receivables after netting adjustments , and the current liquidity risk of derivative payables after netting adjustments , as of december 31 , 2009. .\n|december 31 2009 ( in millions )|derivative

reflected in the table above , at december 31 , 2009 , the firm had received and posted liquid secu- rities collateral in the amount of $ 15.5 billion and $ 11.7 billion , respectively .the firm also receives and delivers collateral at the initiation of derivative transactions , which is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the transactions move in the firm 2019s or client 2019s favor , respectively .furthermore , the firm and its counterparties hold collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency for collateral to be posted , and collateral that the firm or a counterparty has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date .at december 31 , 2009 , the firm had received $ 16.9 billion and delivered $ 5.8 billion of such additional collateral .these amounts were not netted against the derivative receivables and payables in the table above , because , at an individual counterparty level , the collateral exceeded the fair value exposure at december 31 , 2009 .credit derivatives credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer ( the reference entity ) and which allow one party ( the protection purchaser ) to transfer that risk to another party ( the protection seller ) .credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller , as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event , such as a bankruptcy , a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring .the seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event .the firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes .first , in its capacity as a market-maker in the dealer/client business , the firm actively risk manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection , pre- dominantly on corporate debt obligations , to meet the needs of customers .as a seller of protection , the firm 2019s exposure to a given reference entity may be offset partially , or entirely , with a contract to purchase protection from another counterparty on the same or similar reference entity .second , the firm uses credit derivatives to mitigate credit risk associated with its overall derivative receivables and traditional commercial credit lending exposures ( loans and unfunded commitments ) as well as to manage its exposure to residential and commercial mortgages .see note 3 on pages 156--- 173 of this annual report for further information on the firm 2019s mortgage-related exposures .in accomplishing the above , the firm uses different types of credit derivatives .following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives .credit default swaps credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single refer- ence entity ( 201csingle-name 201d ) or a broad-based index , as described further below .the firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations .single-name cds and index cds contracts are both otc derivative contracts .single- name cds are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity , while cds index are used to manage credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments .like the s&p 500 and other market indices , a cds index is comprised of a portfolio of cds across many reference entities .new series of cds indices are established approximately every six months with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets .if one of the reference entities in the index experi- ences a credit event , then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index .cds can also be referenced against spe- cific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands : for example , to provide protection against the first $ 1 million of realized credit losses in a $ 10 million portfolio of exposure .such structures are commonly known as tranche cds .for both single-name cds contracts and index cds , upon the occurrence of a credit event , under the terms of a cds contract neither party to the cds contract has recourse to the reference entity .the protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the cds contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settling the credit derivative contract , also known as the recovery value .the protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the cds contract when a credit event occurs .credit-linked notes a credit linked note ( 201ccln 201d ) is a funded credit derivative where the issuer of the cln purchases credit protection on a referenced entity from the note investor .under the contract , the investor pays the issuer par value of the note at the inception of the transaction , and in return , the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor , based on the credit risk of the referenced entity .the issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity experiences a specified credit event .in that event , the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note , but rather , the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note .\nQuestion: at december 31 , 2009 , what was the ratio of the firm had received to the additional collateral .\nAnswer:",

expected loss modeling in 2006 , the firm restructured four multi-seller conduits that it administers .the restructurings included enhancing the firm 2019s expected loss model .in determining the primary beneficiary of the conduits it administers , the firm uses a monte carlo 2013based model to estimate the expected losses of each of the conduits and considers the rela- tive rights and obligations of each of the variable interest holders .the variability to be considered in the modeling of expected losses is based on the design of the entity .the firm 2019s traditional multi-seller conduits are designed to pass credit risk , not liquidity risk , to its vari- able interest holders , as the assets are intended to be held in the conduit for the longer term .under fin 46r , the firm is required to run the monte carlo-based expected loss model each time a reconsideration event occurs .in applying this guidance to the conduits , the following events are considered to be reconsideration events as they could affect the determination of the primary beneficiary of the conduits : 2022 new deals , including the issuance of new or additional variable interests ( credit support , liquidity facilities , etc ) ; 2022 changes in usage , including the change in the level of outstand- ing variable interests ( credit support , liquidity facilities , etc ) ; 2022 modifications of asset purchase agreements ; and 2022 sales of interests held by the primary beneficiary .from an operational perspective , the firm does not run its monte carlo-based expected loss model every time there is a reconsidera- tion event due to the frequency of their occurrence .instead , the firm runs its expected loss model each quarter and includes a growth assumption for each conduit to ensure that a sufficient amount of elns exists for each conduit at any point during the quarter .as part of its normal quarterly model review , the firm reassesses the underlying assumptions and inputs of the expected loss model .during the second half of 2007 , certain assumptions used in the model were adjusted to reflect the then current market conditions .specifically , risk ratings and loss given default assumptions relating to residential subprime mortgage exposures were modified .for other nonmortgage-related asset classes , the firm determined that the assumptions in the model required little adjustment .as a result of the updates to the model , during the fourth quarter of 2007 the terms of the elns were renegotiated to increase the level of commit- ment and funded amounts to be provided by the eln holders .the total amount of expected loss notes outstanding at december 31 , 2007 and 2006 , were $ 130 million and $ 54 million , respectively .management concluded that the model assumptions used were reflective of market participant 2019s assumptions and appropriately considered the probability of a recurrence of recent market events .qualitative considerations the multi-seller conduits are primarily designed to provide an efficient means for clients to access the commercial paper market .the firm believes the conduits effectively disperse risk among all parties and that the preponderance of economic risk in the firm 2019s multi-seller conduits is not held by jpmorgan chase .the percentage of assets in the multi-seller conduits that the firm views as client-related represent 99% ( 99 % ) and 98% ( 98 % ) of the total conduits 2019 holdings at december 31 , 2007 and 2006 , respectively .consolidated sensitivity analysis on capital it is possible that the firm could be required to consolidate a vie if it were determined that the firm became the primary beneficiary of the vie under the provisions of fin 46r .the factors involved in making the determination of whether or not a vie should be consolidated are dis- cussed above and in note 1 on page 108 of this annual report .the table below shows the impact on the firm 2019s reported assets , liabilities , net income , tier 1 capital ratio and tier 1 leverage ratio if the firm were required to consolidate all of the multi-seller conduits that it administers .as of or for the year ending december 31 , 2007 .\n|( in billions except ratios )|reported|pro forma|\n|assets|$ 1562.1|$ 1623.9|\n|liabilities|1438.9|1500.9|\n|net

intermediation as a financial intermediary , the firm creates certain types of vies and also structures transactions , typically derivative structures , with these vies to meet investor needs .the firm may also provide liquidity and other support .the risks inherent in the derivative instruments or liq- uidity commitments are managed similarly to other credit , market or liquidity risks to which the firm is exposed .the principal types of vies for which the firm is engaged in these structuring activities are municipal bond vehicles , credit-linked note vehicles and collateralized debt obligation vehicles .municipal bond vehicles the firm has created a series of secondary market trusts that provide short-term investors with qualifying tax-exempt investments , and that allow investors in tax-exempt securities to finance their investments at short-term tax-exempt rates .in a typical transaction , the vehicle pur- chases fixed-rate longer-term highly rated municipal bonds and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities : ( 1 ) putable floating- rate certificates and ( 2 ) inverse floating-rate residual interests ( 201cresid- ual interests 201d ) .the maturity of each of the putable floating-rate certifi- cates and the residual interests is equal to the life of the vehicle , while the maturity of the underlying municipal bonds is longer .holders of the putable floating-rate certificates may 201cput 201d , or tender , the certifi- cates if the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the float- ing-rate certificates to another investor .a liquidity facility conditionally obligates the liquidity provider to fund the purchase of the tendered floating-rate certificates .upon termination of the vehicle , if the pro- ceeds from the sale of the underlying municipal bonds are not suffi- cient to repay the liquidity facility , the liquidity provider has recourse either to excess collateralization in the vehicle or the residual interest holders for reimbursement .the third-party holders of the residual interests in these vehicles could experience losses if the face amount of the putable floating-rate cer- tificates exceeds the market value of the municipal bonds upon termi- nation of the vehicle .certain vehicles require a smaller initial invest- ment by the residual interest holders and thus do not result in excess

examination by the relevant taxing authorities for various tax years .the company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the amount of unrecognized tax benefit recorded .while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position , we believe we have appropriately accrued for our uncertain tax benefits .however , audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements and future events that would impact our previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits and the range of anticipated increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits are subject to significant uncertainty .it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed our provision for current unrecognized tax benefits in amounts that could be material , but cannot be estimated as of december 31 , 2018 .our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could therefore be materially impacted .22 .discontinued operations due to a portfolio evaluation in the first half of 2016 , management decided to pursue a strategic shift of its distribution companies in brazil , sul and eletropaulo , to reduce the company's exposure to the brazilian distribution market .the disposals of sul and eletropaulo were completed in october 2016 and june 2018 , respectively .eletropaulo 2014 in november 2017 , eletropaulo converted its preferred shares into ordinary shares and transitioned the listing of those shares to the novo mercado , which is a listing segment of the brazilian stock exchange with the highest standards of corporate governance .upon conversion of the preferred shares into ordinary shares , aes no longer controlled eletropaulo , but maintained significant influence over the business .as a result , the company deconsolidated eletropaulo .after deconsolidation , the company's 17% ( 17 % ) ownership interest was reflected as an equity method investment .the company recorded an after-tax loss on deconsolidation of $ 611 million , which primarily consisted of $ 455 million related to cumulative translation losses and $ 243 million related to pension losses reclassified from aocl .in december 2017 , all the remaining criteria were met for eletropaulo to qualify as a discontinued operation .therefore , its results of operations and financial position were reported as such in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented .in june 2018 , the company completed the sale of its entire 17% ( 17 % ) ownership interest in eletropaulo through a bidding process hosted by the brazilian securities regulator , cvm .gross proceeds of $ 340 million were received at our subsidiary in brazil , subject to the payment of taxes .upon disposal of eletropaulo , the company recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $ 243 million ( after-tax $ 199 million ) .excluding the gain on sale , eletropaulo's pre-tax loss attributable to aes was immaterial for the year ended december 31 , 2018 .eletropaulo's pre-tax loss attributable to aes , including the loss on deconsolidation , for the years ended december 31 , 2017 and 2016 was $ 633 million and $ 192 million , respectively .prior to its classification as discontinued operations , eletropaulo was reported in the south america sbu reportable segment .sul 2014 the company executed an agreement for the sale of sul , a wholly-owned subsidiary , in june 2016 .the results of operations and financial position of sul are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented .upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria , the company recognized an after-tax loss of $ 382 million comprised of a pre-tax impairment charge of $ 783 million , offset by a tax benefit of $ 266 million related to the impairment of the sul long lived assets and a tax benefit of $ 135 million for deferred taxes related to the investment in sul .prior to the impairment charge , the carrying value of the sul asset group of $ 1.6 billion was greater than its approximate fair value less costs to sell .however , the impairment charge was limited to the carrying value of the long lived assets of the sul disposal group. .\nQuestion: what was the percentage change of unrecognized tax benefits at

2011 include 27076 , 25620 and 27090 deferred stock units , respectively , awarded under the outside directors deferred stock unit plan .a deferred stock unit is a phantom share of our common stock , which is accounted for as a liability until such awards are paid to the participants in cash .as there are no vesting or service requirements on these awards , total compensation expense is recognized in full for these awards on the date of grant .incentive/performance unit share awards and restricted stock/share unit awards the fair value of nonvested incentive/performance unit share awards and restricted stock/share unit awards is initially determined based on prices not less than the market value of our common stock on the date of grant .the value of certain incentive/performance unit share awards is subsequently remeasured based on the achievement of one or more financial and other performance goals , generally over a three-year period .the personnel and compensation committee ( 201cp&cc 201d ) of the board of directors approves the final award payout with respect to certain incentive/performance unit share awards .restricted stock/share unit awards have various vesting periods generally ranging from 3 years to 5 years .beginning in 2013 , we incorporated several enhanced risk- related performance changes to certain long-term incentive compensation programs .in addition to achieving certain financial performance metrics on both an absolute basis and relative to our peers , final payout amounts will be subject to reduction if pnc fails to meet certain risk-related performance metrics as specified in the award agreement .however , the p&cc has the discretion to waive any or all of this reduction under certain circumstances .these awards have either a three- year or a four-year performance period and are payable in either stock or a combination of stock and cash .additionally , performance-based restricted share units were granted in 2013 to certain executives as part of annual bonus deferral criteria .these units , payable solely in stock , vest ratably over a four-year period and contain the same risk- related discretionary criteria noted in the preceding paragraph .the weighted-average grant date fair value of incentive/ performance unit share awards and restricted stock/unit awards granted in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $ 64.77 ,

chase assesses its capital adequacy relative to the risks underlying its business activities using internal risk-assessment methodologies .the firm measures economic capital primarily based on four risk factors : credit , market , operational and private equity risk. .\n|year ended december 31 ( in billions )|yearly average 2012|yearly average 2011|yearly average 2010|\n|credit risk|$ 46.6|$

objectives .credit risk capital credit risk capital is estimated separately for the wholesale businesses ( cib , cb and am ) and consumer business ( ccb ) .credit risk capital for the wholesale credit portfolio is defined in terms of unexpected credit losses , both from defaults and from declines in the value of the portfolio due to credit deterioration , measured over a one-year period at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard .unexpected losses are losses in excess of those for which the allowance for credit losses is maintained .the capital methodology is based on several principal drivers of credit risk : exposure at default ( or loan-equivalent amount ) , default likelihood , credit spreads , loss severity and portfolio correlation .credit risk capital for the consumer portfolio is based on product and other relevant risk segmentation .actual segment-level default and severity experience are used to estimate unexpected losses for a one-year horizon at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard .the decrease in credit risk capital in 2012 was driven by consumer portfolio runoff and continued model enhancements to better estimate future stress credit losses in the consumer portfolio .see credit risk management on pages 134 2013135 of this annual report for more information about these credit risk measures .market risk capital the firm calculates market risk capital guided by the principle that capital should reflect the risk of loss in the value of the portfolios and financial instruments caused by adverse movements in market variables , such as interest and foreign exchange rates , credit spreads , and securities and commodities prices , taking into account the liquidity of the financial instruments .results from daily var , weekly stress tests , issuer credit spreads and default risk calculations , as well as other factors , are used to determine appropriate capital levels .market risk capital is allocated to each business segment based on its risk assessment .the increase in market risk capital in 2012 was driven by increased risk in the synthetic credit portfolio .see market risk management on pages 163 2013169 of this annual report for more information about these market risk measures .operational risk capital operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems , human factors or external events .the operational risk capital model is based on actual losses and potential scenario-based losses , with adjustments to the capital calculation to reflect changes in the quality of the control environment .the increase in operational risk capital in 2012 was primarily due to continued model enhancements to better capture large historical loss events , including mortgage-related litigation costs .the increases that occurred during 2012 will be fully reflected in average operational risk capital in 2013 .see operational risk management on pages 175 2013176 of this annual report for more information about operational risk .private equity risk capital capital is allocated to privately- and publicly-held securities , third-party fund investments , and commitments in the private equity portfolio , within the corporate/private equity segment , to cover the potential loss associated with a decline in equity markets and related asset devaluations .in addition to negative market fluctuations , potential losses in private equity investment portfolios can be magnified by liquidity risk. .\nQuestion: in 2012 what was

recognized on acquired or purchased loans is recognized based on the constant effective yield of the financial instrument .the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize in any period is dependent on estimates , judgments , assumptions , and interpretation of contractual terms .changes in these factors can have a significant impact on revenue recognized in any period due to changes in products , market conditions or industry norms .residential and commercial mortgage servicing rights we elect to measure our residential mortgage servicing rights ( msrs ) at fair value .this election was made to be consistent with our risk management strategy to hedge changes in the fair value of these assets as described below .the fair value of residential msrs is estimated by using a cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows , taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates , discount rates , servicing costs , and other economic factors which are determined based on current market conditions .assumptions incorporated into the residential msrs valuation model reflect management 2019s best estimate of factors that a market participant would use in valuing the residential msrs .although sales of residential msrs do occur , residential msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices so the precise terms and conditions of sales are not available .as a benchmark for the reasonableness of its residential msrs fair value , pnc obtains opinions of value from independent parties ( 201cbrokers 201d ) .these brokers provided a range ( +/- 10 bps ) based upon their own discounted cash flow calculations of our portfolio that reflected conditions in the secondary market , and any recently executed servicing transactions .pnc compares its internally-developed residential msrs value to the ranges of values received from the brokers .if our residential msrs fair value falls outside of the brokers 2019 ranges , management will assess whether a valuation adjustment is warranted .for 2011 and 2010 , pnc 2019s residential msrs value has not fallen outside of the brokers 2019 ranges .we consider our residential msrs value to represent a reasonable estimate of fair value .commercial msrs are purchased or originated when loans are sold with servicing retained .commercial msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices so the precise terms and conditions of sales are not available .commercial msrs are initially recorded at fair value and are subsequently accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value .commercial msrs are periodically evaluated for impairment .for purposes of impairment , the commercial mortgage servicing rights are stratified based on asset type , which characterizes the predominant risk of the underlying financial asset .the fair value of commercial msrs is estimated by using an internal valuation model .the model calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows considering estimates of servicing revenue and costs , discount rates and prepayment speeds .pnc employs risk management strategies designed to protect the value of msrs from changes in interest rates and related market factors .residential msrs values are economically hedged with securities and derivatives , including interest-rate swaps , options , and forward mortgage-backed and futures contracts .as interest rates change , these financial instruments are expected to have changes in fair value negatively correlated to the change in fair value of the hedged residential msrs portfolio .the hedge relationships are actively managed in response to changing market conditions over the life of the residential msrs assets .commercial msrs are economically hedged at a macro level or with specific derivatives to protect against a significant decline in interest rates .selecting appropriate financial instruments to economically hedge residential or commercial msrs requires significant management judgment to assess how mortgage rates and prepayment speeds could affect the future values of msrs .hedging results can frequently be less predictable in the short term , but over longer periods of time are expected to protect the economic value of the msrs .the fair value of residential and commercial msrs and significant inputs to the valuation model as of december 31 , 2011 are shown in the tables below .the expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are significant factors driving the fair value .management uses a third-party model to estimate future residential loan prepayments and internal proprietary models to estimate future commercial loan prepayments .these models have been refined based on current market conditions .future interest rates are another important factor in the valuation of msrs .management utilizes market implied forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and discount rates .the forward rates utilized are derived from the current yield curve for u.s .dollar interest rate swaps and are consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments .changes in the shape and slope of the forward curve in future periods may result in volatility in the fair value estimate .residential mortgage servicing rights dollars in

2022 at the lower of cost or fair value , with valuation changes record- ed in noninterest revenue , for loans that are classified as held- for-sale ; or 2022 at fair value , with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue , for loans classified as trading assets or risk managed on a fair value basis ; 2022 purchased credit-impaired loans held for investment are account- ed for under sop 03-3 and initially measured at fair value , which includes estimated future credit losses .accordingly , an allowance for loan losses related to these loans is not recorded at the acquisition date .see note 5 on pages 156 2013158 of this annual report for further information on the firm 2019s elections of fair value accounting under sfas 159 .see note 6 on pages 158 2013160 of this annual report for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets .for loans held for investment , other than purchased credit-impaired loans , interest income is recognized using the interest method or on a basis approximating a level rate of return over the term of the loan .loans within the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are transferred to the held-for-sale portfolio .transfers to held-for-sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer .credit-related losses are charged off to the allowance for loan losses and losses due to changes in interest rates , or exchange rates , are recognized in noninterest revenue .loans within the held-for-sale portfolio that management decides to retain are transferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value .these loans are subsequently assessed for impairment based on the firm 2019s allowance methodology .for a fur- ther discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the firm 2019s allowance for loan losses , see note 15 on pages 178 2013180 of this annual report .nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest is dis- continued .loans ( other than certain consumer and purchased credit- impaired loans discussed below ) are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if , in the opinion of management , full payment of princi- pal or interest is in doubt , or when principal or interest is 90 days or more past due and collateral , if any , is insufficient to cover principal and interest .loans are charged off to the allowance for loan losses when it is highly certain that a loss has been realized .interest accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed against interest income .in addition , the amortiza- tion of net deferred loan fees is suspended .interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent it is received in cash .however , where there is doubt regarding the ultimate col- lectibility of loan principal , all cash thereafter received is applied to reduce the carrying value of such loans ( i.e. , the cost recovery method ) .loans are restored to accrual status only when future pay- ments of interest and principal are reasonably assured .consumer loans , other than purchased credit-impaired loans , are generally charged to the allowance for loan losses upon reaching specified stages of delinquency , in accordance with the federal financial institutions examination council policy .for example , credit card loans are charged off by the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due or within 60 days from receiv- ing notification of the filing of bankruptcy , whichever is earlier .residential mortgage products are generally charged off to net real- izable value at no later than 180 days past due .other consumer .\nQuestion: as of december 31 , 2008 , how much of the collateral related to short sales , repo's , or securities lending agreements?\nAnswer:",

recorded related to the settlement expense due to the uncertainty as to the tax treatment .during the third quarter of 2008 , we reached an agreement with the u.s .internal revenue service ( irs ) confirming the deductibility of a portion of the settlement payment .as a result , during 2008 we recorded a current tax benefit of $ 31.7 million .in june 2006 , the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) issued interpretation no .48 , accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 2013 an interpretation of fasb statement no .109 , accounting for income taxes ( fin 48 ) .fin 48 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements .under fin 48 , we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities , based on the technical merits of the position .the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement .fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition , classification , interest and penalties on income taxes , accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures .we adopted fin 48 on january 1 , 2007 .prior to the adoption of fin 48 we had a long term tax liability for expected settlement of various federal , state and foreign income tax liabilities that was reflected net of the corollary tax impact of these expected settlements of $ 102.1 million , as well as a separate accrued interest liability of $ 1.7 million .as a result of the adoption of fin 48 , we are required to present the different components of such liability on a gross basis versus the historical net presentation .the adoption resulted in the financial statement liability for unrecognized tax benefits decreasing by $ 6.4 million as of january 1 , 2007 .the adoption resulted in this decrease in the liability as well as a reduction to retained earnings of $ 4.8 million , a reduction in goodwill of $ 61.4 million , the establishment of a tax receivable of $ 58.2 million , which was recorded in other current and non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheet , and an increase in an interest/penalty payable of $ 7.9 million , all as of january 1 , 2007 .therefore , after the adoption of fin 48 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is $ 95.7 million as of january 1 , 2007 .as of december 31 , 2008 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is $ 129.5 million .of this amount , $ 45.5 million would impact our effective tax rate if recognized .$ 38.2 million of the $ 129.5 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax positions of acquired entities taken prior to their acquisition by us .under fas 141 ( r ) , if these liabilities are settled for different amounts , they will affect the income tax expense in the period of reversal or settlement .the following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits ( in millions ) : .\n||2008|2007|\n|balance at january 1|$ 135.2|$ 95.7|\n|increases related to prior periods|12.1|27.4|\n|decreases related to prior periods|-32.0 ( 32.0 )|-5.5 ( 5.5 )|\n|increases

)|\n|balance at december 31|$ 129.5|$ 135.2|\nwe recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings , which is consistent with the recognition of these items in prior reporting periods .as of december 31 , 2007 , we recorded a liability of $ 19.6 million for accrued interest and penalties , of which $ 14.7 million would impact our effective tax rate , if recognized .the amount of this liability is $ 22.9 million as of december 31 , 2008 .of this amount , $ 17.1 million would impact our effective tax rate , if recognized .we expect that the amount of tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months ; however , we do not expect these changes will have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position .the u.s .federal statute of limitations remains open for the year 2003 and onward .the u.s .federal returns for years 2003 and 2004 are currently under examination by the irs .on july 15 , 2008 , the irs issued its examination report .we filed a formal protest on august 15 , 2008 and requested a conference with the appeals office regarding disputed issues .although the appeals process could take several years , we do not anticipate resolution of the audit will result in any significant impact on our results of operations , financial position or cash flows .in addition , for the 1999 tax year of centerpulse , which we acquired in october 2003 , one issue remains in dispute .state income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of 3 to 5 years after filing of the respective return .the state impact of any federal changes remains subject to examination by various states for a period of up to one year after formal notification to the states .we have various state income tax returns in the process of examination , administrative appeals or litigation .it is z i m m e r h o l d i n g s , i n c
