equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only , as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments .based upon outstanding balances , and excluding purchased impaired loans , at december 31 , 2011 , for home equity lines of

approximately 5.57% ( 5.57 % ) were greater than or equal to 90 days past due .generally , when a borrower becomes 60 days past due , we terminate borrowing privileges , and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated .at that point , we continue our collection/recovery processes , which may include a loss mitigation loan modification resulting in a loan that is classified as a tdr .see note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information .loan modifications and troubled debt restructurings consumer loan modifications we modify loans under government and pnc-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure , where appropriate .initially , a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program .if a borrower does not qualify under a government program , the borrower is then evaluated under a pnc program .our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate , extend the term and/or defer

involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to the original loan terms as of a specific date or the occurrence of an event , such as a failure to pay in accordance with the terms of the modification .typically , these modifications are for a period of up to 24 months after which the interest rate reverts to the original loan rate .a permanent modification , with a term greater than 60 months , is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed .permanent modifications primarily include the government-created home affordable modification program ( hamp ) or pnc-developed hamp-like modification programs .for consumer loan programs , such as residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines , we will enter into a temporary modification when the borrower has indicated a temporary hardship and a willingness to bring current the delinquent loan balance .examples of this situation often include delinquency due to illness or death in the family , or a loss of employment .permanent modifications are entered into when it is confirmed that the borrower does not possess the income necessary to continue making loan payments at the current amount , but our expectation is that payments at lower amounts can be made .residential mortgage and home equity loans and lines have been modified with changes in terms for up to 60

operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures ( including non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures ) , adjusted for the estimated impact of noncontrolling interests .the proportionate share of cash flows and related adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries comprise the proportional adjustment factor presented in the reconciliation below .upon the company's adoption of the accounting guidance for service concession arrangements effective january 1 , 2015 , capital expenditures related to service concession assets that would have been classified as investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows are now classified as operating activities .see note 1 2014general and summary of significant accounting policies of this form 10-k for further information on the adoption of this guidance .beginning in the quarter ended march 31 , 2015 , the company changed the definition of proportional free cash flow to exclude the cash flows for capital expenditures related to service concession assets that are now classified within net cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows .the proportional adjustment factor for these capital expenditures is presented in the reconciliation below .we also exclude environmental capital expenditures that are expected to be recovered through regulatory , contractual or other mechanisms .an example of recoverable environmental capital expenditures is ipl's investment in mats-related environmental upgrades that are recovered through a tracker .see item 1 . 2014us sbu 2014ipl 2014environmental matters for details of these investments .the gaap measure most comparable to proportional free cash flow is cash flows from operating

maintenance capital expenditures , that may be available for investing or repaying debt or other purposes .factors in this determination include the impact of noncontrolling interests , where aes consolidates the results of a subsidiary that is not wholly-owned by the company .the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations .proportional free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to cash from operating activities , which is determined in accordance with gaap .proportional free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary payments because it excludes certain payments that are required or to which we have committed , such as debt service requirements and dividend payments .our definition of proportional free cash flow may not be

.( 2 ) the proportional adjustment factor , proportional maintenance capital expenditures ( net of reinsurance proceeds ) and proportional non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures are calculated by multiplying the percentage owned by noncontrolling interests for each entity by its corresponding consolidated cash flow metric and are totaled to the resulting figures .for example , parent company a owns 20% ( 20 % ) of subsidiary company b , a consolidated subsidiary .thus , subsidiary company b has an 80% ( 80 % ) noncontrolling interest .assuming a consolidated net cash flow from operating activities of $ 100 from subsidiary b , the proportional adjustment factor for subsidiary b would equal $ 80 ( or $ 100 x 80% ( 80 % ) ) .the company calculates the proportional

more rapidly than they had climbed as the u.s .dollar rebounded and other countries entered recessions which decreased demand .during 2008 , the average spot price per barrel for wti was $ 99.75 , up from an average of $ 72.41 in 2007 , but ended the year at $ 44.60 .the average spot price per barrel for brent was $ 97.26 in 2008 , up from an average of $ 72.39 in 2007 , but ended the year at $ 36.55 .the differential between wti and brent average prices widened to $ 2.49 in 2008 from $ 0.02 in 2007 .our domestic crude oil production is on average heavier and higher in sulfur content than light sweet wti .heavier and higher sulfur crude oil ( commonly referred to as heavy sour crude oil ) sells at a discount to light sweet crude oil .our international crude oil production is relatively sweet and is generally sold in relation to the brent crude oil benchmark .natural gas prices on average were higher in 2008 than in 2007 .a significant portion of our u.s .lower 48 states natural gas production is sold at bid-week prices or first-of-month indices relative to our specific producing areas .the average henry hub first-of-month price index was $ 2.18 per thousand cubic feet ( 201cmcf 201d ) higher in 2008 than the 2007 average .natural gas sales in alaska are subject to term contracts .our other major natural gas-producing regions are europe and equatorial guinea , where large portions of our natural gas sales are subject to term contracts , making realized prices in these areas less volatile .as we sell larger quantities of natural gas from these regions , to the extent that these fixed prices are lower than prevailing prices , our reported average natural gas prices realizations may decrease .e&p segment income during 2008 was up 57 percent from 2007 , with revenue increases tied to these increases in average commodity prices accounting for almost half of the income improvement .liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes were also higher in 2008 than 2007

normal output mix will track movements in wti and one-third will track movements in the canadian heavy sour crude oil marker , primarily western canadian select .output mix can be impacted by operational problems or planned unit outages at the mine or upgrader .during 2008 , our average realized price for synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil was $ 91.90 per barrel , up from 2007 , but ended the year at $ 24.97 per barrel impacted by a heavier yield in december and a seasonal decrease in the value of our heavy output .the operating cost structure of the oil sands mining operations is predominantly fixed , and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime .per unit costs are sensitive to production rates .key variable costs are natural gas and diesel fuel , which track commodity markets such as the canadian aeco natural gas sales index and crude prices respectively .the table below shows benchmark prices that impact both

net interest income , very strong private equity gains , record asset management , administration and commissions revenue , higher mortgage fees and related income and record investment banking fees contributed to the revenue growth .these increases were offset partially by lower trading revenue .investment banking fees grew in 2007 to a level higher than the pre- vious record set in 2006 .record advisory and equity underwriting fees drove the results , partially offset by lower debt underwriting fees .for a further discussion of investment banking fees , which are primarily recorded in ib , see the ib segment results on pages 40 201342 of this annual report .principal transactions revenue consists of trading revenue and private equity gains .trading revenue declined significantly from the 2006 level , primarily due to markdowns in ib of $ 1.4 billion ( net of hedges ) on subprime positions , including subprime cdos , and $ 1.3 billion ( net of fees ) on leveraged lending funded loans and unfunded commitments .also in ib , markdowns in securitized products on nonsubprime mortgages and weak credit trading performance more than offset record revenue in currencies and strong revenue in both rates and equities .equities benefited from strong client activity and record trading results across all products .ib 2019s credit portfolio results increased compared with the prior year , primarily driven by higher revenue from risk management activities .the increase in private equity gains from 2006 reflected a significantly higher level of gains , the classification of certain private equity carried interest as compensation expense and a fair value adjustment in the first quarter of 2007 on nonpublic private equity investments resulting from the adoption of sfas 157 ( 201cfair value measurements 201d ) .for a further discussion of principal transactions revenue , see the ib and corporate segment results on pages 40 201342 and 59 201360 , respectively , and note 6 on page 122 of this annual report .lending & deposit-related fees rose from the 2006 level , driven pri- marily by higher deposit-related fees and the bank of new york transaction .for a further discussion of lending & deposit-related fees , which are mostly recorded in rfs , tss and cb , see the rfs segment results on pages 43 201348 , the tss segment results on pages 54 201355 , and the cb segment results on pages 52 201353 of this annual report .asset management , administration and commissions revenue reached a level higher than the previous record set in 2006 .increased assets under management and higher performance and placement fees in am drove the record results .the 18% ( 18 % ) growth in assets under management from year-end 2006 came from net asset inflows and market appreciation across all segments : institutional , retail , private bank and private client services .tss also contributed to the rise in asset management , administration and commissions revenue , driven by increased product usage by new and existing clients and market appreciation on assets under custody .finally , commissions revenue increased , due mainly to higher brokerage transaction volume ( primarily included within fixed income and equity markets revenue of ib ) , which more than offset the sale of the insurance business by rfs in the third quarter of 2006 and a charge in the first quarter of 2007 resulting from accelerated surrenders of customer annuities .for additional information on these fees and commissions , see the segment discussions for ib on pages 40 201342 , rfs on pages 43 201348 , tss on pages 54 201355 , and am on pages 56 201358 , of this annual report .the favorable variance resulting from securities gains in 2007 compared with securities losses in 2006 was primarily driven by improvements in the results of repositioning of the treasury invest- ment securities portfolio .also contributing to the positive variance was a $ 234 million gain from the sale of mastercard shares .for a fur- ther discussion of securities gains ( losses ) , which are mostly recorded in the firm 2019s treasury business , see the corporate segment discussion on pages

typically allocated among the many potential responsible parties .remedial costs are recorded in the consolidated financial statements when they become probable and reasonably estimable .international paper has estimated the probable liability associated with these matters to be approximately $ 92 million in the aggregate at december 31 , 2012 .one of the matters referenced above is a closed wood treating facility located in cass lake , minneso- ta .during 2009 , in connection with an environmental site remediation action under cercla , international paper submitted to the epa a site

is currently $ 48 mil- lion to address this selection of an alternative for the soil remediation component of the overall site remedy .in october 2011 , the epa released a public statement indicating that the final soil remedy deci- sion would be delayed .in the unlikely event that the epa changes its proposed soil remedy and approves instead a more expensive clean-up alternative , the remediation costs could be material , and sig- nificantly higher than amounts currently recorded .in october 2012 , the natural resource trustees for this site provided notice to international paper and other potentially responsible parties of their intent to per- form a natural resource damage assessment .it is premature to predict the outcome of the assessment or to estimate a loss or range of loss , if any , which may be incurred .in addition to the above matters , other remediation costs typically associated with the cleanup of hazardous substances at the company 2019s current , closed or

actions is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements .the company is a potentially responsible party with respect to the allied paper , inc./portage creek/

located along the river , including a paper mill formerly owned by st .regis .the company is a successor in interest to st .regis .international paper has not received any orders from the epa with respect to the site and is in the process of collecting information from the epa and other parties relative to the kalamazoo river superfund site to evaluate the extent of its liability , if any ,

equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only , as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments .based upon outstanding balances , and excluding purchased impaired loans , at december 31 , 2011 , for home equity lines of credit for which the borrower can no longer draw ( e.g. , draw period has ended or borrowing privileges have been terminated ) , approximately 4.32% ( 4.32 % ) were 30-89 days past due and approximately 5.57% ( 5.57 % ) were greater than or equal to 90 days past due .generally , when a borrower becomes 60 days past due , we terminate borrowing privileges , and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated .at that point , we continue our collection/recovery processes , which may include a loss mitigation loan modification resulting in a loan that is classified as a tdr .see note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information .loan modifications and troubled debt restructurings consumer loan modifications we modify loans under government and pnc-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure , where appropriate .initially , a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program .if a borrower does not qualify under a government program , the borrower is then evaluated under a pnc program .our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate , extend the term and/or defer principal .temporary and permanent modifications under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as tdrs .further , certain payment plans and trial payment arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as tdrs .additional detail on tdrs is discussed below as well as in note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report .a temporary modification , with a term between three and 60 months , involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to the original loan terms as of a specific date or the occurrence of an event , such as a failure to pay in accordance with the terms of the modification .typically , these modifications are for a period of up to 24 months after which the interest rate reverts to the original loan rate .a permanent modification , with a term greater than 60 months , is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed .permanent modifications primarily include the government-created home affordable modification program ( hamp ) or pnc-developed hamp-like modification programs .for consumer loan programs , such as residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines , we will enter into a temporary modification when the borrower has indicated a temporary hardship and a willingness to bring current the delinquent loan balance .examples of this situation often include delinquency due to illness or death in the family , or a loss of employment .permanent modifications are entered into when it is confirmed that the borrower does not possess the income necessary to continue making loan payments at the current amount , but our expectation is that payments at lower amounts can be made .residential mortgage and home equity loans and lines have been modified with changes in terms for up to 60 months , although the majority involve periods of three to 24 months .we also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in serving our customers 2019 needs while mitigating credit losses .the following tables provide the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified consumer real estate related loans as well

portions of our natural gas sales are subject to term contracts , making realized prices in these areas less volatile .as we sell larger quantities of natural gas from these regions , to the extent that these fixed prices are lower than prevailing prices , our reported average natural gas prices realizations may decrease .e&p segment income during 2008 was up 57 percent from 2007 , with revenue

normal output mix will track movements in wti and one-third will track movements in the canadian heavy sour crude oil marker , primarily western canadian select .output mix can be impacted by operational problems or planned unit outages at the mine or upgrader .during 2008 , our average realized price for synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil was $ 91.90 per barrel , up from 2007 , but ended the year at $ 24.97 per barrel impacted by a heavier yield in december and a seasonal decrease in the value of our heavy output .the operating cost structure of the oil sands mining operations is predominantly fixed , and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime .per unit costs are sensitive to production rates .key variable costs
