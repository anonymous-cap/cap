to close and consolidate certain facilities and reduce our total workforce by approximately 4000 positions within our is&gs , mst , and space systems business segments .these charges also include $ 30 million related to certain severance actions at our is&gs business segment that occurred in the first quarter of 2013 , which were subsequently paid in 2013 .the november 2013 plan resulted from a strategic review of these businesses 2019 facility capacity and future workload projections and is intended to better align our organization and cost structure and improve the affordability of our products and services given the continued decline in u.s .government spending as well as the rapidly changing competitive and economic landscape .upon separation , terminated employees will receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service .during 2013 , we paid approximately $ 15 million in severance payments associated with these actions , with the remainder expected to be paid through the middle of 2015 .in addition to the severance charges described above , we expect to incur accelerated and incremental costs ( e.g. , accelerated depreciation expense related to long-lived assets at the sites to be closed , relocation of equipment and other employee related costs ) of approximately $ 15 million , $ 50 million , and $ 135 million at our is&gs , mst , and space systems business segments related to the facility closures and consolidations .the accelerated and incremental costs will be expensed as incurred in the respective business segment 2019s results of

or involuntary actions .these severance actions resulted from a strategic review of these businesses and our corporate headquarters and are intended to better align our organization and cost structure with changing economic conditions .the workforce reductions at the business segments also reflected changes in program lifecycles , where several of our major programs were either transitioning out of development and into production or were ending .upon separation , terminated employees received lump-sum severance payments based on years of service .during 2011 , we made approximately half of the

    "output": "6.35%",
    "pred_output": "To find the annual other sinking fund requirements as a percentage of annual long-term debt maturities (excluding lease obligations) and annual cash sinking fund requirements for debt outstanding in 2007, we first need to find the total annual long-term debt maturities and other sinking fund requirements for 2007.\n\nFrom the given data, the annual long-term debt maturities for 2007 are $475,288 (in thousands). The other sinking fund requirements are approximately $30.2 million annually.\n\nTo find the percentage, we'll divide the other sinking fund requirements by the sum of the annual long-term debt maturities and other sinking fund requirements for 2007.\n\nFirst, let's convert the annual long-term debt maturities and other sinking fund requirements from thousands to a common denominator:\n\nAnnual long-term debt maturities = 475,288,000\nOther sinking fund requirements = 30,200,000\n\nNow, let's find the total annual debt obligations for 2007:\n\nTotal annual debt obligations = Annual long-term debt maturities + Other sinking fund requirements\nTotal annual debt obligations = 475,288,000 + 30,200,000 = 505,488,000\n\nFinally, let's find the percentage of other sinking fund requirements as a percentage of total annual debt obligations:\n\nPercentage = (Other sinking fund requirements / Total annual debt obligations) * 100%\nPercentage = (30,200,000 / 505,488,000) * 100% ≈ 5.98%\n\nSo, the annual other sinking fund requirements as a percentage of annual long-term debt maturities (excluding lease obligations) and annual cash sinking fund requirements for debt outstanding in 2007 is approximately 5.98%."

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists , delivery of product has occurred , the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured .for our company , this means that revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred to our customers .title transfers to our customers upon shipment or upon receipt at the customer's location as determined by the sales terms for each transaction .the company estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience , and these estimates are normally immaterial .2022 goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets valuation - we test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review .we perform our annual impairment analysis in the first quarter of each year .while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists , the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis .the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value .if the carrying value exceeds the fair value , goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired .to determine the fair value of goodwill , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model , supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry .at december 31 , 2015 , the carrying value of our goodwill was $ 7.4 billion , which is related to ten reporting units , each of which is comprised of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics .the estimated fair value of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 , 2015 .to determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method .we concluded that the fair value of our non-amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value , and any reasonable movement in the assumptions would not result in an impairment .these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows , which are subject to changes in business conditions , such as volumes and prices , costs to produce , discount rates and estimated capital needs .management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated , and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use .since the march 28 , 2008 , spin-off from altria , we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets .2022 marketing and advertising costs - we incur certain costs to support our products through programs which include advertising , marketing , consumer engagement and trade promotions .the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with u.s .gaap .recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program .for volume-based incentives provided to customers , management continually assesses and estimates , by customer , the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made .for other trade promotions , management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience .changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position , results of operations or operating cash flows .we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate our marketing programs during the past three years .2022 employee benefit plans - as discussed in item 8 , note 13 .benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements , we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees , including pensions , postretirement health care and postemployment benefits ( primarily severance ) .we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by u.s .gaap .these calculations include various actuarial assumptions , such as discount rates , assumed rates of return on plan assets , compensation increases , mortality , turnover rates and health care cost trend rates .we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so .as permitted by u.s .gaap , any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods .we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries .weighted-average discount rate assumptions for pensions and postretirement plans are as follows: .\n||2015|2014|\n|u.s . pension plans|4.30% ( 4.30 % )|3.95% ( 3.95 % )|\n|non-u.s . pension plans|1.68% ( 1.68 % )|1.92% ( 1.92 % )|\n|postretirement plans|4.45% ( 4.45 % )|4.20% ( 4.20 % )|\nwe anticipate that assumption changes , coupled with decreased amortization of deferred losses , will decrease 2016 pre-tax u.s .and non- u.s .pension and postretirement expense to approximately $ 209 million as compared with approximately $ 240 million in 2015 , excluding .\nQuestion: what is the percentage change in the weighted-average discount rate for non-u.s . pension plans from 2014 to 2015?\nAnswer:",

In 2014, the weighted-average discount rate was 1.92%, and in 2015, it was 1.68%. To calculate the percentage change, you can use the formula:\n\nPercentage Change = (New Value - Old Value) / Old Value\n\nIn this case:\n\nPercentage Change = (1.68% - 1.92%) / 1.92%\n\nPercentage Change = -0.24 / 1.92\n\nPercentage Change = -0.1256 or approximately -12.56% (when expressed as a percentage)\n\nHowever, since the question asks for a percentage increase, you would need to multiply the result by -1 to get a positive value:\n\nPercentage Increase = -1 * -0.1256\n\nPercentage Increase = 0.1256 or approximately 12.56% (when expressed as a percentage)\n\nSo, the percentage increase in the weighted-average discount rate for non-U.S. pension plans from 2014 to 2015 is approximately 12.56%."

improvements was a net reduction in cash from operations of $ 350 million related to our defined benefit pension plan .this reduction was the result of increased contributions to the pension trust of

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists , delivery of product has occurred , the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured .for our company , this means that revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred to our customers .title transfers to our customers upon shipment or upon receipt at the customer's location as determined by the sales terms for each transaction .the company estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience , and these estimates are normally immaterial .2022 goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets valuation - we test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review .we perform our annual impairment analysis in the first quarter of each year .while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists , the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis .the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value .if the carrying value exceeds the fair value , goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired .to determine the fair value of goodwill , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model , supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry .at december 31 , 2015 , the carrying value of our goodwill was $ 7.4 billion , which is related to ten reporting units , each of which is comprised of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics .the estimated fair value of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 , 2015 .to determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method .we concluded that the fair value of our non-amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value , and any reasonable movement in the assumptions would not result in an impairment .these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows , which are subject to changes in business conditions , such as volumes and prices , costs to produce , discount rates and estimated capital needs .management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated , and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use .since the march 28 , 2008 , spin-off from altria , we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets .2022 marketing and advertising costs - we incur certain costs to support our products through programs which include advertising , marketing , consumer engagement and trade promotions .the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with u.s .gaap .recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program .for volume-based incentives provided to customers , management continually assesses and estimates , by customer , the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made .for other trade promotions , management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience .changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position , results of operations or operating cash flows .we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate our marketing programs during the past three years .2022 employee benefit plans - as discussed in item 8 , note 13 .benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements , we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees , including pensions , postretirement health care and postemployment benefits ( primarily severance ) .we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by u.s .gaap .these calculations include various actuarial assumptions , such as discount rates , assumed rates of return on plan assets , compensation increases , mortality , turnover rates and health care cost trend rates .we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so .as permitted by u.s .gaap , any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods .we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries .weighted-average discount rate assumptions for pensions and postretirement plans are as follows: .\n||2015|2014|\n|u.s . pension plans|4.30% ( 4.30 % )|3.95% ( 3.95 % )|\n|non-u.s . pension plans|1.68% ( 1.68 % )|1.92% ( 1.92 % )|\n|postretirement plans|4.45% ( 4.45 % )|4.20% ( 4.20 % )|\nwe anticipate that assumption changes , coupled with decreased amortization of deferred losses , will decrease 2016 pre-tax u.s .and non- u.s .pension and postretirement expense to approximately $ 209 million as compared with approximately $ 240 million in 2015 , excluding .\nQuestion: what is the percentage change in the weighted-average discount rate for u.s . pension plans from 2014 to 2015?\nAnswer:",

net interest income , very strong private equity gains , record asset management , administration and commissions revenue , higher mortgage fees and related income and record investment banking fees contributed to the revenue growth .these increases were offset partially by lower trading revenue .investment banking fees grew in 2007 to a level higher than the pre- vious record set in 2006 .record advisory and equity underwriting fees drove the results , partially offset by lower debt underwriting fees .for a further discussion of investment banking fees , which are primarily recorded in ib , see the ib segment results on pages 40 201342 of this annual report .principal transactions revenue consists of trading revenue and private equity gains .trading revenue declined significantly from the 2006 level , primarily due to markdowns in ib of $ 1.4 billion ( net of hedges ) on subprime positions , including subprime cdos , and $ 1.3 billion ( net of fees ) on leveraged lending funded loans and unfunded commitments .also in ib , markdowns in securitized products on nonsubprime mortgages and weak credit trading performance more than offset record revenue in currencies and strong revenue in both rates and equities .equities benefited from strong client activity and record trading results across all products .ib 2019s credit portfolio results increased compared with the prior year , primarily driven by higher revenue from risk management activities .the increase in private equity gains from 2006 reflected a significantly higher level of gains , the classification of certain private equity carried interest as compensation expense and a fair value adjustment in the first quarter of 2007 on nonpublic private equity investments resulting from the adoption of sfas 157 ( 201cfair value measurements 201d ) .for a further discussion of principal transactions revenue , see the ib and corporate segment results on pages 40 201342 and 59 201360 , respectively , and note 6 on page 122 of this annual report .lending & deposit-related fees rose from the 2006 level , driven pri- marily by higher deposit-related fees and the bank of new york transaction .for a further discussion of lending & deposit-related fees , which are mostly recorded in rfs , tss and cb , see the rfs segment results on pages 43 201348 , the tss segment results on pages 54 201355 , and the cb segment results on pages 52 201353 of this annual report .asset management , administration and commissions revenue reached a level higher than the previous record set in 2006 .increased assets under management and higher performance and placement fees in am drove the record results .the 18% ( 18 % ) growth in assets under management from year-end 2006 came from net asset inflows and market appreciation across all segments : institutional , retail , private bank and private client services .tss also contributed to the rise in asset management , administration and commissions revenue , driven by increased product usage by new and existing clients and market appreciation on assets under custody .finally , commissions revenue increased , due mainly to higher brokerage transaction volume ( primarily included within fixed income and equity markets revenue of ib ) , which more than offset the sale of the insurance business by rfs in the third quarter of 2006 and a charge in the first quarter of 2007 resulting from accelerated surrenders of customer annuities .for additional information on these fees and commissions , see the segment discussions for ib on pages 40 201342 , rfs on pages 43 201348 , tss on pages 54 201355 , and am on pages 56 201358 , of this annual report .the favorable variance resulting from securities gains in 2007 compared with securities losses in

    "pred_output": "The difference in percentage cumulative total shareholder return for Ball Corporation compared to the S&P 500 index for the five-year period ending 12/31/10 is approximately 67.94%. This is calculated by subtracting the final value of the S&P 500 index ($111.99) from the final value of Ball Corporation ($178.93), dividing the result by the initial value ($100), and multiplying by 100.

demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments .based upon outstanding balances , and excluding purchased impaired loans , at december 31 , 2011 , for home equity lines of

approximately 5.57% ( 5.57 % ) were greater than or equal to 90 days past due .generally , when a borrower becomes 60 days past due , we terminate borrowing privileges , and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated .at that point , we continue our collection/recovery processes , which may include a loss mitigation loan modification resulting in a loan that is classified as a tdr .see note

homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure , where appropriate .initially , a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program .if a borrower does not qualify under a government program , the borrower is then evaluated under a pnc program .our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate , extend the term and/or defer

the terms of the modification .typically , these modifications are for a period of up to 24 months after which the interest rate reverts to the original loan rate .a permanent modification , with a term greater than 60 months , is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed .permanent modifications primarily include the government-created home affordable modification program ( hamp ) or pnc-developed hamp-like modification programs .for consumer loan programs , such as residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines , we will enter into a temporary modification when the borrower has indicated a temporary hardship and a willingness to bring current the delinquent loan balance .examples of this situation often include delinquency due to illness or death in the family , or a loss of employment .permanent modifications are entered into when it is confirmed that the borrower does not possess the income necessary to continue making loan payments at the current amount , but our expectation is that payments at lower amounts can be made .residential mortgage and home equity loans and lines have been modified with changes in terms for up to 60 months , although the majority involve periods of three to 24 months .we also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in

before expenses of $ 991 million .the shelf expired on april 23 , 2016 .we plan to file a new shelf registration statement with the sec in july 2016 .on august 28 , 2015 , we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks , which provides for up to $ 2 billion of borrowings .the facility matures august 28 , 2020 , with a one year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date , provided that in no event shall it extend beyond august 28 , 2022 .this facility replaces the prior $ 1 billion credit facility agreement entered into on november 1 , 2011 , which would have matured november 1 , 2017 .as of and for the periods ended may 31 , 2016 and 2015 , we had no amounts outstanding under either committed credit facility .we currently have long-term debt ratings of aa- and a1 from standard and poor 2019s corporation and moody 2019s investor services , respectively .if our long- term debt ratings were to decline , the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase .conversely , if our long-term debt rating were to improve , the facility fee and interest rate would decrease .changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility .under this committed revolving credit facility , we have agreed to various covenants .these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets , the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur , as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth .in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant , and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate , any borrowings would become immediately due and payable .as of may 31 , 2016 , we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future .liquidity is also provided by our $ 2 billion commercial paper program , which increased $ 1 billion during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 .during the year ended may 31 , 2016 , we did not issue commercial paper , and as of may 31 , 2016 , there were no outstanding borrowings under this program .any future issuance of commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2017 will depend on general corporate needs .we currently have short-term debt ratings of a1+ and p1 from standard and poor 2019s corporation and moody 2019s investor services , respectively .as of may 31 , 2016 , we had cash , cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $ 5.5 billion , of which $ 4.6 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries .included in cash and equivalents as of may 31 , 2016 was $ 105 million of cash collateral received from counterparties as a result of hedging activity .cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks , money market funds , commercial paper , corporate notes , u.s .treasury obligations , u.s .government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed income securities .our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk .all of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk .while individual securities have varying durations , as of may 31 , 2016 , the weighted average remaining duration of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 91 days .to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs .future volatility in the capital markets , however , may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets .we believe that existing cash , cash equivalents , short-term investments and cash generated by operations , together with access to external sources of funds as described above , will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future .we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed .we routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which u.s .taxes have previously been provided .we also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings , and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings .should we require additional capital in the united states , we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states through debt .if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds , we would be required to accrue and pay additional u.s .taxes less applicable foreign tax credits .if we elect to raise capital in the united states through debt , we would incur additional interest expense .off-balance sheet arrangements in connection with various contracts and agreements , we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights , coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor .currently , we have several such agreements in place .however , based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss , we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations .contractual obligations our significant long-term contractual obligations as of may 31 , 2016 and significant endorsement contracts , including related marketing commitments , entered into

f0b7 evaluation of any expected changes in current operations and the outlook for continued use of the assets ; f0b7 evaluation of technological advances and changes to maintenance practices ; and f0b7 expected salvage to be received upon retirement .for rail in high-density traffic corridors , we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track .it has been our experience that the lives of rail in high-density traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage ( i.e. , the amount of weight carried over the rail ) .the service lives also vary based on rail weight , rail condition ( e.g. , new or secondhand ) , and rail type ( e.g. , straight or curve ) .our depreciation studies for rail in high density traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives .for rail in high-density traffic corridors , we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross ton-miles carried over the rail ( i.e. , the weight of loaded and empty freight cars , locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail ) by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile .rail in high-density traffic corridors accounts for approximately 70 percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material .based on the number of gross ton-miles carried over our rail in high density traffic corridors during 2013 , the estimated service lives of the majority of this rail ranged from approximately 15 years to approximately 30 years .for all other depreciable assets , we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives .\nQuestion: what was the net change in the number of environmental sites from 2011 to 2012?\nAnswer:",

equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only , as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments .based upon outstanding balances , and excluding purchased impaired loans , at december 31 , 2011 , for home equity lines of credit for which the borrower can no longer draw ( e.g. , draw period has ended or borrowing privileges have been terminated ) , approximately 4.32% ( 4.32 % ) were 30-89 days past due and approximately 5.57% ( 5.57 % ) were greater than or equal to 90 days past due .generally , when a borrower becomes 60 days past due , we terminate borrowing privileges , and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated .at that point , we continue our collection/recovery processes , which may include a loss mitigation loan modification resulting in a loan that is classified as a tdr .see note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information .loan modifications and troubled debt restructurings consumer loan modifications we modify loans under government and pnc-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure , where appropriate .initially , a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program .if a borrower does not qualify under a government program , the borrower is then evaluated under a pnc program .our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate , extend the term and/or defer principal .temporary and permanent modifications under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as tdrs .further , certain payment plans and trial payment arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as tdrs .additional detail on tdrs is discussed below as well as in note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report .a temporary modification , with a term between three and 60 months , involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to the original loan terms as of a specific date or the occurrence of an event , such as a failure to pay in accordance with the terms of the modification .typically , these modifications are for a period of up to 24 months after which the interest rate reverts to the original loan rate .a permanent modification , with a term greater than 60 months , is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed .permanent modifications primarily include the government-created home affordable modification program ( hamp ) or pnc-developed hamp-like modification programs .for consumer loan programs , such as residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines , we will enter into a temporary modification when the borrower has indicated a temporary hardship and a willingness to bring current the delinquent loan balance .examples of this situation often include delinquency due to illness or death in the family , or a loss of employment .permanent modifications are entered into when it is confirmed that the borrower does not possess the income necessary to continue making loan payments at the current amount , but our expectation is that payments at lower amounts can be made .residential mortgage and home equity loans and lines have been modified with changes in terms for up to 60 months , although the majority involve periods of three to 24 months .we also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in serving our customers 2019 needs while mitigating credit losses .the following tables provide the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified consumer real estate related loans as well

for the wholesale business- es ( ib , cb , tss and am ) and consumer businesses ( rfs and cs ) .credit risk capital for the overall wholesale credit portfolio is defined in terms of unexpected credit losses , both from defaults and declines in the portfolio value due to credit deterioration , measured over a one-year period at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard .unexpected losses are losses in excess of those for which provisions for credit losses are maintained .the capital methodology is based upon several principal drivers of credit risk : exposure at default ( or loan-equivalent amount ) , default likelihood , credit spreads , loss severity and portfolio correlation .credit risk capital for the consumer portfolio is based upon product and other relevant risk segmentation .actual segment level default and severity experience are used to estimate unexpected losses for a one-year horizon at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard .statistical results for certain segments or portfolios are adjusted to ensure that capital is consistent with external bench- marks , such as subordination levels on market transactions or capital held at representative monoline competitors , where appropriate .market risk capital the firm calculates market risk capital guided by the principle that capital should reflect the risk of loss in the value of portfolios and financial instruments caused by adverse movements in market vari- ables , such as interest and foreign exchange rates , credit spreads , securities prices and commodities prices .daily value-at-risk ( 201cvar 201d ) , biweekly stress-test results and other factors are used to determine appropriate capital levels .the firm allocates market risk capital to each business segment according to a formula that weights that seg- ment 2019s var and stress-test exposures .see market risk management on pages 111 2013116 of this annual report for more information about these market risk measures .operational risk capital capital is allocated to the lines of business for operational risk using a risk-based capital allocation methodology which estimates opera- tional risk on a bottom-up basis .the operational risk capital model is based upon actual losses and potential scenario-based stress losses , with adjustments to the capital calculation to reflect changes in the quality of the control environment or the use of risk-transfer prod- ucts .the firm believes its model is consistent with the new basel ii framework .private equity risk capital capital is allocated to privately and publicly held securities , third-party fund investments and commitments in the private equity portfolio to cover the potential loss associated with a decline in equity markets and related asset devaluations .in addition to negative market fluctua- tions , potential losses in private equity investment portfolios can be magnified by liquidity risk .the capital allocation for the private equity portfolio is based upon measurement of the loss experience suffered by the firm and other market participants over a prolonged period of

    "pred_output": "The yearly interest expense incurred from the $375 million note with a fixed rate is not directly provided in the context. However, since the fixed rate is 5.0%, we can calculate the annual interest expense.\n\nThe formula for calculating annual interest expense is:\n\nInterest Expense = Principal * Interest Rate * Number of Days / 360\n\nAssuming a 360-day year for simplicity, the annual interest expense would be:\n\nInterest Expense = $375,000,000 * 5.0% * 360 / 360 = $18,750,000.\n\nSo, the yearly interest expense incurred from the $375 million note with a fixed rate is $18,750,000."

2001 .the $ 338 million or 119% ( 119 % ) increase in net sales during 2003 reflects the impact from opening 25 new stores in 2003 , the full year impact of 2002 store openings , as well as an increase in average revenue per store .total macintosh sales increased by approximately $ 170 million of which $ 108 million related to year-over-year increases in powerbook sales .the retail segment has also contributed strongly to the increases in net sales of peripherals , software and services experienced by the company during 2003 .during 2003 , approximately 45% ( 45 % ) of the retail segment 2019s net sales came from the sale of apple-branded and third-party peripherals , software and services as compared to 28% ( 28 % ) for the company as a whole .with an average of 54 stores open during 2003 , the retail segment achieved annualized revenue per store of approximately $ 11.5 million , as compared to approximately $ 10.2 million based on an average of 28 stores open in 2002 .as measured by the company 2019s operating segment reporting , the retail segment improved from a loss of $ 22 million during 2002 to a loss of $ 5 million during 2003 .this improvement is primarily attributable to the segment 2019s year-over-year increase in net sales , which resulted in higher leverage on occupancy , depreciation and other fixed costs .expansion of the retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure , operating lease commitments , personnel , and other operating expenses .capital expenditures

pricing actions on several macintosh models instituted by the company beginning in late fiscal 2002 as a result of continued pricing pressure throughout the personal computer industry , lower sales of relatively higher margin power macintosh systems during the first three fiscal quarters of 2003 , and increased air freight and manufacturing costs associated with the production ramp-up of the new power mac g5 and 15-inch powerbook , both of which began shipping in volume during september 2003 .this decline is also attributable to a rise in certain component costs as the year progressed .the aforementioned negative factors affecting gross margins during 2003 were partially offset by the increase in higher margin software and direct sales .the company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer industry will remain under pressure throughout fiscal 2004 in light of weak economic conditions , price competition in the personal computer industry

    "pred_output": "To find the percentage change in the unrecognized tax benefits from 2014 to 2015, we first need to find the difference between the ending balance of 2015 and the beginning balance of 2014, and then divide that difference by the beginning balance of 2014.\n\nFrom the table provided, the beginning balance of 2014 is $392 million and the ending balance of 2015 is $373 million.\n\nThe difference is $392 (2014) - $373 (2015) = $19 million.\n\nNow, to find the percentage change, we divide the difference by the beginning balance and multiply by 100:\n\n($19 million / $392 million) * 100 = 4.84% (approximately)\n\nSo, the percentage change in the unrecognized tax benefits from 2014 to 2015 is approximately 4.84%."

    "output": "1.64%",
    "pred_output": "To calculate the interest from 2017 to 2025 as a percentage of the total long-term borrowings, we first need to find the total interest paid during this period and then divide it by the total long-term borrowings.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. 2017: No long-term borrowings were issued in 2017, so there is no interest to be calculated.\n\n2. 2018-2024: Interest is payable annually on the 2024 notes, which are $1.0 billion. The interest rate is 3.50%, and there are 5 years from 2018 to 2022 (since 2023 is not included in the given period). So, the total interest for 2018-2022 would be 3.50% * $1.0 billion * 5 = $17.5 million per year for 5 years, totaling $87.5 million.\n\n3. 2025: The 2025 notes are $738 million, and the interest rate is 1.25%. For one year, the interest would be 1.25% * $738 million = $9.225 million.\n\nNow, let's find the total long-term borrowings for the given period:\n\n- 2024 notes: $1.0 billion (already accounted for in the interest calculation)\n- 2025 notes: $738 million\n\nTotal long-term borrowings for the given period: $1.0 billion + $738 million = $1,738 million\n\nNow, let's calculate the total interest for the given period:\n\n- 2018-2022: $87.5 million\n- 2025: $9.225 million\n\nTotal interest for the given period: $87.5 million + $9.225 million = $96.725 million\n\nFinally, let's calculate the percentage of the total interest to the total long-term borrowings:\n\n$96.725 million / $1,738 million = approximately 5.6%\n\nSo, the interest from 2017 to 2025 as a percentage of the total long-term borrowings is approximately 5.6%."

    "pred_output": "The growth rate in operating profit for Space Systems in 2011 is a decrease of 1.5% compared to 2010. This is calculated by subtracting the operating profit of 2011 ($1,063 million) from the operating profit of 2010 ($1,030 million), and then dividing the result by the operating profit of 2010. The formula is (1063 - 1030) / 1030 = 1.5%. However, the question asks for the growth rate in 2011, not the decrease in 2011 compared to 2010, so the percentage would be negative.

operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures ( including non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures ) , adjusted for the estimated impact of noncontrolling interests .the proportionate share of cash flows and related adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries comprise the proportional adjustment factor presented in the reconciliation below .upon the company's adoption of the accounting guidance for service concession arrangements effective january 1 , 2015 , capital expenditures related to service concession assets that would have been classified as investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows are now classified as operating activities .see note 1 2014general and summary of significant accounting policies of this form 10-k for further information on the adoption of this guidance .beginning in the quarter ended march 31 , 2015 , the company changed the definition of proportional free cash flow to exclude the cash flows for capital expenditures related to service concession assets that are now classified within net cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows .the proportional adjustment factor for these capital expenditures is presented in the reconciliation below .we also exclude environmental capital expenditures that are expected to be recovered through regulatory , contractual or other mechanisms .an example of recoverable environmental capital expenditures is ipl's investment in mats-related environmental upgrades that are recovered through a tracker .see item 1 . 2014us sbu 2014ipl 2014environmental matters for details of these investments .the gaap measure most comparable to proportional free cash flow is cash flows from operating activities .we believe that proportional free cash flow better reflects the underlying business performance of the company , as it measures the cash generated by the business , after the funding of maintenance capital expenditures , that may be available for investing or repaying debt or other purposes .factors in this determination include the impact of noncontrolling interests , where aes consolidates the results of a subsidiary that is not wholly-owned by the company .the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations .proportional free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to cash from operating activities , which is determined in accordance with gaap .proportional free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary payments because it excludes certain payments that are required or to which we have committed , such as debt service requirements and dividend payments .our definition of proportional free cash flow may not be

.( 2 ) the proportional adjustment factor , proportional maintenance capital expenditures ( net of reinsurance proceeds ) and proportional non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures are calculated by multiplying the percentage owned by noncontrolling interests for each entity by its corresponding consolidated cash flow metric and are totaled to the resulting figures .for example , parent company a owns 20% ( 20 % ) of subsidiary company b , a consolidated subsidiary .thus , subsidiary company b has an 80% ( 80 % ) noncontrolling interest .assuming a consolidated net cash flow from operating activities of $ 100 from subsidiary b , the proportional adjustment factor for subsidiary b would equal $ 80 ( or $ 100 x 80% ( 80 % ) ) .the company calculates the proportional adjustment factor for each consolidated business in this manner and then sums these amounts to determine the total proportional adjustment factor used in the reconciliation .the proportional adjustment factor may differ from the proportion of income attributable to noncontrolling interests as a result of ( a ) non-cash items which impact income but not cash and ( b ) aes' ownership

net interest income , very strong private equity gains , record asset management , administration and commissions revenue , higher mortgage fees and related income and record investment banking fees contributed to the revenue growth .these increases were offset partially by lower trading revenue .investment banking fees grew in 2007 to a level higher than the pre- vious record set in 2006 .record advisory and equity underwriting fees drove the results , partially offset by lower debt underwriting fees .for a further discussion of investment banking fees , which are primarily recorded in ib , see the ib segment results on pages 40 201342 of this annual report .principal transactions revenue consists of trading revenue and private equity gains .trading revenue declined significantly from the 2006 level , primarily due to markdowns in ib of $ 1.4 billion ( net of hedges ) on subprime positions , including subprime cdos , and $ 1.3 billion ( net of fees ) on leveraged lending funded loans and unfunded commitments .also in ib , markdowns in securitized products on nonsubprime mortgages and weak credit trading performance more than offset record revenue in currencies and strong revenue in both rates and equities .equities benefited from strong client activity and record trading results across all products .ib 2019s credit portfolio results increased compared with the prior year , primarily driven by higher revenue from risk management activities .the increase in private equity gains from 2006 reflected a significantly higher level of gains , the classification of certain private equity carried interest as compensation expense and a fair value adjustment in the first quarter of 2007 on nonpublic private equity investments resulting from the adoption of sfas 157 ( 201cfair value measurements 201d ) .for a further discussion of principal transactions revenue , see the ib and corporate segment results on pages 40 201342 and 59 201360 , respectively , and note 6 on page 122 of this annual report .lending & deposit-related fees rose from the 2006 level , driven pri- marily by higher deposit-related fees and the bank of new york transaction .for a further discussion of lending & deposit-related fees , which are mostly recorded in rfs , tss and cb , see the rfs segment results on pages 43 201348 , the tss segment results on pages 54 201355 , and the cb segment results on pages 52 201353 of this annual report .asset management , administration and commissions revenue reached a level higher than the previous record set in 2006 .increased assets under management and higher performance and placement fees in am drove the record results .the 18% ( 18 % ) growth in assets under management from year-end 2006 came from net asset inflows and market appreciation across all segments : institutional , retail , private bank and private client services .tss also contributed to the rise in asset management , administration and commissions revenue , driven by increased product usage by new and existing clients and market appreciation on assets under custody .finally , commissions revenue increased , due mainly to higher brokerage transaction volume ( primarily included within fixed income and equity markets revenue of ib ) , which more than offset the sale of the insurance business by rfs in the third quarter of 2006 and a charge in the first quarter of 2007 resulting from accelerated surrenders of customer annuities .for additional information on these fees and commissions , see the segment discussions for ib on pages 40 201342 ,

.( 2 ) the proportional adjustment factor , proportional maintenance capital expenditures ( net of reinsurance proceeds ) and proportional non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures are calculated by multiplying the percentage owned by noncontrolling interests for each entity by its corresponding consolidated cash flow metric and are totaled to the resulting figures .for example , parent company a owns 20% ( 20 % ) of subsidiary company b , a consolidated subsidiary .thus , subsidiary company b has an 80% ( 80 % ) noncontrolling interest .assuming a consolidated net cash flow from operating activities of $ 100 from subsidiary b , the proportional adjustment factor for subsidiary b would equal $ 80 ( or $ 100 x 80% ( 80 % ) ) .the company calculates the proportional adjustment factor for each consolidated business in this manner and then sums these amounts to determine the total proportional adjustment factor used in the reconciliation .the proportional adjustment factor may differ from the proportion of income attributable to noncontrolling interests as a result of ( a ) non-cash items which impact income but not cash and ( b ) aes' ownership interest in the subsidiary where such items occur .( 3 ) includes proportional adjustment amount for service concession asset expenditures of $ 84 million for the year ended december 31 , 2015 .the

    "output": "19%",
    "pred_output": "The net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 924 million dollars in 2014 compared to 2013. To find the percentage change, we can divide the change in cash flow by the initial amount and multiply by 100.\n\nSo, the percentage change is (924 / 2715) * 100 = -34.1% (rounded). Therefore, the net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately 34.1% in 2014 compared to 2013."

were primarily related to weather- related events in the u.s. , earthquakes in chile , mexico , and new zealand , and storms in australia and europe .the catastrophe losses for 2009 were primarily related to an earthquake in asia , floods in europe , several weather-related events in the u.s. , and a european windstorm .for 2008 , the catastrophe losses were primarily related to hurricanes gustav and ike .prior period development arises from changes to loss estimates recognized in the current year that relate to loss reserves first reported in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premium from pre- vious accident years .we experienced $ 503 million of net favorable prior period development in our p&c segments in 2010 .this

information .the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio declined in 2010 , compared with 2009 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , non-recurring premium adjustment and the reduction in assumed loss portfolio business , which is written at higher loss ratios than other types of business .our policy acquisition costs include commissions , premium taxes , underwriting , and other costs that vary with , and are primarily related to , the production of premium .administrative expenses include all other operating costs .our policy acquis- ition cost ratio increased in 2010 ,

the impact of reinstatement premiums expensed in connection with catastrophe activity and changes in business mix .our administrative expense ratio increased in 2010 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , reinstatement premiums expensed , and increased costs in our international operations .although the crop settlements generate minimal administrative expenses , they resulted in lower adjustment to net premiums earned in 2010 , compared with 2009 .administrative expenses in 2010 , were partially offset by higher net results generated by our third party claims administration

rate .our effective income tax rate was 15 percent in 2010 , compared with 17 percent and 24 percent in 2009 and 2008 , respectively .the decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2010 , was primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings to lower tax-paying jurisdictions , a decrease in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits which was the result of a settlement with the u.s .internal

characteris- tics , contractually specified servicing fees , prepayment assumptions , delinquency rates , late charges , other ancillary revenue and costs to service , and other economic factors .the firm reassesses and periodi- cally adjusts the underlying inputs and assumptions used in the oas model to reflect market conditions and assumptions that a market par- ticipant would consider in valuing the msr asset .during the fourth quarter of the 2007 , the firm 2019s proprietary prepayment model was refined to reflect a decrease in estimated future mortgage prepay- ments based upon a number of market related factors including a downward trend in home prices , general tightening of credit under- writing standards and the associated impact on refinancing activity .the firm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available and to recent market activity and actual portfolio experience .the fair value of msrs is sensitive to changes in interest rates , includ- ing their effect on prepayment speeds .jpmorgan chase uses or has used combinations of derivatives , afs securities and trading instru- ments to manage changes in the fair value of msrs .the intent is to offset any changes in the fair value of msrs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instruments .msrs decrease in value when interest rates decline .conversely , securities ( such as mort- gage-backed securities ) , principal-only certificates and certain deriva- tives ( when the firm receives fixed-rate interest payments ) increase in value when interest rates decline .in march 2006 , the fasb issued sfas 156 , which permits an entity a one-time irrevocable election to adopt fair value accounting for a class of servicing assets .jpmorgan chase elected to adopt the standard effective january 1 , 2006 , and defined msrs as one class of servicing assets for this election .at the transition date , the fair value of the msrs exceeded their carrying amount , net of any related valuation allowance , by $ 150 million net of taxes .this amount was recorded as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of january 1 , 2006 .msrs are recognized in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value , and changes in their fair value are recorded in current- period earnings .revenue amounts related to msrs and the financial instruments used to manage the risk of msrs are recorded in mortgage fees and related income .for the year ended december 31 , 2005 , msrs were accounted for under sfas 140 , using a lower of cost or fair value approach .under this approach , msrs were amortized as a reduction of the actual servicing income received in proportion to , and over the period of , the estimated future net servicing income stream of the underlying mortgage loans .for purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment of msrs , the firm stratified the portfolio on the basis of the predominant risk characteristics , which are loan type and interest rate .any indicated impairment was rec- ognized as a reduction in revenue through a valuation allowance , which represented the extent to which the carrying value of an individual stra- tum exceeded its estimated fair value .any gross carrying value and relat- ed valuation allowance amounts which were not expected to be recov- ered in the foreseeable future , based upon the interest rate scenario , were considered to be other-than-temporary .prior to the adoption of sfas 156 , the firm designated certain deriva- tives used to risk manage msrs ( e.g. , a combination of swaps , swap- tions and floors ) as sfas 133 fair value hedges of benchmark interest rate risk .sfas 133 hedge accounting allowed the carrying value of the hedged msrs to be adjusted through earnings in the same period that the change in value of the hedging derivatives was recognized through earnings .the designated hedge period was daily .in designat- ing the benchmark interest rate , the firm considered the impact that the change in the benchmark rate had on the prepayment speed esti- mates in determining the fair value of the msrs .hedge effectiveness was assessed using a regression analysis of the change in fair value of the msrs as a result of changes in benchmark interest rates and of the change in the fair value of the designated derivatives .the valua- tion adjustments to both the msrs and sfas 133 derivatives were recorded in mortgage fees and related income .with the election to apply fair value accounting to the msrs under sfas 156 , sfas 133 hedge accounting is no

Once you have that information, you can calculate the yearly interest expense using the formula:\n\nYearly Interest Expense = Face Value x Coupon Rate / 2 (since the bond is issued in the middle of the year)\n\nFor example, if the coupon rate is 1.875% (as mentioned in the text for a different bond), the yearly interest expense would be:\n\nYearly Interest Expense = $250,000,000 x 1.875% / 2 = $6,687,500 (approximately)"

    "pred_output": "To find the percent of unfunded commitments at December 31, 2013, we need to divide the amount of unfunded commitments by the total equity investment balances and then multiply by 100.\n\nFirst, let's find the total equity investment balances:\n\nTotal equity investment balances = Blackrock + Tax credit investments + Private equity + Visa + Other\nTotal equity investment balances = $5940 + $2676 + $1656 + $158 + $234 = $10664\n\nNext, let's find the unfunded commitments at December 31, 2013:\n\nUnfunded commitments = $802 million\n\nNow, let's calculate the percent of unfunded commitments:\n\nPercent of unfunded commitments = (Unfunded commitments / Total equity investment balances) * 100\nPercent of unfunded commitments = ($802 million / $10664) * 100\nPercent of unfunded commitments = 7.55%\n\nSo, the percent of unfunded commitments at December 31, 2013, is 7.55%."

    "pred_output": "The growth rate in base rent for the Hudson Yards, New York facility cannot be determined directly from the provided information as the second period's base rent amount is not given. However, we can see that the base rent increases every five years. The base rent for the first five years is approximately $51 million per year, and it is expected to increase to $58 million, $66 million, and $74 million per year for the next five years. Therefore, the growth rate for the second period would be the difference between the base rent for the second five years and the base rent for the first five years, divided by the base rent for the first five years. To find the exact growth rate, we would need the base rent amount for the second five years, which is not provided in the context."

pension protection act of 2006 , sets limits as to both minimum and maximum contributions to the plan .we do not expect to be required by law to make any contributions to the plan during 2012 .we maintain other defined benefit plans that have a less significant effect on financial results , including various nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees .recourse and repurchase obligations as discussed in note 3 loan sale and servicing activities and variable interest entities in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report , pnc has sold commercial mortgage and residential mortgage loans directly or indirectly in securitizations and whole-loan sale transactions with continuing involvement .one form of continuing involvement includes certain recourse and loan repurchase obligations associated with the transferred assets in these transactions .commercial mortgage loan recourse obligations we originate , close , and service certain multi-family commercial mortgage loans which are sold to fnma under fnma 2019s delegated underwriting and servicing ( dus ) program .we participated in a similar program with the fhlmc .under these programs , we generally assume up to a one-third pari passu risk of loss on unpaid principal balances through a loss share arrangement .at december 31 , 2011 and december 31 , 2010 , the unpaid principal balance outstanding of loans sold as a participant in these programs was $ 13.0 billion and $ 13.2 billion , respectively .the potential maximum exposure under the loss share arrangements was $ 4.0 billion at both december 31 , 2011 and december 31 , 2010 .we maintain a reserve for estimated losses based on our exposure .the reserve for losses under these programs totaled $ 47 million and $ 54 million as of december 31 , 2011 and december 31 , 2010 , respectively , and is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet .if payment is required under these programs , we would not have a contractual interest in the collateral underlying the mortgage loans on which losses occurred , although the value of the collateral is taken into account in determining our share of such losses .our exposure and activity associated with these recourse obligations are reported in the corporate & institutional banking segment .residential mortgage loan and home equity repurchase obligations while residential mortgage loans are sold on a non-recourse basis , we assume certain loan repurchase obligations associated with mortgage loans we have sold to investors .these loan repurchase obligations primarily relate to situations where pnc is alleged to have breached certain origination covenants and representations and warranties made to purchasers of the loans in the respective purchase and sale agreements .residential mortgage loans covered by these loan repurchase obligations include first and second-lien mortgage loans we have sold through agency securitizations , non-agency securitizations , and whole-loan sale transactions .as discussed in note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report , agency securitizations consist of mortgage loans sale transactions with fnma , fhlmc , and the government national mortgage association ( gnma ) program , while non-agency securitizations and whole-loan sale transactions consist of mortgage loans sale transactions with private investors .our historical exposure and activity associated with agency securitization repurchase obligations has primarily been related to transactions with fnma and fhlmc , as indemnification and repurchase losses associated with federal housing agency ( fha ) and department of veterans affairs ( va ) -insured and uninsured loans pooled in gnma securitizations historically have been minimal .repurchase obligation activity associated with residential mortgages is reported in the residential mortgage banking segment .pnc 2019s repurchase obligations also include certain brokered home equity loans/lines that were sold to a limited number of private investors in the financial services industry by national city prior to our acquisition .pnc is no longer engaged in the brokered home equity lending business , and our exposure under these loan repurchase obligations is limited to repurchases of the whole-loans sold in these transactions .repurchase activity associated with brokered home equity lines/loans are reported in the non-strategic assets portfolio segment .loan covenants and representations and warranties are established through loan sale agreements with various investors to provide assurance that pnc has sold loans to the pnc financial services group , inc .2013 form 10-k 69 .\nQuestion: for december

    "output": "921%",
    "pred_output": "To find the goodwill as a percentage of current assets, we first need to find the total current assets and the goodwill amount from the given table.\n\nCurrent assets: $28.1 million\nGoodwill: $258.9 million\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage by dividing the goodwill by the current assets and multiplying by 100:\n\n(Goodwill / Current assets) * 100 = ($258.9 million / $28.1 million) * 100 = approximately 918.5%\n\nHowever, a goodwill percentage of over 100% is not meaningful in this context, as goodwill is an excess of purchase price over the net tangible assets acquired. In reality, the percentage should be much lower, and this high value is likely due to rounding errors in the provided numbers. To get a more accurate percentage, you should use the actual numbers from the financial statements."

light sweet wti .heavier and higher sulfur crude oil ( commonly referred to as heavy sour crude oil ) sells at a discount to light sweet crude oil .our international crude oil production is relatively sweet and is generally sold in relation to the brent crude oil benchmark .natural gas prices on average were higher in 2008 than in 2007 .a significant portion of our u.s .lower 48 states natural gas production is sold at bid-week prices or first-of-month indices relative to our specific producing areas .the average henry hub first-of-month price index was $ 2.18 per thousand cubic feet ( 201cmcf 201d ) higher in 2008 than the 2007 average .natural gas sales in alaska are subject to term contracts .our other major natural gas-producing regions are europe and equatorial guinea , where large portions of our natural gas sales are subject to term contracts , making realized prices in these areas less volatile .as we sell larger quantities of natural gas from these regions , to the extent that these fixed prices are lower than prevailing prices , our reported average natural gas prices realizations may decrease .e&p segment income during 2008 was up 57 percent from 2007 , with revenue increases tied to these increases in average commodity prices accounting for almost half of the income improvement .liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes were also higher in 2008 than 2007

ended the year at $ 24.97 per barrel impacted by a heavier yield in december and a seasonal decrease in the value of our heavy output .the operating cost structure of the oil sands mining operations is predominantly fixed , and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime .per unit costs are sensitive to production rates .key variable costs

From the table provided, we can see that the number of Class A common stocks issued and outstanding increased from 338,240 in 2016 to 339,235 in 2017.

Therefore, the number of new Class A common stocks issued between 2016 and 2017 is zero.\n\nHowever, if we are to interpret the question as asking for the net increase in issued and outstanding Class A common stocks (new issues minus reissuances or transfers), we would need additional information to determine this.\n\nIn summary, the answer to the question is zero, assuming we are only considering new issues of Class A common stocks.

described above illustrate the total economic sensitivity of the firm 2019s consolidated balance sheets to changes in market variables .the effect of interest rate exposure on reported net income is also important .interest rate risk exposure in the firm 2019s core nontrading business activities ( i.e. , asset/liability management positions ) results from on 2013and off 2013balance sheet positions and can occur due to a variety of factors , including : 2022 differences in the timing among the maturity or repricing of assets , liabilities and off 2013balance sheet instruments .for example , if liabilities reprice quicker than assets and funding interest rates are declining , earnings will increase initially .2022 differences in the amounts of assets , liabilities and off 2013balance sheet instruments that are repricing at the same time .for example , if more deposit liabilities are repricing than assets when general interest rates are declining , earnings will increase initially .2022 differences in the amounts by which short-term and long-term market interest rates change ( for example , changes in the slope of the yield curve , because the firm has the ability to lend at long-term fixed rates and borrow at variable or short- term fixed rates ) .based on these scenarios , the firm 2019s earnings would be affected negatively by a sudden and unanticipated increase in short-term rates paid on its liabilities ( e.g. , depos- its ) without a corresponding increase in long-term rates re- ceived on its assets ( e.g. , loans ) .conversely , higher long-term rates received on assets generally are beneficial to earnings , particularly when the increase is not accompanied by rising short-term rates paid on liabilities .2022 the impact of changes in the maturity of various assets , liabili- ties or off 2013balance sheet instruments as interest rates change .for example , if more borrowers than forecasted pay down higher-rate loan balances when general interest rates are de- clining , earnings may decrease initially .the firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated , corporate-wide basis .business units transfer their interest rate risk to treasury through a transfer- pricing system , which takes into account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be risk-managed in financial markets .these elements include asset and liability balances and contrac- tual rates of interest , contractual principal payment schedules , expected prepayment experience , interest rate reset dates and maturities , rate indices used for repricing , and any interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products .all transfer-pricing assumptions are dynamically reviewed .the firm conducts simulations of changes in net interest income from its nontrading activities under a variety of interest rate scenarios .earnings-at-risk tests measure the potential change in the firm 2019s net interest income , and the corresponding impact to the firm 2019s pretax earnings , over the following 12 months .these tests highlight exposures to various rate-sensitive factors , such as the rates themselves ( e.g. , the prime lending rate ) , pricing strate- gies on deposits , optionality and changes in product mix .the tests include forecasted balance sheet changes , such as asset sales and securitizations , as well as prepayment and reinvestment behavior .immediate changes in interest rates present a limited view of risk , and so a number of alternative scenarios are also reviewed .these scenarios include the implied forward curve , nonparallel rate shifts and severe interest rate shocks on selected key rates .these scenar- ios are intended to provide a comprehensive view of jpmorgan chase 2019s earnings at risk over a wide range of outcomes .jpmorgan chase 2019s 12-month pretax earnings sensitivity profile as of december 31 , 2009 and 2008 , is as follows. .\n|( in millions )|immediate change in rates +200bp|immediate change in rates +100bp|immediate change in rates -100bp|immediate change in rates -200bp|\n|december 31 2009|$ -1594 ( 1594 )|$ -554 ( 554 )|nm

200-basis-point parallel shocks result in a fed funds target rate of zero , and negative three- and six-month treasury rates .the earnings- at-risk results of such a low-probability scenario are not meaningful .the change in earnings at risk from december 31 , 2008 , results from a higher level of afs securities and an updated baseline scenario that uses higher short-term interest rates .the firm 2019s risk to rising rates is largely the result of increased funding costs on assets , partially offset by widening deposit margins , which are currently compressed due to very low short-term interest rates .additionally , another interest rate scenario , involving a steeper yield curve with long-term rates rising 100 basis points and short- term rates staying at current levels , results in a 12-month pretax earnings benefit of $ 449 million .the increase in earnings is due to reinvestment of maturing assets at the higher long-term rates , with funding costs remaining unchanged .risk identification for large exposures individuals who manage risk positions , particularly those that are complex , are responsible for identifying potential losses that could arise from specific , unusual events , such as a potential tax change , and estimating the probabilities of losses arising from such events .this information is entered into the firm 2019s rifle database .management of trading businesses control rifle entries , thereby permitting the firm to monitor further earnings vulnerability not adequately covered by standard risk measures .risk monitoring and control limits market risk is controlled primarily through a series of limits .limits reflect the firm 2019s risk appetite in the context of the market environment and business strategy .in setting limits , the firm takes into consideration factors such as market volatility , product liquidity , business trends and management experience. .\nQuestion: if there were a 200bp rise in rates , how much more would the impact be on earnings in 2009 vs . 2008?\nAnswer:",
    "output": "1930",
    "pred_output": "The impact on earnings in 2009 would be a decrease of $1,594 million, while in 2008 the impact would have been an increase of $336 million.

However, it does mention the total debt as a percentage of total capital (a), which represents shareholders' equity, net non-current deferred income tax liabilities, and debt. In 2019, total debt as a percentage of total capital was 45.6%. Therefore, the remaining percentage of the financing structure would be the percentage of equity, which can be calculated by subtracting the debt percentage from 100%.\n\nSo, the percentage of the financing structure that was based on equity in 2019 would be 100% - 45.6% = 54.4%."

The fair value is given in the table as $1189 million. The notional value can be found by adding the assets and liabilities for derivatives designated as hedging instruments under GAAP, which is $29,270 million + $1872 million = $31,142 million.\n\nNow, to find the percentage, we divide the fair value by the notional value and multiply by 100:\n\n(1189 / 31142) * 100 = approximately 3.82%\n\nSo, at the end of 2013, the notional value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments under GAAP was approximately 3.82% of the fair value.

    "output": "yes",
    "pred_output": "Yes, the change in net revenue from changes in transmission revenue was more significant than the change due to the retail electric price change. This is because the change in transmission revenue was $7.0 million, while the change in retail electric price was $5.4 million. However, it's important to note that this analysis does not consider the changes in other categories such as reserve equalization, purchased power capacity, net wholesale, and other.

However, the question does not provide the exact amount of lease obligations for Entergy Louisiana. It only mentions the total lease obligations excluding those of Entergy Louisiana and System Energy, which are $149 million at Entergy Louisiana and $97 million at System Energy.\n\nSince we don't have the exact amount for Entergy Louisiana's lease obligations, we cannot calculate the percentage accurately.

profits compared with 2004 by $ 586 million .lower sales volumes were also a negative factor versus 2004 as we took a significant amount of lack-of-order downtime in our u.s .uncoated paper and containerboard mills , and downtime in our eastern european operations to rebuild paper machines in po- land and russia to add needed uncoated paper and pa- perboard capacity .we were able to partially offset some of these negative impacts through operational improvements in our manufacturing operations , im- proved average pricing for our paper and packaging grades , a more favorable product mix , and higher earn- ings from forestland and real estate sales .looking forward to 2006 , we expect operating prof- its for the first quarter to be flat with the 2005 fourth quarter .sales volumes should be seasonally slow in the quarter , but should show some improvement as the quarter progresses .price realizations should also improve as previously announced price increases are im-

first-quarter announced price increases .additionally , operating rates should improve in 2006 reflecting announced industry capacity reductions in uncoated papers and container- board .we are also starting to see some reductions in natural gas and southern wood costs that , if the trend continues , should benefit operations as the year pro- gresses .in connection with our overall strategic direction , we are evaluating options for the possible sale or spin-off of certain of our businesses as previously announced in our transformation plan , with decisions on certain businesses anticipated during 2006 .we also will con- tinue to improve our key operations in north america by realigning our uncoated and packaging mill oper- ations to reduce costs , improve our products and

as discussed in item 8 , note 13 .benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements , we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees , including pensions , postretirement health care and postemployment benefits ( primarily severance ) .we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by u.s .gaap .these calculations include various actuarial assumptions , such as discount rates , assumed rates of return on plan assets , compensation increases , mortality , turnover rates and health care cost trend rates .we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so .as permitted by u.s .gaap , any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods .we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries .weighted-average discount rate assumptions for pension and postretirement plan obligations at december 31 , 2018 and 2017 are as follows: .\n||2018|2017|\n|pension plans|1.61% ( 1.61 % )|1.51% ( 1.51 % )|\n|postretirement plans|3.97% ( 3.97 % )|3.79% ( 3.79 % )|\nwe anticipate that assumption changes will increase 2019 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense to approximately $ 205 million as compared with approximately $ 160 million in 2018 , excluding amounts related to employee severance and early retirement programs .the anticipated increase is primarily due to higher amortization out of other comprehensive earnings for unrecognized actuarial gains/ losses of $ 14 million , coupled with lower return on assets of $ 16 million , higher interest and service cost of $ 12 million and $ 4 million respectively , partially offset by other movements of $ 1 million .weighted-average expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amount of expense reported for the employee benefit plans .a fifty-basis-point decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2019 pension and postretirement expense by approximately $ 50 million , and a fifty-basis-point increase in our discount rate would decrease our 2019 pension and postretirement .\nQuestion: what is the percentage change in weighted average discount rate for postretirement plans from 2017 to 2018?\nAnswer:",

So, the calculation would be:\n\nPercentage = ($2.2 billion / $3195 million) * 100%\n\nTo perform the calculation, you would first divide $2.2 billion by $3195 million, which gives approximately 0.069 or 6.9%.

any interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31 , 2015 .we had $ 1509.7 of cash , cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31 , 2015 that we generally invest in conservative , short-term bank deposits or securities .the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements .during 2015 and 2014 , we had interest income of $ 22.8 and $ 27.4 , respectively .based on our 2015 results , a 100-basis-point increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately $ 15.0 , assuming that all cash , cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from year-end 2015 levels .foreign currency rates we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates .since we report revenues and expenses in u.s .dollars , changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses ( as expressed in u.s .dollars ) from foreign operations .the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2015 included the australian dollar , brazilian real , british pound sterling and euro .based on 2015 exchange rates and operating results , if the u.s .dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10% ( 10 % ) , we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase approximately 4% ( 4 % ) , assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2015 levels .the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency .assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date , and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented .the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss , net of tax , in the stockholders 2019 equity section of our consolidated balance sheets .our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency , mitigating transaction risk .however , certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency .assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement .currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses .we regularly review our foreign exchange exposures that may have a material impact on our business and from time to time use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these exposures .we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives for speculative purposes. .\nQuestion: what is the total difference , in millions , in 2015 between a 10% ( 10 % )

    "pred_output": "To find the percentage of the total future minimum commitments under existing non-cancelable operating leases for purchase obligations, we need to divide the amount for purchase obligations by the total future minimum commitments and then multiply by 100.\n\nFrom the table provided, the amount for purchase obligations at December 31, 2007, is $2089 million. The total future minimum commitments under existing non-cancelable operating leases and purchase obligations is $2089 (lease obligations) + $1572 (purchase obligations) = $3661 million.\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage: (2089 / 3661) * 100 = approximately 57.02%.\n\nSo, at December 31, 2007, the percent of the total future minimum commitments under existing non-cancelable operating leases for purchase obligations was approximately 57.02%."

    "pred_output": "The question asks for the growth rate in net revenue in 2016, but the provided table shows a decrease in net revenue from 2015 to 2016. To find the growth rate, we would typically subtract the previous year's value from the current year's value and divide by the previous year's value, then multiply by 100 to get a percentage. However, since the net revenue decreased, we would take the absolute value of the difference and then calculate the percentage.\n\nIn this case, the net revenue in 2015 was $1666 million, and in 2016 it was $1542 million. So, the decrease in net revenue is $124 million ($1666 - $1542). To find the growth rate, we would calculate:\n\n(124 / 1666) * 100 = -7.46%\n\nSo, the growth rate in net revenue in 2016 was approximately -7.46%.

    "pred_output": "To find the percentage of minimum total assets available for default that was guaranty fund contributions (2), we first need to find the value of guaranty fund contributions (2) and the total minimum assets available for default (4). Then, we can calculate the percentage by dividing the value of guaranty fund contributions by the total minimum assets available for default and multiplying by 100.\n\nFrom the table provided, we have:\n\n- Guaranty fund contributions (2) = $2,899.5 million\n- Total minimum assets available for default (4) = $10,973.1 million\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage:\n\nPercentage = (Guaranty fund contributions / Total minimum assets available for default) * 100%\nPercentage = ($2,899.5 / $10,973.1) * 100%\nPercentage ≈ 26.64%\n\nSo, the answer is that guaranty fund contributions (2) represented approximately 26.64% of the minimum total assets available for default."

plemented .while energy , wood and raw material price movements are mixed , their impact for the quarter is expected to be flat .however , we see favorable signs of positive mo- mentum for the remainder of 2006 .we anticipate that demand in north america for both uncoated paper and industrial packaging products will be stronger , and that we will realize 2005 fourth-quarter and 2006 first-quarter announced price increases .additionally , operating rates should improve in 2006 reflecting announced industry capacity reductions in uncoated papers and container- board .we are also starting to see some reductions in natural gas and southern wood costs that , if the trend continues , should benefit operations as the year pro- gresses .in connection with our overall strategic direction , we are evaluating options for the possible sale or spin-off of certain of our businesses as previously announced in our transformation plan , with decisions on certain businesses anticipated during 2006 .we also will con- tinue to improve our key operations in north america by realigning our uncoated and packaging mill oper- ations to reduce costs , improve our products and im- prove our overall profitability .results of operations industry segment operating profits are used by international paper 2019s management to measure the earn- ings performance of its businesses

To find this, we can use the number of closed sites and the total number of sites (open sites beginning balance + new sites - closed sites).\n\nTotal sites in 2013 = 284 (open sites beginning balance) + 41 (new sites) - 57 (closed sites) = 286\n\nPercentage of sites closed down = (closed sites / total sites) * 100% = (57 / 286) * 100% = approximately 19.94% (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, the answer is that approximately 19.94% of the sites were closed down in 2013."

Aggregate statutory capital and surplus: From the table, the estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus as of December 31, 2008, is $13.8 billion.\n\n3. Life operations statutory surplus: The effects of the permitted practices are included in the 2008 life operations surplus amount, which is $6,047 million (as per the table).\n\n4. Calculate the portion related to life operations: Life operations portion = Life operations surplus / (Total GAAP stockholders' equity + Aggregate statutory capital and surplus)\nLife operations portion = $6,047 million / ($9.3 billion + $13.8 billion)\nLife operations portion = $6,047 million / $23.1 billion\nLife operations portion = 0.262 or 26.2%\n\nSo, in 2008, the percent of the total GAAP stockholders' equity and aggregate statutory capital associated with life operations was 26.2%."

    "pred_output": "To find the average price per share of the company's common stock in the third quarter of 2016, we need to calculate the arithmetic mean of the high and low prices for that quarter.\n\nThe high price for the third quarter is $32.91, and the low price is $27.09.\n\nAverage price = (High price + Low price) / 2\nAverage price = ($32.91 + $27.09) / 2\nAverage price = $30.005\n\nSince the reverse stock split occurred after the third quarter, the prices listed are not adjusted for the split. To get the actual average price per share after the reverse stock split, we would need to multiply the calculated average price by 3. However, since the question asks for the average price before the reverse stock split, we can simply use the calculated average price of $30.005.\n\nSo, the answer is $30.005."

    "output": "2.7%",
    "pred_output": "The growth rate in the number of stores during 2011 is 116 (new stores) - 4 (stores closed) = 112 stores. However, it's important to note that this growth rate does not include stores that opened as relocations of previously existing stores within the same general market area or substantial renovations of stores. To find the percentage growth rate, we would divide the number of new stores by the number of ending stores in 2011 (3460) and multiply by 100. But since the exact number of stores in 2010 (3369) is given, we can calculate the percentage growth rate as (116 - 3369) / 3369 * 100 = -96.47%. This means there was a decrease in the number of stores by approximately 96.47% from 2010 to 2011."

    "output": "66.67%",
    "pred_output": "To find the percentage of common stock repurchased, we first need to determine the total number of shares repurchased and the total number of shares authorized for repurchase.\n\nFrom the text, we know that:\n- The total number of shares repurchased under the February 2017 ASR was 6.67 million.\n- Additional shares repurchased in the open market after the settlement of the February 2017 ASR were 3.04 million.\n- The total number of shares authorized for repurchase under the $2.25 billion authorization was not explicitly stated, but we can calculate it by dividing the total authorization amount by the average price per share of Humana common stock.\n\nFirst, let's find the total authorization amount in terms of shares:\n\n1. Convert the total authorization amount ($2.25 billion) to the number of shares by dividing it by the average daily volume-weighted average share price of Humana common stock during the term of the agreement ($224.81):\n\n   Total shares authorized = Total authorization amount / Average share price\n   Total shares authorized = $2,250,000,000 / $224.81 ≈ 9,999,999 shares\n\n2. Now, add the shares repurchased under the February 2017 ASR and the additional shares repurchased in the open market to find the total number of shares repurchased:\n\n   Total shares repurchased = Shares repurchased under ASR + Additional shares repurchased\n   Total shares repurchased = 6,670,000 + 3,040,000 = 9,710,000 shares\n\n3. Finally, divide the total number of shares repurchased by the total number of shares authorized to find the percentage:\n\n   Percentage of common stock repurchased = (Total shares repurchased / Total shares authorized) * 100%\n   Percentage of common stock repurchased = (9,710,000 / 9,999,999) * 100% ≈ 97.1%\n\nSo, approximately 97.1% of the common stock was repurchased under the total program of repurchases."

primarily reflected lower interest expense related to financial instruments sold , but not yet purchased , at fair value and other interest-bearing liabilities , partially offset by higher interest expense related to long-term borrowings .see 201csupplemental financial information 2014 statistical disclosures 2014 distribution of assets , liabilities and shareholders 2019 equity 201d for further

    "pred_output": "To find the percentage of total shares purchased in October, we first need to find the total number of shares purchased in October and then divide it by the total number of shares purchased during the entire quarter.\n\nFrom the table, we can see that 379488 shares were purchased in October. The total number of shares purchased during the quarter is 3915795.\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage:\n\nPercentage of shares purchased in October = (Shares purchased in October / Total shares purchased during the quarter) * 100%\nPercentage of shares purchased in October = (379488 / 3915795) * 100%\n\nTo calculate the percentage, we can use a calculator or a financial calculator tool. The result is approximately 9.72%. So, about 9.72% of the total number of shares purchased were purchased in October."

    "pred_output": "To calculate the ROI (Return on Investment) for the Nasdaq Composite from 2008 to 2009, we first need to find the ending and beginning values of the investment, and then use the ROI formula.\n\nThe beginning value is given as 100 (on 12/29/2007), and the ending value is the value on 1/3/2009, which is 59.03 (according to the table).\n\nThe ROI formula is:\n\nROI = (Ending Value - Beginning Value) / Beginning Value\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nROI = (59.03 - 100) / 100\n\nROI = -0.4097 or -40.97%\n\nSo, the ROI of the Nasdaq Composite from 2008 to 2009 was approximately -40.97%. This means that for every $100 invested in the Nasdaq Composite from the end of 2007 to the beginning of 2009, the return was approximately -$40.97."

we test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review .while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists , the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis .the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value .if the carrying value exceeds the fair value , goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired .to determine the fair value of goodwill , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model , supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry .at december 31 , 2018 , the carrying value of our goodwill was $ 7.2 billion , which is related to ten reporting units , each of which consists of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics .the estimated fair value of each of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 , 2018 .to determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method .we concluded that the fair value of our non- amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value .these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows , which are subject to changes in business conditions , such as volumes and prices , costs to produce , discount rates and estimated capital needs .management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated , and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use .since the march 28 , 2008 , spin-off from altria group , inc. , we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets .marketing costs - we incur certain costs to support our products through programs that include advertising , marketing , consumer engagement and trade promotions .the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with u.s .gaap .recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program .for volume-based incentives provided to customers , management continually assesses and estimates , by customer , the likelihood of the customer's achieving the specified targets , and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made .for other trade promotions , management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience .changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position , results of operations or operating cash flows .employee benefit plans - as discussed in item 8 , note 13 .benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements , we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees , including pensions , postretirement health care and postemployment benefits ( primarily severance ) .we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by u.s .gaap .these calculations include various actuarial assumptions , such as discount rates , assumed rates of return on plan assets , compensation increases , mortality , turnover rates and health care cost trend rates .we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so .as permitted by u.s .gaap , any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods .we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries .weighted-average discount rate assumptions for pension and postretirement plan obligations at december 31 , 2018 and 2017 are as follows: .\n||2018|2017|\n|pension plans|1.61% ( 1.61 % )|1.51% ( 1.51 % )|\n|postretirement plans|3.97% ( 3.97 % )|3.79% ( 3.79 % )|\nwe anticipate that assumption changes will increase 2019 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense to approximately $ 205 million as compared with approximately $ 160 million in 2018 , excluding amounts related to employee severance and early retirement programs .the anticipated increase is primarily due to higher amortization out of other comprehensive earnings for unrecognized actuarial gains/ losses of $ 14 million , coupled with lower return on assets of $ 16 million , higher interest and service cost of $ 12 million and $ 4 million respectively , partially offset by other movements of $ 1 million .weighted-average expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amount of expense reported for the employee benefit plans .a fifty-basis-point decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2019 pension and postretirement expense by approximately $ 50 million , and a fifty-basis-point increase in our discount rate would decrease our 2019 pension and postretirement .\nQuestion: by what percentage will the 2019 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense be higher than that of 2018?\nAnswer:",

    "pred_output": "The 2019 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense is anticipated to be approximately 28.1% higher than that of 2018, excluding amounts related to employee severance and early retirement programs. This is calculated by taking the difference between the anticipated 2019 expense ($205 million) and the 2018 expense ($160 million), and dividing it by the 2018 expense. The calculation would be: (($205 million - $160 million) / $160 million) * 100%."
