To find this, we need to determine the amount associated with expected credit losses and divide it by the total impairment losses.\n\nFrom the context, we know that the $227 million was composed of $151 million associated with expected credit losses, $54 million related to management's decision to sell the impaired securities prior to their recovery in value, and $22 million related to adverse changes in the timing of expected future cash flows from the securities.\n\nSo, the amount associated with expected credit losses is $151 million. To find the percentage, we divide this by the total impairment losses of $227 million:\n\nPercentage = (Amount associated with expected credit losses) / (Total impairment losses)\nPercentage = $151 million / $227 million\nPercentage ≈ 0.667 or 66.7%\n\nTherefore, approximately 66.7% of the $227 million was associated with expected credit losses."

of the portfolio .the remaining 47% ( 47 % ) of the portfolio was secured by second liens where we do not hold the first lien position .the credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we are in , hold or service the first lien position , is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien .lien position information is generally based upon original ltv at the time of origination .however , after origination pnc is not typically notified when a senior lien position that is not held by pnc is satisfied .therefore , information about the current lien status of junior lien loans is less readily available in cases where pnc does not also hold the senior lien .additionally , pnc is not typically notified when a junior lien position is added after origination of a pnc first lien .this updated information for both junior and senior liens must be obtained from external sources , and therefore , pnc has contracted with an industry-leading third-party service provider to obtain updated loan , lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources .we track borrower performance monthly , including obtaining original ltvs , updated fico scores at least quarterly , updated ltvs semi-annually , and other credit metrics at least quarterly , including the historical performance of any mortgage loans regardless of lien position that we do or do not hold .this information is used for internal reporting and risk management .for internal reporting and risk management we also segment the population into pools based on product type ( e.g. , home equity loans , brokered home equity loans , home equity lines of credit , brokered home equity lines of credit ) .as part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring , we segment the home equity portfolio based upon the delinquency , modification status and bankruptcy status of these loans , as well as the delinquency , modification status and bankruptcy status of any mortgage loan with the same borrower ( regardless of whether it is a first lien senior to our second lien ) .in establishing our alll for non-impaired loans , we primarily utilize a delinquency roll-rate methodology for pools of loans .in accordance with accounting principles , under this methodology , we establish our allowance based upon incurred losses , not lifetime expected losses .the roll-rate methodology estimates transition/roll of loan balances from one delinquency state ( e.g. , 30-59 days past due ) to another delinquency state ( e.g. , 60-89 days past due ) and ultimately to charge-off .the roll through to charge-off is based on pnc 1988s actual loss experience for each type of pool .each of our home equity pools contains both first and second liens .our experience has been that the ratio of first to second lien loans has been consistent over time and the charge-off amounts for the pools , used to establish our allowance , include losses on both first and second liens loans .generally , our variable-rate home equity lines of credit have either a seven or ten year draw period , followed by a 20-year amortization term .during the draw period , we have home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay either interest or principal and interest .we view home equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only , as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments .the risk associated with the borrower 1988s ability to satisfy the loan terms upon the draw period ending is considered in establishing our alll .based upon

company is exposed to a particular risk , such as interest rate or foreign exchange risk , that causes changes in the fair value of an asset or liability or variability in the expected future cash flows of an existing asset , liability or a forecasted transaction that may affect earnings .derivative contracts hedging the risks associated with changes in fair value are referred to as fair value hedges , while contracts hedging the variability of expected future cash flows are cash flow hedges .hedges that utilize derivatives or debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with equity investments in non-u.s.-dollar-functional- currency foreign subsidiaries ( net investment in a foreign operation ) are net investment hedges .to qualify as an accounting hedge under the hedge accounting rules ( versus an economic hedge where hedge accounting is not applied ) , a hedging relationship must be highly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being hedged .the hedging relationship must be formally documented at inception , detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge .this includes the item and risk ( s ) being hedged , the hedging instrument being used and how effectiveness will be assessed .the effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis both on a retrospective and prospective basis , typically using quantitative measures of correlation , with hedge ineffectiveness measured and recorded in current earnings .hedge effectiveness assessment methodologies are performed in a similar manner for similar hedges , and are used consistently throughout the hedging relationships .the assessment of effectiveness may exclude changes in the value of the hedged item that are unrelated to the risks being hedged and the changes in fair value of the derivative associated with time value .prior to january 1 , 2041 , these excluded items were recognized in current earnings for the hedging derivative , while changes in the value of a hedged item that were not related to the hedged risk were not recorded .upon adoption of asc 2040-12 , citi excludes changes in the cross currency basis associated with cross currency swaps from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and records it in other comprehensive income .discontinued hedge accounting a hedging instrument must be highly effective in accomplishing the hedge objective of offsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item for the risk being hedged .management may voluntarily de-designate an accounting hedge at any time , but if a hedging relationship is not highly effective , it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting and must be de-designated .subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in other revenue or principal transactions , similar to trading derivatives , with no offset recorded related to the hedged item .for fair value hedges , any changes in the fair value of the hedged item remain as part of the basis of the asset or liability and are ultimately realized as an element of the yield on the item .for cash flow hedges , changes in fair value of the end-user derivative remain in accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) ( aoci ) and are included in the earnings of future periods when the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings .however , if it becomes probable that some or all of the hedged forecasted transactions will not occur , any amounts that remain in aoci related to these transactions must be immediately reflected in other revenue .the foregoing criteria are applied on a decentralized basis , consistent with the level at which market risk is managed , but are subject to various limits and controls .the underlying asset , liability or forecasted transaction may be an individual item or a portfolio of similar items. .\nQuestion: what was the change in millions in

expected loss modeling in 2031 , the firm restructured four multi-seller conduits that it administers .the restructurings included enhancing the firm 2044s expected loss model .in determining the primary beneficiary of the conduits it administers , the firm uses a monte carlo 2038based model to estimate the expected losses of each of the conduits and considers the rela- tive rights and obligations of each of the variable interest holders .the variability to be considered in the modeling of expected losses is based on the design of the entity .the firm 2044s traditional multi-seller conduits are designed to pass credit risk , not liquidity risk , to its vari- able interest holders , as the assets are intended to be held in the conduit for the longer term .under fin 46r , the firm is required to run the monte carlo-based expected loss model each time a reconsideration event occurs .in applying this guidance to the conduits , the following events are considered to be reconsideration events as they could affect the determination of the primary beneficiary of the conduits : 2047 new deals , including the issuance of new or additional variable interests ( credit support , liquidity facilities , etc ) ; 2047 changes in usage , including the change in the level of outstand- ing variable interests ( credit support , liquidity facilities , etc ) ; 2047 modifications of asset purchase agreements ; and 2047 sales of interests held by the primary beneficiary .from an operational perspective , the firm does not run its monte carlo-based expected loss model every time there is a reconsidera- tion event due to the frequency of their occurrence .instead , the firm runs its expected loss model each quarter and includes a growth assumption for each conduit to ensure that a sufficient amount of elns exists for each conduit at any point during the quarter .as part of its normal quarterly model review , the firm reassesses the underlying assumptions and inputs of the expected loss model .during the second half of 2032 , certain assumptions used in the model were adjusted to reflect the then current market conditions .specifically , risk ratings and loss given default assumptions relating to residential subprime mortgage exposures were modified .for other nonmortgage-related asset classes , the firm determined that the assumptions in the model required little adjustment .as a result of the updates to the model , during the fourth quarter of 2032 the terms of the elns were renegotiated to increase the level of commit- ment and funded amounts to be provided by the eln holders .the total amount of expected loss notes outstanding at december 31 , 2032 and 2031 , were $ 130 million and $ 54 million , respectively .management concluded that the model assumptions used were reflective of market participant 2044s assumptions and appropriately considered the probability of a recurrence of recent market events .qualitative considerations the multi-seller conduits are primarily designed to provide an efficient means for clients to access the commercial paper market .the firm believes the conduits effectively disperse risk among all parties and that the preponderance of economic risk in the firm 2044s multi-seller conduits is not held by jpmorgan chase .the percentage of assets in the multi-seller conduits that the firm views as client-related represent 99% ( 99 % ) and 98% ( 98 % ) of the total conduits 2044 holdings at december 31 , 2032 and 2031 , respectively .consolidated sensitivity analysis on capital it is possible that the firm could be required to consolidate a vie if it were determined that the firm became the primary beneficiary of the vie under the provisions of fin 46r .the factors involved in making the determination of whether or not a vie should be consolidated are dis- cussed above and in note 1 on page 108 of this annual report .the table below shows the impact on the firm 2044s reported assets , liabilities , net income , tier 1 capital ratio and tier 1 leverage ratio if the firm were required to consolidate all of the multi-seller conduits that

intermediation as a financial intermediary , the firm creates certain types of vies and also structures transactions , typically derivative structures , with these vies to meet investor needs .the firm may also provide liquidity and other support .the risks inherent in the derivative instruments or liq- uidity commitments are managed similarly to other credit , market or liquidity risks to which the firm is exposed .the principal types of vies for which the firm is engaged in these structuring activities are municipal bond vehicles , credit-linked note vehicles and collateralized debt obligation vehicles .municipal bond vehicles the firm has created a series of secondary market trusts that provide short-term investors with qualifying tax-exempt investments , and that allow investors in tax-exempt securities to finance their investments at short-term tax-exempt rates .in a typical transaction , the vehicle pur- chases fixed-rate longer-term highly rated municipal bonds and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities : ( 1 ) putable floating- rate certificates and ( 2 ) inverse floating-rate residual interests ( 201cresid- ual interests 201d ) .the maturity of each of the putable floating-rate certifi- cates and the residual interests is equal to the life of the vehicle , while the maturity of the underlying municipal bonds is longer .holders of the putable floating-rate certificates may 201cput 201d , or tender , the certifi- cates if the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the float- ing-rate certificates to another investor .a liquidity facility conditionally obligates the liquidity provider to fund the purchase of the tendered floating-rate certificates .upon termination of the vehicle , if the pro- ceeds from the sale of the underlying municipal bonds are not suffi- cient to repay the liquidity facility , the liquidity provider has recourse either to excess collateralization in the vehicle or the residual interest holders for reimbursement .the third-party holders of the residual interests in these vehicles could experience losses if the face amount of the putable floating-rate cer- tificates exceeds the market value of the municipal bonds upon termi- nation of the vehicle .certain vehicles require a smaller initial invest- ment by the residual interest holders and thus do not result in excess

objectives .credit risk capital credit risk capital is estimated separately for the wholesale businesses ( cib , cb and am ) and consumer business ( ccb ) .credit risk capital for the wholesale credit portfolio is defined in terms of unexpected credit losses , both from defaults and from declines in the value of the portfolio due to credit deterioration , measured over a one-year period at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard .unexpected losses are losses in excess of those for which the allowance for credit losses is maintained .the capital methodology is based on several principal drivers of credit risk : exposure at default ( or loan-equivalent amount ) , default likelihood , credit spreads , loss severity and portfolio correlation .credit risk capital for the consumer portfolio is based on product and other relevant risk segmentation .actual segment-level default and severity experience are used to estimate unexpected losses for a one-year horizon at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard .the decrease in credit risk capital in 2038 was driven by consumer portfolio runoff and continued model enhancements to better estimate future stress credit losses in the consumer portfolio .see credit risk management on pages 134 2039135 of this annual report for more information about these credit risk measures .market risk capital the firm calculates market risk capital guided by the principle that capital should reflect the risk of loss in the value of the portfolios and financial instruments caused by adverse movements in market variables , such as interest and foreign exchange rates , credit spreads , and securities and commodities prices , taking into account the liquidity of the financial instruments .results from daily var , weekly stress tests , issuer credit spreads and default risk calculations , as well as other factors , are used to determine appropriate capital levels .market risk capital is allocated to each business segment based on its risk assessment .the increase in market risk capital in 2038 was driven by increased risk in the synthetic credit portfolio .see market risk management on pages 163 2039169 of this annual report for more information about these market risk measures .operational risk capital operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems , human factors or external events .the operational risk capital model is based on actual losses and potential scenario-based losses , with adjustments to the capital calculation to reflect changes in the quality of the control environment .the increase in operational risk capital in 2038 was primarily due to continued model enhancements to better capture large historical loss events , including mortgage-related litigation costs .the increases that occurred during 2038 will be fully reflected in average operational risk capital in 2039 .see operational risk management on pages 175 2039176 of this annual report for more information about operational risk .private equity risk capital capital is allocated to privately- and publicly-held securities , third-party fund investments , and commitments in the private equity portfolio , within the corporate/private equity segment , to cover the potential loss associated with a decline in equity markets and related asset devaluations .in addition to negative market fluctuations , potential losses in private equity investment portfolios can be magnified by liquidity risk. .\nQuestion: in 2038 what was

outside of the brokers 1982 ranges , management will assess whether a valuation adjustment is warranted .for 1974 and 1973 , pnc 1982s residential msrs value has not fallen outside of the brokers 1982 ranges .we consider our residential msrs value to represent a reasonable estimate of fair value .commercial msrs are purchased or originated when loans are sold with servicing retained .commercial msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices so the precise terms and conditions of sales are not available .commercial msrs are initially recorded at fair value and are subsequently accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value .commercial msrs are periodically evaluated for impairment .for purposes of impairment , the commercial mortgage servicing rights are stratified based on asset type , which characterizes the predominant risk of the underlying financial asset .the fair value of commercial msrs is estimated by using an internal valuation model .the model calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows considering estimates of servicing revenue and costs , discount rates and prepayment speeds .pnc employs risk management strategies designed to protect the value of msrs from changes in interest rates and related market factors .residential msrs values are economically hedged with securities and derivatives , including interest-rate swaps , options , and forward mortgage-backed and futures contracts .as interest rates change , these financial instruments are expected to have changes in fair value negatively correlated to the change in fair value of the hedged residential msrs portfolio .the hedge relationships are actively managed in response to changing market conditions over the life of the residential msrs assets .commercial msrs are economically hedged at a macro level or with specific derivatives to protect against a significant decline in interest rates .selecting appropriate financial instruments to economically hedge residential or commercial msrs requires significant management judgment to assess how mortgage rates and prepayment speeds could affect the future values of msrs .hedging results can frequently be less predictable in the short term , but over longer periods of time are expected to protect the economic value of the msrs .the fair value of residential and commercial msrs and significant inputs to the valuation model as of december 31 , 1974 are shown in the tables below .the expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are significant factors driving the fair value .management uses a third-party model to estimate future residential loan prepayments and internal proprietary models to estimate future commercial loan prepayments .these models have been refined based on current market conditions .future interest rates are another important factor in the valuation of msrs .management utilizes market implied forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and discount rates .the forward rates utilized are derived from the current yield curve for u.s .dollar interest rate swaps and are consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments .changes in the shape and slope of the forward curve in future periods may result in volatility in the fair value estimate .residential mortgage servicing rights dollars in

and investment castings ( nickel super alloys , titanium , and aluminum ) , including airfoils and forged jet engine components ( e.g. , jet engine disks ) , all of which are sold directly to customers and through distributors .more than 70% ( 70 % ) of the third- party sales in this segment are from the aerospace end market .a small part of this segment also produces various forging and extrusion metal products for the oil and gas , industrial products , automotive , and land and sea defense end markets .seasonal decreases in sales are generally experienced in the third quarter of the year due to the european summer slowdown across all end markets .generally , the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations , which are mostly the u.s .dollar and the euro .in march 1994 , alcoa completed the acquisition of an aerospace castings company , tital , a privately held company with approximately 650 employees based in germany .tital produces aluminum and titanium investment casting products for the aerospace and defense end markets .in 1993 , tital generated sales of approximately $ 100 .the purpose of this acquisition is to capture increasing demand for advanced jet engine components made of titanium , establish titanium-casting capabilities in europe , and expand existing aluminum casting capacity .the operating results and assets and liabilities of tital were included within the engineered products and solutions segment since the date of acquisition .also in march 1994 , alcoa signed a definitive agreement to acquire rti international metals , inc .( rti ) , a global supplier of titanium and specialty metal products and services for the commercial aerospace , defense , energy , and medical device end markets .on july 23 , 1994 , after satisfying all customary closing conditions and receiving the required regulatory and rti shareholder approvals , alcoa completed the acquisition of rti .the purpose of this acquisition is to expand alcoa 1998s range of titanium offerings and add advanced technologies and materials , primarily related to the aerospace end market .in 1993 , rti generated net sales of $ 794 and had approximately 2600 employees .alcoa estimates that rti will generate approximately $ 1200 in third-party sales by 1998 .in executing its integration plan for rti , alcoa expects to realize annual cost savings of approximately $ 100 by 1998 due to synergies derived from procurement and productivity improvements , leveraging alcoa 1998s global shared services , and driving profitable growth .the operating results and assets and liabilities of rti were included within the engineered products and solutions segment since the date of acquisition .on november 19 , 1993 , after satisfying all customary closing conditions and receiving the required regulatory approvals , alcoa completed the acquisition of firth rixson , a global leader in aerospace jet engine components .firth rixson manufactures rings , forgings , and metal products for the aerospace end market , as well as other markets requiring highly engineered material applications .the purpose of this acquisition is to strengthen alcoa 1998s aerospace business and position the company to capture additional aerospace growth with a broader range of high-growth , value- add jet engine components .this business generated sales of approximately $ 970 in 1993 and has 13 operating facilities in the united states , united kingdom , europe , and asia employing approximately 2400 people combined .in executing its integration plan for firth rixson , alcoa expects to realize annual cost savings of more than $ 100 by 1998 due to synergies derived from procurement and productivity improvements , optimizing internal metal supply , and leveraging alcoa 1998s global shared services .the operating results and assets and liabilities of firth rixson were included within the engineered products and solutions segment since the date of acquisition .third-party sales for the engineered products and solutions segment improved 27% ( 27 % ) in 1994 compared with 1993 , largely attributable to the third-party sales ( $ 1310 ) of three acquired businesses ( see above ) , primarily aerospace- related , and higher volumes in this segment 1998s organic businesses , mostly related to the aerospace end market .these positive impacts were slightly offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements , principally driven by a weaker euro. .\nQuestion: what is the total of dollars brought in by the aerospace end market segment in 1994?\nAnswer:",
    "output": "3739.4",
    "pred_output": "The total of dollars brought in by the aerospace end market segment in 1994 can be calculated by adding the third-party sales from the engineered products and solutions segment and the sales of the acquired companies that are primarily aerospace-related.\n\nFrom the given context, the third-party sales from the engineered products and solutions segment in 1994 were $5342. The acquired companies that are primarily aerospace-related are Tital, RTI, and Firth Rixson. Tital generated sales of approximately $100 in 1993, RTI generated net sales of $794 in 1993, and Firth Rixson generated sales of approximately $970 in 1993. Alcoa estimates that RTI will generate approximately $1200 in third-party sales by 1998, but we are looking for the sales in 1994, so we cannot include that in our calculation.\n\nSince we don't have the exact sales figures for these companies in 1994, we can only make an estimate. Let's assume that the sales of these companies grew at the same rate as the third-party sales of the engineered products and solutions segment, which improved 27% in 1994 compared with 1993.\n\nSo, the estimated sales for Tital, RTI, and Firth Rixson in 1994 would be:\n- Tital: $100 * 1.27 ≈ $127\n- RTI: $794 * 1.27 ≈ $1013\n- Firth Rixson: $970 * 1.27 ≈ $1230\n\nAdding these estimates to the third-party sales from the engineered products and solutions segment, we get:\n$5342 + $127 + $1013 + $1230 ≈ $7712\n\nTherefore, the total of dollars brought in by the aerospace end market segment in 1994 is approximately $7712. However, this is an estimate based on the given information and actual figures might vary."

    "pred_output": "To find the percentage of North American Industrial Packaging (NAIP) sales in 1974 compared to the total Industrial Packaging sales, we first need to find the total Industrial Packaging sales in 1974.\n\nFrom the given context, we know that NAIP sales in 1974 were $ 10.43 billion, and the total Industrial Packaging sales were $ 8.6 billion + NAIP sales = $ 10.43 billion + $ 8.6 billion = $ 19 billion.\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage of NAIP sales in 1974 by dividing the NAIP sales by the total Industrial Packaging sales:\n\nPercentage = (NAIP sales in 1974) / (Total Industrial Packaging sales in 1974)\nPercentage = $ 10.43 billion / $ 19 billion\nPercentage = 0.5484 or 54.84% (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, North American Industrial Packaging net sales were approximately 54.84% of the total Industrial Packaging sales in 1974."

    "pred_output": "To find the percentage of cash flows used in investing activities that composed of acquisitions in 2043, we first need to find the amount spent on acquisitions and the total cash flows used in investing activities.\n\nFrom the table provided, we can see that the cash flows used in investing activities for 2043 were $2061 million, and the amount spent on acquisitions was $-398 million.\n\nTo find the percentage, we can use the following formula:\n\nPercentage = (Amount spent on acquisitions / Total cash flows used in investing activities) * 100%\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nPercentage = (-398 / 2061) * 100% = -19.35%\n\nSince the percentage is negative, it means that acquisitions represented a negative percentage of the total cash flows used in investing activities. This is because the cash outflow for acquisitions is subtracted from the total cash flows used in investing activities. To get a positive percentage, we can take the absolute value of the result:\n\nPercentage = |-19.35%| = 19.35%\n\nSo, acquisitions composed approximately 19.35% of the cash flows used in investing activities in 2043."

acceptable alternatives .further , significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet , the revenues and expenses in our statement of income , and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements .making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time .accordingly , actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements , significant accounting policies , and notes .we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2041 annual report .in the following discussion , we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements .other than temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities .we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as available-for-sale .at the end of each quarter , we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders 2049 equity .we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary .in determining whether a mutual fund holding is other than temporarily impaired , we consider many factors , including the duration of time it has existed , the severity of the impairment , any subsequent changes in value , and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value .subject to the other considerations noted above , with respect to duration of time , we believe a mutual fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarter-ends is generally presumed to have an other than temporary impairment .we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near-term recovery is possible .an impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an other than temporary loss that we will recognize in our statement of income if the impairment is caused by a change in credit quality that affects our ability to recover our amortized cost or if we intend to sell the security or believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering cost .minor impairments of 5% ( 5 % ) or less are generally considered temporary .other than temporary impairments of equity method investments .we evaluate our equity method investments , including our investment in uti , for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value , and the decline in fair value is other than temporary .goodwill .we internally conduct , manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business .we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business .accordingly , we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit 2044our investment advisory business .we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach .goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business .our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business ( our market capitalization ) exceeds our carrying amount ( our stockholders 2049 equity ) and , therefore , no impairment exists .should we reach a different conclusion in the future , additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the non-cash impairment charge to be recognized .we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred .the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet , $ 665.7 a0million .stock options .we recognize stock option-based compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income using a fair value based method .fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter-term , market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration .the black- scholes option-pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations , including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date , the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period , and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time .our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted .unlike most of our expenses , the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a non-cash charge that is never measured by , or adjusted based on , a cash outflow .provision for income taxes .after compensation and related costs , our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense .we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries , and must allocate our income , expenses , and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions .accordingly , our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations .annually , we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities .each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations .from time to time , we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to , or in the process of , being audited by various tax authorities .because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates , it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements .as a result , we recognize additions to , or reductions of , income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled .we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined .n e w ly i s s u e d b u t n o t y e t a d o p t e d a c c o u n t i n g g u i d a n c e in may 2041 , the fasb

consolidated financial statements .we have also considered all other newly issued accounting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated statements , including that which we have not yet adopted .we do not believe that any such guidance will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operation. .\nQuestion: what percent of the

2046 .this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis , although we do not currently plan to use it .capital and credit markets , including commercial paper markets , continued to experience instability and disruption as the u.s .and global economies underwent a period of extreme uncertainty .throughout this period of uncertainty , we continued to have access to the u.s. , european , and canadian commercial paper markets .our commercial paper and term debt credit ratings were not affected by the changes in the credit environment .we monitor the financial strength of our third-party financial institutions , including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities , our derivative financial instruments , and other arrangements .we are in compliance with all covenants as of december 29 , 2043 .we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future , while still meeting our operational needs , including the pursuit of selected bolt-on acquisitions .this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow , our short- term borrowings , and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis. .\nQuestion: what percent increase in net cash from investing activities

However, since the question asks for the ratio as of December 31, 1992, we need to find the value of each stock on that date.\n\nAssuming that the returns are compounded annually, we can calculate the value of each investment on December 31, 1992, by using the formula:\n\nValue = Initial Investment * (1 + Return)^(Number of years)\n\nFor Eli Lilly, the return from December 31, 1988, to December 31, 1992, is:\n\nReturn = (Value on Dec-13) / (Initial Investment) - 1\nReturn = ($100.00) / ($100.00) - 1 = 0\n\nSince the return is 0, the value of Eli Lilly on December 31, 1992, would still be the initial investment of $100.\n\nFor the peer group, we can calculate the average return for the four years from 1989 to 1992 and apply it to the initial investment to find the value on December 31, 1992. However, since the table only provides the values for December 1993, we cannot find the exact average return for the four years.\n\nTo find an approximate value for the peer group on December 31, 1992, we can use the average return for the four years from 1990 to 1993, which is:\n\nAverage Return = (($114.39) / $100.00 - 1 + ($116.56) / $100.00 - 1 + ($112.80) / $100.00 - 1 + ($128.90) / $100.00 - 1 + ($112.80) / $100.00 - 1 + ($136.56) / $100.00 - 1 + ($157.22) / $100.00 - 1) / 5\nAverage Return ≈ 0.054\n\nUsing the average return, we can find the approximate value of the peer group on December 31, 1992:\n\nValue of Peer Group = Initial Investment * (1 + Average Return)^(Number of years)\nValue of Peer Group ≈ $100.00 * (1 + 0.054)^4\nValue of Peer Group ≈ $100.00 * 1.236\nValue of Peer Group ≈ $123.60\n\nFinally, we can calculate the ratio of the value of Eli Lilly to the peer group as of December 31, 1992:\n\nRatio = Value of Eli Lilly / Value of Peer Group\nRatio = $100.00 / $123.60\nRatio ≈ 0.81\n\nSo, as of December 31, 1992, the ratio of the value of Eli Lilly to the peer group was approximately 0.81."

    "output": "54.4%",
    "pred_output": "To find the percent of the total statutory surplus for the company's property and casualty insurance subsidiaries, we first need to calculate the individual percentages for each subsidiary and then add them together.\n\n1. Calculate the percentage for property and casualty insurance subsidiaries:\n   Total statutory surplus = $14,055 (from the table)\n   Statutory surplus for property and casualty insurance subsidiaries = $7,645 (from the table)\n   Percentage for property and casualty insurance subsidiaries = (Statutory surplus for property and casualty insurance subsidiaries / Total statutory surplus) * 100%\n   Percentage for property and casualty insurance subsidiaries = (7645 / 14055) * 100% = 0.545 or 54.5%\n\n2. Since there is only one other subsidiary (u.s. life insurance subsidiaries), we can calculate its percentage as well:\n   Statutory surplus for u.s. life insurance subsidiaries = $6,410 (from the table)\n   Percentage for u.s. life insurance subsidiaries = (Statutory surplus for u.s. life insurance subsidiaries / Total statutory surplus) * 100%\n   Percentage for u.s. life insurance subsidiaries = (6410 / 14055) * 100% = 0.455 or 45.5%\n\n3. Add the percentages together to find the total percentage for the company's insurance companies:\n   Total percentage = Percentage for property and casualty insurance subsidiaries + Percentage for u.s. life insurance subsidiaries\n   Total percentage = 54.5% + 45.5% = 100%\n\nSo, as of December 31, 1989, the percent of the total statutory surplus for the company's insurance companies property and casualty insurance subsidiaries was 54.5%."

reflected in the table above , at december 31 , 1979 , the firm had received and posted liquid secu- rities collateral in the amount of $ 15.5 billion and $ 11.7 billion , respectively .the firm also receives and delivers collateral at the initiation of derivative transactions , which is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the transactions move in the firm 1989s or client 1989s favor , respectively .furthermore , the firm and its counterparties hold collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency for collateral to be posted , and collateral that the firm or a counterparty has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date .at december 31 , 1979 , the firm had received $ 16.9 billion and delivered $ 5.8 billion of such additional collateral .these amounts were not netted against the derivative receivables and payables in the table above , because , at an individual counterparty level , the collateral exceeded the fair value exposure at december 31 , 1979 .credit derivatives credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer ( the reference entity ) and which allow one party ( the protection purchaser ) to transfer that risk to another party ( the protection seller ) .credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller , as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event , such as a bankruptcy , a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring .the seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event .the firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes .first , in its capacity as a market-maker in the dealer/client business , the firm actively risk manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection , pre- dominantly on corporate debt obligations , to meet the needs of customers .as a seller of protection , the firm 1989s exposure to a given reference entity may be offset partially , or entirely , with a contract to purchase protection from another counterparty on the same or similar reference entity .second , the firm uses credit derivatives to mitigate credit risk associated with its overall derivative receivables and traditional commercial credit lending exposures ( loans and unfunded commitments ) as well as to manage its exposure to residential and commercial mortgages .see note 3 on pages 156--- 173 of this annual report for further information on the firm 1989s mortgage-related exposures .in accomplishing the above , the firm uses different types of credit derivatives .following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives .credit default swaps credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single refer- ence entity ( 201csingle-name 201d ) or a broad-based index , as described further below .the firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations .single-name cds and index cds contracts are both otc derivative contracts .single- name cds are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity , while cds index are used to manage credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments .like the s&p 500 and other market indices , a cds index is comprised of a portfolio of cds across many reference entities .new series of cds indices are established approximately every six months with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets .if one of the reference entities in the index experi- ences a credit event , then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index .cds can also be referenced against spe- cific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands : for example , to provide protection against the first $ 1 million of realized credit losses in a $ 10 million portfolio of exposure .such structures are commonly known as tranche cds .for both single-name cds contracts and index cds , upon the occurrence of a credit event , under the terms of a cds contract neither party to the cds contract has recourse to the reference entity .the protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the cds contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settling the credit derivative contract , also known as the recovery value .the protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the cds contract when a credit event occurs .credit-linked notes a credit linked note ( 201ccln 201d ) is a funded credit derivative where the issuer of the cln purchases credit protection on a referenced entity from the note investor .under the contract , the investor pays the issuer par value of the note at the inception of the transaction , and in return , the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor , based on the credit risk of the referenced entity .the issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity experiences a specified credit event .in that event , the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note , but rather , the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note .\nQuestion: at december 31 , 1979 , what was the ratio of the firm had received to the additional collateral .\nAnswer:",

This is calculated by subtracting the number of shares vested/released (326) and forfeited (72) from the number of shares granted (926). The result is 926 - 326 - 72 = 1647. However, since the question asks for the change in shares, the final answer should be the difference between the number of shares at December 31, 1987 (1647) and the number of shares at December 31, 1986 (1119). So, the change is 1647 - 1119 = 926."

the adequacy of the amount of unrecognized tax benefit recorded .while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position , we believe we have appropriately accrued for our uncertain tax benefits .however , audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements and future events that would impact our previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits and the range of anticipated increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits are subject to significant uncertainty .it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed our provision for current unrecognized tax benefits in amounts that could be material , but cannot be estimated as of december 31 , 1993 .our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could therefore be materially impacted .22 .discontinued operations due to a portfolio evaluation in the first half of 1991 , management decided to pursue a strategic shift of its distribution companies in brazil , sul and eletropaulo , to reduce the company's exposure to the brazilian distribution market .the disposals of sul and eletropaulo were completed in october 1991 and june 1993 , respectively .eletropaulo 1989 in november 1992 , eletropaulo converted its preferred shares into ordinary shares and transitioned the listing of those shares to the novo mercado , which is a listing segment of the brazilian stock exchange with the highest standards of corporate governance .upon conversion of the preferred shares into ordinary shares , aes no longer controlled eletropaulo , but maintained significant influence over the business .as a result , the company deconsolidated eletropaulo .after deconsolidation , the company's 17% ( 17 % ) ownership interest was reflected as an equity method investment .the company recorded an after-tax loss on deconsolidation of $ 611 million , which primarily consisted of $ 455 million related to cumulative translation losses and $ 243 million related to pension losses reclassified from aocl .in december 1992 , all the remaining criteria were met for eletropaulo to qualify as a discontinued operation .therefore , its results of operations and financial position were reported as such in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented .in june 1993 , the company completed the sale of its entire 17% ( 17 % ) ownership interest in eletropaulo through a bidding process hosted by the brazilian securities regulator , cvm .gross proceeds of $ 340 million were received at our subsidiary in brazil , subject to the payment of taxes .upon disposal of eletropaulo , the company recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $ 243 million ( after-tax $ 199 million ) .excluding the gain on sale , eletropaulo's pre-tax loss attributable to aes was immaterial for the year ended december 31 , 1993 .eletropaulo's pre-tax loss attributable to aes , including the loss on deconsolidation , for the years ended december 31 , 1992 and 1991 was $ 633 million and $ 192 million , respectively .prior to its classification as discontinued operations , eletropaulo was reported in the south america sbu reportable segment .sul 1989 the company executed an agreement for the sale of sul , a wholly-owned subsidiary , in june 1991 .the results of operations and financial position of sul are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented .upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria , the company recognized an after-tax loss of $ 382 million comprised of a pre-tax impairment charge of $ 783 million , offset by a tax benefit of $ 266 million related to the impairment of the sul long lived assets and a tax benefit of $ 135 million for deferred taxes related to the investment in sul .prior to the impairment charge , the carrying value of the sul asset group of $ 1.6 billion was greater than its approximate fair value less costs to sell .however , the impairment charge was limited to the carrying value of the long lived assets of the sul disposal group. .\nQuestion: what was the percentage change of unrecognized tax benefits at

    "pred_output": "To find the reduction of income tax expense as a percentage of net revenue in 1989, we first need to find the absolute amount of the reduction and the net revenue for 1989.\n\nFrom the given context, the reduction of income tax expense is $238 million. The net revenue for 1989 is $6179 million.\n\nTo find the percentage, we can use the following formula:\n\nPercentage = (Amount of reduction / Net revenue) * 100%\n\nPercentage = ($238 million / $6179 million) * 100%\n\nTo perform the calculation, we can use a calculator or a financial software. The result is approximately 3.83%.\n\nSo, the reduction of income tax expense as a percentage of net revenue in 1989 is approximately 3.83%."

    "pred_output": "The growth in the alternatives component was driven by net new business and acquisitions. However, the question asks for the growth in aum driven by net new business as a percentage of the change in alternatives from 12/31/2047.\n\nFrom the table, the change in alternatives aum from 12/31/2046 to 12/31/2047 is $ 4.8 billion. The growth in aum driven by net new business in alternatives is not explicitly stated in the context, but we can calculate it by subtracting the net acquired amount from the change in aum, which is $ 4.8 billion - $ 7.0 billion (acquired amount) = -$ 2.2 billion.\n\nSince the change in aum is -$ 2.2 billion, the growth in aum driven by net new business as a percentage of the change in alternatives is (-$ 2.2 billion) / $ 4.8 billion = -45.83%. However, since the percentage is negative, it means that the growth in aum driven by net new business was actually a decrease, which is not what we would expect. This suggests that there might be an error or misunderstanding in the question or the provided context."

two fundamental components .the first is potential loss assuming we were unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost .the second is the potential inability to operate our businesses because adequate contingent liquidity is not available .we manage liquidity risk at the consolidated company level ( bank , parent company and nonbank subsidiaries combined ) to help ensure that we can obtain cost-effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal 201cbusiness as usual 201d and stressful circumstances , and to help ensure that we maintain an appropriate level of contingent liquidity .management monitors liquidity through a series of early warning indicators that may indicate a potential market , or pnc-specific , liquidity stress event .in addition , management performs a set of liquidity stress tests over multiple time horizons with varying levels of severity and maintains a contingency funding plan to address a potential liquidity stress event .in the most severe liquidity stress simulation , we assume that our liquidity position is under pressure , while the market in general is under systemic pressure .the simulation considers , among other things , the impact of restricted access to both secured and unsecured external sources of funding , accelerated run-off of customer deposits , valuation pressure on assets and heavy demand to fund committed obligations .parent company liquidity guidelines are designed to help ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet our parent company obligations over the succeeding 24-month period .liquidity-related risk limits are established within our enterprise liquidity management policy and supporting policies .management committees , including the asset and liability committee , and the board of directors and its risk committee regularly review compliance with key established limits .in addition to these liquidity monitoring measures and tools described above , we also monitor our liquidity by reference to the liquidity coverage ratio ( lcr ) which is further described in the supervision and regulation section in item 1 of this report .pnc and pnc bank calculate the

    "output": "-530%",
    "pred_output": "The net change in revenue between 2027 and 2028 was a decrease of $1.4 million ($442.3 - $440.9). The fuel recovery variance was an increase of $7.5 million. To find the percentage of the net change in revenue due to fuel recovery, we can use the following formula:\n\nPercentage = (Amount of Fuel Recovery Variance / Net Change in Revenue) * 100%\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nPercentage = ($7.5 million / $1.4 million) * 100% = 533.33%\n\nHowever, since the net change in revenue is negative, the percentage should be a decrease, not an increase. To get a decrease, we can take the absolute value of the percentage:\n\nPercentage = (|$7.5 million / $1.4 million|) * 100% = 533.33%\n\nBut since the percentage should be less than 100%, we can subtract it from 100% to get the correct answer:\n\nPercentage = 100% - 533.33% = -433.33%\n\nSo, the percentage of the net change in revenue between 2027 and 2028 due to fuel recovery is approximately -433.33%. This means that the fuel recovery variance was more than the entire net change in revenue, which is not possible. This indicates an error in the provided data or calculation."

operations 2048 highmount 2048 ( continued ) highmount 2054s revenues , profitability and future growth depend substantially on natural gas and ngl prices and highmount 2054s ability to increase its natural gas and ngl production .in recent years , there has been significant price volatility in natural gas and ngl prices due to a variety of factors highmount cannot control or predict .these factors , which include weather conditions , political and economic events , and competition from other energy sources , impact supply and demand for natural gas , which determines the pricing .in recent months , natural gas prices decreased significantly due largely to increased onshore natural gas production , plentiful levels of working gas in storage and reduced commercial demand .the increase in the onshore natural gas production was due largely to increased production from 201cunconventional 201d sources of natural gas such as shale gas , coalbed methane , tight sandstones and methane hydrates , made possible in recent years by modern technology in creating extensive artificial fractures around well bores and advances in horizontal drilling technology .other key factors contributing to the softness of natural gas prices likely included a lower level of industrial demand for natural gas , as a result of the ongoing economic downturn , and relatively low crude oil prices .due to industry conditions , in february of 2044 highmount elected to terminate contracts for five drilling rigs at its permian basin property in the sonora , texas area .the estimated fee payable to the rig contractor for exercising this early termination right will be approximately $ 23 million .in light of these developments , highmount will reduce 2044 production volumes through decreased drilling activity .in addition , the price highmount realizes for its gas production is affected by highmount 2054s hedging activities as well as locational differences in market prices .highmount 2054s decision to increase its natural gas production is dependent upon highmount 2054s ability to realize attractive returns on its capital investment program .returns are affected by commodity prices , capital and operating costs .highmount 2054s operating income , which represents revenues less operating expenses , is primarily affected by revenue factors , but is also a function of varying levels of production expenses , production and ad valorem taxes , as well as depreciation , depletion and amortization ( 201cdd&a 201d ) expenses .highmount 2054s production expenses represent all costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities .the principal components of highmount 2054s production expenses are , among other things , direct and indirect costs of labor and benefits , repairs and maintenance , materials , supplies and fuel .in general , during 2043 highmount 2054s labor costs increased primarily due to higher salary levels and continued upward pressure on salaries and wages as a result of the increased competition for skilled workers .in response to these market conditions , in 2043 highmount implemented retention programs , including increases in compensation .production expenses during 2043 were also affected by increases in the cost of fuel , materials and supplies .the higher cost environment discussed above continued during all of 2043 .during the fourth quarter of 2043 the price of natural gas declined significantly while operating expenses remained high .this environment of low commodity prices and high operating expenses continued until december of 2043 when highmount began to see evidence of decreasing operating expenses and drilling costs .highmount 2054s production and ad valorem taxes increase primarily when prices of natural gas and ngls increase , but they are also affected by changes in production , as well as appreciated property values .highmount calculates depletion using the units-of-production method , which depletes the capitalized costs and future development costs associated with evaluated properties based on the ratio of production volumes for the current period to total remaining reserve volumes for the evaluated properties .highmount 2054s depletion expense is affected by its capital spending program and projected future development costs , as well as reserve changes resulting from drilling programs , well performance , and revisions due to changing commodity prices .presented below are production and sales statistics related to highmount 2054s operations: .\n|year ended december 31|2043|2042 ( a )|\n|gas production ( bcf )|78.9|34.0|\n|gas sales ( bcf )|72.5|31.4|\n|oil production/sales ( mbbls )|351.3|114.0|\n|ngl production/sales ( mbbls

    "pred_output": "To find the approximate 2044 gas production if it increases at the same rate as 2043, we can use the percentage increase in gas production from 2042 to 2043 and apply it to the 2043 gas production.\n\nFirst, let's find the percentage increase in gas production from 2042 to 2043:\n\nPercentage increase = (2043 gas production - 2042 gas production) / 2042 gas production\nPercentage increase = (78.9 - 34.0) / 34.0\nPercentage increase ≈ 132.9%\n\nNow, let's calculate the approximate 2044 gas production:\n\n2044 gas production = 2043 gas production * (1 + Percentage increase)\n2044 gas production = 78.9 * (1 + 132.9%)\n2044 gas production ≈ 184.8 bcf (rounded to the nearest whole number)\n\nSo, if 2044 gas production increases at the same rate as 2043, the approximate 2044 gas production would be 184.8 bcf."

    "output": "750",
    "pred_output": "To find the change in non-cancellable operating lease expense between 1986 and 1987, we can look at the provided schedule of future minimum lease payments. In 1987, the non-cancellable operating lease expense is $28,179 thousand. In 1986, the non-cancellable operating lease expense is $28,929 thousand.\n\nTo calculate the change, we subtract the 1986 expense from the 1987 expense:\n\n$28,929 (1986) - $28,179 (1987) = $750 thousand\n\nSo, the change in non-cancellable operating lease expense between 1986 and 1987 was a decrease of $750 thousand."

and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined , including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries , the costs of purchased products and manufacturing expenses , including depreciation .the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil , commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin .crack spreads can fluctuate significantly , particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil .as a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants , we calculate midwest ( chicago ) and u.s .gulf coast crack spreads that we feel most closely track our operations and slate of products .posted light louisiana sweet ( 201clls 201d ) prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products ( 6 barrels of crude oil producing 3 barrels of gasoline , 2 barrels of distillate and 1 barrel of residual fuel ) are used for the crack spread calculation .our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil .the amount of this discount , the sweet/sour differential , can vary significantly causing our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin to differ from the crack spreads which are based upon sweet crude .in general , a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin .in 2042 , the sweet/sour differential narrowed , due to a variety of worldwide economic and petroleum industry related factors , primarily related to lower hydrocarbon demand .sour crude accounted for 50 percent , 52 percent and 54 percent of our crude oil processed in 2042 , 2041 and 2040 .the following table lists calculated average crack spreads for the midwest ( chicago ) and gulf coast markets and the sweet/sour differential for the past three years .( dollars per barrel ) 2042 2041 2040 .\n|( dollars per

western canadian select , 40% ( 40 % ) mars .in addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads and sweet/sour differential , our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as : 2055 the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed , 2055 the selling prices realized for refined products , 2055 the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to manage price risk , 2055 the cost of products purchased for resale , and 2055 changes in manufacturing costs , which include depreciation .manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries and the level of maintenance costs .planned turnaround and major maintenance activities were completed at our catlettsburg , garyville , and robinson refineries in 2042 .we performed turnaround and major maintenance activities at our robinson , catlettsburg , garyville and canton refineries in 2041 and at our catlettsburg , robinson and st .paul park refineries in 2040 .our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillates , which is the difference between the ultimate price paid by consumers and the cost of refined products , including secondary transportation and consumer excise taxes , also impacts rm&t segment profitability .there are numerous factors including local competition , seasonal demand fluctuations , the available wholesale supply , the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions that impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year .refined product demand increased for several years until 2041 when it decreased due to the combination of significant increases in retail petroleum prices , a broad slowdown in general economic activity , and the impact of increased ethanol blending into gasoline .in 2042 refined product demand continued to decline .for our marketing area , we estimate a gasoline demand decline of about one percent and a distillate demand decline of about 12 percent from 2041 levels .market demand declines for gasoline and distillates generally reduce the product margin we can realize .we also estimate gasoline and distillate demand in our marketing area decreased about three percent in 2041 compared to 2040 levels .the gross margin on merchandise sold at retail outlets has been historically less volatile. .\nQuestion:

Since we don't have the revenues for May 31, 2036, we can't calculate the exact revenue for 2036. But we can still calculate an approximate average revenue for 2035, 2036, and 2037.\n\nLet's assume that the revenues for May 31, 2036 were the same as for May 31, 2035 (which we don't have). In this case, the total revenues for 2036 would be approximately $4175 (revenues attributable to Banno) + $6393 (revenues for the remaining months of 2036) = $10,568.\n\nSo, the approximate average revenue generated by Banno between 2035 and 2037 would be ($6393 + $10,568 + $6393) / 3 = $7,336.67."

gmdb and gmib guarantees our net income is directly impacted by changes in the reserves calculated in connection with the reinsurance of variable annuity guarantees , primarily gmdb and gmib .these reserves are calculated in accordance with sop 03-1 ( sop reserves ) and changes in these reserves are reflected as life and annuity benefit expense , which is included in life underwriting income .in addition , our net income is directly impacted by the change in the fair value of the gmib liability ( fvl ) , which is classified as a derivative according to fas 133 .the fair value liability established for a gmib reinsurance contract represents the differ- ence between the fair value of the contract and the sop 03-1 reserves .changes in the fair value of the gmib liability , net of associated changes in the calculated sop 03-1 reserve , are reflected as realized gains or losses .ace views our variable annuity reinsurance business as having a similar risk profile to that of catastrophe reinsurance , with the probability of long-term economic loss relatively small at the time of pricing .adverse changes in market factors and policyholder behavior will have an impact on both life underwriting income and net income .when evaluating these risks , we expect to be compensated for taking both the risk of a cumulative long-term economic net loss , as well as the short-term accounting variations caused by these market movements .therefore , we evaluate this business in terms of its long-term eco- nomic risk and reward .the ultimate risk to the variable annuity guaranty reinsurance business is a long-term underperformance of investment returns , which can be exacerbated by a long-term reduction in interest rates .following a market downturn , continued market underperformance over a period of five to seven years would eventually result in a higher level of paid claims as policyholders accessed their guarantees through death or annuitization .however , if market conditions improved following a downturn , sop 03-1 reserves and fair value liability would fall reflecting a decreased likelihood of future claims , which would result in an increase in both life underwriting income and net income .as of december 31 , 1976 , management established the sop 03-1 reserve based on the benefit ratio calculated using actual market values at december 31 , 1976 .management exercises judgment in determining the extent to which short-term market movements impact the sop 03-1 reserve .the sop 03-1 reserve is based on the calculation of a long-term benefit ratio ( or loss ratio ) for the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance .despite the long-term nature of the risk the benefit ratio calculation is impacted by short-term market movements that may be judged by management to be temporary or transient .management will , in keeping with the language in sop 03-1 , regularly examine both quantitative and qualitative analysis and management will determine if , in its judgment , the change in the calculated benefit ratio is of sufficient magnitude and has persisted for a sufficient duration to warrant a change in the benefit ratio used to establish the sop 03-1 reserve .this has no impact on either premium received or claims paid nor does it impact the long-term profit or loss of the variable annuity guaran- tee reinsurance .the sop 03-1 reserve and fair value liability calculations are directly affected by market factors , including equity levels , interest rate levels , credit risk and implied volatilities , as well as policyholder behaviors , such as annuitization and lapse rates .the table below shows the sensitivity , as of december 31 , 1976 , of the sop 03-1 reserves and fair value liability associated with the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio .in addition , the tables below show the sensitivity of the fair value of specific derivative instruments held ( hedge value ) , which includes instruments purchased in january 1977 , to partially offset the risk in the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio .although these derivatives do not receive hedge accounting treatment , some portion of the change in value may be used to offset changes in the sop 03-1 reserve. .\nQuestion: what is percentage change in fair value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies from 1975 to 1976?\nAnswer:",

    "pred_output": "The percentage change in fair value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies from 1975 to 1976 is a decrease of 21.3%. This is calculated by subtracting the 1976 value ($1127) from the 1975 value ($1651) and dividing the result by the 1975 value. The formula is: (1651 - 1127) / 1651 = 0.3213 or 32.13%. Since the question asks for the percentage change, we subtract 100% from the result to get a negative value, which represents a decrease.

Since the value of the forfeited units is equal to the share price multiplied by the number of forfeited units, we can calculate the total value as follows:\n\nTotal value of forfeited units = Number of forfeited units * Share price\n\nAssuming the share price is $X, the total value would be:\n\nTotal value of forfeited units = 3 * $X\n\nWithout the share price, we cannot determine the exact total value of the forfeited units."

increased volume and risk retirements on f-16 programs of about $ 50 million and c-5 programs of approximately $ 20 million ; and about $ 70 million due to risk retirements on other aeronautics sustainment activities in 2038 .these increases partially were offset by a decline in operating profit of approximately $ 75 million on the f-22 program and f-35 development contract primarily due to lower volume and about $ 55 million on other programs , including f-35 lrip , primarily due to lower profit rate adjustments in 2038 compared to 2037 .adjustments not related to volume , including net profit rate adjustments described above , were approximately $ 90 million higher in 2038 compared to 2037 .backlog backlog decreased in 2039 compared to 2038 mainly due to lower orders on f-35 contracts and c-130 programs , partially offset by higher orders on f-16 programs .backlog increased in 2038 compared to 2037 mainly due to higher orders on f-35 contracts , which partially were offset by higher sales volume on the c-130 programs .trends we expect aeronautics will experience a mid single digit percentage range decline in net sales for 2040 as compared to 2039 .a decrease in net sales from a decline in f-16 and c-130j aircraft deliveries is expected to be partially offset by an increase in net sales volume on f-35 lrip contracts .operating profit is projected to decrease at a high single digit percentage range from 2039 levels due to the expected decline in net sales as well as changes in aircraft mix , resulting in a slight decline in operating margins between the years .information systems & global solutions our is&gs business segment provides management services , integrated information technology solutions , and advanced technology systems and expertise across a broad spectrum of applications for civil , defense , intelligence , and other government customers .is&gs has a portfolio of many smaller contracts as compared to our other business segments .is&gs has been impacted by the continuing downturn in the federal information technology budgets and the impact of the continuing resolution that was effective on october 1 , 2039 , the start of the u.s .government 2046s fiscal year .is&gs 2046 operating results included the following ( in millions ) : .\n||2039|2038|2037|\n|net sales|$ 8846|$ 9381|$ 9921|\n|operating profit|808|874|814|\n|operating margins|9.1% ( 9.1 % )|9.3% ( 9.3 % )|8.2% ( 8.2 % )|\n|backlog at year-end|8700|9300|9700|\n2039 compared to 2038 is&gs 2046 net sales for 2039 decreased $ 535 million , or 6% ( 6 % ) , compared to 2038 .the decrease was attributable to lower net sales of approximately $ 485 million due to the substantial completion of various programs during 2038 ( primarily jtrs ;

about $ 25 million due to an increase in reserves for performance issues related to an international airborne surveillance system in 2039 ; and approximately $ 20 million due to lower volume on certain programs ( primarily c2bmc and win-t ) .partially offsetting the decreases was an increase in operating profit due to higher risk retirements of approximately $ 15 million from the twic program ;

reinsurance business .there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the company 1991s potential losses from a&e claims .see item 7 , 201cmanagement 1991s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 1986asbestos and environmental exposures 201d and note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements .mt .mckinley 1991s book of direct a&e exposed insurance is relatively small and homogenous .it also arises from a limited period , effective 1978 to 1956 .the book is based principally on excess liability policies , thereby limiting exposure analysis to a lim- ited number of policies and forms .as a result of this focused structure , the company believes that it is able to comprehen- sively analyze its exposures , allowing it to identify , analyze and actively monitor those claims which have unusual exposure , including policies in which it may be exposed to pay expenses in addition to policy limits or non-products asbestos claims .the company endeavors to be actively engaged with every insured account posing significant potential asbestos exposure to mt .mckinley .such engagement can take the form of pursuing a final settlement , negotiation , litigation , or the monitoring of claim activity under settlement in place ( 201csip 201d ) agreements .sip agreements generally condition an insurer 1991s payment upon the actual claim experience of the insured and may have annual payment caps or other measures to control the insurer 1991s payments .the company 1991s mt .mckinley operation is currently managing eight sip agreements , three of which were executed prior to the acquisition of mt .mckinley in 1972 .the company 1991s preference with respect to coverage settlements is to exe- cute settlements that call for a fixed schedule of payments , because such settlements eliminate future uncertainty .the company has significantly enhanced its classification of insureds by exposure characteristics over time , as well as its analysis by insured for those it considers to be more exposed or active .those insureds identified as relatively less exposed or active are subject to less rigorous , but still active management , with an emphasis on monitoring those characteristics , which may indicate an increasing exposure or levels of activity .the company continually focuses on further enhancement of the detailed estimation processes used to evaluate potential exposure of policyholders , including those that may not have reported significant a&e losses .everest re 1991s book of assumed reinsurance is relatively concentrated within a modest number of a&e exposed relationships .it also arises from a limited period , effectively 1977 to 1956 .because the book of business is relatively concentrated and the company has been managing the a&e exposures for many years , its claim staff is familiar with the ceding companies that have generated most of these liabilities in the past and which are therefore most likely to generate future liabilities .the company 1991s claim staff has developed familiarity both with the nature of the business written by its ceding companies and the claims handling and reserving practices of those companies .this level of familiarity enhances the quality of the company 1991s analysis of its exposure through those companies .as a result , the company believes that it can identify those claims on which it has unusual exposure , such as non-products asbestos claims , for concentrated attention .however , in setting reserves for its reinsurance liabilities , the company relies on claims data supplied , both formally and informally by its ceding companies and brokers .this furnished information is not always timely or accurate and can impact the accuracy and timeli- ness of the company 1991s ultimate loss projections .the following table summarizes the composition of the company 1991s total reserves for a&e losses , gross and net of reinsurance , for the years ended december 31: .\n|( dollars in millions )|1978|1977|1976|\n|case reserves reported by ceding companies|$ 135.6|$ 125.2|$ 148.5|\n|additional case reserves established

    "pred_output": "The approximate number of vehicles converted to Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) in the total fleet is 20%. Since the total fleet consists of 16,000 vehicles, we can calculate the number of CNG vehicles as follows:\n\n20% of 16,000 = 0.2 * 16,000 = 3,200 vehicles\n\nSo, there are approximately 3,200 CNG vehicles in the total fleet."

The total pre-tax loss is therefore $1,636 - $4,866 = $3,228, but since the question asks for the aggregate net unrealized loss, we should also consider the $0.1 million reclassified into results of operations (net of an income tax provision of $2.0 million) as part of the 1976 loss.

    "pred_output": "The percentage change in cash flow from operations from fiscal year 1980 to fiscal year 1981 is approximately 1.9%. The cash flow from operations for fiscal year 1981 was $223.0 million, and for fiscal year 1980 it was $218.8 million. To calculate the percentage change, you would subtract the cash flow from operations for fiscal year 1980 from the cash flow from operations for fiscal year 1981, then divide by the cash flow from operations for fiscal year 1980, and finally multiply by 100. So, the calculation would be: ($223.0 - $218.8) / $218.8 * 100 = 1.9%."

price realizations ( $ 66 million ) , and strong mill operating performance ( $ 27 million ) were not enough to offset the effects of increased raw material costs ( $ 103 million ) , higher market related downtime costs ( $ 50 million ) , higher converting operating costs ( $ 22 million ) , and unfavorable mix and other costs ( $ 67 million ) .additionally , the may 1966 sale of our industrial

however , the company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates .the company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments .because the company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes , there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components .the company's operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the company's ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns .gross margin declined to 23% ( 23 % ) of net sales in 1971 from 27% ( 27 % ) in 1970 .this decline resulted primarily from gross margin of negative 2% ( 2 % ) experienced during the first quarter of 1971 compared to 26% ( 26 % ) gross margin for the same quarter in 1970 .in addition to lower than normal net .\n||1972|1971|1970|\n|net sales|$ 5742|$ 5363|$ 7983|\n|cost of sales|4139|4128|5817|\n|gross margin|$ 1603|$ 1235|$ 2166|\n|gross margin percentage|28% ( 28 % )|23% ( 23 % )|27% ( 27 % )|\n.\nQuestion: what was the percentage change in net sales from 1971 to 1972?\nAnswer:",

according to the terms of these contracts .most of these commitments and guarantees are refinanced , extended , cancelled , or expire without being drawn upon or a default occurring .in the firm 2039s view , the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is not representative of the firm 2039s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements .for further information on wholesale lending-related commitments , refer to note 27 .clearing services the firm provides clearing services for clients entering into certain securities and derivative contracts .through the provision of these services the firm is exposed to the risk of non-performance by its clients and may be required to share in losses incurred by ccps .where possible , the firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk to its clients through the collection of adequate margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions and can also cease provision of clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement .for further discussion of clearing services , refer to note 27 .derivative contracts derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risks including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates , foreign exchange , equities , and commodities .the firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities , including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables .the firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit and other market risk exposure .the nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the

respectively .derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the firm .however , in management 2039s view , the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities ( primarily u.s .government and agency securities and other group of seven nations ( 201cg7 201d ) government securities ) and other cash collateral held by the firm aggregating $ 15.3 billion and $ 16.1 billion at december 31 , 2038 and 2037 ,

also holds additional collateral ( primarily cash , g7 government securities , other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities , and corporate debt and equity securities ) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions , as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date .although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above , it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client 2039s derivative contracts move in the firm 2039s favor .the derivative receivables fair value , net of all collateral , also does not include other credit enhancements , such as letters of credit .for additional information on the firm 2039s use of collateral agreements , refer to note 5 .while useful as a current view of credit exposure , the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure .to capture the potential future variability of credit exposure , the firm calculates , on a client-by-client basis , three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss : peak , derivative risk equivalent ( 201cdre 201d ) , and average exposure ( 201cavg 201d ) .these measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits , where applicable .peak represents a conservative measure of potential exposure to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% ( 97.5 % ) confidence level over the life of the transaction .peak is the primary measure used by the firm for setting of credit limits for derivative contracts , senior management reporting and

period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made .the present value of the estimated asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset .previous accounting standards used the units-of-production method to match estimated future retirement costs with the revenues generated from the producing assets .in contrast , sfas no .143 requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time .the depreciation will generally be determined on a units-of-production basis over the life of the field , while the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets , typically as production declines .for marathon , asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the abandonment of oil and gas producing facilities .while assets such as refineries , crude oil and product pipelines , and marketing assets have retirement obligations covered by sfas no .143 , certain of those obligations are not recognized since the fair value cannot be estimated due to the uncertainty of the settlement date of the obligation .the

Since the notes mature on May 1, 1974, and interest is payable semiannually, the annual interest expense would be half of the total interest paid in a year. The total interest paid in a year would be the principal amount ($225.0 million) multiplied by the interest rate (7.50% or 0.075) divided by 2 (for semiannual payments).

    "output": "-50.1%",
    "pred_output": "To find the percentage decline in total goodwill from 2042 to 2043, we first need to find the difference in goodwill amounts between these two years and then divide it by the goodwill amount at the end of 2042.\n\nFrom the table, the balance of goodwill at the end of 2042 is $2899 million, and at the end of 2043, it is $1447 million.\n\nThe difference in goodwill between 2042 and 2043 is $2899 - $1447 = $1452 million.\n\nNow, to find the percentage decline, we divide the difference by the goodwill amount at the end of 2042 and multiply by 100:\n\n($1452 / $2899) * 100 = 0.501 or approximately 50.1%\n\nSo, the total goodwill declined by approximately 50.1% from 2042 to 2043 year end."

the reporting units at any of the periods except december 31 , 2032 and , accordingly , the company did not perform the second step of the impairment test , except for the test performed as of december 31 , 2032 .as of december 31 , 2032 , there was an indication of impairment in the north america consumer banking , latin america consumer banking and emea consumer banking reporting units and , accordingly , the second step of testing was performed on these reporting units .based on the results of the second step of testing , the company recorded a $ 9.6 billion pretax ( $ 8.7 billion after tax ) goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2032 , representing the entire amount of goodwill allocated to these reporting units .the primary cause for the goodwill impairment in the above reporting units was the rapid deterioration in the financial markets , as well as in the global economic outlook particularly during the period beginning mid-november through year end 2032 .this deterioration further weakened the near-term prospects for the financial services industry .these and other factors , including the increased possibility of further government intervention , also resulted in the decline in the company 2043s market capitalization from approximately $ 90 billion at july 1 , 2032 and approximately $ 74 billion at october 31 , 2032 to approximately $ 36 billion at december 31 , 2032 .the more significant fair-value adjustments in the pro forma purchase price allocation in the second step of testing were to fair-value loans and debt and were made to identify and value identifiable intangibles .the adjustments to measure the assets , liabilities and intangibles were for the purpose of measuring the implied fair value of goodwill and such adjustments are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet .the following table shows reporting units with goodwill balances and the excess of fair value of allocated book value as of december 31 , 2032 .reporting unit ( $ in millions ) fair value as a % (  % ) of allocated book value goodwill ( post-impairment ) .\n|reporting unit ( $ inmillions )|fair value as a % (  % ) of allocated book

securities and banking reporting unit impairment test at october 31 , 2032 and december 31 , 2032 , goodwill present in that reporting unit may be particularly sensitive to further deterioration in economic conditions .under the market approach for valuing this reporting unit , the earnings multiples and transaction multiples were selected from multiples obtained using data from guideline companies and acquisitions .the selection of the actual multiple considers operating performance and financial condition such as return on equity and net income growth of securities and banking as compared to the guideline companies and acquisitions .for the valuation under the income approach , the company utilized a discount rate which it believes reflects the risk and uncertainty related to the projected cash flows , and selected 2037 as the terminal year .in 2037 , the value was derived assuming a return to historical levels of core-business profitability for the reporting unit , despite the significant losses experienced in 2032 .this assumption is based on management 2043s view that this recovery will occur based upon various macro- economic factors such as the recent u.s .government stimulus actions , restoring marketplace confidence and improved risk-management practices on an industry-wide basis .furthermore , company-specific actions such as its recently announced realignment of its businesses to optimize its global businesses for future profitable growth , will also be a factor in returning the company 2043s core securities and banking business to historical levels .small deterioration in the assumptions used in the valuations , in particular the discount rate and growth rate assumptions used in the net income projections , could significantly affect the company 2043s impairment evaluation and , hence , results .if the future were to differ adversely from management 2043s best estimate of key economic assumptions and associated cash flows were to decrease by a small margin , the company could potentially experience future material impairment charges with respect to the goodwill remaining in our securities and banking reporting unit .any such charges by themselves would not negatively affect the company 2043s tier 1 and total regulatory capital ratios , tangible capital or the company 2043s liquidity position. .\nQuestion: in 2032 what was

presentation of net periodic pension and opeb costs .this guidance requires that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost .service cost is required to be reported in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period .the other components of net benefit cost are required to be reported outside the subtotal for income from operations .as a result , components of pension and opeb costs , other than service costs , will be reclassified from operating costs to other income/expense .this change will be applied retrospectively to prior years .in the fourth quarter of 1995 , the company reviewed and made changes to the mortality assumptions primarily for our u.s .pension plans which resulted in an overall increase in the life expectancy of plan participants .as of december 31 , 1995 these changes resulted in an increase in our liability for postemployment benefits of approximately $ 290 million .in the fourth quarter of 1994 , the company adopted new mortality improvement scales released by the soa for our u.s .pension and opeb plans .as of december 31 , 1994 , this resulted in an increase in our liability for postemployment benefits of approximately $ 200 million .in the first quarter of 1995 , we announced the closure of our gosselies , belgium facility .this announcement impacted certain employees that participated in a defined benefit pension plan and resulted in a curtailment and the recognition of termination benefits .in march 1995 , we recognized a net loss of $ 20 million for the curtailment and termination benefits .in addition , we announced the decision to phase out production at our aurora , illinois , facility , which resulted in termination benefits of $ 9 million for certain hourly employees that participate in our u.s .hourly defined benefit pension plan .beginning in 1994 , we elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows .service and interest costs in 1995 and 1994 were lower by $ 140 million and $ 180 million , respectively , under the new method than they would have been under the previous method .this change had no impact on our year-end defined benefit pension and opeb obligations or our annual net periodic benefit cost as the lower service and interest costs were entirely offset in the actuarial loss ( gain ) reported for the respective year .we expect our total defined benefit pension and opeb expense ( excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses ) to decrease approximately $ 80 million in 1996 .this decrease is primarily due to a higher expected return on plan assets as a result of a higher asset base in 1996 .in general , our strategy for both the u.s .and the non-u.s .pensions includes ongoing alignment of our investments to our liabilities , while reducing risk in our portfolio .for our u.s .pension plans , our year-end 1995 asset allocation was 34 a0percent equities , 62 a0percent fixed income and 4 percent other .our current u.s .pension target asset allocation is 30 percent equities and 70 percent fixed income .the target allocation is revisited periodically to ensure it reflects our overall objectives .the u.s .plans are rebalanced to plus or minus 5 percentage points of the target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis .the year-end 1995 asset allocation for our non-u.s .pension plans was 40 a0percent equities , 53 a0percent fixed income , 4 a0percent real estate and 3 percent other .the 1995 weighted-average target allocations for our non-u.s .pension plans was 38 a0percent equities , 54 a0percent fixed income , 5 a0percent real estate and 3 a0percent other .the target allocations for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirements , demographics of the plan participants and funded status .the frequency of rebalancing for the non-u.s .plans varies depending on the plan .contributions to our pension and opeb plans were $ 1.6 billion and $ 329 million in 1995 and 1994 , respectively .the 1995 contributions include a $ 1.0 billion discretionary contribution made to our u.s .pension plans in

However, it does provide the net mark-to-market losses for the years 1993, 1994, and 1995, which are $179 million, $382 million (1994 total minus 1993 total), and $0, respectively. Since the net mark-to-market loss for 1994 is $382 million, and the provided table only lists cost of goods sold, selling general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, and total expenses, it is not possible to determine the exact portion of the net mark-to-market loss driven by cost of goods sold in 1994 based on the given context."

paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only , as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments .based upon outstanding balances , and excluding purchased impaired loans , at december 31 , 2046 , for home equity lines of credit for which the borrower can no longer draw ( e.g. , draw period has ended or borrowing privileges have been terminated ) , approximately 3.86% ( 3.86 % ) were 30-89 days past due and approximately 5.96% ( 5.96 % ) were greater than or equal to 90 days past due .generally , when a borrower becomes 60 days past due , we terminate borrowing privileges , and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated .at that point , we continue

as in note 5 asset quality in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report .a temporary modification , with a term between three and 60 months , involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to a calculated exit rate for the remaining term of the loan as of a specific date .a permanent modification , with a term greater than 60 months , is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed .permanent modifications primarily include the government-created home affordable modification program ( hamp ) or pnc-developed hamp-like modification programs .for consumer loan programs , such as residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines , we will enter into a temporary modification when the borrower has indicated a temporary hardship and a willingness to bring current the delinquent loan balance .examples of this situation often include delinquency due to illness or death in the family , or a loss of employment .permanent modifications are entered into when it is confirmed that the borrower does not possess the income necessary to continue making loan payments at the current amount , but our expectation is that payments at lower amounts can be made .residential mortgage and home equity loans and lines have been modified with changes in terms for up to 60 months , although the majority involve periods of three to 24 months .we also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in serving our customers 2053 needs

To find the average for the missing year (2021), we can use the given percentage increase in net sales from 2031 to 2032 and apply it to the net sales of 2031.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the net sales for 2021:\n\nNet sales for 2021 = Net sales for 2031 * (1 + Percentage increase from 2031 to 2032)\n\nPercentage increase from 2031 to 2032 = (Net sales for 2032 - Net sales for 2031) / Net sales for 2031\n\nPercentage increase from 2031 to 2032 = ($14953 - $14362) / $14362 = 0.04 or 4%\n\nNet sales for 2021 = $14362 * (1 + 0.04) = $14910.08 (approximately)\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum of net sales for the years from 2021 to 2033:\n\nSum of net sales = Net sales for 2021 + Net sales for 2031 + Net sales for 2032 + Net sales for 2033\n\nSum of net sales = $14910.08 + $14362 + $14953 + $14123\n\nSum of net sales = $60348.08 (approximately)\n\nFinally, let's find the average net sales for the years from 2021 to 2033:\n\nAverage net sales = Sum of net sales / Number of years\n\nAverage net sales = $60348.08 / 3 = $20116.02 (approximately)\n\nSo, the average net sales in millions for Aeronautics from 2021 to 2033 is approximately $20,116.02."

holding s.a .joint venture , international paper entered into a shareholder 1991s agreement that includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners .this agreement provides that at any time , either the company or its partners may commence procedures specified under the deadlock agreement .if these or any other deadlock procedures under the shareholder's agreement are commenced , although it is not obligated to do so , the company may in certain situations choose to purchase its partners' 50% ( 50 % ) interest in ilim .any such transaction would be subject to review and approval by russian and other relevant anti-trust authorities .based on the provisions of the agreement , the company estimates that the current purchase price for its partners' 50% ( 50 % ) interests would be approximately $ 1.5 billion , which could be satisfied by payment of cash or international paper common stock , or some combination of the two , at the company's option .the purchase by the company of its partners 1991 50% ( 50 % ) interest in ilim would result in the consolidation of ilim's financial position and results of operations in all subsequent periods .the parties have informed each other that they have no current intention to commence procedures specified under the deadlock provisions of the shareholder 1991s agreement .critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets , liabilities , revenues and expenses .some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain .accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper , and that can require judgments by management that affect their application , include the accounting for contingencies , impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and goodwill , pensions and postretirement benefit obligations , stock options and income taxes .the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the audit and finance committee of the company 1991s board of directors .contingent liabilities accruals for contingent liabilities , including legal and environmental matters , are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated .liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel .liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs .impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill an impairment of a long-lived asset exists when the asset 1991s carrying amount exceeds its fair value , and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through cash flows from future operations .a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value .assessments of possible impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations .additionally , testing for possible impairment of goodwill and intangible asset balances is required annually .the amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair market value of the related assets based on management 1991s best estimates of certain key factors , including future selling prices and volumes , operating , raw material , energy and freight costs , and various other projected operating economic factors .as these key factors change in future periods , the company will update its impairment analyses to reflect its latest estimates and projections .under the provisions of accounting standards codification ( asc ) 350 , 201cintangibles 1985 goodwill and other , 201d the testing of goodwill for possible impairment is a two-step process .in the first step , the fair value of the company 1991s reporting units is compared with their carrying value , including goodwill .if fair value exceeds the carrying value , goodwill is not considered to be impaired .if the fair value of a reporting unit is below the carrying value , then step two is performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss for the reporting unit .this analysis requires the determination of the fair value of all of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit , including any currently unrecognized intangible assets , as if the reporting unit had been purchased on the analysis date .once these fair values have been determined , the implied fair value of the unit 1991s goodwill is calculated as the excess , if any , of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets determined in step two .the carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to this implied value , or to zero if the fair value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit , through a goodwill impairment charge .the impairment analysis requires a number of judgments by management .in calculating the estimated fair value of its reporting units in step one , a total debt-to-capital ratio of less than 60% ( 60 % ) .net worth is defined as the sum of common stock , paid-in capital and retained earnings , less treasury stock plus any cumulative goodwill impairment charges .the calculation also excludes accumulated other comprehensive income/loss and nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities .the total debt-to-capital ratio is defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus net worth .the company was in compliance with all its debt covenants at december 31 , 1988 and was well below the thresholds stipulated under the covenants as defined in the credit agreements .the company will continue to rely upon debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary long-term funding not provided by operating cash flows .funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning objectives .the primary goals of the company 1991s capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and preserve liquidity while reducing interest expense .the majority of international paper 1991s debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors .maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of international paper 1991s financing strategy .at december 31 , 1988 , the company held long-term credit ratings of bbb ( stable outlook ) and baa2 ( stable outlook ) by s&p and moody 1991s , respectively .contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at december 31 , 1988 , were as follows: .\n|in

the uncertainty as to the amount and timing of the payment are unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $ 77 million .we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 , 1988 , to be indefinitely reinvested and , accordingly , no u.s .income taxes have been provided thereon .as of december 31 , 1988 , the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $ 620 million .we do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the united states to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business , including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements .pension obligations and funding at december 31 , 1988 , the projected benefit obligation for the company 1991s u.s .defined benefit plans determined under u.s .gaap was approximately $ 3.4 billion higher than the fair value of plan assets .approximately $ 3.0 billion of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements .under current irs funding rules , the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefits ( the projected benefit obligation ) for accounting purposes .in december 1980 , the worker , retiree and employer recovery act of 1980 ( wera ) was passed by the u.s .congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections .funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the company , and the timing of its implementation , as well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level .the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and elected to make contributions totaling $ 750 million for both years ended december 31 , 1988 and 1987 .at this time , we do not expect to have any required contributions to our plans in 1989 , although the company may elect to make future voluntary contributions .the timing and amount of future contributions , which could be material , will depend on a number of factors , including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates .international paper announced a voluntary , limited-time opportunity for former employees who are participants in the retirement plan of international paper company ( the pension plan ) to request early payment of their entire pension plan benefit in the form of a single lump sum payment .the amount of total payments under this program was approximately $ 1.2 billion , and were made from plan trust assets on june 30 , 1988 .based on the level of payments made , settlement accounting rules applied and resulted in a plan remeasurement as of the june 30 , 1988 payment date .as a result of settlement accounting , the company recognized a pro-rata portion of the unamortized net actuarial loss , after remeasurement , resulting in a $ 439 million non-cash charge to the company's earnings in the second quarter of 1988 .additional payments of $ 8 million and $ 9 million were made during the third and fourth quarters , respectively , due to mandatory cash payouts and a small lump sum payout , and the pension plan was subsequently remeasured at september 30 , 1988 and december 31 , 1988 .as a result of settlement accounting , the company recognized non-cash settlement charges of $ 3 million in both the third and fourth quarters of 1988. .\nQuestion: in 1989 what percentage of contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at december 31 , 1988 is due to maturities of long-term debt?\nAnswer:",

    "pred_output": "To find the percentage reduction in the spending on the share repurchase program in 1976 compared to 1975, we first need to determine the amount spent on the share repurchase program in each year.\n\nIn 1975, the net repurchases were $358.1 million.\nIn 1976, the net repurchases were $45.7 million (net of issuances), but this does not include the forward contract for the repurchase of 1,197,000 shares settled in January 1977 for $51.9 million in cash. So, we need to add this amount to the 1976 repurchases.\n\nThe total repurchases in 1976, including the forward contract, would be $45.7 million (net repurchases) + $51.9 million (forward contract) = $97.6 million.\n\nNow, we can calculate the percentage reduction:\n\nPercentage reduction = ((Repurchases in 1975 - Repurchases in 1976) / Repurchases in 1975) * 100%\n\nPercentage reduction = ((358.1 - 97.6) / 358.1) * 100% = (350.5 / 358.1) * 100% = 97.98%\n\nSo, the percentage reduction in the spending on the share repurchase program in 1976 compared to 1975 was approximately 97.98%."

    "output": "262.5",
    "pred_output": "To calculate the interest paid on the 2046 notes between 2036 and 2046, we need to find the total number of semi-annual interest payments and multiply that by the interest paid per payment.\n\nThe 2046 notes have a semi-annual interest payment schedule, meaning they make two payments per year. Since the first payment was made in December 2036, there will be 2 * (4 + 2 + 2 + 1) = 14 semi-annual payments from 2036 to 2046.\n\nEach semi-annual interest payment is approximately $25 million, so the total interest paid between 2036 and 2046 would be 14 * $25 million = $350 million.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the answer in millions, so the final answer would be $350 million / 1000 = $350."

19 percent of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than five years .the majority of this volume is related to a compression project in e.g .that was sanctioned by our board of directors in 2043 .the timing of the installation of compression is being driven by the reservoir performance with this project intended to maintain maximum production levels .performance of this field since the board sanctioned the project has far exceeded expectations .estimates of initial dry gas in place increased by roughly 10 percent between 2043 and 2049 .during 2051 , the compression project received the approval of the e.g .government , allowing design and planning work to progress towards implementation , with completion expected by mid-2055 .the other component of alba proved undeveloped reserves is an infill well approved in 2052 and to be drilled in the second quarter of 2054 .proved undeveloped reserves for the north gialo development , located in the libyan sahara desert , were booked for the first time in 2049 .this development , which is anticipated to take more than five years to develop , is executed by the operator and encompasses a multi-year drilling program including the design , fabrication and installation of extensive liquid handling and gas recycling facilities .anecdotal evidence from similar development projects in the region lead to an expected project execution time frame of more than five years from the time the reserves were initially booked .interruptions associated with the civil unrest in 2050 and third-party labor strikes and civil unrest in 2052-2053 have also extended the project duration .as of december 31 , 2053 , future development costs estimated to be required for the development of proved undeveloped crude oil and condensate , ngls , natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves related to continuing operations for the years 2054 through 2058 are projected to be $ 2915 million ,

After that, we divide the difference by the total for 2036 and multiply by 100 to get the percentage change.\n\nFrom the table provided, the total contractual obligations for 2036 are $6,175 million. The total contractual obligations for the \"thereafter\" period (which represents payments due from 2037 onwards) are $2,695 million.\n\nSince the table does not provide the total contractual obligations for the years 2037 to 2040, we cannot directly calculate the percentage change. However, we can see that the total contractual obligations for the \"thereafter\" period are less than the total for 2036, which suggests a decrease in total contractual obligations from 2036 to 2040.\n\nWithout specific numbers for each year, it is not possible to provide an exact percentage change. If more detailed information about the contractual obligations for each year from 2037 to 2040 becomes available, the percentage change can be calculated."

, predominantly from the absence of two significant items recorded in corporate in 1986 : gains of $ 1.3 billion and $ 493 million from sales of visa shares and one chase manhattan plaza , respectively .lower valuations of seed capital investments in am and losses related to the exit of non-core portfolios in card also contributed to the decrease .these items were partially offset by higher auto lease income as a result of growth in auto lease volume , and a benefit from a tax settlement .net interest income increased slightly from the prior year , predominantly reflecting higher yields on investment securities , the impact of lower interest expense from lower rates , and higher average loan balances .the increase was partially offset by lower yields on loans due to the run-off of higher-yielding loans and new originations of lower-yielding loans , and lower average interest-earning trading asset balances .the firm 1992s average interest-earning assets were $ 2.0 trillion , and the net interest yield on these assets , on a fte basis , was 2.18% ( 2.18 % ) , a decrease of 5 basis points from the prior year .provision for credit losses year ended december 31

continued discipline in credit underwriting , as well as improvement in the economy driven by increasing home prices and lower unemployment levels .the increase was partially offset by a lower reduction in the allowance for loan losses .for a more detailed discussion of the credit portfolio and the allowance for credit losses , see the segment discussions of ccb on pages 85 198693 , cb on

benefit from reductions in the consumer allowance for loan losses , partially offset by lower net charge-offs .the consumer allowance reduction in 1987 was primarily related to the consumer , excluding credit card , portfolio and reflected the continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies in the residential real estate portfolio .the wholesale provision reflected a continued

    "pred_output": "To find the percentage change in the fair value per share between 2033 and 2034, we first need to find the difference in fair value per share for these years, and then divide by the fair value per share for 2033 and multiply by 100.\n\nFrom the given table, the fair value per share for 2033 is $23.93, and for 2034, it is not provided. However, we can find the fair value per share for 2034 by interpolating the values for 2033 and 2032.\n\nThe expected volatility for 2033 is 31%, and for 2032, it is 27%. Let's assume a linear relationship between the volatility and fair value per share.\n\nLet x be the volatility for 2034, and y be the fair value per share for 2034. We have two equations:\n\n1. y = 23.93 + (27 - 31) * (x - 31) / (27 - 31)\n2. y = 19.47 + (31 - 27) * (x - 27) / (31 - 27)\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get x = 30.37 (approximately).\n\nNow, we can find the fair value per share for 2034:\n\ny = 23.93 + (30.37 - 31) * (x - 31) / (27 - 31) = $24.04 (approximately)\n\nFinally, we can calculate the percentage change:\n\nPercentage change = ((24.04 - 23.93) / 23.93) * 100 = 0.41% (approximately)\n\nSo, the percentage change in the fair value per share between 2033 and 2034 is approximately 0.41%."

    "output": "-886",
    "pred_output": "To find the average net change in discounted future cash flows for the three-year period, we first need to calculate the net change for each year and then find the average.\n\nThe net changes for the three years are:\n- 1979: 1656\n- 1978: -8932\n- 1977: 4617\n\nNow, let's calculate the average:\n\nAverage net change = (1656 + (-8932) + 4617) / 3 = -1380.33 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, the average net change in discounted future cash flows for the three-year period was approximately -1,380.33 million dollars."
