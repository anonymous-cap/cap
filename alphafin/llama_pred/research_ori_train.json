http://www.everestre.com.\nQuestion: what is the percentage change of the, pre-tax catastrophe losses from 2003 to 2004\nAnswer: The pre-tax catastrophe losses in 2003 were $35.0 million and in 2004 were $390.0 million. To find the percentage change, first, find the difference between the two values: $390.0 million - $35.0 million = $355.0 million. Then, divide the difference by the original value and multiply by 100: ($355.0 million / $35.0 million) * 100 = 1014.29%. So, the pre-tax catastrophe losses increased by 1014.29% from 2003 to 2004. Note that this is an extremely large increase, which may be due to a significant event or change in the company's operations....

The tweets mention Intel's (INTC) partnerships, new chips, and acquisition, which are all positive developments. Additionally, the tweets mention other stocks that have risen significantly, such as Mobileye (MBLY) and NVIDIA (NVDA), which could indicate a potential rise in the stock price. The only negative tweet is from June 8, but it is not a strong negative sentiment, and the overall sentiment is still positive. Therefore, based on the tweets, it is likely that the closing price of $INTC will rise at 2017-06-15."

The tweets also suggest a positive sentiment, with many users expressing excitement about Amazon's earnings and the company's growth. The only negative tweet is about the potential impact of government regulation, but it is not enough to outweigh the overall positive sentiment. Therefore, it is likely that the closing price of $amzn will rise at 2017-02-13."

As an illustration, 'The company's recent investment in renewable energy has yielded impressive returns.' would be labeled as positive.\nLast year's third quarter result had been burdened by costs stemming from restructuring in the US. The company's efforts to streamline its operations and reduce expenses have been ongoing for several years, but the latest quarter's performance was still impacted by these costs. The company's revenue increased by 5% year-over-year, but the net income decreased by 10% due to the aforementioned expenses. The company's management has expressed optimism about the future, citing the progress made in reducing costs and the potential for future growth.\nThe sentiment conveyed in this sentence is:\nA) Positive\nB) Negative\nC) Neutral\n\nCorrect answer: B) Negative\n\nExplanation: The sentence mentions that the company's net income decreased by 10% due to expenses, which is a negative development. Although the company's revenue increased by 5%, the overall tone of the sentence is negative due to the focus on the decrease in net income. The sentence also mentions that the company's efforts to streamline its operations and reduce expenses have been ongoing for several years, which implies that the company is still struggling with these issues. The sentence's overall sentiment is therefore negative."

Therefore, it is likely that the closing price of $agn will surge at 2017-06-26."

The recent tweets and data suggest that the company is expected to announce quarterly sales of $1.84 billion, and there are discussions with the FDA. Additionally, the company is planning to launch a new product, which could lead to an increase in the stock price. The tweets also mention the company's growth and the potential for it to become a leader in its industry.

To find the percentage increase, we can use the formula:\n\nPercentage increase = ((New value - Old value) / Old value) * 100\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nPercentage increase = ((0.29 - 0.25) / 0.25) * 100 = 16%\n\nSo, the cash dividend increased by 16% from 2015 to 2016."

the company 2019s revolving credit agreements include a financial ratio covenant. the covenant requires that the amount of total indebtedness not exceed 60% ( 60 % ) of the company 2019s total capitalization excluding the portion of accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) related to pensions and other postretirement benefit adjustments. as of december 31, 2012, total indebtedness was 42% ( 42 % ) of the company 2019s total capitalization excluding the portion of accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) related to pensions and other postretirement benefit adjustments. additionally, substantially all of the company 2019s debt agreements contain customary cross- default provisions. those provisions generally provide that a default on a debt service payment of $ 10 million or more for longer than the grace period provided ( usually 10 days ) under one agreement may result in an event of default under other agreements. none of the company 2019s primary debt obligations are secured or guaranteed by the company 2019s affiliates. interest payments in 2012, 2011 and 2010 totaled $ 219 million, $ 212 million and $ 189 million, respectively. in october 2009, the company entered into an agreement with a counterparty to repurchase up to 1.2 million shares of the company 2019s stock of which 1.1 million shares were purchased in the open market ( 465006 of these shares were purchased as of december 31, 2009 at a weighted average price of $ 56.66 per share ). the counterparty held the shares until september of 2010 when the company paid $ 65 million and took possession of these shares. rental expense for operating leases was $ 233 million, $ 249 million and $ 233 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. the primary leased assets include paint stores, transportation equipment, warehouses and other distribution facilities, and office space, including the company 2019s corporate headquarters located in pittsburgh, pa. minimum lease commitments for operating leases that have initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year as of december 31, 2012, are ( in millions ) $ 171 in 2013, $ 135 in 2014, $ 107 in 2015, $ 83 in 2016, $ 64 in 2017 and $ 135 thereafter. the company had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $ 119 million as of december 31, 2012. the letters of credit secure the company 2019s performance to third parties under certain self-insurance programs and other commitments made in the ordinary course of business. as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, guarantees outstanding were $ 96 million and $ 90 million, respectively. the guarantees relate primarily to debt of certain entities in which ppg has an ownership interest and selected customers of certain of the company 2019s businesses. a portion of such debt is secured by the assets of the related entities. the carrying values of these guarantees were $ 11 million and $ 13 million as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and the fair values were $ 11 million and $ 21 million, as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. the fair value of each guarantee was estimated by comparing the net present value of two hypothetical cash flow streams, one based on ppg 2019s incremental borrowing rate and the other based on the borrower 2019s incremental borrowing rate, as of the effective date of the guarantee. both streams were discounted at a risk free rate of return. the company does not believe any loss related to these letters of credit, surety bonds or guarantees is likely. 9. fair value measurement the accounting guidance on fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy with three levels of inputs used to determine fair value. level 1 inputs are quoted prices ( unadjusted ) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, are considered to be the most reliable evidence of fair value, and should be used whenever available. level 2 inputs are observable prices that are not quoted on active exchanges. level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs employed for measuring the fair value of assets or liabilities. table of contents notes to the consolidated financial

$104,520,000 and the total long-term debt is $5,475,988,000. Therefore, the ratio of total cash to total long-term debt is $104,520,000 / $5,475,988,000 = 0.0192 or 1.92%. This means that for every dollar of long-term debt, the company has approximately 1.92 cents in cash. This is a very low cash-to-debt ratio, indicating that the company has a significant amount of debt relative to its cash reserves. This could be a concern for investors and creditors, as it may indicate that the company is taking on too much debt and may struggle to meet its financial obligations. However, it's important to note that the company's financial statements also show that it has a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents, which could be used to pay off debt or fund future operations. Therefore, the company's financial position should be evaluated in the context of its overall financial situation and industry trends. 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page 35. 35 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page 35. 35 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page 35. 35 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page 35. 35 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page 35. 35 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page 35. 35 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page 35. 35 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page 35. 35 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page 35. 35 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page 35. 35 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page 35. 35 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page 35. 35 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page 35. 35 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page 35. 35 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page 35. 35 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page 35. 35 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page 35. 35 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page 35. 35 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page 35. 35 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page 35. 35 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page 35. 35 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page 35. 35 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page"

participants are limited to the number of whole shares that can be purchased by an amount equal to ten percent of the participant 2019s compensation or $ 25000, whichever is less. the espp has two six-month subscription periods, the first of which runs between january 1 and june 30 and the second of which runs between july 1 and december 31 of each year. the amounts that have been collected from participants during a subscription period are used on the 201cexercise date 201d to purchase full shares of common shares. an exercise date is generally the last trading day of a sub- scription period. the number of shares purchased is equal to the total amount, as of the exercise date, that has been collected from the participants through payroll deductions for that subscription period, divided by the 201cpurchase price 201d, rounded down to the next full share. effective for and from the second subscription period of 2007, the purchase price is 85 percent of the fair value of a common share on the exercise date. prior to the second subscription period of 2007, the purchase price was calculated as the lower of ( i ) 85 percent of the fair value of a common share on the first day of the subscription period, or.\nConversations: \nQuestion: what is the net impact of granted and vested shares in the number of unvested restricted stocks in 2007?\nAnswer: \nThe net impact of

debt securities can be found in note 4, \"\"debt and credit facilities'' to the company's consolidated financial statements. as previously discussed, the decrease in the long- term debt obligations as compared to december 31, 2004, was due to the redemptions and repurchases of $ 1.0 billion principal amount of outstanding securities during 2005. also, as previously discussed, the remaining $ 118 million of 7.6% ( 7.6 % ) notes due january 1, 2007 were reclassified to current maturities of long-term debt. lease obligations : the company owns most of its major facilities, but does lease certain

to five years for software ). however, generally these agreements do not obligate the company to make any purchases, and many permit the company to terminate the agreement with advance notice ( usually ranging from 60 to 180 days ). if the company were to terminate these agreements, it generally would be liable for certain termination charges, typically based on work performed and supplier on-hand inventory and raw materials attributable to canceled orders. the company's liability would only arise in the event it terminates the agreements for reasons other than \"\"cause.'' in 2003, the

This does not indicate a direction up in the gold market. Instead, it suggests that the price may be facing resistance and potentially declining. A direction up would be inferred if the headline mentioned a breakout above the 200-day SMA or other bullish indicators. In this case, the headline does not provide any evidence of a direction up in the gold market. Therefore, the answer is No."

The current long futures is 1052, so the new long futures would be 1052 * 2 = 2104. The increase would be 2104 - 1052 = 1052, which is a percentage increase of (1052 / 1052) * 100% = 100%. Therefore, the long futures would need to increase by 100% to double the short futures. Final Answer: The final answer is 100%. I hope it is correct.

    "pred_output": "Please answer the given financial question based on the context.\nContext: capital asset purchases associated with the retail segment were $ 294 million in 2007, bringing the total capital asset purchases since inception of the retail segment to $ 1.0 billion. as of september 29, 2007, the retail segment had approximately 7900 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of $ 1.1 billion. the company would incur substantial costs if it were to close multiple retail stores. such costs could adversely affect the company 2019s financial condition and operating results. other segments the company 2019s other segments, which consists of its asia pacific and filemaker operations, experienced an increase in net sales of $ 406 million, or 30% ( 30 % ) during 2007 compared to 2006. this increase related primarily to a 58% ( 58 % ) increase in sales of mac portable products and strong ipod sales in the company 2019s asia pacific region. during 2006, net sales in other segments increased 35% ( 35 % ) compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in sales of ipod and mac portable products. strong sales growth was a result of the introduction of the updated ipods featuring video-playing capabilities and the new intel-based mac portable products that translated to a 16% ( 16 % ) increase in mac unit sales during 2006 compared to 2005. gross margin gross margin for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows ( in millions, except gross margin percentages ) : september 29, september 30, september 24, 2007 2006 2005.\n||september 29 2007|september 30 2006|september 24 2005|\n|net sales|$ 24006|$ 19315|$ 13931|\n|cost of sales|15852|13717|9889|\n|gross margin|$ 8154|$ 5598|$ 4042|\n|gross margin percentage|34.0% ( 34.0 % )|29.0% ( 29.0 % )|29.0% ( 29.0 % )|\ngross margin percentage of 34.0% ( 34.0 % ) in 2007 increased significantly from 29.0% ( 29.0 % ) in 2006. the primary drivers of this increase were more favorable costs on certain commodity components, including nand flash memory and dram memory, higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production costs and a higher percentage of revenue from the company 2019s direct sales channels. the company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margins of the personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries will be subject to pressure due to price competition. the company expects gross margin percentage to decline sequentially in the first quarter of 2008 primarily as a result of the full-quarter impact of product transitions and reduced pricing that were effected in the fourth quarter of 2007, lower sales of ilife and iwork in their second quarter of availability, seasonally higher component costs, and a higher mix of indirect sales. these factors are expected to be partially offset by higher sales of the company 2019s mac os x operating system due to the introduction of mac os x version 10.5 leopard ( 2018 2018mac os x leopard 2019 2019 ) that became available in october 2007. the foregoing statements regarding the company 2019s expected gross margin percentage are forward-looking. there can be no assurance that current gross margin percentage will be maintained or targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved. in general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services, and a potential shift in the company 2019s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. in response to these competitive pressures, the company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products. gross margins could also be affected by the company 2019s ability to effectively manage product quality and warranty costs and to stimulate.\nQuestion: what was the percentage sales change from 2005 to 2006?\nAnswer: The percentage sales change from 2005 to 2006 was 35%.

To find the percentage increase from 2007 to 2009, first, find the difference between the 2009 and 2007 values: $6.2 million - $1.7 million = $4.5 million. Then, divide the difference by the 2007 value and multiply by 100: ($4.5 million / $1.7 million) * 100 = 265.12%. Therefore, the total fair value of share awards vested increased by 265.12% from 2007 to 2009. However, the question asks for the percentage increase, not the percentage change. To find the percentage increase, subtract 1 from the percentage change and multiply by 100: (265.12% - 1) * 100 = 264.12%. Therefore, the total fair value of share awards vested increased by 264.12% from 2007 to 2009. However, the question asks for the percentage increase, not the percentage change. To find the percentage increase, subtract 1 from the percentage change and multiply by 100: (265.12% - 1) * 100 = 264.12%.

( 3 ) represents the rolling three-month average of the combined balance of accounts payable-trade, excluding cash overdrafts, and accounts payable-inventory financing at the end of the period divided by average daily cost of sales for the same three-month period. the cash conversion cycle was 19 days at december 31, 2017 and 2016. the increase in dso was primarily driven by higher net sales and related accounts receivable for third-party services such as saas, software assurance and warranties. these services have an unfavorable impact on dso as the receivable is recognized on the consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the consolidated statement of operations is recorded on a net basis. this also results in a favorable impact on dpo as the payable is recognized on the consolidated balance sheet without a corresponding cost of sales in the statement of operations because the cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales. in addition, dpo also increased due to the mix of payables with certain vendors that have longer payment terms. the cash conversion cycle was 19 and 21 days at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the increase in dso was primarily driven by higher net sales and related accounts receivable for third-party services such as saas, software assurance and warranties. these services have an unfavorable impact on dso as the receivable is recognized on the balance sheet on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the statement of operations is recorded on a net basis. these services have a favorable impact on dpo as the payable is recognized on the balance sheet without a corresponding cost of sale in the statement of operations because the cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales. in addition to the impact of these services on dpo, dpo also increased due to the mix of payables with certain vendors that have longer payment terms. investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased $ 15 million in 2017 compared to 2016. capital expenditures increased $ 17 million to $ 81 million from $ 64 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily related to improvements to our information technology systems. net cash used in investing activities decreased $ 289 million in 2016 compared to 2015. the decrease in cash used was primarily due to the completion of the acquisition of cdw uk in 2015. additionally, capital expenditures decreased $ 26 million to $ 64 million from $ 90 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to spending for our new office location in 2015. financing activities net cash used in financing activities increased $ 514 million in 2017 compared to 2016. the increase was primarily driven by changes in accounts payable-inventory financing, which resulted in an increase in cash used for financing activities of $ 228 million and by share repurchases during 2017, which resulted in an increase in cash used for financing activities of $ 167 million. for more information on our share repurchase program, see part ii, item 5, 201cmarket for registrant 2019s common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities. 201d the increase in cash used for accounts payable-inventory financing was primarily driven by the termination of one of our inventory financing agreements in the fourth quarter of 2016, with amounts.\nConversations: \nq0: what is the cash conversion cycle in 2015? 21.0\nq1: what about in 2017? 19.0\nq2: what is the change in ash conversion cycle? 2.0\nQuestion: what fraction does this represent?\nAnswer: The change in cash conversion cycle is 2 days, which represents a 9.5% decrease from the 2015 value of 21 days. To calculate this, you can use the following formula:\n\nFraction = (Change in Cash Conversion Cycle / Original Value) * 100\n= (2 / 21) * 100\n= 9.5%\n\nSo, the change in cash conversion cycle represents a 9.5% decrease from the 2015 value."

The tweets also mention that the stock is not yet oversold, and that the $27.00 threshold is critical. Additionally, the report on the industrial automation market reaching $15.52b by 2023 does not seem to have a significant impact on the stock price. Overall, the data and tweets suggest that the closing price of $GE is likely to decrease at 2017-07-03."

This represents a 2% decrease as compared to 2013. To calculate this, you can use the following formula:\n\n((2013 proved undeveloped reserves - 2014 proved undeveloped reserves) / 2013 proved undeveloped reserves) * 100\n\nPlugging in the numbers, you get:\n\n((701 - 689) / 701) * 100 = 1.71%\n\nHowever, the text states that the change represents a 2% decrease, which is slightly different from the calculation above. This may be due to rounding errors or minor discrepancies in the data. Nevertheless, the answer provided in the text is 2%, which is close to the calculated value."

Risk Factors:\nIn addition to the other information provided in this report, the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in our securities. If the circumstances contemplated by the individual risk factors materialize, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly.\nRisks Relating to Our Business:\nFluctuations in the financial markets could result in investment losses. Prolonged and severe disruptions in the public debt and equity markets, such as occurred during 2008, could result in significant realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we incurred $695.8 million of realized investment gains and $310.4 million of unrealized investment losses. Although financial markets significantly improved during 2009 and 2010, they could deteriorate in the future and again result in substantial realized and unrealized losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings.\nOur results could be adversely affected by catastrophic events. We are exposed to unpredictable catastrophic events, including weather-related and other natural catastrophes, as well as acts of terrorism. Any material reduction in our operating results caused by the occurrence of one or more catastrophes could inhibit our ability to pay dividends or to meet our interest and principal payment obligations. Subsequent to April 1, 2010, we define a catastrophe as an event that causes a loss on property exposures before reinsurance of at least $10.0 million, before corporate level reinsurance and taxes. Prior to April 1, 2010, we used a threshold of $5.0 million. By way of illustration, during the past five calendar years, pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of contract specific reinsurance but before cessions under corporate reinsurance programs, were as follows:\n\n|Calendar Year|Pre-tax Catastrophe Losses|\n|(Dollars in Millions)|\n|2010|$571.1|\n|2009|67.4|\n|2008|364.3|\n|2007|160.0|\n|2006|287.9|\n\nQuestion: What would be the net value, in millions of dollars, of investment gains in 2008 if all unrealized losses were realized?\n\nAnswer: The net value of investment gains in 2008 would be the sum of realized investment gains and unrealized investment losses.

To find the percentage decrease, first find the difference between the two prices: $20.74 - $18.89 = $1.85. Then, divide the difference by the original price and multiply by 100: ($1.85 / $20.74) * 100 = 8.96%. So, the average price per share decreased by 8.96% from October to November. Final Answer: The final answer is 8.96%. I hope it is correct."

Answer: Rise Final Answer: The final answer is Rise. I hope it is correct.  The tweets suggest that $mcd is down, but the last tweet on June 27th mentions going to $mcd for a meal, which could be a positive sentiment. The stock price has been fluctuating, but the recent trend is up. Therefore, I predict that the closing price of $mcd will rise at 2020-07-07.  Utilize the data and tweets at hand to foresee if the closing price of $mcd will elevate or diminish at 2020-07-07. Only answer with Rise or Fall.

Stock-based compensation We grant other stock-based compensation awards such as stock-settled awards, cash-settled awards and performance-based awards (settled in cash or shares) to certain key employees. The number of shares or units received by an employee for performance-based awards depends on company performance against specific performance targets and could range from 0% (0%) to 300% (300%) of the target amount of shares originally granted. Incentive awards are subject to certain restrictions and vesting requirements as determined by the compensation committee. The fair value of the shares on the grant date is amortized over the vesting period, which is generally three years. Upon completion of the vesting period for cash-settled awards, the grantee is entitled to receive a payment in cash based on the fair market value of the corresponding number of shares of common stock. No monetary consideration is paid by a recipient for any incentive award. The fair value of cash-settled awards is adjusted each quarter based on our share price. The holders of stock-settled awards have absolute ownership interest in the underlying shares of common stock prior to vesting, which includes the right to vote and receive dividends. Dividends declared on common stock are accrued during the vesting period and paid when the award vests. The holders of cash-settled and performance-based awards have no ownership interest in the underlying shares of common stock until the awards vest and the shares of common stock are issued.. \nConversations: \nq0: how many stock options were granted in 2014? 0.0 \nq1: what about in 2015?

Therefore, we cannot determine the total value of the non-vested units that were forfeited during the year. However, we can infer that the total value of the non-vested units that were forfeited during the year is $3, which is the value of the restricted units that were forfeited during the year.

Analyzed the historical data of the stock price and found that the stock has been trending upwards.\n2. Looked at the tweets and found that there were more positive tweets than negative tweets, indicating a positive sentiment towards the stock.\n3. Found that the stock has a high open interest range for the option expiration on 01/13/2017, indicating that there is a lot of trading activity in the stock.\n4. Found that the stock has a high put-call ratio for the option expiration on 01/13/2017, indicating that there are more puts than calls, which could be a sign of a potential rise in the stock price.\n5. Found that the stock has a high volume of trading activity, which could indicate a high level of interest in the stock.\n\nBased on these methods, I predict that the closing price of $amgn will rise at 2017-01-18. However, please note that this is just a prediction and not a guarantee of the stock's performance. It's always important to do your own research and consider multiple factors before making an investment decision."

2022 $ 165.0 million from an up-front payment we received in connection with signing the janssen agreement ; 2022 $ 52.4 million from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans ; and 2022 $ 30.0 million from the sale of shares of altus pharmaceuticals inc. common stock and warrants to purchase altus common stock. these cash inflows were partially offset by the significant cash expenditures we made in 2006 related to research and development expenses and sales, general and administrative expenses. capital expenditures for property and equipment during 2006 were $ 32.4 million. at december 31, 2006, we had $ 42.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2007 notes and $ 59.6 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2011 notes outstanding. the 2007 notes are due in september 2007 and are convertible into common stock at the option of the holder at a price equal to $ 92.26 per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. in february 2007, we announced that we will redeem our 2011 notes on march 5, 2007. the 2011 notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at the option of the holder at a price equal to $ 14.94 per share. we expect the holders of the 2011 notes will elect to convert their notes into stock, in which case we will issue approximately 4.0 million. we will be required to repay any 2011 notes that are not converted at the rate of $ 1003.19 per $ 1000 principal amount, which includes principal and interest that will accrue to the redemption date. liability as of december 31, payments in 2004 cash received from sublease, net of operating costs in 2004 additional charge in liability as of december 31, lease restructuring liability and other operating lease liability $ 69526 $ ( 31550 ) $ 293 $ 17574 $ 55843. <table class='wikitable'><tr><td>1</td><td></td><td>liability as of december 31 2003</td><td>cash payments in 2004</td><td>cash received from sublease net of operating costs in 2004</td><td>additional charge in 2004</td><td>liability as of december 31 2004</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>lease restructuring liability and other operating lease liability</td><td>$ 69526</td><td>$ -31550 ( 31550 )</td><td>$ 293</td><td>$ 17574</td><td>$ 55843</td></tr></table> the activity related to the restructuring liability for 2004 is as follows ( in thousands ) : non-operating items interest income increased $ 1.7 million to $ 12.0 million in 2005 from $ 10.3 million in 2004. the increase was mainly the result of higher returns on invested funds. interest expense decreased $ 1.0 million, or 5% ( 5 % ), to $ 17.3 million in 2005 from $ 18.3 million in 2004 as a result of the exchange of newly issued stock for a portion of our outstanding convertible debt in the second half of 2005. in addition, as a result of the issuance during 2005 of common stock in exchange for convertible subordinated notes, we recorded a non- cash charge of $ 48.2 million. this charge related to the incremental shares issued in the transactions over the number of shares that would have been issued upon the conversion of the notes under their original terms. liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses since our inception and historically have financed our operations principally through public and private offerings of our equity and debt securities, strategic collaborative agreements that include research and/or development funding, development milestones and royalties on the sales of products, investment income and proceeds from the issuance of stock under our employee benefit programs. at december 31, 2006, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $ 761.8 million, which was an increase of $ 354.2 million from $ 407.5 million at december 31, 2005. the increase was primarily a result of : 2022 $ 313.7 million in net proceeds from our september 2006 public offering of common stock ;

A more comprehensive analysis would be necessary for a more accurate prediction."

The tweets also show a mix of positive and negative sentiments, but overall, there is a slight bias towards positive comments. The tweet on July 16th mentions a price target raise for $mcd, which could indicate a potential increase in the stock price. Additionally, the tweet on July 17th mentions that McDonald's franchisees are pessimistic, but this could also be seen as a contrarian indicator, as the stock price may rise if the franchisees are overly pessimistic. Overall, based on the data and tweets, it is predicted that the closing price of $mcd will rise on July 18th. 0.6 0.7 -0.0 -0.9 1.4 1.8 2.1 2.5 2.5 2.6\nFinal Answer: The final answer is Rise.

    "output": "Yes",
    "pred_output": " Yes\nExplanation: The headline suggests that gold is moving away from a high, which implies a decrease in price. The phrase \"edges away\" also implies a downward movement. Additionally, the fact that the dollar is \"steadying\" implies that the dollar is strengthening, which can also lead to a decrease in the price of gold. Overall, the headline implies a direction down for the price of gold.  Text: gold prices fall as investors seek safety in bonds\nAnswer: Yes\nExplanation: The headline explicitly states that gold prices are falling, which implies a direction down. The phrase \"seek safety in bonds\" also implies that investors are moving away from gold, which further supports the idea that the price of gold is decreasing.  Text: gold prices rise as investors seek safe-haven assets\nAnswer: No\nExplanation: The headline explicitly states that gold prices are rising, which implies a direction up. The phrase \"seek safe-haven assets\" implies that investors are moving towards gold, which further supports the idea that the price of gold is increasing.  Text: gold prices steady as investors await central bank decisions\nAnswer: No\nExplanation: The headline does not imply a direction up or down for the price of gold. The phrase \"steady\" implies that the price of gold is not changing, and the fact that investors are \"awaiting central bank decisions\" implies that the price of gold may be influenced by external factors, but does not provide a clear direction.  Text: gold prices drop as dollar strengthens\nAnswer: Yes\nExplanation: The headline explicitly states that gold prices are dropping, which implies a direction down. The phrase \"dollar strengthens\" implies that the dollar is becoming more valuable, which can lead to a decrease in the price of gold.  Text: gold prices rise as investors seek safe-haven assets amid global uncertainty\nAnswer: Yes\nExplanation: The headline explicitly states that gold prices are rising, which implies a direction up. The phrase \"seek safe-haven assets\" implies that investors are moving towards gold, which further supports the idea that the price of gold is increasing. The phrase \"amid global uncertainty\" implies that investors are seeking a safe-haven asset, which is gold.  Text: gold prices fall as investors turn to stocks\nAnswer: Yes\nExplanation: The headline explicitly states that gold prices are falling, which implies a direction down. The phrase \"investors turn to stocks\" implies that investors are moving away from gold and towards stocks, which further supports the idea that the price of gold is decreasing.

the total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2005?\nAnswer: $ 31 million\nQuestion: what was the total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2007, 2006, and 2005?\nAnswer: $ 52 million + $ 111 million + $ 31 million = $ 194 million\nFinal Question: What was the total intrinsic value of options exercised during the period from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2007?\nAnswer: $ 194 million\nFinal Answer: The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the period from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2007 was $ 194 million. This is the sum of the total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2005 ($ 31 million), 2006 ($ 111 million), and 2007 ($ 52 million). This information is provided in the context of the company's financial filings and is used to calculate the total intrinsic value of options exercised during the period from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2007. The weighted-average remaining contractual life was approximately 4.2 years. At December 31, 2007, there were approximately 13,788,000 options in total that were vested and are expected to vest. The weighted-average exercise price of such options was $ 62.07 per share, the weighted-average remaining contractual life was approximately 5.2 years, and the aggregate intrinsic value at December 31, 2007 was approximately $ 92 million. Stock options granted in 2005 include options for 30,000 shares that were granted to non-employee directors that year. No such options were granted in 2006 or 2007. Awards granted to non-employee directors in 2007 include 20,944 deferred stock units awarded under the outside directors deferred stock unit plan. A deferred stock unit is a phantom share of our common stock, which requires liability accounting treatment under SFAS 123R until such awards are paid to the participants as cash. As there are no vestings or service requirements on these awards, total compensation expense is recognized in full on all awarded units on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $ 11.37, $ 10.75 and $ 9.83 per option, respectively. To determine stock-based compensation expense under SFAS 123R, the grant-date fair value is applied to the options granted with a reduction made for estimated forfeitures. At December 31, 2006 and 2005 options for 10,743,000 and 13,582,000 shares of common stock, respectively, were exercisable at a weighted-average price of $ 58.38 and $ 56.58, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $ 52 million, $ 111 million and $ 31 million, respectively. At December 31, 2007 the aggregate intrinsic value of all options outstanding and exercisable was $ 94 million and $ 87 million, respectively. Cash received from option exercises under all incentive plans for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $ 111 million, $ 233 million and $ 98 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for tax deduction purposes from option exercises under all incentive plans for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $ 39 million, $ 82 million and $ 34 million, respectively. There were no options granted in excess of market value in 2007, 2006 or 2005. Shares of common stock available during the next year for the granting of options and other awards under the incentive plans were 40,116,726 at December 31, 2007. Total shares of PNC common stock authorized for future issuance under equity compensation plans totaled 41,787,400 shares at December 31, 2007, which includes shares available for issuance under the incentive plans, the employee stock purchase plan as described below, and a director plan. During 2007, we issued approximately 2.1 million shares from treasury stock in connection with stock option exercise activity. As with past exercise activity, we intend to utilize treasury stock for future stock option exercises. As discussed in Note 1 Accounting Policies, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 prospectively to all employee awards including stock"

The tweet about the long-term durability of the Medtronic Corevalve system also suggests that the company is doing well. Additionally, the inc-5, inc-10, inc-15, inc-20, inc-25, and inc-30 values are all positive, indicating that the stock has been increasing over the past few weeks. Therefore, it is likely that the closing price of $mdt will continue to rise. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02. 2014-04-02"

approximately $ 415.0 million of shares of our common stock, which includes the $ 250.0 million of shares that we repurchased from certain selling stockholders on february 10, 2016. in order to achieve operational synergies, we expect cash outlays related to our integration plans to be approximately $ 290.0 million in 2016. these cash outlays are necessary to achieve our integration goals of net annual pre-tax operating profit synergies of $ 350.0 million by the end of the third year post-closing date. also as discussed in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements, as of december 31, 2015, a short-term liability of $ 50.0 million and long-term liability of $ 264.6 million related to durom cup product liability claims was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. we expect to continue paying these claims over the next few years. we expect to be reimbursed a portion of these payments for product liability claims from insurance carriers. as of december 31, 2015, we have received a portion of the insurance proceeds we estimate we will recover. we have a long-term receivable of $ 95.3 million remaining for future expected reimbursements from our insurance carriers. we also had a short-term liability of $ 33.4 million related to biomet metal-on-metal hip implant claims. at december 31, 2015, we had ten tranches of senior notes outstanding as follows ( dollars in millions ) : principal interest rate maturity date.\n|principal|interest rate|maturity date|\n|$ 500.0|1.450% ( 1.450 % )|april 1 2017|\n|1150.0|2.000|april 1 2018|\n|500.0|4.625|november 30

2039|\n|1250.0|4.450|august 15 2045|\nwe issued $ 7.65 billion of senior notes in march 2015 ( the 201cmerger notes 201d ), the proceeds of which were used to finance a portion of the cash consideration payable in the biomet merger, pay merger related fees and expenses and pay a portion of biomet 2019s funded debt. on june 24, 2015, we also borrowed $ 3.0 billion on a u.s. term loan ( 201cu.s. term loan 201d ) to fund the biomet merger. we may, at our option, redeem our senior notes, in whole or in part, at any time upon payment of the principal, any applicable make-whole premium, and accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. in addition, the merger notes and the 3.375% ( 3.375 % ) senior notes due 2021 may be redeemed at our option without any make-whole premium at specified dates ranging from one month to six months in advance of the scheduled maturity date. we have a $ 4.35 billion credit agreement ( 201ccredit agreement 201d ) that contains : ( i ) a 5-year unsecured u.s. term loan facility ( 201cu.s. term loan facility 201d ) in the principal amount of $ 3.0 billion, and ( ii ) a 5-year unsecured multicurrency revolving facility ( 201cmulticurrency revolving facility 201d ) in the principal amount of $ 1.35 billion. the multicurrency revolving facility will mature in may 2019, with two one-year extensions available at our option. borrowings under the multicurrency revolving facility may be used for general corporate purposes. there were no borrowings outstanding under the multicurrency revolving facility as of december 31, 2015. the u.s. term loan facility will mature in june 2020, with principal payments due beginning september 30, 2015, as follows : $ 75.0 million on a quarterly basis during the first three years, $ 112.5 million on a quarterly basis during the fourth year, and $ 412.5 million on a quarterly basis during the fifth year. in 2015, we paid $ 500.0 million in principal under the u.s. term loan facility, resulting in $ 2.5 billion in outstanding borrowings as of december 31, we and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the borrowers under the credit agreement. borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at floating rates based upon indices determined by the currency of the borrowings plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term credit rating, or at an alternate base rate, or, in the case of borrowings under the multicurrency revolving facility only, at a fixed rate determined through a competitive bid process. the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement, including, among other things, limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. financial covenants include a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda ratio of no greater than 5.0 to 1.0 through june 24, 2016 and no greater than 4.5 to 1.0 thereafter. if

exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure on a basis intended to be.\nQuestion: what was the ratio of the fair value of derivative receivables reported on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31, 2018 and 2017.\nAnswer: The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the consolidated balance sheets was $54.2 billion and $56.5 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Therefore, the ratio of the fair value of derivative receivables reported on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2018 and 2017 is:\n\n$54.2 billion / $56.5 billion = 0.96 or 96% (rounded to two decimal places) [1]\n[1] The ratio is rounded to two decimal places, as the question does not specify the number of decimal places to which the answer should be rounded. However, in practice, the ratio would typically be rounded to one or two significant figures, depending on the context and the level of precision required. In this case, the ratio is rounded to two decimal places to provide a more precise answer. [2]\n[2] The ratio is calculated by dividing the fair value of derivative receivables at December 31, 2018 by the fair value of derivative receivables at December 31, 2017. This ratio provides a measure of the change in the fair value of derivative receivables over the two-year period. [3]\n[3] The ratio is not a measure of the firm's credit risk or exposure, but rather a measure of the change in the fair value of derivative receivables over time. The firm's credit risk or exposure is a separate measure that is calculated using different metrics, such as peak, derivative risk equivalent (DRE), and average exposure (AVG). [4]\n[4] The firm's credit risk or exposure is not directly related to the fair value of derivative receivables, but rather is a measure of the potential loss that the firm could incur if a counterparty defaults on its obligations. The firm's credit risk or exposure is calculated using a variety of metrics, including peak, DRE, and AVG, which take into account the firm's netting and collateral arrangements with its counterparties. [5]\n[5] The firm's credit risk or exposure is not a measure of the firm's financial performance or profitability, but rather is a measure of the firm's risk management practices and its ability to manage its credit risk. The firm's financial performance or profitability is measured using different metrics, such as revenue, net income, and return on equity. [6]\n[6] The firm's credit risk or exposure is not a measure of the firm's creditworthiness or its ability to borrow money, but rather is a measure of the firm's risk management practices and its ability to manage its credit risk. The firm's creditworthiness or its ability to borrow money is measured using different metrics, such as credit ratings, debt-to-equity ratio, and interest coverage ratio. [7]\n[7] The firm's credit risk or exposure is not a measure of the firm's liquidity or its ability to meet its short-term obligations, but rather is a measure of the firm's risk management practices and its ability to manage its credit risk. The firm's liquidity or its ability to meet its short-term obligations is measured using different metrics, such as cash flow, current ratio, and quick ratio. [8]\n[8] The firm's credit risk or exposure is not a measure of the firm's solvency or its ability to meet its long-term obligations, but rather is a measure of the firm's risk management practices and its ability to manage its credit risk. The firm's solvency or its ability to meet its long-term obligations is measured using different metrics, such as debt-to-equity ratio, interest coverage ratio, and cash flow. [9]\n[9] The firm's credit risk or exposure is not a measure of the firm's financial leverage or its ability to take on debt, but rather is a measure of the firm's risk management practices and its ability to manage its credit risk. The firm's financial leverage or its ability to take on debt is measured using different metrics, such as debt-to-equity ratio, interest coverage ratio, and cash flow. [10]\n[10] The firm's credit risk or exposure is not a measure of the firm's profitability or its ability to generate earnings, but rather is a measure of the firm's risk management practices and its ability to manage its credit risk. The firm's profitability or its ability to generate earnings is measured using different metrics, such as revenue, net income, and return on equity. [11]\n[11] The firm's credit risk or exposure is not a measure of the firm's credit rating or its ability to borrow money, but rather is a measure of the firm's risk management practices and its ability to manage its credit risk. The firm's credit rating or its ability to borrow money is measured using different metrics, such as credit ratings, debt-to-equity ratio, and interest coverage ratio.

It only mentions that gold prices turned positive after a jobs report, which is a news event that may have affected the price of gold, but it does not provide a constant direction.

The tone is informative and objective, without expressing a positive or negative sentiment. The use of the word \"rise\" is a neutral term that doesn't convey a strong emotional tone.

The recent tweets suggest that the user is looking for custom content, which could be a sign of increased engagement and interest in the stock. Additionally, the user's tweets are not negative or bearish, which could also contribute to the upward trend. Therefore, I project that the closing price of $nee will rise at 2020-05-28."

The social media posts suggest that there is a mix of positive and negative sentiment, but the overall tone is more bearish. The posts also mention earnings, economic reports, and Fed speak, which could be affecting the stock price. Additionally, the post on 2015-01-07 mentions a large trade on $bac, which could be a sign of increased selling pressure. Therefore, based on the analysis, it is likely that the closing price of $bac will descend at 2015-01-16."

The carrying value of PNC's investment in BlackRock at December 31, 2009 was $5.8 billion. Therefore, the recognized increase in value as a pretax gain in the fourth quarter of 2009 equaled $1.076 billion / $5.8 billion = 18.5% of the total carrying value of PNC's investment in BlackRock....

However, the net derivative receivables (after deducting cash collateral) increased from $40,415 million in 2017 to $38,891 million in 2018. The net derivative receivables after deducting all collateral (including liquid securities and other cash collateral) increased from $40,415 million in 2017 to $38,891 million in 2018. The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the consolidated balance sheets was $54.2 billion and $56.5 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The net derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the firm. However, in management's view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities and other cash collateral held by the firm aggregating $15.3 billion and $16.1 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, that may be used as security when the fair value of the client's exposure is in the firm's favor. In addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph, the firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client's derivative contracts move in the firm's favor. The derivative receivables fair value, net of all collateral, also does not include other credit enhancements, such as letters of credit. For additional information on the firm's use of collateral agreements, refer to Note 5. While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure. To capture the potential future variability of credit exposure, the firm calculates, on a client-by-client basis, three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss: peak, derivative risk equivalent (DRE), and average exposure (AVG). These measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits, where applicable. Peak represents a conservative measure of potential exposure to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% (97.5%) confidence level over the life of the transaction. Peak is the primary measure used by the firm for setting of credit limits for derivative contracts, senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management. DRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure on a basis intended to be. AVG exposure is a measure that expresses the average exposure over the life of the transaction. The firm also calculates a measure of potential derivatives-related credit loss, which is the sum of the peak, DRE, and AVG exposures. This measure is used to assess the potential credit risk associated with the firm's derivative receivables. The firm's derivative receivables are subject to various risks, including credit risk, market risk, and operational risk. The firm's credit risk is primarily related to the risk that the firm's counterparties may default on their obligations. The firm's market risk is primarily related to the risk that the firm's derivative contracts may lose value due to changes in market conditions. The firm's operational risk is primarily related to the risk that the firm's derivative contracts may be subject to errors or other operational issues. The firm's derivative receivables are also subject to various regulatory requirements, including capital requirements and reporting requirements. The firm's derivative receivables are also subject to various accounting requirements, including the requirement to recognize the fair value of the derivative contracts on the firm's balance sheet. The firm's derivative receivables are also subject to various tax requirements, including the requirement to recognize the tax implications of the derivative contracts. The firm's derivative receivables are also subject to various other requirements, including the requirement to maintain adequate collateral and the requirement to comply with various regulatory and accounting requirements. The firm's derivative receivables are also subject to various other risks, including the risk of counterparty default, the risk of market volatility, and the risk of operational errors. The firm's derivative receivables are also subject to various other requirements, including the requirement to maintain adequate collateral and the requirement to comply with various regulatory and accounting requirements.

( b ) alberta energy company day ahead index. integrated gas our integrated gas strategy is to link stranded natural gas resources with areas where a supply gap is emerging due to declining production and growing demand. our integrated gas operations include marketing and transportation of products manufactured from natural gas, such as lng and methanol, primarily in west africa, the u.s. and europe. our most significant lng investment is our 60 percent ownership in a production facility in equatorial guinea, which sells lng under a long-term contract at prices tied to henry hub natural gas prices. in 2009, the gross sales from the plant were 3.9 million metric tonnes, while in 2008, its first full year of operations, the plant sold 3.4 million metric tonnes. industry estimates of 2009 lng trade are approximately 185 million metric tonnes. more lng production facilities and tankers were under construction in 2009. as a result of the sharp worldwide economic downturn in 2008, continued weak economies are expected to lower natural gas consumption in various countries ; therefore, affecting near-term demand for lng. long-term lng supply continues to be in demand as markets seek the benefits of clean burning natural gas. market prices for lng are not reported or posted. in general, lng delivered to the u.s. is tied to henry hub prices and will track with changes in u.s. natural gas prices, while lng sold in europe and asia is indexed to crude oil prices and will track the movement of those prices. we own a 45 percent interest in a methanol plant located in equatorial guinea through our investment in ampco. gross sales of methanol from the plant totaled 960374 metric tonnes in 2009 and 792794 metric tonnes in 2008. methanol demand has a direct impact on ampco 2019s earnings. because global demand for methanol is rather limited, changes in the supply-demand balance can have a significant impact on sales prices. the 2010 chemical markets associates, inc. estimates world demand for methanol in 2009 was 41 million metric tonnes. our plant capacity is 1.1 million, or about 3 percent of total demand. refining, marketing and transportation rm&t segment income depends largely on our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin, refinery throughputs and retail marketing gross margins for gasoline, distillates and merchandise..\nConversations: \nq0: what was the net change in value of the average price of the wti crude oil benchmark from 2008 to 2009? -37.66\nq1: what was the value in 2009? 99.75\nQuestion: what was the percent decrease?\nAnswer: \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 62.09. I hope it is correct."

percentage of long-term debt in relation to the total contractual obligations, we need to divide the long-term debt by the total contractual obligations and multiply by 100.\n\nLong-term debt: $104.3 million\nTotal contractual obligations: $591.6 million\n\nPercentage = (Long-term debt / Total contractual obligations) * 100\n= ($104.3 million / $591.6 million) * 100\n= 17.6%\n\nSo, the long-term debt represents approximately 17.6% of the total contractual obligations."

So, the net change during 2013 is:\n\n$136,098 - $160,468 = -$24,370\n\nThis means that the total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $24,370 during 2013."

The difference is 3824 - 1750 = 2074 shares. The average price paid per share in October was $23.30, and the average price paid per share in November was $23.77. The difference in the total amount spent is 2074 * ($23.77 - $23.30) = $2074 * $0.47 = $976.78. Therefore, $976.78 more was spent on purchased shares in October than in November. (Note: The maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the plans or programs is the same for both months, which is $338421933.) Final Answer: The final answer is $976.78. I hope it is correct."

The analysis is based on the following factors:\n\n1. The closing price of $gd has been increasing over the past few days, indicating a bullish trend.\n2. The social media posts suggest that there is a growing interest in gold and other precious metals, which could lead to an increase in demand and prices.\n3. The posts also mention the potential for a \"blue sky discovery\" and future royalty cashflows, which could be a positive catalyst for the price of $gd.\n4. The Elliott wave analysis suggests that the price of $gd is in an upward trend and is likely to continue to rise.\n\nOverall, the analysis suggests that the closing price of $gd is likely to ascend at 2020-04-13. However, it is important to note that the stock market is inherently unpredictable and there is always a risk of unexpected events that could affect the price of $gd. Therefore, it is important to do your own research and consider your own risk tolerance before making any investment decisions."

the year ended december 31, 2013 from $ 7.38 billion for the year ended december 31, 2012. the increased levels were primarily the result of higher levels of cash collateral provided in connection

This may require extracting information from the context and performing mathematical calculations. Please take into account the information provided in the preceding questions and their answers when formulating your response:\nContext: the analysis of our depreciation studies. changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively. under group depreciation, the historical cost ( net of salvage ) of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using ( i ) inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ( ii ) the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies. the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes. because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired, we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate. in addition, we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient ( or in excess ) of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies. any deficiency ( or excess ) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets. for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business, a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions : ( i ) is unusual, ( ii ) is material in amount, and ( iii ) varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies. a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations. when we purchase an asset, we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use. however, many of our assets are self-constructed. a large portion of our capital expenditures is for replacement of existing track assets and other road properties, which is typically performed by our employees, and for track line expansion and other capacity projects. costs that are directly attributable to capital projects ( including overhead costs ) are capitalized. direct costs that are capitalized as part of self- constructed assets include material, labor, and work equipment. indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset. general and administrative expenditures are expensed as incurred. normal repairs and maintenance are also expensed as incurred, while costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset, improve the safety of our operations or improve operating efficiency are capitalized. these costs are allocated using appropriate statistical bases. total expense for repairs and maintenance incurred was $ 2.3 billion for 2013, $ 2.1 billion for 2012, and $ 2.2 billion for 2011. assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease. 12. accounts payable and other current liabilities dec. 31, dec. 31, millions 2013 2012. <table class='wikitable'><tr><td>1</td><td>millions</td><td>dec. 31 2013</td><td>dec. 312012</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>accounts payable</td><td>$ 803</td><td>$ 825</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>income and other taxes payable</td><td>491</td><td>368</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>accrued wages and vacation</td><td>385</td><td>376</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>dividends payable</td><td>356</td><td>318</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>accrued casualty costs</td><td>207</td><td>213</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>interest payable</td><td>169</td><td>172</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>equipment rents payable</td><td>96</td><td>95</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>other</td><td>579</td><td>556</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>total accounts payable and othercurrent liabilities</td><td>$ 3086</td><td>$ 2923</td></tr></table>.\nConversations: \nq0: what was the net change in value of total expenses for repairs and maintenance from 2012 to 2013?

caused by adverse movements in market variables, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and securities and commodities prices, taking into account the liquidity of the financial instruments. results from daily var, weekly stress tests, issuer credit spreads and default risk calculations, as well as other factors, are used to determine appropriate capital levels. market risk capital is allocated to each business segment based on its risk assessment. the increase in market risk capital in 2012 was driven by increased risk in the synthetic credit portfolio. see market risk management on pages 163 2013169 of this annual report for more information about these market risk measures. operational risk capital operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors or external events. the operational risk capital model is based on actual losses and potential scenario-based losses, with adjustments to the capital calculation to reflect changes in the quality of the control environment. the increase in operational risk capital in 2012 was primarily due to continued model enhancements to better capture large historical loss events, including mortgage-related litigation costs. the increases that occurred during 2012 will be fully reflected in average operational risk capital in 2013. see operational risk management on pages 175 2013176 of this annual report for more information about operational risk. private equity risk capital capital is allocated to privately- and publicly-held securities, third-party fund investments, and commitments in the private equity portfolio, within the corporate/private equity segment, to cover the potential loss associated with a decline in equity markets and related asset devaluations. in addition to negative market fluctuations, potential losses in private equity investment portfolios can be magnified by liquidity risk..\nQuestion: in 2012 what was the ratio of the 3 credit risk to the market risk\nAnswer: The credit risk capital in 2012 was $46.6 billion and the market risk capital was $17.5 billion. Therefore, the ratio of credit risk to market risk is:\n\n$46.6 billion / $17.5 billion = 2.66\n\nSo, the credit risk was approximately 2.66 times the market risk in 2012."

The author is presenting a balanced view, stating that the outcome of the investment is uncertain (\"can go either way imo\"). There is no clear positive or negative tone in the post. The author is simply sharing their opinion and providing context, without expressing a strong emotional or biased view. The use of \"imo\" (in my opinion) also suggests a neutral tone, as it implies that the author is sharing their subjective view rather than making a definitive statement. Overall, the post is informative and objective, rather than emotional or sensational. Therefore, the sentiment is classified as Neutral."

Therefore, the ratio of the total brokerage payables to total brokerage receivables is $64571 / $35450 = 1.82 or 182%.

To find the percentage change, we can use the formula:\n\nPercentage change = ((New value - Old value) / Old value) * 100\n\nPlugging in the numbers, we get:\n\nPercentage change = ((44 - 48) / 48) * 100 = (-4 / 48) * 100 = -8.33%\n\nSo, the rental expense for operating leases decreased by 8.33% from 2009 to 2010. (Note: A negative percentage change indicates a decrease.) Final Answer: The final answer is -8.33%. I hope it is correct."

Despite these challenges, the company is taking measures to improve its competitiveness and profitability.\nThe sentiment in this sentence is negative. The use of words such as \"below\", \"decreased\", \"challenging\", and \"decline\" convey a sense of disappointment and difficulty. The fact that the company's performance is not meeting expectations and is being affected by external factors also contributes to the negative sentiment. However, the sentence also mentions that the company is taking measures to improve its competitiveness and profitability, which could be seen as a positive note, but overall the sentiment is still negative. Therefore, I would classify it as negative."

6372814 ; 6664308 ; and 6818020. on june 13, 2007, the court granted our motion for summary judgment on the invalidity of the asserted claims of u.s. patent nos. 6174934 ; 6372814 ; and 6664308 by ruling that all of the asserted claims are invalid for indefiniteness. on august 19, 2008, the court granted our motion for summary judgment of non- infringement of certain claims of u.s. patent no. 6818020, reducing the number of claims at issue in the suit to five. we continue to believe that our defenses against infringement of the remaining claims are valid and meritorious, and we intend to defend this lawsuit vigorously. in addition to certain claims related to the durom cup discussed above, we are also subject to product liability and other claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, for which we maintain insurance, subject to self- insured retention limits. we establish accruals for product liability and other claims in conjunction with outside counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for open claims, related fees and claims incurred but not reported. while it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these cases, it is the opinion of management that, upon ultimate resolution, liabilities from these cases in excess of those recorded, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. government investigations in march 2005, the u.s. department of justice through the u.s. attorney 2019s office in newark, new jersey commenced an investigation of us and four other orthopaedic companies pertaining to consulting contracts, professional service agreements and other agreements by which remuneration is provided to orthopaedic surgeons. on september 27, 2007, we reached a settlement with the government to resolve all claims related to this investigation. as part of the settlement, we entered into a settlement agreement with the u.s. through the u.s. department of justice and the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services ( the 201coig-hhs 201d ). in addition, we entered into a deferred prosecution agreement ( the 201cdpa 201d ) with the u.s. attorney 2019s office for the district of new jersey ( the 201cu.s. attorney 201d ) and a corporate integrity agreement ( the 201ccia 201d ) with the oig- hhs. we did not admit any wrongdoing, plead guilty to any criminal charges or pay any criminal fines as part of the settlement. we settled all civil and administrative claims related to the federal investigation by making a settlement payment to the u.s. government of $ 169.5 million. under the terms of the dpa, the u.s. attorney filed a criminal complaint in the u.s. district court for the district of new jersey charging us with conspiracy to commit violations of the anti-kickback statute ( 42 u.s.c. a7 1320a-7b ) during the years 2002 through 2006. the court deferred prosecution of the criminal complaint during the 18-month term of the dpa. the u.s. attorney will seek dismissal of the criminal complaint after the 18-month period if we comply with the provisions of the dpa. the dpa provides for oversight by a federally-appointed monitor. under the cia, which has a term of five years, we agreed, among other provisions, to continue the operation of our enhanced corporate compliance program, designed to promote compliance with federal healthcare program z i m m e r h o l d i n g s, i n c. 2 0 0 8 f o r m 1 0 - k a n n u a l r e p o r t notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) %%transmsg*** transmitting job : c48761 pcn : 060000000 ***%%pcmsg|60 |00012|yes|no|02/24/2009 06:10|0|0|page is valid, no graphics -- color : d|.\nQuestion: in 2008, america's total depreciation & amortization is what percent of europe and asia combined?\nAnswer: 275.1 / (57.0 + 25.6) = 275.1 / 82.6 = 3.33 ( rounded to two decimal places ). so, the answer is 333 %.

( \"o'reilly\" ) is a leading retailer of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, and accessories. the company operates a chain of retail stores and offers a wide range of products and services to its customers. o'reilly is a publicly traded company listed on the new york stock exchange ( \"nyse\" ) under the ticker symbol orly. o'reilly's financial performance has been strong over the years, with the company consistently delivering profitable results. the company's stock has also performed well, with the cumulative total shareholder return assuming the investment of $ 100 on december 31, 2010, and the reinvestment of dividends thereafter, if any, in the company's common stock versus the standard and poor's s&p 500 retail index ( \"s&p 500 retail index\" ) and the standard and poor's s&p 500 index ( \"s&p 500\" ), as shown in the graph below.\nFinal Question: \nwhat is the total cumulative return of o'reilly automotive inc. from 2010 to 2015, assuming the investment of $ 100 on december 31, 2010, and the reinvestment of dividends thereafter, if any, in the company's common stock? \nPlease provide a response to the final question, taking into account the information provided in the preceding questions and their answers, as well as the context and posttext. \n\nSolution:\nTo find the total cumulative return of O'Reilly Automotive Inc. from 2010 to 2015, we need to calculate the cumulative return for each year and then add them up.\n\nThe cumulative return for each year can be calculated as follows:\n\n2010: $100 (initial investment)\n2011: $132 (return of $32)\n2012: $148 (return of $16)\n2013: $213 (return of $65)\n2014: $319 (return of $106)\n2015: $419 (return of $100)\n\nThe total cumulative return can be calculated by adding up the cumulative returns for each year:\n\n$100 + $32 = $132\n$132 + $16 = $148\n$148 + $65 = $213\n$213 + $106 = $319\n$319 + $100 = $419\n\nTherefore, the total cumulative return of O'Reilly Automotive Inc. from 2010 to 2015 is $419, assuming the investment of $100 on December 31, 2010, and the reinvestment of dividends thereafter, if any, in the company's common stock. \n\nAnswer: The total cumulative return of O'Reilly Automotive Inc. from 2010 to 2015 is $419. \n\nNote: The cumulative return is the total return of the investment over the entire period, assuming the reinvestment of dividends and the initial investment of $100 on December 31, 2010. The cumulative return is not the same as the annual return, which is the return for a single year. The cumulative return takes into account the compounding effect of the returns over the entire period. \n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $419. I hope it is correct. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can help you with. \n\nThank you for your time and consideration. \n\nBest regards, \n[Your Name] \n\nPlease note that this response is based on the information provided in the context and posttext, and it is not a financial advice.

The company's revenue also fell by 5. 1 % to EUR 1. 3 billion in 2005 compared to EUR 1. 4 billion in 2003. The company's net income decreased by 12. 1 % to EUR 1. 1 billion in 2005 compared to EUR 1. 2 billion in 2003.\nThis sentence is negative. The use of words such as \"decreased\", \"fell\", and \"decreased\" convey a sense of decline and loss, indicating a negative sentiment. The numbers also support this interpretation, as the EPS, revenue, and net income all decreased from 2003 to 2005.

The use of the word \"laying off\" implies a significant and potentially painful change for the company's employees, which is a negative development. The phrase \"declining sales\" also suggests that the company is struggling financially, which is a negative trend. Overall, the tone of the sentence is one of concern and uncertainty. 2021-02-26 14:45:14\nThe company's quarterly earnings report showed a significant increase in revenue and net income, driven by strong sales of its new product line.\nThis sentence is positive. The use of the words \"significant increase\" and \"strong sales\" implies a positive development for the company's financial performance. The phrase \"driven by\" suggests that the company's new product line is a key factor in the company's success, which is a positive sign.

The use of the word \"volatile\" implies a lack of stability or predictability, which is a neutral characteristic. The phrase \"concerns over the company's financial health\" suggests that there are potential issues with the company's financial performance, but the sentence does not take a clear positive or negative stance. Overall, the tone of the sentence is one of caution and uncertainty. 2021-02-26 14:45:14\nThe company's new product line has been met with widespread critical acclaim, with many reviewers praising its innovative design and features.\nThis sentence is positive. The use of the word \"widespread\" implies a broad and general positive response, while the phrase \"critical acclaim\" suggests that the product has received high praise from experts and critics. The phrase \"innovative design and features\" also suggests that the product is unique and impressive, which is a positive characteristic.

The use of the phrase \"major restructuring effort\" implies a significant change, but the sentence does not take a clear positive or negative stance. The phrase \"improving the company's financial performance and increasing efficiency\" suggests that the restructuring effort is intended to have a positive impact, but the sentence does not provide enough information to determine whether the effort will be successful.

The tweets also show a mix of positive and negative sentiments, but overall, there are more positive tweets than negative ones. The tweets about IBM's blockchain technology, partnerships, and patents suggest that the company is making progress and has a strong future ahead. Additionally, the tweets about IBM's stock price and the Dow Jones index suggest that the market is performing well. Based on this analysis, it is likely that the closing price of IBM will rise on September 7, 2017. However, it's important to note that this is just a prediction and not a guarantee. The actual closing price may differ."

price of impella cardiosystems assuming all contingent consideration is earned, in millions?\nAnswer: The total purchase price of impella cardiosystems would be approximately $ 56.7 million, assuming all contingent consideration is earned. This is calculated as follows:\n$ 45.1 million (purchase price) + $ 5.6 million (contingent payment made in 2007) + $ 5.6 million (contingent payment triggered in 2008) + $ 11.2 million (additional contingent payments) = $ 56.7 million. Note that $ 1.8 million of the contingent payments must be made in cash, which would reduce the total purchase price by that amount.

The tweets also suggest a positive sentiment towards $wmt, with mentions of a \"nice flow and chart\" and a \"little bit of a price and p/l cushion\" before earnings. Additionally, the tweet about Morgan Stanley maintaining an \"overweight\" rating on $wmt suggests that analysts are optimistic about the company's prospects. Overall, the data and tweets suggest that the closing price of $wmt is likely to surge on 2020-05-06."

    "pred_output": " Rise\nExplanation: The closing price of $ups on 2015-07-07 is 0.4, which is higher than the previous day's closing price of 0.3. The tweet on 2015-07-02 mentions $ups, but it does not provide any specific information about the stock's performance. The tweet on 2015-07-05 is about $wfc, not $ups. Therefore, based on the data, it is likely that the closing price of $ups will rise on 2015-07-07. However, it is important to note that this is a prediction based on historical data and may not be accurate. It is always important to do your own research and consider multiple factors before making any investment decisions.  Final Answer: The final answer is Rise.

We can do this by dividing the amount for 2009 by the amount for 2010:\n\n$478,269 (2009) ÷ $778,320 (2010) = 0.616\n\nTo convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\n0.616 × 100 = 61.6%\n\nSo, the principal payments required for 2009 were 61.6% of those for 2010. ###### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### ##### #####
