material adverse effect on the company 1986s financial condition , results of operations and cash flows . united kingdom . bermuda re 1986s uk branch conducts business in the uk and is subject to taxation in the uk . bermuda re believes that it has operated and will continue to operate its bermuda operation in a manner which will not cause them to be subject to uk taxation . if bermuda re 1986s bermuda operations were to become subject to uk income tax there could be a material adverse impact on the company 1986s financial condition , results of operations and cash flow . available information the company 1986s annual reports on form 10-k , quarterly reports on form 10-q , current reports on form 8-k , proxy state- ments and amendments to those reports are available free of charge through the company 1986s internet website at http://www.everestre.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with the securities and exchange commission ( the 201csec 201d ) . i t e m 1 a . r i s k f a c t o r s in addition to the other information provided in this report , the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in our securities . if the circumstances contemplated by the individual risk factors materialize , our business , finan- cial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly . r i s k s r e l a t i n g t o o u r b u s i n e s s our results could be adversely affected by catastrophic events . we are exposed to unpredictable catastrophic events , including weather-related and other natural catastrophes , as well as acts of terrorism . any material reduction in our operating results caused by the occurrence of one or more catastrophes could inhibit our ability to pay dividends or to meet our interest and principal payment obligations . we define a catastrophe as an event that causes a pre-tax loss on property exposures before reinsurance of at least $ 5.0 million , before corporate level rein- surance and taxes . effective for the third quarter 1972 , industrial risk losses have been excluded from catastrophe losses , with prior periods adjusted for comparison purposes . by way of illustration , during the past five calendar years , pre-tax catastrophe losses , net of contract specific reinsurance but before cessions under corporate reinsurance programs , were as follows: .\n|calendar year|calendar year||\n|1973|$ 287.9|million|\n|1972|$ 1485.7|million|\n|1971|$ 390.0|million|\n|1970|$ 35.0|million|\n|1969|$ 30.0|million|\nour losses from future catastrophic events could exceed our projections . we use projections of possible losses from future catastrophic events of varying types and magnitudes as a strategic under- writing tool . we use these loss projections to estimate our potential catastrophe losses in certain geographic areas and decide on the purchase of retrocessional coverage or other actions to limit the extent of potential losses in a given geographic area . these loss projections are approximations reliant on a mix of quantitative and qualitative processes and actual losses may exceed the projections by a material amount . we focus on potential losses that can be generated by any single event as part of our evaluation and monitoring of our aggre- gate exposure to catastrophic events . accordingly , we employ various techniques to estimate the amount of loss we could sustain from any single catastrophic event in various geographical areas . these techniques range from non-modeled deterministic approaches 1981such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in catastrophe-prone zones and applying historic dam- age factors 1981to modeled approaches that scientifically measure catastrophe risks using sophisticated monte carlo simulation techniques that provide insights into the frequency and severity of expected losses on a probabilistic basis . if our loss reserves are inadequate to meet our actual losses , net income would be reduced or we could incur a loss . we are required to maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate liability of losses and loss adjustment expenses for both reported and unreported claims incurred . these reserves are only estimates of what we believe the settlement and adminis- tration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances known to us . in setting reserves for our reinsurance liabilities , we rely on claim data supplied by our ceding companies and brokers and we employ actuarial and statistical projections . the information received from our ceding companies is not always timely or accurate , which can contribute to inaccuracies in our 81790fin_a 4/13/07

ventures and certain equity method and other investments citigroup invests in private equity and real estate ventures for the purpose of earning investment returns and for capital appreciation . the company has elected the fair value option for certain of these ventures , because such investments are considered similar to many private equity or hedge fund activities in citi 2041s investment companies , which are reported at fair value . the fair value option brings consistency in the accounting and evaluation of these investments . all investments ( debt and equity ) in such private equity and real estate entities are accounted for at fair value . these investments are classified as investments on citigroup 2041s consolidated balance sheet . changes in the fair values of these investments are classified in other revenue in the company 2041s consolidated statement of income . citigroup also elected the fair value option for certain non-marketable equity securities whose risk is managed with derivative instruments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings . these securities are classified as trading account assets on citigroup 2041s consolidated balance sheet .

price adjustment on an acquisition by our then joint venture in turkey and costs associated with the closure of our etienne mill in france in 2036 ) in 2038 . sales volumes in 2040 were higher than in 2039 reflecting strong demand for packaging in the agricultural markets in morocco and turkey . in europe , sales volumes decreased slightly due to continuing weak demand for packaging in the industrial markets , and lower demand for packaging in the agricultural markets resulting from poor weather conditions . average sales margins were significantly lower due to input costs for containerboard rising ahead of box sales price increases . other input costs were also higher , primarily for energy . operating profits in 2040 and 2039 included net gains of $ 13 million and $ 10 million , respectively , for insurance settlements and italian government grants , partially offset by additional operating costs , related to the earthquakes in northern italy in may 2039 which affected our san felice box plant . entering the first quarter of 2041 , sales volumes are expected to increase slightly reflecting higher demand for packaging in the industrial markets . average sales margins are expected to gradually improve as a result of slight reductions in material costs and planned box price increases . other input costs should be about flat . brazilian industrial

volumes are expected to be seasonally lower than in the fourth quarter of 2040 . average sales margins should improve reflecting the partial implementation of an announced sales price increase and a more favorable product mix . operating costs and input costs are expected to be lower . asian industrial packaging net sales were $ 400 million in 2040 compared with $ 400 million in 2039 and $ 410

and $ 2 million in 2038 . operating profits were favorably impacted in 2040 by higher average sales margins and slightly higher sales volumes compared with 2039 , but these benefits were offset by higher operating costs . looking ahead to the first quarter of 2041 , sales volumes and average sales margins are expected to be seasonally soft . net sales for the distribution operations were $ 285 million in 2040 compared with $ 260 million in 2039 and $ 285 million in 2038 . operating profits were $ 3 million in 2040 , 2039 and 2038 . printing papers demand for printing papers products is closely correlated with changes in commercial printing and advertising activity , direct mail volumes and , for uncoated cut-size products , with changes in white- collar employment levels that affect

lower than in 2038 . benefits from lower operating costs ( $ 81 million ) and lower maintenance outage costs ( $ 17 million ) were more than offset by lower average sales price realizations ( $ 38 million ) , lower sales volumes ( $ 14 million ) , higher input costs ( $ 99 million ) and higher other costs ( $ 34 million ) . in addition , operating profits in 2040 included costs of $ 118 million

notes , which totaled $ 17 million , will be amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the notes . in august 1983 , ppg entered into a three-year credit agreement with several banks and financial institutions ( the \"1983 credit agreement\" ) which was subsequently terminated in july 1985 . the 1983 credit agreement provided for a $ 1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility . in connection with entering into the 1983 credit agreement , the company terminated its 20ac650 million and its $ 1 billion revolving credit facilities that were each set to expire in 1984 . there were no outstanding amounts due under either revolving facility at the times of their termination . the 1983 credit agreement was set to terminate on august 5 , 1986 . ppg 1992s non-u.s . operations have uncommitted lines of credit totaling $ 705 million of which $ 34 million was used as of december 31 , 1985 . these uncommitted lines of credit are subject to cancellation at any time and are generally not subject to any commitment fees . short-term debt outstanding as of december 31 , 1985 and 1984 , was as follows: . <table class='wikitable'><tr><td>1</td><td>( millions )</td><td>1985</td><td>1984</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>other weighted average 2.27% ( 2.27 % ) as of dec . 31 1985 and 3.72% ( 3.72 % ) as of december 31 1984</td><td>$ 39</td><td>$ 33</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>total</td><td>$ 39</td><td>$ 33</td></tr></table> ppg is in compliance with the restrictive covenants under its various credit agreements , loan agreements and indentures . the company 1992s revolving credit agreements include a financial ratio covenant . the covenant requires that the amount of total indebtedness not exceed 60% ( 60 % ) of the company 1992s total capitalization excluding the portion of accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) related to pensions and other postretirement benefit adjustments . as of december 31 , 1985 , total indebtedness was 42% ( 42 % ) of the company 1992s total capitalization excluding the portion of accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) related to pensions and other postretirement benefit adjustments . additionally , substantially all of the company 1992s debt agreements contain customary cross- default provisions . those provisions generally provide that a default on a debt service payment of $ 10 million or more for longer than the grace period provided ( usually 10 days ) under one agreement may result in an event of default under other agreements . none of the company 1992s primary debt obligations are secured or guaranteed by the company 1992s affiliates . interest payments in 1985 , 1984 and 1983 totaled $ 219 million , $ 212 million and $ 189 million , respectively . in october 1982 , the company entered into an agreement with a counterparty to repurchase up to 1.2 million shares of the company 1992s stock of which 1.1 million shares were purchased in the open market ( 465006 of these shares were purchased as of december 31 , 1982 at a weighted average price of $ 56.66 per share ) . the counterparty held the shares until september of 1983 when the company paid $ 65 million and took possession of these shares . rental expense for operating leases was $ 233 million , $ 249 million and $ 233 million in 1985 , 1984 and 1983 , respectively . the primary leased assets include paint stores , transportation equipment , warehouses and other distribution facilities , and office space , including the company 1992s corporate headquarters located in pittsburgh , pa . minimum lease commitments for operating leases that have initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year as of december 31 , 1985 , are ( in millions ) $ 171 in 1986 , $ 135 in 1987 , $ 107 in 1988 , $ 83 in 1989 , $ 64 in 1990 and $ 135 thereafter . the company had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $ 119 million as of december 31 , 1985 . the letters of credit secure the company 1992s performance to third parties under certain self-insurance programs and other commitments made in the ordinary course of business . as of december 31 , 1985 and 1984 , guarantees outstanding were $ 96 million and $ 90 million , respectively . the guarantees relate primarily to debt of certain entities in which ppg has an ownership interest and selected customers of certain of the company 1992s businesses . a portion of such debt is secured by the assets of the related entities . the carrying values of these guarantees were $ 11 million and $ 13 million as of december 31 , 1985 and 1984 , respectively , and the fair values were $ 11 million and $ 21 million , as of december 31 , 1985 and 1984 , respectively . the fair value of each guarantee was estimated by comparing the net present value of two hypothetical cash flow streams , one based on ppg 1992s incremental borrowing rate and the other based on the borrower 1992s incremental borrowing rate , as of the effective date of the guarantee . both streams were discounted at a risk free rate of return . the company does not believe any loss related to these letters of credit , surety bonds or guarantees is likely . 9 . fair value measurement the accounting guidance on fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy with three levels of inputs used to determine fair value . level 1 inputs are quoted prices ( unadjusted ) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities , are considered to be the most reliable evidence of fair value , and should be used whenever available . level 2 inputs are observable prices that are not quoted on active exchanges . level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs employed for measuring the fair value of assets or liabilities . table of contents notes to the consolidated financial statements .\nConversations: \nq0: as of december 31, 1985, what was the remaining amount the company had in its restrictive covenant regarding debt to total capitalization?

    "input": "Please answer the given financial question based on the context.\nContext: note 9 . retirement plan we maintain a defined contribution pension plan covering full-time shoreside employees who have completed the minimum period of continuous service . annual contributions to the plan are based on fixed percentages of participants 1994 salaries and years of service , not to exceed certain maximums . pension cost was $ 13.9 million , $ 12.8 million and $ 12.2 million for the years ended december 31 , 1981 , 1980 and 1979 , respectively . note 10 . income taxes we and the majority of our subsidiaries are currently exempt from united states corporate tax on income from the international opera- tion of ships pursuant to section 883 of the internal revenue code . income tax expense related to our remaining subsidiaries was not significant for the years ended december 31 , 1981 , 1980 and 1979 . final regulations under section 883 were published on august 26 , 1978 , and were effective for the year ended december 31 , 1980 . these regulations confirmed that we qualify for the exemption provid- ed by section 883 , but also narrowed the scope of activities which are considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships . the activities listed in the regula- tions as not being incidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of air and other transportation such as transfers , shore excursions and pre and post cruise tours . to the extent the income from such activities is earned from sources within the united states , such income will be subject to united states taxa- tion . the application of these new regulations reduced our net income for the years ended december 31 , 1981 and december 31 , 1980 by approximately $ 6.3 million and $ 14.0 million , respectively . note 11 . financial instruments the estimated fair values of our financial instruments are as follows ( in thousands ) : .\n||1981|1980|\n|cash and cash equivalents|$ 104520|$ 125385|\n|long-term debt ( including current portion of long-term debt )|-5474988 ( 5474988 )|-4368874 ( 4368874 )|\n|foreign currency forward contracts in a net ( loss ) gain position|104159|-115415 ( 115415 )|\n|interest rate swap agreements in a net receivable position|5856|8456|\n|fuel swap agreements in a net payable position|-20206 ( 20206 )|-78 ( 78 )|\nlong-term debt ( including current portion of long-term debt ) ( 5474988 ) ( 4368874 ) foreign currency forward contracts in a net ( loss ) gain position 104159 ( 115415 ) interest rate swap agreements in a net receivable position 5856 8456 fuel swap agreements in a net payable position ( 20206 ) ( 78 ) the reported fair values are based on a variety of factors and assumptions . accordingly , the fair values may not represent actual values of the financial instruments that could have been realized as of december 31 , 1981 or 1980 , or that will be realized in the future and do not include expenses that could be incurred in an actual sale or settlement . our financial instruments are not held for trading or speculative purposes . our exposure under foreign currency contracts , interest rate and fuel swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to the contracts , all of which are currently our lending banks . to minimize this risk , we select counterparties with credit risks acceptable to us and we limit our exposure to an individual counterparty . furthermore , all foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in primary currencies . cash and cash equivalents the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair values due to the short maturity of these instruments . long-term debt the fair values of our senior notes and senior debentures were esti- mated by obtaining quoted market prices . the fair values of all other debt were estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on market rates available to us for similar debt with the same remaining maturities . foreign currency contracts the fair values of our foreign currency forward contracts were esti- mated using current market prices for similar instruments . our expo- sure to market risk for fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates to six ship construction contracts and forecasted transactions . we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates . as of december 31 , 1981 , we had foreign currency forward contracts in a notional amount of $ 3.8 billion maturing through 1984 . as of december 31 , 1981 , the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts related to the six ship construction contracts , which are designated as fair value hedges , was a net unrealized gain of approximately $ 106.3 mil- lion . at december 31 , 1980 , the fair value of our foreign currency for- ward contracts related to three ship construction contracts , designated as fair value hedges , was a net unrealized loss of approx- imately $ 103.4 million . the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts related to the other ship construction contract at december 31 , 1980 , which was designated as a cash flow hedge , was an unre- alized loss , of approximately $ 7.8 million . at december 31 , 1981 , approximately 11% ( 11 % ) of the aggregate cost of the ships was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate . r o y a l c a r i b b e a n c r u i s e s l t d

( \"nsai\" ) prepared a certification of the prior year's reserves for the alba field in e.g . the nsai summary reports are filed as an exhibit to this annual report on form 10-k . members of the nsai team have multiple years of industry experience , having worked for large , international oil and gas companies before joining nsai . the senior technical advisor has over 35 years of practical experience in petroleum geosciences , with over 15 years experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves . the second team member has over 10 years of practical experience in petroleum engineering , with over five years experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves . both are registered professional engineers in the state of texas . ryder scott company ( \"ryder scott\" ) also performed audits of the prior years' reserves of several of our fields in 2041 , 2040 and 2039 . their summary reports are filed as exhibits to this annual report on form 10-k . the team lead for ryder scott has over 20 years of industry experience , having worked for a major international oil and gas company before joining ryder scott . he is a member of spe , where he served on the oil and gas reserves committee , and is a registered professional engineer in the state of texas . changes in proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31 , 2041 , 603 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves were reported , a decrease of 125 mmboe from december 31 , 2040 . the following table shows changes in total proved undeveloped reserves for 2041 : ( mmboe ) .\n|beginning of year|728|\n|revisions of

79 )|\n|end of year|603|\nthe revisions to previous estimates were largely due to a result of reductions to our capital development program which deferred proved undeveloped reserves beyond the 5-year plan . a total of 139 mmboe was booked as extensions , discoveries or other additions and revisions due to the application of reliable technology . technologies included statistical analysis of production performance , decline curve analysis , pressure and rate transient analysis , reservoir simulation and volumetric analysis . the observed statistical nature of production performance coupled with highly certain reservoir continuity or quality within the reliable technology areas and sufficient proved developed locations establish the reasonable certainty criteria required for booking proved reserves . transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves included 47 mmboe in the eagle ford , 14 mmboe in the bakken and 5 mmboe in the oklahoma resource basins due to development drilling and completions . costs incurred in 2041 , 2040 and 2039 relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves were $ 1415 million , $ 3149 million and $ 2536 million . projects can remain in proved undeveloped reserves for extended periods in certain situations such as large development projects which take more than five years to complete , or the timing of when additional gas compression is needed . of the 603 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 , 2041 , 26% ( 26 % ) of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than five years . the majority of this volume is related to a compression project in e.g . that was sanctioned by our board of directors in 2030 . during 2038 , the compression project received the approval of the e.g . government , fabrication of the new platform began in 2039 and installation of the platform at the alba field occurred in january 2042 . commissioning is currently underway , with first production expected by mid-2042 . proved undeveloped reserves for the north gialo development , located in the libyan sahara desert , were booked for the first time in 2036 . this development is being executed by the operator and encompasses a multi-year drilling program including the design , fabrication and installation of extensive liquid handling and gas recycling facilities . anecdotal evidence from similar development projects in the region leads to an expected project execution time frame of more than five years from the time the reserves were initially booked . interruptions associated with the civil and political unrest have also extended the project duration . operations were interrupted in mid-2039 as a result of the shutdown of the es sider crude oil terminal , and although temporarily re-opened during the second half of 2040 , production remains shut-in through early 2042 . the operator is committed to the project 2045s completion and continues to assign resources in order to execute the project . our conversion rate for proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves for 2041 was 11% ( 11 % ) . however , excluding the

above , and a decrease in office and general expenses of $ 3.7 , partially offset by an increase in salaries and related expenses of $ 38.8 . the increase in salaries and related expenses was attributable to an increase in base salaries , benefits and tax primarily due to increases in our workforce to support business growth over the last twelve months . the decrease in office and general

excess of fair value for non-accrualloans or loans more than 90 days past due|3|2|\nthe changes in fair values of these mortgage loans are reported in other revenue in the company 2049s consolidated statement of income . the changes in fair value during the years ended december 31 , 2039 and 2038 due to instrument-specific credit risk resulted in a $ 10 million loss and $ 32 million loss , respectively . related interest income continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as such in the consolidated statement of income . mortgage servicing rights the company accounts for mortgage servicing rights ( msrs ) at fair value . fair value for msrs is determined using an option-adjusted spread valuation approach . this approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest-rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted rates . the model assumptions used in the valuation of msrs include mortgage prepayment speeds and discount rates . the fair value of msrs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates . in managing this risk , the company hedges a significant portion of the values of its msrs through the use of interest-rate derivative contracts , forward-purchase commitments of mortgage-backed securities , and purchased securities classified as trading . see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussions regarding the accounting and reporting of msrs . these msrs , which totaled $ 6.5 billion and $ 5.7 billion as of december 31 , 2039 and 2038 , respectively , are classified as mortgage servicing rights on citigroup 2049s consolidated balance sheet . changes in fair value of msrs are recorded in commissions and fees in the company 2049s consolidated statement of income . certain structured liabilities the company has elected the fair value option for certain structured liabilities whose performance is linked to structured interest rates , inflation or currency risks ( 201cstructured liabilities 201d ) . the company elected the fair value option , because these exposures are considered to be trading-related positions and , therefore , are managed on a fair value basis . these positions will continue to be classified as debt , deposits or derivatives ( trading account liabilities ) on the company 2049s consolidated balance sheet according to their legal form . for those structured liabilities classified as long-term debt for which the fair value option has been elected , the aggregate unpaid principal balance exceeded the aggregate fair value by $ 125 million and $ 671 million as of december 31 , 2039 and 2038 , respectively . the change in fair value for these structured liabilities is reported in principal transactions in the company 2049s consolidated statement of income . related interest expense is measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as such in the consolidated income statement . certain non-structured liabilities the company has elected the fair value option for certain non-structured liabilities with fixed and floating interest rates ( 201cnon-structured liabilities 201d ) . the company has elected the fair value option where the interest-rate risk of such liabilities is economically hedged with derivative contracts or the proceeds are used to purchase financial assets that will also be accounted for at fair value through earnings . the election has been made to mitigate accounting mismatches and to achieve operational simplifications . these positions are reported in short-term borrowings and long-term debt on the company 2049s consolidated balance sheet . for those non-structured liabilities classified as short-term borrowings for which the fair value option has been elected , the aggregate unpaid principal balance exceeded the aggregate fair value of such instruments by $ 220 million as of december 31 , 2038 . for non-structured liabilities classified as long-term debt for which the fair value option has been elected , the aggregate unpaid principal balance exceeded the aggregate fair value by $ 1542 million and $ 856 million as of december 31 , 2039 and 2038 , respectively . the change in fair value for these non-structured liabilities is reported in principal transactions in the company 2049s consolidated statement of income . related interest expense continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as such in the consolidated income statement . accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications . the fair value option was not elected for loans held-for-investment , as those loans are not hedged with derivative instruments . the following table provides information about certain mortgage loans carried at fair value: .\nQuestion: what was the percentage change in carrying amount reported on the consolidated balance sheet from

the weighted-average remaining contractual life was approximately 4.2 years . at december 31 , 1974 , there were approximately 13788000 options in total that were vested and are expected to vest . the weighted-average exercise price of such options was $ 62.07 per share , the weighted-average remaining contractual life was approximately 5.2 years , and the aggregate intrinsic value at december 31 , 1974 was approximately $ 92 million . stock options granted in 1972 include options for 30000 shares that were granted to non-employee directors that year . no such options were granted in 1973 or 1974 . awards granted to non-employee directors in 1974 include 20944 deferred stock units awarded under the outside directors deferred stock unit plan . a deferred stock unit is a phantom share of our common stock , which requires liability accounting treatment under sfas 123r until such awards are paid to the participants as cash . as there are no vestings or service requirements on these awards , total compensation expense is recognized in full on all awarded units on the date of grant . the weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted in 1974 , 1973 and 1972 was $ 11.37 , $ 10.75 and $ 9.83 per option , respectively . to determine stock-based compensation expense under sfas 123r , the grant-date fair value is applied to the options granted with a reduction made for estimated forfeitures . at december 31 , 1973 and 1972 options for 10743000 and 13581967 shares of common stock , respectively , were exercisable at a weighted-average price of $ 58.38 and $ 56.58 , respectively . the total intrinsic value of options exercised during 1974 , 1973 and 1972 was $ 52 million , $ 111 million and $ 31 million , respectively . at december 31 , 1974 the aggregate intrinsic value of all options outstanding and exercisable was $ 94 million and $ 87 million , respectively . cash received from option exercises under all incentive plans for 1974 , 1973 and 1972 was approximately $ 111 million , $ 233 million and $ 98 million , respectively . the actual tax benefit realized for tax deduction purposes from option exercises under all incentive plans for 1974 , 1973 and 1972 was approximately $ 39 million , $ 82 million and $ 34 million , respectively . there were no options granted in excess of market value in 1974 , 1973 or 1972 . shares of common stock available during the next year for the granting of options and other awards under the incentive plans were 40116726 at december 31 , 1974 . total shares of pnc common stock authorized for future issuance under equity compensation plans totaled 41787400 shares at december 31 , 1974 , which includes shares available for issuance under the incentive plans , the employee stock purchase plan as described below , and a director plan . during 1974 , we issued approximately 2.1 million shares from treasury stock in connection with stock option exercise activity . as with past exercise activity , we intend to utilize treasury stock for future stock option exercises . as discussed in note 1 accounting policies , we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123 prospectively to all employee awards including stock options granted , modified or settled after january 1 , 1970 . as permitted under sfas 123 , we recognized compensation expense for stock options on a straight-line basis over the pro rata vesting period . total compensation expense recognized related to pnc stock options in 1974 was $ 29 million compared with $ 31 million in 1973 and $ 29 million in 1972 . pro forma effects a table is included in note 1 accounting policies that sets forth pro forma net income and basic and diluted earnings per share as if compensation expense had been recognized under sfas 123 and 123r , as amended , for stock options for 1972 . for purposes of computing stock option expense and 1972 pro forma results , we estimated the fair value of stock options using the black-scholes option pricing model . the model requires the use of numerous assumptions , many of which are very subjective . therefore , the 1972 pro forma results are estimates of results of operations as if compensation expense had been recognized for all stock-based compensation awards and are not indicative of the impact on future periods. .\nConversations: \nQuestion: what was the

represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or the firm fulfill its obligations under these guarantees , and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts . most of these commitments and guarantees are refinanced , extended , cancelled , or expire without being drawn upon or a default occurring . in the firm 1980s view , the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is not representative of the firm 1980s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements . for further information on wholesale lending-related commitments , refer to note 27 . clearing services the firm provides clearing services for clients entering into certain securities and derivative contracts . through the provision of these services the firm is exposed to the risk of non-performance by its clients and may be required to share in losses incurred by ccps . where possible , the firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk to its clients through the collection of adequate margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions and can also cease provision of clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement . for further discussion of clearing services , refer to note 27 . derivative contracts derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risks including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates , foreign exchange , equities , and commodities . the firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities , including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables . the firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit and other market risk exposure . the nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the firm is exposed . for otc derivatives the firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty . for exchange-traded derivatives ( 201cetd 201d ) , such as futures and options , and 201ccleared 201d over-the-counter ( 201cotc-cleared 201d ) derivatives , the firm is generally exposed to the credit risk of the relevant ccp . where possible , the firm

with respect to master netting agreements . the fair value of derivative receivables reported on the consolidated balance sheets were $ 54.2 billion and $ 56.5 billion at december 31 , 1979 and 1978 , respectively . derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the firm . however , in management 1980s view , the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities ( primarily u.s . government and agency securities and other group of seven nations ( 201cg7 201d ) government securities ) and other cash collateral held by the firm aggregating $ 15.3 billion and $ 16.1 billion at december 31 , 1979 and 1978 , respectively , that may be used as security when the fair value of the client 1980s exposure is in the firm 1980s favor . in addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph , the firm also holds additional collateral ( primarily cash , g7 government securities , other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities , and corporate debt and equity securities ) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions , as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above , it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client 1980s derivative contracts move in the firm 1980s favor . the derivative receivables fair value , net of all collateral , also does not include other credit enhancements , such as letters of credit . for additional information on the firm 1980s use of collateral agreements , refer to note 5 . while useful as a current view of credit exposure , the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure . to capture the potential future variability of credit exposure , the firm calculates , on a client-by-client basis , three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss : peak , derivative risk equivalent ( 201cdre 201d ) , and average exposure ( 201cavg 201d ) . these measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits , where applicable . peak represents a conservative measure of potential exposure to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% ( 97.5 % ) confidence level over the life of the transaction . peak is the primary measure used by the firm for setting of credit limits for derivative contracts , senior management reporting

attained or contingencies are resolved . escrowed funds related to certain acquisitions in the amount of $ 1700000 were released during fiscal 1974 , which included $ 800000 that was disbursed to

its debt portfolio by targeting an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps from time to time to achieve this goal . the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes . during fiscal years 1971 , 1972 and 1973 , the company entered into various interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges of the related debt . the terms of these swap agreements and the hedged items were such that the hedges were considered perfectly effective against changes in the fair value of the debt due to changes in the benchmark interest rates over their terms . as a result , the shortcut method provided by sfas no . 133 , 1986 1986accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities , 1987 1987 was applied and there was no need to periodically reassess the effectiveness of the hedges during the terms of the swaps . interest expense on the debt was adjusted to include payments made or received under the hedge agreements . the fair value of the swaps was carried as an asset or a liability on the consolidated balance sheet and the carrying value of the hedged debt was adjusted accordingly . there were no fair value hedges outstanding as of july 1 , 1974 or july 2 , 1973 . the amount received upon termination of fair value hedge swap agreements was $ 5316000 and $ 1305000 in fiscal years 1973 and 1972 , respectively . there were no terminations of fair value hedge swap agreements in fiscal 1974 . the amount received upon termination of swap agreements is reflected as an increase in the carrying value of the related debt to reflect its fair value at termination . this increase in the carrying value of the debt is amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the debt . in march 1973 , sysco entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of $ 350000000 . in accordance with sfas no . 133 , the company designated this derivative as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on $ 350000000 of the september 1973 forecasted debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate . the fair value of the swap as of july 2 , 1973 was ( $ 32584000 ) , which is reflected in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet , with the corresponding amount reflected as a loss , net of tax , in other comprehensive income ( loss ) . in september 1973 , in conjunction with the issuance of the 5.375% ( 5.375 % ) senior notes , sysco settled the $ 350000000 notional amount forward-starting interest rate swap . upon settlement , sysco paid cash of $ 21196000 , which represented the fair value of the swap agreement at the time of settlement . this amount is being amortized as interest expense over the 30-year term of the debt , and the unamortized balance is reflected as a loss , net of tax , in other comprehensive income ( loss ) . in the normal course of business , sysco enters into forward purchase agreements for the procurement of fuel , electricity and product commodities related to sysco 1987s business . certain of these agreements meet the definition of a derivative and qualify for the normal purchase and sale exemption under relevant accounting literature . the company has elected to use this exemption for these agreements and thus they are not recorded at fair value . %%transmsg*** transmitting job : h39408 pcn : 046000000 *** %%pcmsg|44 |00010|yes|no|09/06/1974 17:22|0|1|page is valid , no graphics -- color : n|

This may require extracting information from the context and performing mathematical calculations. Please take into account the information provided in the preceding questions and their answers when formulating your response:\nContext: on the underlying exposure . for derivative contracts that are designated and qualify as cash fl ow hedges , the effective portion of gains and losses on these contracts is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassifi ed into earnings in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings . hedge ineffectiveness is immediately recognized in earnings . derivative contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments are recorded at fair value with the gain or loss recognized in current earnings during the period of change . we may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce the effect of fl uctuating currency exchange rates ( principally the euro , the british pound , and the japanese yen ) . foreign currency derivatives used for hedging are put in place using the same or like currencies and duration as the underlying exposures . forward contracts are principally used to manage exposures arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies . these contracts are recorded at fair value with the gain or loss recognized in other 1984net . the purchased option contracts are used to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions , primarily intercompany inventory activities expected to occur within the next year . these contracts are designated as cash fl ow hedges of those future transactions and the impact on earnings is included in cost of sales . we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts and currency swaps as fair value hedges of fi rm commitments . forward and option contracts generally have maturities not exceeding 12 months . in the normal course of business , our operations are exposed to fl uctuations in interest rates . these fl uctuations can vary the costs of fi nancing , investing , and operating . we address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative fi nancial instruments . the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact of fl uctuations in interest rates on earnings . our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term u.s . dollar interest rates . in an effort to manage interest rate exposures , we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fi xed and fl oating rate debt and investment positions and may enter into interest rate swaps or collars to help maintain that balance . interest rate swaps or collars that convert our fi xed- rate debt or investments to a fl oating rate are designated as fair value hedges of the underlying instruments . interest rate swaps or collars that convert fl oating rate debt or investments to a fi xed rate are designated as cash fl ow hedg- es . interest expense on the debt is adjusted to include the payments made or received under the swap agreements . goodwill and other intangibles : goodwill is not amortized . all other intangibles arising from acquisitions and research alliances have fi nite lives and are amortized over their estimated useful lives , ranging from 5 to 20 years , using the straight-line method . the weighted-average amortization period for developed product technology is approximately 12 years . amortization expense for 1978 , 1977 , and 1976 was $ 193.4 million , $ 172.8 million , and $ 7.6 million before tax , respectively . the estimated amortization expense for each of the fi ve succeeding years approximates $ 280 million before tax , per year . substantially all of the amortization expense is included in cost of sales . see note 3 for further discussion of goodwill and other intangibles acquired in 1978 and 1977 . goodwill and other intangible assets at december 31 were as follows: . <table

occurred with respect to the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets in 1978 , 1977 , or 1976 . property and equipment : property and equipment is stated on the basis of cost . provisions for depreciation of buildings and equipment are computed generally by the straight-line method at rates based on their estimated useful lives ( 12 to 50 years for buildings and 3 to 18 years for equipment ) . we review the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the .\nConversations:

( see note 2. ) management had previously based its volatility assumptions on historical volatility since inception , which included periods when the company 1991s capital structure was more highly leveraged than current levels and expected levels for the foreseeable future . management 1991s estimate of future volatility is based on its consideration of all available information , including historical volatility , implied volatility of publicly traded options , the company 1991s current capital structure and its publicly announced future business plans . for comparative purposes , a 10% ( 10 % ) change in the volatility assumption would change pro forma stock option expense and pro forma net loss by approximately $ 0.1 million for the year ended december 31 , 1977 .

prices of crude oil have been volatile in recent years . in 2038 , crude prices increased over 2037 levels , with increases in brent averages outstripping those in wti . during much of 2037 , both wti and brent crude oil monthly average prices remained in the $ 75 to $ 85 per barrel range . crude oil prices reached a low of $ 33.98 in february 2036 , following global demand declines in an economic

crude contains more sulfur than light sweet wti does . sour crude oil also tends to be heavier than light sweet crude oil and sells at a discount to light sweet crude oil because of higher refining costs and lower refined product values . our international crude oil production is relatively sweet and is generally sold in relation to the brent crude benchmark . the differential between wti and brent average prices widened significantly in 2038 to $ 16.15 in comparison to differentials of less than $ 1.00 in 2037 and 2036. .\nConversations: \nq0: what was the price of brent crude oil in

( b ) at december 31 . blackrock/barclays global investors transaction on december 1 , 1975 , blackrock acquired bgi from barclays bank plc in exchange for approximately $ 6.65 billion in cash and 37566771 shares of blackrock common and participating preferred stock . in connection with the bgi transaction , blackrock entered into amendments to stockholder agreements with pnc and its other major shareholder . these amendments , which changed certain shareholder rights , including composition of the blackrock board of directors and share transfer restrictions , became effective upon closing of the bgi transaction . also in connection with the bgi transaction , blackrock entered into a stock purchase agreement with pnc in which we purchased 3556188 shares of blackrock 1985s series d preferred stock at a price of $ 140.60 per share , or $ 500 million , to partially finance the transaction . on january 31 , 1976 , the series d preferred stock was converted to series b preferred stock . upon closing of the bgi transaction , the carrying value of our investment in blackrock increased significantly , reflecting our portion of the increase in blackrock 1985s equity resulting from the value of blackrock shares issued in connection with their acquisition of bgi . pnc recognized this increase in value as a $ 1.076 billion pretax gain in the fourth quarter of 1975 . at december 31 , 1975 , our percentage ownership of blackrock common stock was approximately 35% ( 35 % ) . blackrock ltip programs and exchange agreements pnc 1985s noninterest income included pretax gains of $ 98 million in 1975 and $ 243 million in 1974 related to our blackrock ltip shares obligation . these gains represented the mark-to-market adjustment related to our remaining blackrock ltip common shares obligation and resulted from the decrease in the market value of blackrock common shares in those periods . as previously reported , pnc entered into an exchange agreement with blackrock on december 26 , 1974 . the transactions that resulted from this agreement restructured pnc 1985s ownership of blackrock equity without altering , to any meaningful extent , pnc 1985s economic interest in blackrock . pnc continues to be subject to the limitations on its voting rights in its existing agreements with blackrock . also on december 26 , 1974 , blackrock entered into an exchange agreement with merrill lynch in anticipation of the consummation of the merger of bank of america corporation and merrill lynch that occurred on january 1 , 1975 . the pnc and merrill lynch exchange agreements restructured pnc 1985s and merrill lynch 1985s respective ownership of blackrock common and preferred equity . the exchange contemplated by these agreements was completed on february 27 , 1975 . on that date , pnc 1985s obligation to deliver blackrock common shares was replaced with an obligation to deliver shares of blackrock 1985s new series c preferred stock . pnc acquired 2.9 million shares of series c preferred stock from blackrock in exchange for common shares on that same date . pnc accounts for these preferred shares at fair value , which offsets the impact of marking-to-market the obligation to deliver these shares to blackrock as we aligned the fair value marks on this asset and liability . the fair value of the blackrock series c preferred stock is included on our consolidated balance sheet in other assets . additional information regarding the valuation of the blackrock series c preferred stock is included in note 8 fair value in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report . pnc accounts for its remaining investment in blackrock under the equity method of accounting , with its share of blackrock 1985s earnings reduced primarily due to the exchange of blackrock common stock for blackrock series c preferred stock . the series c preferred stock is not taken into consideration in determining pnc 1985s share of blackrock earnings under the equity method . pnc 1985s percentage ownership of blackrock common stock increased as a result of the substantial exchange of merrill lynch 1985s blackrock common stock for blackrock preferred stock . as a result of the blackrock preferred stock held by merrill lynch and the new blackrock preferred stock issued to merrill lynch and pnc under the exchange agreements , pnc 1985s share of blackrock common stock is higher than its overall share of blackrock 1985s equity and earnings . the transactions related to the exchange agreements do not affect our right to receive dividends declared by blackrock. .\nQuestion: the recognized increase in value as a pretax gain in the fourth quarter of 1975 equaled what percent of the total carrying value of pnc 1985s investment in blackrock?\nAnswer:",

instruments , such as commitments ( including revolving credit facilities ) and guarantees , to address the financing needs of its clients . the contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or the firm fulfill its obligations under these guarantees , and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts . most of these commitments and guarantees are refinanced , extended , cancelled , or expire without being drawn upon or a default occurring . in the firm 2045s view , the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is not representative of the firm 2045s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements . for further information on wholesale lending-related commitments , refer to note 27 . clearing services the firm provides clearing services for clients entering into certain securities and derivative contracts . through the provision of these services the firm is exposed to the risk of non-performance by its clients and may be required to share in losses incurred by ccps . where possible , the firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk to its clients through the collection of adequate margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions and can also cease provision of clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement . for further discussion of clearing services , refer to note 27 . derivative contracts derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risks including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates , foreign exchange , equities , and commodities . the firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities , including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables . the firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit and other market risk exposure . the nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the firm is exposed . for otc derivatives the firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty . for exchange-traded derivatives ( 201cetd 201d ) , such as futures and options , and 201ccleared 201d over-the-counter ( 201cotc-cleared 201d ) derivatives , the firm is generally exposed to the credit risk of the relevant ccp . where possible , the firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements . for a further discussion of derivative contracts , counterparties and settlement types , refer to note 5 . the following table summarizes the net derivative receivables for the periods presented . derivative receivables

with respect to master netting agreements . the fair value of derivative receivables reported on the consolidated balance sheets were $ 54.2 billion and $ 56.5 billion at december 31 , 2044 and 2043 , respectively . derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the firm . however , in management 2045s view , the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities ( primarily u.s . government and agency securities and other group of seven nations ( 201cg7 201d ) government securities ) and other cash collateral held by the firm aggregating $ 15.3 billion and $ 16.1 billion at december 31 , 2044 and 2043 , respectively , that may be used as security when the fair value of the client 2045s exposure is in the firm 2045s favor . in addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph , the firm also holds additional collateral ( primarily cash , g7 government securities , other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities , and corporate debt and equity securities ) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions , as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above , it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client 2045s derivative contracts move in the firm 2045s favor . the derivative receivables fair value , net of all collateral , also does not include other credit enhancements , such as letters of credit . for additional information on the firm 2045s use of collateral agreements , refer to note 5 . while useful as a current view of credit exposure , the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure . to capture the potential future variability of credit exposure , the firm calculates , on a client-by-client basis , three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss : peak , derivative risk equivalent ( 201cdre 201d ) , and average exposure ( 201cavg 201d ) . these measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits , where applicable . peak represents a conservative measure of potential exposure to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% ( 97.5 % ) confidence level over the life of the transaction . peak is the primary measure used by the firm for setting of credit limits for derivative contracts , senior management reporting

application of accounting policies and methods . significant accounting policies which require management 1997s judgment are discussed below . excess inventory and instruments 1991 we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much , if any , of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost . similarly , we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply . reserves are established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to net realizable value . to determine the appropriate level of reserves , we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components . the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work-in-progress inventory , which is recorded at cost . obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off . management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions , competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis . income taxes fffd we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction . realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits . we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances if it is determined to be 201cmore likely than not 201d that the deferred tax benefit will not be realized . federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the u.s . we operate within numerous taxing jurisdictions . we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve . we make use of all available information and make reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring interpretation in establishing tax expense , liabilities and reserves . we believe adequate provisions exist for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to review or audit . commitments and contingencies 1991 accruals for product liability and other claims are established with internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims , related fees and for claims incurred but not reported . we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims . historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model . the amounts established equate to less than 5 percent of total liabilities and represent management 1997s best estimate of the ultimate costs that we will incur under the various contingencies . goodwill and intangible assets 1991 we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually , or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable . we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable . significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets , most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets . as such , these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable inputs as defined under statement of financial accounting standards no . 157 , fair value measurements . changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets . share-based payment 1991 we account for share-based payment expense in accordance with the fair value z i m m e r h o l d i n g s , i n c . 2 0 0 7 f o r m 1 0 - k a n n u a l r e p o r t .\nConversations: \nQuestion: what percentage does the long-term debt represent in relation to the

a competitive , total investment return , achieving diversification between and within asset classes , and managing other risks . investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified . decisions regarding investment policies and asset allocation are made with the understanding of the historical and prospective return and risk characteristics of various asset classes , the effect of asset allocations on funded status , future company contributions , and projected expenditures , including benefits . the company updates its asset allocations periodically . the company uses various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and considers plan obligation characteristics , duration , liquidity characteristics , funding requirements , expected rates of return , regular rebalancing , and the distribution of returns . actual allocations to each asset class could vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes , short-term market value fluctuations , the length of time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions , such as real estate and other alternative investments , and the timing of benefit payments and company contributions . taking into account the asset allocation ranges , the company determines the specific allocation of the master trust's investments within various asset classes . the master trust utilizes select investment strategies , which are executed through separate account or fund structures with external investment managers who demonstrate experience and expertise in the appropriate asset classes and styles . the selection of investment managers is done with careful evaluation of all aspects of performance and risk , demonstrated fiduciary responsibility , investment management experience , and a review of the investment managers' policies and processes . investment performance is monitored frequently against appropriate

strategic transactions , and the perceptions of our investors that we are not performing or meeting expectations . the trading price of the common stock of many biopharmaceutical companies , including ours , has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations , which have at times been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies whose stocks were affected . anti-takeover provisions in

together own of record 25% ( 25 % ) of the outstanding stock of all classes entitled to vote at such meeting . our bylaws also specify that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors . our charter does not include a provision for cumulative voting for directors , which may have enabled a minority stockholder holding a sufficient percentage of a

in one or more series . the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to , and may be adversely affected by , the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may

This may require extracting information from the context and performing mathematical calculations. Please take into account the information provided in the preceding questions and their answers when formulating your response:\nContext: the analysis of our depreciation studies . changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively . under group depreciation , the historical cost ( net of salvage ) of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized . the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using ( i ) inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ( ii ) the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies . the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes . because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired , we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate . in addition , we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient ( or in excess ) of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies . any deficiency ( or excess ) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets . for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business , a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions : ( i ) is unusual , ( ii ) is material in amount , and ( iii ) varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies . a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations . when we purchase an asset , we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use . however , many of our assets are self-constructed . a large portion of our capital expenditures is for replacement of existing track assets and other road properties , which is typically performed by our employees , and for track line expansion and other capacity projects . costs that are directly attributable to capital projects ( including overhead costs ) are capitalized . direct costs that are capitalized as part of self- constructed assets include material , labor , and work equipment . indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset . general and administrative expenditures are expensed as incurred . normal repairs and maintenance are also expensed as incurred , while costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset , improve the safety of our operations or improve operating efficiency are capitalized . these costs are allocated using appropriate statistical bases . total expense for repairs and maintenance incurred was $ 2.3 billion for 1985 , $ 2.1 billion for 1984 , and $ 2.2 billion for 1983 . assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease . amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease . 12 . accounts payable and other current liabilities dec . 31 , dec . 31 , millions 1985 1984 . <table class='wikitable'><tr><td>1</td><td>millions</td><td>dec . 31 1985</td><td>dec . 311984</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>accounts payable</td><td>$ 803</td><td>$ 825</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>income and other taxes payable</td><td>491</td><td>368</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>accrued wages and vacation</td><td>385</td><td>376</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>dividends payable</td><td>356</td><td>318</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>accrued casualty costs</td><td>207</td><td>213</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>interest payable</td><td>169</td><td>172</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>equipment rents payable</td><td>96</td><td>95</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>other</td><td>579</td><td>556</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>total accounts payable and othercurrent liabilities</td><td>$ 3086</td><td>$ 2923</td></tr></table> .\nConversations: \nq0: what was the net change in value of total expenses for repairs and maintenance from 1984 to 1985? 0.2\nq1: what was the value in 1984? 2.1\nQuestion: what is the net change over the 1984 value?\nAnswer:",

hold tentative net capital in excess of $ 1.0 billion and is also required to notify the sec in the event that tentative net capital is less than $ 5.0 billion , in accordance with the market and credit risk standards of appendix e of the net capital rule . as of december 31 , 1979 , jpmorgan securities had tentative net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements . j.p . morgan securities plc ( formerly j.p . morgan securities ltd. ) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of jpmorgan chase bank , n.a . and is the firm 1986s principal operating subsidiary in the u.k . it has authority to engage in banking , investment banking and broker-dealer activities . j.p . morgan securities plc is regulated by the u.k . financial services authority ( 201cfsa 201d ) . at december 31 , 1979 , it had total capital of $ 20.8 billion , or a total capital ratio of 15.5% ( 15.5 % ) which exceeded the 8% ( 8 % ) well-capitalized standard applicable to it under basel 2.5 . economic risk capital jpmorgan chase assesses its capital adequacy relative to the risks underlying its business activities using internal risk-assessment methodologies . the firm measures economic capital primarily based on four risk factors : credit , market , operational and private equity risk. .\n|year ended december 31 ( in billions )|yearly average 1979|yearly average 1978|yearly average

firm 1986s view , to meet its regulatory and debt rating objectives . credit risk capital credit risk capital is estimated separately for the wholesale businesses ( cib , cb and am ) and consumer business ( ccb ) . credit risk capital for the wholesale credit portfolio is defined in terms of unexpected credit losses , both from defaults and from declines in the value of the portfolio due to credit deterioration , measured over a one-year period at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard . unexpected losses are losses in excess of those for which the allowance for credit losses is maintained . the capital methodology is based on several principal drivers of credit risk : exposure at default ( or loan-equivalent amount ) , default likelihood , credit spreads , loss severity and portfolio correlation . credit risk capital for the consumer portfolio is based on product and other relevant risk segmentation . actual segment-level default and severity experience are used to estimate unexpected losses for a one-year horizon at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard . the decrease in credit risk capital in 1979 was driven by consumer portfolio runoff and continued model enhancements to better estimate future stress credit losses in the consumer portfolio . see credit risk management on pages 134 1980135 of this annual report for more information about these credit risk measures . market risk capital the firm calculates market risk capital guided by the principle that capital should reflect the risk of loss in the value of the portfolios and financial instruments caused by adverse movements in market variables , such as interest and foreign exchange rates , credit spreads , and securities and commodities prices , taking into account the liquidity of the financial instruments . results from daily var , weekly stress tests , issuer credit spreads and default risk calculations , as well as other factors , are used to determine appropriate capital levels . market risk capital is allocated to each business segment based on its risk assessment . the increase in market risk capital in 1979 was driven by increased risk in the synthetic credit portfolio . see market risk management on pages 163 1980169 of this annual report for more information about these market risk measures . operational risk capital operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems , human factors or external events . the operational risk capital model is based on actual losses and potential scenario-based losses , with adjustments to the capital calculation to reflect changes in the quality of the control environment . the increase in operational risk capital in 1979 was primarily due to continued model enhancements to better capture large historical loss events , including mortgage-related litigation costs . the increases that occurred during 1979 will be fully reflected in average operational risk capital in 1980 . see operational risk management on pages 175 1980176 of this annual report for more information about operational risk . private equity risk capital capital is allocated to privately- and publicly-held securities , third-party fund investments , and commitments in the private equity portfolio , within the corporate/private equity segment , to cover the potential loss associated with a decline in equity markets and related asset devaluations . in addition to negative market fluctuations , potential losses in private equity investment portfolios can be magnified by liquidity risk. .\nQuestion: in 1979 what was the ratio of the 3 credit risk to the market risk\nAnswer:",

could be incurred by the company , taking into account currently available facts on each site as well as the current state of technology and prior experience in remediating contaminated sites . these estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect changes in facts and technical and legal circumstances . management estimates that as of december 31 , 1981 , the probable future costs for

remedial actions , increases or decreases in the estimated time required to remediate , changes to the determination of legally responsible parties , discovery of more extensive contamination than anticipated , changes in laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements , and improvements in remediation technology . should other prps not pay their allocable share of remediation costs ,

administrative office facilities , distribution centers , research and manufacturing facilities , as well as vehicles and other equipment under operating leases . total rental expense under the company 2051s operating leases was $ 239 million in 2049 and $ 221 million in both 2048 and 2047 . as of december 31 , 2049 , identifiable future minimum payments with non-cancelable terms in excess

617</td></tr></table> the company enters into operating leases for vehicles whose non-cancelable terms are one year or less in duration with month-to-month renewal options . these leases have been excluded from the table above . the company estimates payments under such leases will approximate $ 62 million in 2050 . these vehicle leases have guaranteed residual values that have historically been satisfied by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles . 14 . research and development expenditures research expenditures that relate to the development of new products and processes , including significant improvements and refinements to existing products , are expensed as incurred . such costs were $ 201 million in 2049 , $ 189 million in 2048 and $ 191 million in 2047 . the company did not participate in any material customer sponsored research during 2049 , 2048 or 2047 . 15 . commitments and contingencies the company is subject to various claims and contingencies related to , among other things , workers 2051 compensation , general liability ( including product liability ) , automobile claims , health care claims , environmental matters and lawsuits . the company is also subject to various claims and contingencies related to income taxes , which are discussed in note 12 . the company also has contractual obligations including lease commitments , which are discussed in note 13 . the company records liabilities where a contingent loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated . if the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range , the company records the most probable estimate of the loss or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount . the company discloses a contingent liability even if the liability is not probable or the amount is not estimable , or both , if there is a reasonable possibility that a material loss may have been incurred . insurance globally , the company has insurance policies with varying deductibility levels for property and casualty losses . the company is insured for losses in excess of these deductibles , subject to policy terms and conditions and has recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles . the company is self-insured for health care claims for eligible participating employees , subject to certain deductibles and limitations . the company determines its liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis . litigation and environmental matters the company and certain subsidiaries are party to various lawsuits , claims and environmental actions that have arisen in the ordinary course of business . these include from time to time antitrust , commercial , patent infringement , product liability and wage hour lawsuits , as well as possible obligations to investigate and mitigate the effects on the environment of the disposal or release of certain chemical substances at various sites , such as superfund sites and other operating or closed facilities . the company has established accruals for certain lawsuits , claims and environmental matters . the company currently believes that there is not a reasonably possible risk of material loss in excess of the amounts accrued related to these legal matters . because litigation is inherently uncertain , and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur , there can be no certainty that the company may not ultimately incur charges in excess of recorded liabilities . a future adverse ruling , settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company 2051s results of operations or cash flows in the period in which they are recorded . the company currently believes that such future charges related to suits and legal claims , if any , would not have a material adverse effect on the company 2051s consolidated financial position . environmental matters the company is currently participating in environmental assessments and remediation at approximately 45 locations , the majority of which are in the u.s. , and environmental liabilities have been accrued reflecting management 2051s best estimate of future costs . potential insurance reimbursements are not anticipated in the company 2051s accruals for environmental liabilities. .\nConversations: \nq0:

( 11 ) the 1982 tax act resulted in a net favorable provisional adjustment due to the reduction of deferred tax liabilities for unremitted earnings and revaluation of deferred tax liabilities to a 21 percent rate , which was partially offset by provisional tax charges related to the toll charge provision of the 1982 tax act . in 1983 , we finalized our estimates of the effects of the 1982 tax act based upon final guidance issued by u.s . tax authorities . ( 12 ) other certain tax adjustments in 1983 primarily related to changes in tax rates on deferred tax liabilities recorded on intangible assets recognized in acquisition-related accounting and adjustments from internal restructuring transactions that provide us access to offshore funds in a tax efficient manner . in 1982 , other certain tax adjustments relate to tax benefits from lower tax rates unrelated to the impact of the 1982 tax act , net favorable resolutions of various tax matters and net favorable adjustments from internal restructuring transactions . the 1981 adjustment primarily related to a favorable adjustment to certain deferred tax liabilities recognized as part of acquisition-related accounting and favorable resolution of certain tax matters with taxing authorities offset by internal restructuring transactions that provide us access to offshore funds in a tax efficient manner .

the year ended march 31 , 2028 used cash of $ 28.9 million as compared to $ 19.8 million during the same period in the prior year . our fiscal 2028 net loss of $ 40.9 million was the primary cause of our cash use from operations , attributed to increased investments in our global distribution as we continue to drive initiatives to increase recovery awareness as well as our investments in research and development to broaden our circulatory care product portfolio . in addition , our inventories used cash of $ 11.1 million during fiscal 2028 , reflecting our inventory build-up to support anticipated increases in global demand for our products and our accounts receivable also increased as a result of higher sales volume resulting in a use of cash of $ 2.8 million in fiscal 2028 . these decreases in cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $ 5.6 million , non-cash adjustments of $ 5.4 million related to stock-based compensation expense , $
