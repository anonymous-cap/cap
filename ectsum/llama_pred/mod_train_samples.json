serves as Executive Vice President, Treasurer and CFO, Kevin Christie is the Senior Vice President of External Affairs and Chief Customer Officer, and Ryan Krasselt occupies the role of Vice President, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer.\nOur diluted share earnings for Q4 2020 were $0.85, an increase from $0.76 in Q4 2019.\nThe company's full-year diluted share earnings decreased from $2.97 in 2019 to $1.90 in 2020.\nI'll now hand over to Dennis to continue the discussion.\nAs we enter 2021 amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we hope you're maintaining your health and safety.\nReflecting on the past year, I'm immensely proud of our staff's resilience in facing pandemic-related challenges, consistently delivering energy to our customers, and advancing our business objectives.\nWe remain committed to supporting those in our communities who are facing difficulties and have the greatest needs.\nAvista and its Foundation contributed over $4 million in charitable donations throughout 2020 to assist community organizations experiencing increased demand for services in our service areas.\nOur 2020 financial performance exceeded our projections, with Mark set to provide more detailed information shortly.\nWe've nearly completed the installation of smart electric meters and natural gas modules across Washington, marking one of our largest-ever projects.\nThis new infrastructure will enable customers to access more up-to-date information for better energy consumption management.\nThe technology allows us to send proactive high energy usage alerts, helping customers avoid unexpected high bills at month's end.\nBeyond billing, smart meter data is enhancing our power grid's reliability and efficiency, leading to improved customer service.\nFor instance, we now have greater insight into our system, allowing for faster power outage detection and restoration.\nWe made progress towards our clean energy objectives with the Rattlesnake Flat Wind Farm becoming operational last December.\nThe project's construction created clean energy jobs in local communities, and its 57 wind turbines will now supply 50 average megawatts of affordable, clean, renewable energy to our customers, sufficient to power 38,000 homes for years to come.\nIn response to the ongoing wildfire threat in our region, we've implemented a new 10-year wildfire resiliency plan to enhance defense strategies and operational practices for a more robust system.\nWe anticipate investing approximately $330 million over the plan's 10-year duration to implement its components.\nWe're pleased to announce that Avista has once again been named one of the World's Most Ethical Companies for 2021 by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and promoting ethical business practices.\nThis marks our second consecutive year receiving this recognition.\nWe are one of only nine honorees in the energy and utilities sector based on their evaluation.\nFor 2021, a total of 135 honorees were recognized across 22 countries and 47 industries.\nWe recently published Avista's 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report on our avistacorp.com website, and I encourage you to review it when you have the opportunity.\nThis material offers a comprehensive overview of our activities and how we're meeting our obligations to various stakeholders.\nThe site also contains links to Avista's reports on various industry and financial ESG disclosures.\nThe revised content reinforces Avista's ongoing dedication to corporate responsibility and transparency with our stakeholders.\nRegarding regulatory submissions, we submitted two-year general rate cases in Idaho in January.\nAs you're aware, we filed general rate cases in Washington in 2020.\nWe're continuing to navigate the regulatory processes in both these states.\nWe take our duty to deliver safe, dependable energy at reasonable prices very seriously.\nWe strive to make wise financial investments in our infrastructure, control our expenses, and identify the best ways to serve our customers while keeping energy costs down.\nFor instance, our suggested tax customer credit would fully counteract an immediate rise in electric and natural gas bills for our Washington customers.\nIn Oregon, new rates became effective on January 16 this year, and we plan to submit another rate case in the latter half of 2021 in Oregon.\nMoving forward, we remain committed to operating an excellent utility and continue to invest wisely in maintaining and upgrading our infrastructure to provide reliable energy service to our customers.\nWe are announcing our earnings guidance for 2021, 2022, and 2023 with consolidated ranges of $1.96 to $2.16 per diluted share for 2021, $2.18 to $2.38 for 2022, and $2.42 to $2.62 per diluted share for 2023.\nThis trajectory puts us on course to achieve our allowed return by 2023.\nFinally, the board recently increased our dividend by 4.3% to an annual dividend of $1.69 per share, marking the 19th consecutive year of dividend increases for our shareholders, which I believe demonstrates the board's commitment to maximizing shareholder value.\nWe anticipated a challenging start to this year.\nNot the company, but the Blackhawks, who have actually begun quite well after a slow first four games.\nFive rookies have scored their first NHL goals, which is quite thrilling for hockey enthusiasts.\nFor the company in Q4, Avista Utilities contributed $0.81 per diluted share, up from $0.67 the previous year.\nOur earnings improved mainly due to higher utility margin and customer growth.\nAlso in Q4, the Oregon and Washington Commissions joined Idaho in allowing the deferral of certain COVID-19 related expenses for potential future recovery.\nMoreover, Avista Utilities' earnings surpassed expectations due to higher utility margin and lower income taxes, partially offset by increased operating expenses.\nRegarding COVID-19, as mentioned earlier, we've now received accounting orders in all our jurisdictions to defer costs and benefits associated with the pandemic, to be addressed in future proceedings with each commission.\nWe anticipate a gradual economic recovery that will still result in some reduced load and customer growth in 2021.\nWe anticipate improvements in our economy to begin in the latter half of 2021.\nWe have regulatory mechanisms and decoupling in place to lessen the impact of load changes on our residential and some commercial customers.\nRegulatory mechanisms cover more than 90% of our income, as you may remember.\nAs mentioned by Dennis, we remain dedicated to making necessary investments in our utility infrastructure.\nWe project capital expenditures of approximately $415 million for 2021, with AEL&P expecting around $7 million and our other businesses about $15 million.\nRegarding our financial flexibility, we had $270 million available under our committed credit line at Avista Utilities as of December 31, and we issued approximately $72 million in stock during 2020.\nWe plan to issue about $75 million in equity or stock and up to $120 million in long-term debt in 2021.\nAs Dennis stated, we are providing guidance not just for 2021, but also for 2022 and 2023.\nThese ranges aim to bring us back to earning our allowed return by 2023, and our guidance assumes timely and appropriate rate adjustments in all our jurisdictions relative to our future capital expenses.\nWe faced regulatory lag in 2020 and expect this to persist through the end of 2022 due to our ongoing infrastructure investments and delayed filings.\nAs discussed earlier, we postponed filings last year due to the pandemic in Washington and Idaho.\nDennis previously mentioned these delays.\nWe anticipate our cases in Washington and Idaho, along with new rates, to provide some relief in 2021 and start reducing the regulatory lag.\nMoving forward, we will aim to further reduce debt and align our returns more closely with those authorized by 2023.\nFollowing 2023, we expect our earnings to grow by 4% to 6%.\nOur 2021 guidance reflects unrecovered structural costs estimated to reduce the return on equity by about 70 basis points, and timing lag, which we're trying to minimize through rate cases, has reduced it by approximately 100 basis points.\nThis results in an expected return on equity for Avista Utilities of about 7.7% in 2021.\nWe are projecting operating cost growth of around 3% and customer growth of about 1% annually, which is a slight improvement from previous customer growth figures.\nFor 2021, we expect Avista Utilities to contribute between $1.93 and $2.07 per diluted share, and the midpoint of our guidance doesn't include any expense or benefit under the ERM.\nWe currently expect the ERM to be in a benefit position within the 75% customer, 25% company sharing band, which is anticipated to add $0.05 per diluted share.\nFor 2021, we expect AEL&P to contribute between $0.08 and $0.11 per diluted share, and our outlook for both Avista Utilities and AEL&P assumes normal precipitation and hydroelectric generation for the year, among other variables.\nWe anticipate a loss between $0.05 and $0.02 per diluted share for our other businesses as we continue to develop future opportunities.\nWe will invest some money in the next couple of years to boost those earnings over the next five years, and we look forward to these opportunities.\nThese opportunities are present both in our service territory and in funds.\nOur guidance typically only includes normal operating conditions and does not incorporate any unusual or non-recurring items until their effects are known and certain.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Ray Young, our chief financial officer, will explain the factors driving our performance, as well as provide an overview of corporate results and financial highlights.\nJuan will then present our future outlook.\nOur group achieved an exceptional fourth quarter performance.\nThe adjusted segment operating profit reached $1.4 billion, showing a 23% increase compared to the same period in 2020.\nOur adjusted EBITDA for the past four quarters totaled $4.9 billion, surpassing last year's figure by $1.25 billion.\nWe met our goals with a trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 10%.\nThis performance marked a robust conclusion to an outstanding 2021.\nWe achieved a record-breaking adjusted earnings per share of $5.19 for the entire year.\nThe full-year adjusted segment operating profit amounted to $4.8 billion.\nThis remarkable performance was evident throughout the entire organization.\nThe Ag Services and Oilseeds team's efforts to enhance their business portfolio and strengthen their operational model continued to yield superior results in a favorable market environment.\nAS&O generated a full-year 2021 operating profit of $2.8 billion, with each subsegment performing at or near record levels.\nCarbohydrate solutions executed exceptionally well, delivering full-year operating profits of $1.3 billion.\nThe team is advancing the evolution of carbohydrate solutions through various initiatives, including the Peoria dry mill sale, a sustainable aviation fuel MOU, an agreement with LG Chem, growth in the biosolutions platform, a project to reduce carbon emissions at major processing facilities, and the development of carbon capture and storage capabilities.\nThe nutrition team once again demonstrated industry-leading revenue and operating profit growth, with full-year revenues increasing by 16% and full-year operating profit reaching $691 million, representing a 20% year-over-year increase.\nWe continued to enhance our nutrition business through strategic investments in growing demand areas, such as soya protein, PetDine, Deerland, and FISA, expanding our presence in alternative proteins, pet food and treats, functional probiotics and enzymes, and flavors in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nDuring our recent Global Investor Day, we presented our strategic plan and reaffirmed our balanced financial framework for value creation, which includes using our strong cash flows for both growth investments and shareholder distributions.\nWe are confident in our plan, which is why we are pleased to announce an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share.\nWe take pride in our record of 90 uninterrupted years of dividends and over 40 years of consecutive annual dividend increases, and we are glad to continue fulfilling our commitment to creating shareholder value.\nIt has been an excellent year, and we are enthusiastic about the future.\nOur ongoing efforts to improve ADM and align it with global trends in food security, health and well-being, and sustainability, along with the steady advancement of our productivity and innovation initiatives, will contribute to our 2022 results.\nI will provide more details about the upcoming calendar year shortly.\nThe Ag Services and Oilseeds team concluded an impressive year by successfully navigating supply chain challenges to deliver results comparable to the extremely strong prior-year quarter.\nThe Ag Services team performed well in an environment of continued strong global demand, including significantly increased export volumes for customers outside of China.\nGlobal trade saw substantial year-over-year growth, driven by effective risk management and improved results in global ocean freight.\nAg Services achieved robust results, only marginally below the exceptional fourth quarter of 2020 when we experienced unusually high export margins.\nCrushing performed well in response to the sustained strong demand for both soybean meal and vegetable oil.\nDecreased performance in EMEA compared to a very strong fourth quarter in 2020 and roughly $250 million in net negative timing effects versus negative $125 million in the previous year's quarter led to overall lower results year-over-year.\nThe majority of these negative timing impacts are anticipated to reverse in the first half of 2022.\nThe refined products and other teams significantly improved their performance compared to the previous year, driven by high volumes and margins for refined oils in North America and better biodiesel margins in North America and EMEA, which compensated for weaker South American results due to the reduced biodiesel mandate.\nWilmar's equity earnings increased compared to the previous year.\nLooking forward, we anticipate a strong first quarter from Ag Services and Oilseeds, surpassing the first quarter of 2021 and comparable to the recently concluded fourth quarter.\nCarbohydrate solutions' fourth quarter results were more than twice those of the same quarter in the previous year.\nIn the Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, including ethanol production from our wet mills, results declined compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, due to increased input costs, particularly energy costs in EMEA, as well as reduced wheat milling volumes, partially offset by continued strong ethanol margins.\nNorth American sweetener and starch volumes remained largely unchanged year-over-year.\nVantage corn processor results once again significantly improved year-over-year, driven by historically high industry ethanol margins resulting from strong demand relative to supply, as well as increased sales volumes due to production at the two dry mills that were inactive in the previous year's period.\nLooking ahead, we expect the first quarter for carbohydrate solutions to be similar to or slightly better than the strong first quarter of 2021.\nThe nutrition business concluded a year of steady and robust growth, with fourth quarter revenues increasing by 19% year-over-year, 21% on a constant currency basis, with 26% higher profits year-over-year, and maintained strong EBITDA margins.\nHuman Nutrition had an excellent fourth quarter, with revenue growth of 21% on a constant currency basis and substantially higher profits.\nFlavors continued its growth trajectory, primarily driven by improved product mix in EMEAI and continued strong performance in North America, partially offset by weaker APAC results.\nIn specialty ingredients, overall profits for the fourth quarter were comparable to the year-ago period as strong demand for plant-based proteins offset the impact of one-time insurance proceeds in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nHealth & wellness improved compared to the prior-year quarter as the business continued to deliver growing profits in bioactives and fermentation.\nAnimal nutrition revenue increased by 21% on a constant currency basis, and operating profit was significantly higher year-over-year, primarily driven by continued strength in amino acids.\nLooking ahead, we expect nutrition to continue growing operating profits at a rate of 15% or more for calendar year 2022, with the first quarter similar to the first quarter of 2021, featuring continued revenue growth offset by some higher costs early in the year and the absence of the one-time benefits observed in the first quarter of the previous year.\nLet me conclude with a few observations about the Other segment and some corporate line items.\nOther business results improved substantially, primarily due to higher captive insurance underwriting results, as the prior-year quarter included larger intracompany insurance settlements.\nFor calendar year 2022, we anticipate other business results to be similar to 2021.\nHowever, for the first quarter, we expect a loss of approximately $25 million due to currently planned insurance settlements.\nNet interest expense increased year-over-year due to higher short-term borrowings.\nIn the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $276 million were lower year-over-year, primarily due to increased variable performance-related compensation expense accruals in the prior year, partially offset by higher IT offering in project-related costs and transfers of costs from business segments into centralized centers of excellence in supply chain and operations.\nWe expect total corporate expenses, including net interest, unallocated costs, and other corporate expenses, to be around $1.2 billion for the 2022 calendar year, as I mentioned at Global Investor Day, with net interest remaining steady, corporate unallocated slightly increasing, and other corporate costs slightly decreasing.\nThe fourth quarter of 2021 saw an effective tax rate of about 21%, in contrast to 8% the previous year.\nFor the 2021 calendar year, the effective tax rate was approximately 17%, an increase from 5% in 2020.\nThe yearly increase was primarily attributed to shifts in the geographical distribution of earnings and current-year specific tax items, mainly valuation allowance and return to provision adjustments.\nFor the full year 2022, we anticipate the effective tax rate to fall between 16% and 19%.\nOur financial position remains strong, with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of approximately 28% and about $9 billion in available liquidity.\nI trust that many of you were able to attend our Global Investor Day last month.\nWe demonstrated our consistent strategic progress, from improving ROIC through capital cost and cash management, to achieving strategic growth and margin enhancement, including establishing a global Nutrition business, to our current focus on productivity and innovation.\nAllow me to briefly discuss our outlook for the 2022 environment.\nIn Ag Services and Oilseeds, we foresee a continued favorable global demand landscape.\nGiven the reduced crop yield in South America, with the extent of the shortfall yet to be determined, we expect global agricultural commodity buyers to rely more heavily on the U.S. market for their needs, assuming a normal U.S. crop later this year.\nRegarding oilseeds, we're beginning 2022 with robust soy crush margins.\nAs discussed at Global Investor Day, we believe that growing demand for meal and vegetable oil as a feedstock for renewable green diesel should continue to support a positive environment this year, with our soy crush margins ranging from 45 to $55 per metric ton.\nIf these conditions materialize, we believe Ag Services and Oilseeds has the potential to achieve operating profit in 2022 that is comparable to or exceeds that of 2021.\nFor carbohydrate solutions, we anticipate a stable demand and margin environment for our starch and sweetener products compared to 2021.\nWe expect the industry ethanol landscape to remain favorable, supported by domestic demand recovering to pre-COVID levels, energy costs driving increased exports, and improved clarity on regulations.\nWith this in mind, we're projecting higher ADM ethanol volumes and EBITDA margins averaging between $0.15 and $0.25 for the calendar year.\nAdditionally, we expect our biosolutions platform to deliver another year of solid growth as we continue to evolve the carbohydrate solutions business.\nOverall, we anticipate carbohydrate solutions to generate full-year operating profit slightly below their exceptional 2021 performance.\nIn nutrition, we expect continued growth in demand for our unmatched portfolio of nutrition ingredients and systems, along with the benefits from our recent acquisitions.\nGiven these factors, we project 15-plus percent operating profit growth in 2022, revenue growth exceeding 10%, and EBITDA margins above 20% in human nutrition and high single digits in animal nutrition, aligning with the targets we outlined at our Global Investor Day.\nAs we look ahead to 2022, we see a positive demand environment across our portfolio.\nWe also consider areas where we can improve.\nWhile our execution was strong in 2021, we continually identify opportunities for enhancement.\nWe aim to do even more to meet the growing demand in 2022.\nConsidering all these factors, we are optimistic about another very strong performance in 2022 as we progress toward our strategic plan's next earnings milestone of six to $7 per share.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We will refer to non-GAAP metrics during our call today.\nI'm very thankful for their daily efforts in moving us forward.\nWe continue to focus on factors within our control.\nDespite major economic changes in fiscal '20, several aspects went according to plan: replacement part sales outperformed new equipment and first-fit products, gross margin improved year-over-year, we cut discretionary spending while investing in growth areas, and we maintained a strong financial position while returning money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.\nWe're starting fiscal '21 with clear objectives and motivated employees.\nWe don't expect robust market conditions overall this year, but our diverse business model and strong operational capabilities make me confident we can advance our strategic initiatives in any economic climate.\nWe'll discuss our long-term opportunities later in the call.\nI'll now provide a brief overview of fourth quarter sales.\nTotal sales for the quarter were $617 million, with sequential increases in June and July.\nSales decreased by 15% compared to last year, aligning with our early August forecast.\nBoth segments experienced similar declines.\nHowever, there was considerable variation within the results.\nOur first-fit businesses in the Engine segment are under the most strain.\nOn-Road sales in the fourth quarter dropped 44% from the previous year.\nThe U.S., which makes up the largest portion of On-Road sales, accounted for most of the decline as the cyclical slowdown in Class 8 truck production was worsened by the pandemic.\nIt's worth noting that On-Road first-fit in the U.S. represents only about 3% of total Donaldson sales, so our overall exposure to that market is limited.\nOff-Road sales decreased by 24% in the quarter.\nMore than half of the decline was attributed to Exhaust and Emissions.\nThere were pre-buys in Europe last year related to an upcoming regulatory change, and new programs for our Exhaust and Emissions products haven't yet reached significant volumes.\nIn the U.S., production of heavy-duty Off-Road equipment remains low, particularly for the construction and mining sectors.\nConversely, Off-Road sales in China increased by nearly 50% in the fourth quarter.\nThe Chinese government is investing to stimulate activity, which is benefiting our Off-Road business.\nAdditionally, we continue to secure new programs with local manufacturers, some of which involve PowerCore.\nThese are new customer relationships in the country that produces more heavy-duty equipment than anywhere else in the world.\nWe're learning how to best support these local manufacturers and we understand this will come with order fluctuations, but our team in China is motivated as we see the potential for significant long-term growth.\nEngine aftermarket sales trends were predictably better than our first-fit businesses.\nAftermarket sales in the fourth quarter decreased by 11%, reflecting a mid-teens decline for sales through our independent channel.\nThe trends in our independent channel are largely consistent with the third quarter.\nU.S. sales fell due to the collapse of the oil and gas market combined with slowing transportation activity.\nIn Latin America, utilization is declining across the region as the spread of the virus compounds the impact of geopolitical uncertainty.\nFourth quarter sales in Eastern Europe remain strong as we continue to gain market share.\nSales through the OEM channel of aftermarket experienced a more modest, low-single-digit decline.\nIn the U.S., large customers reduced inventory to match demand, which was partially offset by strong growth in China as we continue gaining share with local customers.\nIn fact, aftermarket sales in China reached a record level last quarter and we see a long runway as we expect to continue winning new programs with innovative technology.\nOur portfolio of innovative products performed well in the fourth quarter.\nThis portfolio comprises nearly a quarter of total aftermarket revenue and fourth quarter sales increased in the low-single digits.\nFor almost two decades, we have been improving, expanding, and reinventing our offering related to these razor-to-sell razor-blade products.\nAfter all this time, we still maintain very high retention rates.\nThese products create a significant opportunity for growth and relative stability in our Engine business.\nTherefore, we will continue investing in new technologies for the foreseeable future.\nAerospace and Defense sales decreased by 3% in the fourth quarter, driven by weak sales of products for commercial helicopters.\nThe decline was partially offset by a strong increase in sales for ground defense vehicles, though some of the growth is timing-related as key distributors built up inventory in the quarter.\nI also want to inform you about a change to our strategic portfolio classification.\nStarting in fiscal '21, we are reclassifying the defense business from mature to critical core.\nOur mature businesses are focused on generating cash that allows for investment elsewhere, while critical core businesses aim to drive market share gains in existing markets through new technology, services, and relationships.\nThe Defense business has secured new programs with our robust engineering capabilities, and we expect these wins will deliver solid returns over a long time horizon.\nMoving to our Industrial segment, fourth quarter sales decreased by 15%, largely due to the Dust Collection business within Industrial Filtration Solutions (IFS).\nSales of new dust collectors and replacement parts declined as customers continue to postpone investment and reduce output.\nThe quote-to-order cycle remains extended, with large projects being put on hold while smaller, essential projects tend to move forward.\nNevertheless, our value proposition continues to resonate.\nFourth quarter sales of our Downflo Evolution dust collection systems increased in the low teens, and sales of those replacement parts grew by more than 30%.\nThe Downflo family of products currently represents only about 15% of total dust collection sales, but it has grown rapidly as customers appreciate its space and energy-saving features, and we value the ability to retain the aftermarket.\nWe are also expanding the dust collection business through our e-commerce platform, shop.\nWe recently enabled guest orders, and we are encouraged by the results.\nWhile the incremental revenue is still small, we have seen a significant number of new dust collection customers.\nWith our robust sales and delivery model, we believe the simplicity of our e-commerce platform gives customers another reason to choose Donaldson.\nProcess Filtration sales in the fourth quarter decreased in the low-single digits after an increase of more than 10% last year.\nThe decline was driven by new equipment sales, while replacement parts sales were approximately flat compared to the previous year.\nWe continue to make progress penetrating the highly valuable food and beverage industry.\nWe position ourselves as an engaged partner and promote our ability to quickly fulfill orders with products that can help improve efficiency in our customers' processes.\nThe pandemic gave us the opportunity to demonstrate this value proposition to our food and beverage industry customers, and our Process Filtration team delivered.\nWe remain very excited about this market, so we will continue to invest in expanding the sales force and adding new tools to drive this profitable business.\nSpecial Applications sales decreased by 10% in the fourth quarter.\nSales of Disk Drive declined compared to the previous year, following a significant increase in Q3, while reduced automotive demand led to lower Venting Solutions sales.\nGTS revenue rose 6% in Q4, primarily due to strong performance in small turbines.\nThe GTS division achieved another increase in profit, both in absolute terms and as a percentage.\nWe altered the GTS marketing approach four years ago.\nWe decided to concentrate on replacement parts and small turbines, while being selective about large turbine projects.\nThe GTS team has executed their strategy exceptionally well, as reflected in the results.\nWe recently decided to integrate our Saudi Arabian joint venture into our main operations.\nWe are continuing to optimize and streamline GTS to improve profitability.\nGiven the GTS team's performance and future prospects, we are now categorizing GTS as a mature business within our portfolio.\nThe GTS division has successfully transitioned from recovery to driving profitability, and is now in a strong position.\nThe achievements in GTS are not unique within our company.\nOur organization is full of talented individuals working collaboratively to deliver results and create value for all stakeholders.\nThis is why I feel confident about our future prospects.\nBefore handing over to Scott, I'd like to briefly discuss fiscal 2021.\nWe're uncertain about the duration of the pandemic and its ultimate impact on our business.\nGiven these uncertainties, we'll focus on factors within our control: prioritizing employee health and safety, meeting customer commitments, pursuing global growth opportunities, implementing margin improvement initiatives, and maintaining a balanced approach to expense management, including strategic investments.\nScott will provide more details about fiscal 2021.\nLike many companies, we had to quickly adapt to new working methods over the past six months, and our employees performed excellently during this time.\nWe enhanced our collaboration, strengthened relationships with customers and suppliers, and maintained operations in critical sectors worldwide with minimal disruption.\nOverall, I'm very impressed by our team's accomplishments.\nAs we enter fiscal 2021, we have a solid foundation.\nHowever, market conditions remain uncertain.\nGiven the range of possible outcomes, including the timing and nature of the eventual recovery, we are not providing detailed guidance at this time.\nWe will, however, share some of our planning assumptions for 2021.\nI'll discuss these later in the call, but first I'll comment on our fiscal 2020 results.\nOur decremental margin was a notable highlight.\nWe achieved 20% in the fourth quarter and 18% for the full year.\nThese results are better than our historical averages.\nLet me elaborate on some specifics.\nOperating expenses decreased by 10% to $125 million in Q4, remaining flat sequentially and reaching our lowest Q4 level in four years.\nDiscretionary spending was significantly reduced, partly due to pandemic-related travel restrictions, while we maintained investments in strategic growth areas like Process Filtration, Dust Collection, and Connected Solutions.\nWe'll continue to balance expense management with strategic investments, and we're pleased with our Q4 performance.\nWe're also satisfied with our gross margin performance.\nQ4 gross margin increased by 20 basis points year-over-year, and our full-year rate rose by 50 basis points despite headwinds from lower sales and higher depreciation related to capacity expansion projects.\nMany of these projects are now complete, which is why our planned capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 are significantly lower than the $122 million invested last year.\nWe're now focusing on optimization opportunities enabled by these investments.\nWe aim to reduce our cost structure while maintaining or improving service levels.\nWhile benefits from these initiatives will increase over time, our list of optimization projects gives me confidence that we can deliver strong returns on these new assets.\nLower raw material costs are helping to offset the impact of reduced leverage on gross margin.\nWe've seen favorable pricing for steel, media, and petroleum-based products, and our procurement team is driving additional savings while strengthening our supplier network and improving terms.\nRegarding pricing, while it hasn't been a major contributor to the year-over-year gross margin increase, it hasn't been a headwind either.\nWe have more flexibility to influence pricing in many of our replacement parts businesses, and teams like those in the independent channel of Engine Aftermarket have consistently executed our pricing strategy effectively.\nThis makes a significant difference, especially in the current economic environment.\nA favorable sales mix is also contributing to gross margin improvement.\nIn Q4 and for most of the year, we've seen mix benefits as replacement parts comprise a larger share of total sales.\nTo some extent, these mix benefits are intentional.\nWe invest in technology to secure first-fit programs that drive aftermarket retention.\nAs we progress through an economic cycle, our strong base of recurring revenue provides relative stability and some gross margin support.\nReplacement parts now account for 64% of total sales, giving us confidence in the resilience of our business model.\nBefore moving further down the P&L, I'll briefly discuss segment profit margins.\nThe Engine segment's story aligns with the consolidated results.\nMix benefits and lower raw material costs offset the loss of leverage, resulting in a year-over-year margin increase of 20 basis points in Q4.\nIn the Industrial segment, the loss of leverage was amplified by continued investments in our strategic growth businesses.\nWe expect Industrial margins to recover, helping us achieve our goal of improving the company's overall margins over time.\nReturning to the P&L, Other income was $2.7 million in Q4 compared to an expense of $0.5 million in the prior year.\nImproved performance in our joint ventures benefited fiscal 2020, while the prior year's Q4 expense reflected a charge related to our global cash optimization initiatives.\nThese initiatives, which allowed us to streamline our legal and fee structure, were enabled by tax reform.\nWe excluded last year's charge from the calculation of adjusted earnings per share, as well as a non-recurring charge related to tax reform legislation.\nWith that in mind, it's best to compare the reported Q4 tax rate of 21.1% with the prior year's adjusted tax rate of 21.4%.\nWhile the difference between rates is not significant, I'll note that current and prior year rates were well below our typical expectations.\nThe Q4 2020 rate benefited from a favorable mix of earnings across jurisdictions, while the 2019 adjusted rate included a non-recurring benefit related to the favorable settlement of an audit.\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2021, we anticipate our full-year tax rate to increase from 2020, aligning more closely with our long-term estimate of 24% to 27%.\nRegarding our financial position, we're satisfied with where we ended the year.\nOur net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio stood at 0.9, and in Q4 we cleared a $50 million term loan while reducing our revolving credit by $110 million.\nWe cautiously drew from our credit line early in the pandemic to strengthen our financial position.\nDespite ongoing market uncertainty, we feel secure in our position and no longer require the additional financial buffer.\nAs anticipated in the current climate, accounts receivable decreased significantly compared to last year.\nStock levels also declined.\nWe aim to make additional improvements this year by aligning with demand.\nOur cash conversion rates for Q4 and the full 2020 fiscal year improved substantially to 165% and 103% respectively, and we aim to surpass 100% again this year.\nOur sales projections for fiscal 2021 generally align with recent trends.\nSales are expected to fluctuate considerably by region and market, with replacement parts and new market products likely to outperform the company average.\nWe anticipate lower sales in the first half of 2021 compared to the previous year due to the pandemic's onset timing.\nAugust sales are tracking about 10% below last year's figures.\nTotal August sales will be less than July's, which is typical for the season.\nRegional sales patterns in August mirror those of the fourth quarter.\nThe Asia-Pacific region is performing best compared to last year, led by growth in China.\nEurope is doing better, partly due to currency effects, while the U.S. and Latin America face the most challenges.\nAs predicted, some of our more stable businesses like Engine Aftermarket and Process Filtration are showing relative strength, with both growing in Europe while new equipment sales remain under pressure.\nFor fiscal 2021 gross margin, benefits from product mix and lower raw material costs will decrease as we compare against strong advantages in the previous year.\nSimultaneously, we will implement optimization projects to set the stage for long-term gross margin improvements.\nOur fiscal 2021 operating expenses will have both positive and negative factors.\nReestablishing our annual incentive compensation plan creates a $13 million cost increase, and we plan to invest more in our strategic growth businesses and technology development.\nWe intend to largely offset these increases through expense control, likely benefiting from pandemic-related restrictions and comparing against higher spending in the first half of the previous year.\nIf a suitable opportunity arises, we may explore additional optimization initiatives.\nWe plan to buy back at least 1% of outstanding shares in fiscal 2021 to counter any dilution from stock-based compensation.\nAny repurchases beyond this level will depend on macroeconomic conditions, investment opportunities, and our balance sheet metrics.\nIf conditions improve, it's reasonable to consider exceeding the 1% goal in fiscal 2021.\nBroadly speaking, our objectives for the new year align with our long-term strategic plan.\nWe will seek growth and market share opportunities in our Advance & Accelerate business portfolio, implement optimization initiatives to boost gross margins, manage discretionary expenses while making targeted investments, and maintain our strong financial position through disciplined capital deployment and working capital management.\nThese are factors within our control, and I'm confident in our ability to deliver in 2021.\nI have some news to share before handing the call back to Tod.\nAfter five years as our Investor Relations Director, Brad will be moving to Belgium to become Finance Director of our Europe-Middle East region.\nThe exact timing is uncertain due to COVID, but he's committed to ensuring a smooth transition once we find his replacement.\nYou've done an outstanding job, and congratulations on your exciting new role with Donaldson.\nWe'll certainly miss you in this position, but we're all thrilled about this great opportunity for you.\nI'm confident in our ability to handle the complexities of the current environment and to create long-term value by meeting our customers' evolving needs.\nWe have strong relationships with our customers, ranging from global brands to small business owners.\nOur aim is to solve our customers' complex filtration challenges, enabling them to efficiently produce great products, and I believe we're succeeding in this goal.\nLet me provide some examples to illustrate this.\nIn our Engine segment, our Filter Minder team launched a wireless monitoring system to help fleet managers optimize maintenance schedules for On-Road and Off-Road equipment.\nOur system integrates with existing telematics and fleet management infrastructure, making it easy for customers to adopt this valuable technology.\nWe're also expanding connected solutions into the dust collection market with our IQ offering.\nThis service provides customers with real-time monitoring of their equipment performance, helping them reduce energy costs and minimize unplanned downtime.\nWe've made adoption easy; our IQ setup works with any brand of dust collector and the retrofit process is straightforward.\nOur e-commerce platform is another tool helping customers operate more efficiently.\ndonaldson.com has global reach and features like real-time availability and personalization, making it easy for customers to find what they need and place new or repeat orders.\nAs always, new technology is crucial to our success, and we continue to expand our technologies and solutions to drive growth.\nMany of our Engine customers aim to improve fuel economy and reduce emissions, and our products can help them achieve these goals.\nWe've demonstrated that consistent use of our PowerCore products can help end-users improve fuel economy while providing value to our OEM customers by allowing them to retain more of their parts business.\nWe still see many opportunities with diesel engines and growing potential with alternative powertrains like hybrid solutions and hydrogen fuel cells.\nHybrid platforms leverage our existing portfolio of air and liquid solutions, presenting good opportunities with that equipment.\nFuel cells have different needs, and we have a specialized air filtration system designed specifically for those requirements.\nIn addition to our air systems, we also offer venting products and specialized membranes for fuel cells.\nOur technical capabilities position us well to participate in this growing market.\nWe're also pursuing non-Engine markets like food and beverage.\nProcess filtration sales were about $15 million in fiscal 2020, an increase of over 60% in the past three years.\nWe continue to invest in new technologies and are building capabilities to facilitate future expansion into life sciences.\nOur long-term success depends on our team, so we're committed to making our company a great place to work.\nWe have a strong culture that values integrity, commitment, respect, and innovation.\nWe also maintain a continuous improvement mindset, recently creating a diversity, equity, and inclusion council to identify and implement practices that will strengthen our company.\nWe're also progressing with our sustainability practices.\nWe began developing our global sustainability strategy last year.\nWe've engaged our stakeholders and identified numerous projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, and wastewater.\nImplementing and maintaining sustainable practices is another way we work towards our purpose of advancing filtration for a cleaner world.\nI'm proud of our achievements as One Donaldson and look forward to another successful year ahead.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The crisis has presented an opportunity for our company to showcase its adaptability.\nWe enhanced our interactions with retailers.\nOur marketing approach was adjusted.\nWe reallocated resources to product categories that consumers value most.\nNew production milestones were achieved for VITAFUSION, ARM & HAMMER laundry products, and ARM & HAMMER baking soda.\nWe've redirected personnel to concentrate on e-commerce.\nWe've been taking initiative to capitalize on opportunities arising from the crisis and are expanding our manufacturing capabilities both internally and through new partnerships.\nThe flexibility and durability of the Church & Dwight team is evident in our performance.\nWe remain focused on ensuring employee safety, meeting consumer and retailer needs, supporting our local communities, and maintaining the strength of our brands.\nOur factory, warehouse, and laboratory staff have done an outstanding job of staying safe, which has enabled us to maintain our supply chain operations.\nOur office-based employees continue to work from home and are doing an excellent job managing the company.\nLet's now discuss the results.\nThe third quarter was another remarkable period.\nWe saw a 13.9% increase in reported sales and adjusted earnings per share of $0.70.\nIn Q3, we experienced significant year-over-year growth in revenue, earnings, and operating cash flow, driven by a substantial increase in demand for many of our products.\nOrganic sales grew by 9.9%, fueled by higher consumption.\nIn terms of e-commerce, we were already in a strong position before COVID and well-established online.\nOur online sales in Q3 increased by 77% across all retailer websites.\nGummy vitamins serve as a good example.\nIn 2019, 8% of our annual sales were online.\nThis year, we anticipate about 14% of our total sales to be online.\nRemember, we started the year aiming for online sales to account for 9% of global consumer sales.\nIt was 10% in Q1, 13% in Q2, and 13% again in Q3.\nWe expect the full year to be close to 13% as well.\nWe continue to study U.S. consumer purchasing behaviors.\nThe findings are not surprising.\nConsumers remain worried about store stock shortages and delivery issues with websites.\nPeople report consolidating their shopping trips and continuing to stockpile to ensure they have enough products for a couple of weeks at a time.\nLooking at year-to-date shipment and consumption patterns, our brands remain generally balanced across the 15 categories in which we compete.\nOur brands experienced widespread consumption growth in Q3.\nWe observed double-digit consumption growth in several products including VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins, ARM & HAMMER baking soda, OXICLEAN, FLAWLESS, ORAJEL, NAIR, FIRST RESPONSE pregnancy kits, and cleaners.\nIn the Household category, our laundry business consumption increased by 4%, and ARM & HAMMER cat litter rose by 8%.\nWater flossers are another bright spot, with consumption turning slightly positive in Q3.\nAlthough our Lunch & Learn activities remain significantly reduced, we plan to address this with increased advertising.\nIn addition to VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS, we expect water flossers to benefit from the increased consumer focus on health and wellness.\nBATISTE dry shampoo continues to be affected by social distancing, with consumption down 10%, but this is an improvement from Q2 when consumption was down 22%.\nTROJAN consumption decreased by 6% in Q3, but this was also an improvement from Q2 when it was down 15%.\nIt's clear that consumers have prioritized health and wellness.\nVITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins experienced the highest consumption growth of any of our categories in Q3, up 49%.\nThe overall category consumption was even higher.\nWe anticipate that consumer demand for gummy vitamins will remain strong.\nWe have new third-party production capacity coming online in late Q4 to capitalize on this trend.\nConsumers are focusing not only on health and wellness but also on cleaning, home cooking, and new grooming routines.\nAt a recent investor conference, I mentioned consumer research suggesting it takes 66 days to form a new habit.\nOnly time will tell if these new behaviors will lead to permanently higher levels of consumption.\nHowever, if they do persist, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit.\nRegarding private label products, our exposure is limited to five categories.\nPrivate label market shares have remained largely unchanged throughout the first, second, and third quarters of this year.\nOur international business achieved double-digit organic growth in the quarter, driven by strong performance in our Global Markets Group (GMG) and Canada.\nIn October, our GMG business is off to another strong start, and we continue to see robust point-of-sale recovery in Canada and Europe.\nAfter three consecutive quarters of growth, our Specialty Products business contracted by 3.4% in Q3, primarily due to the poultry segment.\nTurning to new products, innovative offerings will continue to attract consumers even in the current economic climate.\nVITAFUSION introduced several new gummy vitamin products to their lineup.\nTo take advantage of growing consumer focus on immune health, we introduced POWER ZINC and Elderberry gummies.\nWe debuted ARM & HAMMER CLEAN & SIMPLE, a detergent containing just six ingredients plus water, compared to typical liquid detergents with 15 to 30 ingredients.\nIn the latter half of the year, we released ARM & HAMMER ABSORBx clumping cat litter, which is 55% lighter than our standard litter.\nLet's now discuss the future outlook.\nWe're experiencing an outstanding year.\nWe now anticipate full year adjusted earnings per share growth of 13% to 14%, significantly exceeding our long-term goal of 8% annual earnings per share growth.\nDue to our strong performance, we have increased our full year projection for sales growth to approximately 11% and organic sales growth to about 9%.\nAs we've stated numerous times before, we manage Church & Dwight with a long-term perspective to maintain our consistent growth model.\nDuring the second half, we seized the opportunity to boost our marketing expenditure for new products and made additional investments in the company.\nAs we approach the end of the year, we are developing our plan for 2021.\nWe are highly confident that we will achieve our consistent growth model in 2021.\nWe will provide a detailed outlook for next year in February.\nTo conclude, I'd like to remind everyone of the many reasons to be confident in Church & Dwight.\nOur company is well-positioned to thrive in both favorable and challenging economic conditions.\nThe product categories we operate in are largely considered essential by consumers.\nSome of our categories are likely to benefit from the current situation.\nWe offer a mix of value and premium products.\nOur leading brands hold the top one or two positions in their respective categories.\nWe have minimal exposure to private label products.\nWe've just experienced some of our strongest growth quarters ever.\nWith a robust balance sheet, we remain open to acquiring businesses that enhance total shareholder return.\nWe believe our company is more robust and adaptable than ever before.\nLastly, we possess the resources, pragmatism, and drive to ensure our brands continue to perform well in the future.\nRick will now provide details on the third quarter.\nLet's begin with earnings per share.\nThird quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding an acquisition-related earnout adjustment, increased 6.1% to $0.70 compared to $0.66 in 2019.\nAs mentioned in previous calls, the quarterly earnout adjustment will persist until the end of the earnout period.\nBetter-than-expected sales performance enabled the company to invest more in marketing.\nReported revenue rose 13.9%, reflecting continued increased consumer demand for our products.\nOrganic sales grew 9.9%, driven by a 10.2% volume increase, partially offset by 0.3% unfavorable product mix and pricing, mainly due to new product support.\nVolume growth was fueled by higher consumption.\nLet's examine the segments.\nOrganic sales increased by 10.7%, primarily due to higher volume.\nGrowth was led by VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins, WATERPIK oral care products, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, and OXICLEAN stain fighters.\nWe're often asked to reconcile Nielsen reporting with our organic results.\nThis quarter, tracked consumption for our brands was 7.7% compared to an organic sales increase of 10.7%.\nIn the current environment, one might assume this is due to restocking retailer inventory, but that's not the case.\nWe saw 400 basis points of benefit from strong growth in untracked channels, mainly online, and a 100 basis point drag from couponing to support new products.\nThe positive news is that consumption and shipments are balanced, both in the low double digits.\nConsumer International achieved 11.6% organic growth due to higher volume, offset by lower price and product mix.\nThis represents a significant recovery for our international business from a flat Q2.\nGrowth was primarily driven by the Global Markets Group and Canada.\nFor our SPD business, organic sales decreased 3.4% due to lower volume, offset by higher pricing.\nThe lower volume was mainly due to the nondairy animal and food production in sodium bicarbonate business.\nRegarding gross margin, our third quarter gross margin was 45.5%, a 110 basis point decrease from last year.\nGross margin was impacted by a 110 basis point drag from tariffs and a 90 basis point impact from acquisition accounting.\nTo complete the Q3 gross margin bridge: a 100 basis point benefit from price/volume mix; 160 basis points from productivity programs, offset by an 80 basis point drag from higher manufacturing costs, inflation, and increased distribution costs; as well as a 90 basis point drag from COVID-related expenses.\nConcerning marketing, spending increased by $45.7 million year-over-year as we invested in our brands.\nMarketing expense as a percentage of net sales rose 230 basis points to 13.8%.\nFor SG&A, Q3 adjusted SG&A decreased 30 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to leverage from strong sales growth.\nTotal expenses amounted to $12.3 million, with a $3.9 million reduction primarily due to decreased interest costs resulting from lower rates.\nOur tax rate for the quarter decreased by 430 basis points to 17.3% from 21.6% in 2019, mainly because of increased tax benefits from stock option exercises.\nLet's now discuss our cash position.\nIn the first three quarters of 2020, operating cash flow rose by 29% to $798 million, thanks to substantially higher cash earnings and improved working capital management.\nAs of September 30, we had $549 million in cash reserves.\nWe maintain our annual capital expenditure plan of about $100 million as we begin to increase our manufacturing and distribution capabilities, primarily in laundry, litter, and vitamin products.\nAs I mentioned at the Barclays conference in September, we anticipate increasing our capital expenditure to approximately 3.5% of sales over the next few years for these capacity-related investments.\nFurthermore, as stated in the release, the company may resume stock buybacks in the future due to its strong cash position.\nFor the fourth quarter, we anticipate reported sales growth of about 9% and organic sales growth of roughly 8%.\nAs Matt pointed out, we're experiencing strong consumption across many of our product categories.\nMoving on to gross margin.\nWe previously projected a 150 basis point contraction in the second half, but now we're forecasting a 190 basis point decrease.\nThis change is primarily attributed to one-time supply chain expenses.\nWe also expect significant expenses, and we've projected them to remain flat for the year as a percentage of sales, implying an increase in Q4.\nWe also foresee a lower tax rate.\nConsequently, we expect Q4 adjusted earnings per share to be between $0.50 and $0.52, excluding the acquisition earnout adjustment, as we conclude 2020 with momentum.\nRegarding our full-year outlook, we now project approximately 11% sales growth for 2020, surpassing our previous 9% to 10% range.\nWe're also increasing our full-year organic sales growth forecast to about 9%, up from our earlier 7% to 8% projection.\nWe've raised our cash from operations outlook to $975 million, a 13% increase compared to last year.\nRegarding gross margin, we expect it to decrease by 20 basis points for the year, mainly due to acquisition accounting effects, COVID-related costs, additional manufacturing and distribution capacity investments, and higher tariffs on WATERPIK.\nConcerning tariffs, recall that in 2018, we were subject to Tier two tariffs, for which we received an extension in 2019.\nThat exemption expired and wasn't renewed as of Q3 2020.\nWe're continuing to work on mitigating this impact.\nTo elaborate further on gross margin, I previously stated that the first half of the year saw a 150 basis point increase, while the second half would see a 150 basis point decrease.\nThus, our previous outlook for the year was flat.\nLast quarter, I also explained the investments we were making in the latter half of 2020.\nThese included a new third-party logistics provider, external storage for surplus inventory, initial engineering for capacity expansion, VMS outsourcing costs, as well as other investments in automation, consumer research, and analytics.\nWe're now projecting a 190 basis point decrease for the second half, or a 20 basis point decrease for the entire year, which implies a 250 basis point decrease for the quarter.\nWe've incurred some non-recurring supply chain costs.\nHere are a few examples: First, due to our exceptional growth, we're adding a new 3PL distribution center, as I mentioned last quarter.\nThis quarter, we again experienced stronger sales, resulting in duplicate external storage locations and a new 3PL distribution center that wasn't operational.\nConsequently, we temporarily incurred duplicate costs.\nWe're also in the process of making \"make first buy\" decisions, which will likely lead to some asset write-offs in Q4.\nWe're conducting lean training across our plants.\nLastly, due to our excellent results this year, we have higher incentive compensation costs that are reflected in COGS.\nOur full-year tax rate is expected to be 19%, and we've also increased our adjusted earnings per share growth forecast to 13% to 14%.\nNow that we've covered the outlook, I'd like to discuss FLAWLESS briefly.\nAs mentioned in the release, we recorded an earnout benefit of about $50 million in the quarter in reported earnings.\nWe exclude any earnout adjustments from our adjusted EPS calculations.\nSome context on this change: We acquired the business for $475 million upfront with a $425 million earnout tied to year-end 2021 sales.\nThat sales target represented over a 15% CAGR for three years, starting from a baseline of $180 million in trailing sales.\nThe revised 3-year CAGR for this business is now closer to 8%.\nConsequently, the earnout liability decreases, and earnings increase.\nWe remain optimistic about this business, and the strong consumption growth over the past six months is an encouraging sign for the future.\nAs Matt mentioned, the company is well-positioned as we enter 2021.\nMatt and I are now ready to answer any questions you may have.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I will commence today by examining guest cruise activities and providing an overview of our first quarter financial flows.\nSubsequently, I will share an update on reservation trends and conclude with projections for adjusted EBITDA and net profit.\nLet's now focus on guest cruise operations.\nIn the initial quarter of 2022, we resumed operations on 10 more vessels, resulting in 60% of our fleet capacity being operational for guest cruises throughout the entire first quarter.\nThis marked a significant increase from 54% during the final quarter of 2021.\nAs of now, 75% of our fleet capacity has resumed guest cruise operations.\nOur ability to continually adjust to the ever-changing environment has been one of our key strengths throughout the pandemic.\nDuring the first quarter, we continued to demonstrate this flexibility by adjusting restart dates to optimize our guest cruise operations.\nWe now anticipate that each brand's entire fleet will be operational for their respective summer seasons, which historically generate the majority of our operating income.\nI'm pleased to announce that just last week, we revealed plans to restart operations in Australia at the end of May, following the government's announcement that cruising would be permitted from April.\nThe occupancy rate for the first quarter was 54% across operational ships.\nWe didn't expect to achieve our historical occupancy rates of over 100% for the first quarter, as many of these voyages were confirmed only a few months before departure, resulting in shorter than usual booking lead times.\nNevertheless, we had anticipated first quarter occupancy would surpass the 58% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nWe began the quarter with over 55% cabin occupancy booked and expected to improve upon that during the quarter.\nHowever, during the first quarter of 2022, the Omicron variant impacted bookings for near-term sailings, leading to higher cancellations due to increased pre-travel positive test results, challenges in obtaining timely pre-travel tests, and the disruption Omicron caused to society during this period.\nThese factors hindered our ability to build on our cabin occupancy book position for the first quarter of 2022, resulting in a 54% occupancy rate, lower than the 58% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nDespite these challenges, we hosted over one million guests during the first quarter, representing nearly a 20% increase from the fourth quarter of 2021.\nOnce again, our brands performed exceptionally well, with Net Promoter Scores remaining elevated compared to pre-COVID levels.\nRevenue per passenger day for the first quarter of 2022 increased by approximately 7.5% compared to the strong performance in 2019, despite the absence of our lucrative world cruises and exotic voyages this year.\nOur revenue management teams maintained pricing when we experienced an impact on bookings for near-term sailings, optimizing our long-term prospects for future revenue and pricing.\nOnce more, our onboard and other revenue per diems significantly increased in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2019, partly due to bundled packages and onboard credits used by guests from cruises canceled during the pause.\nWe experienced substantial growth in onboard and other per diems on both sides of the Atlantic.\nOnboard revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in bar, casino, retail, spa, and internet services.\nIn recent years, we've seen a growing trend of guests selecting more comprehensive package options.\nThe benefits of these all-inclusive packages will ultimately be reflected in our onboard and other revenue streams.\nThese bundled packages have made it harder to distinguish between passenger ticket revenue and onboard spending.\nFor accounting purposes, we divide the total guest payment between these two categories.\nConsequently, our total cruise revenue metrics provide the best indication of our overall performance.\nRegarding expenses, our adjusted cruise cost excluding fuel per available lower berth day (ALBD) increased by 25% in Q1 2022.\nI've used the term \"adjusted cruise costs\" instead of \"net cruise costs,\" which we previously employed.\nThe calculation method for adjusted cruise costs and net cruise costs remains identical.\nFive main factors contributed to the rise in adjusted cruise costs without fuel per ALBD: partial fleet pause, restart expenses, increased dry dock activity, enhanced health and safety measures, and inflation.\nDue to partial fleet pause and increased dry dock days in Q1, costs were spread over fewer ALBDs.\nThe second quarter will see another doubling of dry dock days compared to 2019, impacting adjusted cruise cost without fuel per ALBD.\nWe expect many of these cost-increasing factors to cease in 2022 and not recur in 2023.\nGiven these factors, we anticipate a significant improvement in adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD from H1 2022 to H2 2022, with a projected low double-digit increase for the full year 2022 compared to 2019.\nI will now present an overview of our first quarter cash flows.\nOur liquidity at the end of Q1 2022 was $7.2 billion, down from $9.4 billion at the end of Q4.\nWe believe our current liquidity position remains strong.\nThe change in liquidity during the quarter was primarily due to four factors: firstly, an improved negative adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion, resulting from the resumption of cruise operations despite the omicron variant's impact.\nWe had anticipated a greater improvement in adjusted EBITDA, but the omicron variant hindered our ability to increase occupancy, limiting the improvement.\nSecondly, we invested $400 million in capital expenditures, net of export credits.\nThirdly, we made $500 million in debt principal payments.\nThe fourth item was $400 million in interest expenses for the quarter.\nLet's examine reservation patterns.\nBooking volumes for upcoming voyages have shown an upward trend since mid-January.\nRecent weekly booking numbers have reached their highest levels since the resumption of passenger cruise operations.\nWe improved our booked occupancy for the latter half of 2022 during the first quarter, though not at the usual pace of a typical wave season due to the omicron variant.\nConsequently, the cumulative advanced booking position for the second half of 2022 is at the lower end of the historical range.\nNevertheless, we believe we are well-positioned with our current second half 2022 booking status, given the recent increase in reservation volumes, coupled with closer-in booking patterns and our anticipation of an extended wave season.\nWe anticipate that occupancy will gradually increase throughout 2022 and return to historical levels in 2023.\nNotably, I'm pleased to report that prices for these bookings in the second half of 2022 remain higher, with or without future cruise credits (FCCs), adjusted for bundled packages, compared to 2019 sailings.\nOur cumulative advanced booking position for the first half of 2023 remains at the higher end of the historical range, also at increased prices with or without FCCs, normalized for bundled packages, compared to 2019 sailings.\nThis is a significant accomplishment, considering that pricing for 2019 sailings is a challenging comparison as it was a peak year for historical yields.\nI'll conclude with our adjusted EBITDA and net income projections.\nWe recognize that booking trends are a key indicator of our business's health.\nWith improved recent booking trends leading the way and driving customer deposits higher, positive adjusted EBITDA is within reach.\nWe expect ship-level cash contribution to grow in the coming months as more vessels return to service and we increase our occupancy percentages.\nHowever, as mentioned, adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2022 has been or will be affected by restart-related spending and dry dock expenses, as 39 ships, over 40% of our fleet, will have undergone dry dock during the first half of fiscal 2022.\nConsidering all these factors, we anticipate monthly adjusted EBITDA to continue improving and become consistently positive at the start of our summer season.\nWe still expect a net loss for the second quarter of 2022 on both a U.S. GAAP and adjusted basis.\nHowever, we anticipate a profit for the third quarter of 2022.\nFor the full year, we expect a net loss.\nLooking ahead to brighter prospects in 2023, with the entire fleet back in service year-round, 8% more capacity than 2019, an improved fleet profile with nearly a quarter of our capacity consisting of newly delivered ships, continued momentum on our outstanding Net Promoter Scores, and occupancy returning to historical levels, we are eager to provide memorable vacation experiences to nearly 14 million guests and potentially generate greater adjusted EBITDA than in 2019.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Tom Ferguson, CEO; Philip Schlom, CFO; and David Nark, SVP of marketing, communications, and IR are participating in today's call.\nThe company faces various risks, including fluctuations in customer demand, raw material costs, political and economic conditions in its markets, currency exchange rates, financing availability, and the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on its customers and operations.\nThe third quarter marked our fifth consecutive period of strong performance following COVID-related disruptions in early 2020.\nTheir continued dedication has enabled us to achieve these impressive results.\nTotal revenue increased by 2.3% to nearly $232 million compared to last year, or 4.1% when accounting for the SMS divestiture.\nThe metal coatings division saw a 15.4% increase in sales to over $133 million, while infrastructure solutions experienced an 11% decrease to about $99 million.\nWe are satisfied with our strong quarterly performance.\nOur consistent cash flow generation allowed us to return capital to shareholders this quarter.\nWe achieved a net income exceeding $21 million and earnings of $0.85 per diluted share, showcasing our businesses' resilience and our employees' commitment.\nOur companies capitalized on last year's restructuring efforts to enhance profitability while maintaining their commitment to customer service and quality.\nWe also saw benefits from reduced interest expenses and a lower tax rate of 22% in the third quarter.\nIn line with our value creation strategy, we bought back over 148,000 shares for $7.6 million and paid out $4.2 million in dividends.\nOur metal coatings division achieved a 24.5% operating margin on $133 million in sales.\nThis led to a 14% increase in operating income compared to the previous year.\nThe margin improvement was largely attributed to enhanced operational efficiency and productivity, along with better pricing despite rising costs for zinc, labor, and energy.\nDespite ongoing COVID-related challenges, we successfully acquired Steel Creek Galvanizing in South Carolina.\nThis facility, completed in 2019, features extensive automation and is the most modern in our portfolio.\nOur team is enthusiastic about the growth potential in this previously unserved region.\nThe metal coatings division continues to deliver excellent results while navigating labor shortages and rising costs.\nOur infrastructure solutions segment showed continued improvement in profitability, benefiting from cost-cutting measures implemented last year.\nSales were down about 8% when accounting for the SMS divestiture.\nThe infrastructure solutions segment generated over $9 million in operating income, with margins improving by 140 basis points to 9.3% compared to the previous year.\nThe segment faced increasing labor constraints and material delays due to COVID-related supply chain disruptions, including customer-supplied components.\nOne international WSI project was significantly affected by a COVID outbreak, which was well-managed but resulted in lower profitability.\nWe remain committed to strategic sales initiatives across our electrical and industrial platforms and are optimistic about finishing the fiscal year strongly.\nFor fiscal year 2022, despite ongoing COVID-related uncertainties in various sectors, we are narrowing our earnings per share guidance based on strong performance in the first three quarters and a favorable outlook for the remainder of the year.\nWe expect annual sales between $865 million and $925 million, with earnings per diluted share ranging from $3 to $3.20.\nThe upcoming quarter is not expected to be significantly affected by the recent acquisition as we are concentrating on integration in these initial months.\nThe metal coatings division continues to prioritize expanding sales, including utilizing our spin galvanizing facilities at multiple locations, improving operational efficiency, and enhancing customer service as inflation drives up labor and operational costs.\nOur infrastructure solutions division is guardedly optimistic as it begins the fourth quarter with some positive momentum in order activity, especially in the electrical sector.\nThe WSI division is seeing positive results from the expanded Polish facility, though internationally, the business still faces occasional project delays due to COVID-19 outbreaks at certain client locations.\nAs mentioned previously, some projects originally scheduled for autumn will now be completed in the fourth quarter.\nWe also have some projects typically slated for spring that are set to begin earlier than usual.\nThe electrical division is concentrating on operational efficiency and expanding its e-house and switchgear operations.\nWe anticipate better-than-usual performance in the fourth quarter due to project extensions from the third quarter.\nOur outlook for the spring maintenance season is quite positive based on the number of quotations, but we remain cautious due to ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks at client sites.\nFor the remainder of fiscal year 2022, AZZ will continue to implement our strategic growth plans to increase shareholder value while preparing for a strong start to fiscal 2023.\nWe remain steadfast in our dedication to providing exceptional customer service.\nOur strong cash flow generation is attributed to initiatives that promote operational excellence, strict cost management, maintaining pricing discipline, and emphasizing timely collection of receivables within our operational divisions.\nWe are certain that our businesses continue to be crucial for improving and maintaining infrastructure, so we persist in driving profitable growth and enhancing shareholder value.\nOrders received in the third quarter totaled $248 million, an increase of $53.6 million or 28% compared to the same quarter in the previous year.\nOur book-to-bill ratio remained steady at 107%, consistent with the previous quarter and significantly higher than the 0.86 ratio from the same quarter last year.\nAs Tom mentioned, we have observed consistently strong markets for our metal coatings segment and continue to see improving conditions in our infrastructure solutions segment.\nSales for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 were $231.7 million, an increase of $5.1 million or 2.3% compared to the prior year's third quarter sales of $226.6 million.\nCompared to the same quarter last year, metal coatings segment sales increased by $17.8 million, which was partially offset by lower sales in the infrastructure solutions segment, primarily in the industrial division where we implemented significant restructuring measures in the middle of last year.\nThe company generated a gross profit of $57 million, compared to $54.7 million in the third quarter of the previous year.\nOur gross margin for the third quarter was 24.6%, up from 24.1% in the same quarter last year, as both segments continue to show improvement.\nOperating income for the quarter was $30.1 million, a $2.2 million or 8% improvement compared to $27.9 million in the third quarter of the previous year.\nOur earnings per share were $0.85, which is $0.09 higher than the reported earnings per share of $0.76 and adjusted earnings per share of $0.80 in the third quarter of the previous year.\nThe previous year was affected by our loss on the divestiture of Southern Mechanical Services (SMS). EBITDA for the third quarter was $39.8 million, unchanged from the third quarter of the previous year.\nYear-to-date sales through the third quarter of fiscal 2022 were $678 million, a 5.4% increase from the previous year's third quarter year-to-date sales of $643 million.\nExcluding the impact of SMS divestitures, sales would have increased by 8.6% year-over-year on a pro forma basis.\nNet income for fiscal 2022 year-to-date was $62.4 million, which is $38.9 million or 166% higher than the reported net income of $23.5 million for the same period in the previous year, and $23.1 million or 58.9% above the adjusted net income from the prior year-to-date period, during which the company had recorded impairment and restructuring charges, net of tax, of $15.8 million.\nEarnings per share on a year-to-date diluted share basis is $2.48, compared to $0.90 reported in the previous year and $1.50 on an adjusted basis.\nCurrent year-to-date earnings per share improved by $0.98 or 65.3% compared to the year-to-date 2021 results.\nWe maintain a robust financial position while continuing to provide returns to our investors through dividends and stock buybacks.\nKey capital allocation details for the year are as follows.\nAt the quarter's end, total outstanding debt amounted to $192 million, comprising $150 million in senior notes due in 7 and 12 years, and $42 million drawn from our revolving credit facility.\nThis represents a $13 million increase in borrowings since the end of the previous fiscal year.\nThe rise in borrowings is primarily attributed to ongoing share repurchases, increased receivables, and higher inventory levels due to improved business volumes.\nSo far, we've invested $19.1 million in capital projects and expect to invest approximately $32 million this year, slightly less than our earlier projection of $35 million.\nOngoing supply chain issues have continued to affect and postpone our planned capital expenditures.\nWe bought back $7.6 million worth of outstanding shares during the quarter, and have repurchased 712,000 shares totaling $28.9 million year-to-date.\nWe have consistently declared and paid quarterly dividends.\nFor the nine-month period ending November 30, 2021, cash generated from operations totaled $49.7 million, a decrease of $9.7 million or 16.4% compared to the same period last year.\nWhile higher earnings positively impacted operating cash flows, this was more than offset by increased receivables due to higher sales and increased inventories, mainly resulting from higher zinc costs in our metal coatings.\nWe remain active in mergers and acquisitions, having recently acquired a galvanizing operation in South Carolina that will enhance our Southeast presence and is expected to be profitable within its first year of operation, as Tom mentioned earlier.\nWe are closely monitoring several key indicators.\nIn the metal coating segment's Galvanizing business, we are closely watching fabrication and construction activity, material and labor cost inflation, and OSHA's COVID vaccine mandate.\nFor the surface technologies platform, our main focus is on expanding our customer base and improving operational performance.\nIn infrastructure solutions, domestic turnaround and outage activity has normalized.\nThe upcoming spring season looks promising, though we remain cautious due to COVID, especially regarding international customers.\nThe electrical platform is benefiting from increased spending on transmission distribution and utilities, as well as growing activity in data centers and battery energy storage.\nRegarding our strategic review of infrastructure solutions and our goal to become primarily a metal coatings company, we have made significant progress on a few strategic options aimed at achieving this objective.\nDue to confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide further details at this time.\nWe remain committed to our metal coatings growth strategy and aim to achieve 21% to 23% operating margins, with galvanizing performance remaining stable while we continue to enhance Surface Technologies.\nWe will continue to pursue acquisitions, particularly in metal coatings, and hope to complete one more before the end of this fiscal year.\nFor infrastructure solutions, our focus is on profitability and cash flow.\nThis segment should benefit from more typical turnaround outage seasons and strong markets for renewables, transmission and distribution, utilities, battery energy storage, data center e-houses, and switchgear.\nWe released our inaugural ESG report last quarter and will continue to strive for improvement in these areas.\nLastly, while we typically provide guidance for the upcoming fiscal year at this time, we will not be doing so for fiscal year 2023.\nAlthough we are committed to providing sales and earnings per share guidance, we may not be able to do so until we can incorporate the results of our work on strategic options.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:You can access mdu.com and navigate to the Investors section.\nDave Goodin, MDU Resources' President and CEO, and I will be heading up today's quarterly earnings call.\nWhile the company believes its expectations are founded on reasonable assumptions, the actual outcomes may vary significantly.\nIn Q2 2021, we achieved earnings of $100.2 million or $0.50 per share, which is comparable to Q2 2020's earnings of $99.7 million, also at $0.50 per share.\nOur quarterly results were affected by increased stock-based compensation and healthcare expenses, amounting to roughly $4.2 million after tax.\nOur Q2 consolidated results were additionally impacted by a $5.4 million decrease in investment returns on certain benefit plans compared to the same period in 2020.\nDespite these factors influencing the quarter's performance, all our operations showed strong performance in the first half of the year, with consolidated revenues growing by 3.5% and earnings increasing by $27.5 million year-to-date.\nOur utility operations earned $9.6 million in Q2, down from $11.2 million in Q2 2020.\nThe Electric Utilities segment reported earnings of $10.3 million for the quarter, a decrease from $12.2 million in the same period last year.\nThe decline in earnings was primarily due to higher operation and maintenance costs, including increased labor-related expenses such as stock-based compensation and healthcare, as mentioned earlier, as well as higher generating station expenses.\nReduced benefit plan investment returns also negatively affected the results.\nThe decrease was partially offset by improved adjusted gross margin, driven by a 6.9% rise in retail sales volumes.\nDuring the quarter, sales volumes increased for industrial and commercial customers but decreased for residential customers as COVID-19 pandemic effects began to reverse and people returned to work with businesses reopening.\nThe adjusted gross margin also benefited from higher demand revenues and increased revenues associated with transmission interconnect projects.\nOur natural gas utility segment reported a reduced seasonal loss of $700,000, an improvement from the $1 million seasonal loss in the same period last year.\nThe quarter saw an increase in adjusted gross margin due to approved rate recovery and 2% customer growth.\nTransportation revenues also rose due to higher volumes transported to the company's electric generation customers.\nThe decreased loss was partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses, mainly labor-related costs as previously mentioned, and lower returns on certain benefit plan investments.\nThe pipeline business earned $9.2 million in Q2, slightly up from $9 million in Q2 2020.\nThe increase in earnings was primarily driven by higher nonregulated project revenues and increased allowance for funds used during construction.\nThis increase was partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses related to the previously mentioned increase in nonregulated projects and higher payroll costs.\nLet's now discuss the construction businesses.\nConstruction services reported record Q2 earnings of $28.9 million, surpassing the previous year's record of $27.9 million.\nSales revenue reached a new second quarter record of $525.6 million, showing a 6% increase compared to the same period last year.\nThe need for construction services remains strong in both internal and external specialized contracting sectors.\nThere was robust demand for commercial and industrial work in interior specialized contracting, particularly in manufacturing, while exterior contracting saw increased workloads due to high demand from the utility sector.\nThe rise in earnings was also attributed to reduced depreciation, depletion, and amortization expenses, resulting from decreased intangible amortization related to earlier acquisitions.\nOur construction materials division reported earnings of $51.4 million for the second quarter, compared to $53 million in the same quarter of the previous year.\nIncome increased by 2% to $633.8 million.\nThe drop in earnings was mainly due to higher selling, general, and administrative expenses from increased labor-related costs, as previously discussed.\nThe quarter was also impacted by lower returns on certain benefit plans.\nThese factors were partially offset by reduced interest expenses resulting from lower average interest rates.\nThis concludes the financial highlights for the quarter.\nI will now go through each of our business segments to highlight some notable drivers in the quarter and provide more details about the organic growth items mentioned in yesterday's press release.\nWe'll begin with our regulated energy delivery platform.\nOur electric and natural gas utility businesses now serve approximately 1.15 million customers.\nOur utility employees continue to focus on organic growth and infrastructure improvements to safely and efficiently serve our customers.\nWe anticipate strong customer growth across our service area, surpassing the national average and ranging between 1% and 2% compound annual growth.\nThe electric utility completed the decommissioning activities on the coal-fired Unit I at the Lewis & Clark generating station in the second quarter and began decommissioning in July.\nWe plan to retire Units I and II at Heskett Station near Mandan, North Dakota early next year, which are the company's last wholly owned coal-fired facilities.\nOur generation portfolio's nameplate capacity before these retirements was 48% coal and will decrease to 31% in 2023 upon completion of the proposed Heskett IV natural gas-fired peaking unit.\nOur natural gas utility, along with our pipeline business, WBI Energy, recently announced a project to increase natural gas service to Wahpeton, North Dakota, while also providing natural gas service for the first time to Kindred, North Dakota.\nThis project is driven by customer contracts requiring more firm natural gas supply than our current infrastructure can provide to Eastern North Dakota.\nThe project involves building approximately 60 miles of 12-inch pipeline from our existing facilities at Mapleton, North Dakota to Wahpeton.\nIt will add 20 million cubic feet per day of natural gas capacity and is estimated to cost about $75 million.\nSubject to regulatory approvals, construction is expected to start in early 2024 with completion later that year.\nRegarding our pipeline operations, we're thrilled that WBI Energy received final FERC authorization in early July, permitting the commencement of construction on the North Bakken expansion project in Western North Dakota\nThis $260 million endeavor will increase our system's daily natural gas transportation capacity by 250 million cubic feet, elevating WBI's total pipeline capacity to over 2.4 Bcf per day, while helping to mitigate natural gas flaring in the area and enabling Bakken producers to transport natural gas to market\nWork commenced here in mid-July\nGiven favorable weather conditions during the building period, we anticipate the project to be operational by year-end\nLet's now discuss Construction\nOur Construction Services Group experienced an exceptional second quarter, with robust demand for both interior and exterior specialized contracting\nCSG reported unprecedented second quarter revenues and earnings, along with a record-breaking backlog of $1.32 billion at the end of June\nCompetition remains fierce in all sectors, but we're confident that our customer relationships, skilled workforce, and service quality will help us secure and execute profitable projects\nAs a reminder, revenue projections for this business in 2021 remain between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion, with margins similar to or slightly better than 2020\nLastly, at our construction materials division, despite a slight year-over-year decline in earnings, Knife River is performing near record levels, narrowly missing last year's record second quarter earnings while continuing to generate record revenues\nDemand and pricing for aggregates and ready-mix concrete are strong across several markets\nConstruction materials reported a backlog of $912 million at quarter-end, a 4% increase from the previous year\nRevenue projections for this business also range from $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion, with margins comparable to our 2020 levels\nWe remain optimistic about our construction businesses and continue to explore strategic acquisition opportunities that will enhance our existing footprint and appropriately expand our operations, while earning attractive returns on invested capital\nAs mentioned in yesterday's news release, we are very positive about the discussions surrounding infrastructure funding packages at both federal and state levels across our operational areas\nWith combined construction backlog at an all-time high of $2.23 billion as of June 30, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on these multi-year growth opportunities\nWhile we believe these infrastructure proposals will provide additional opportunities in some of our core business areas, such as surface transportation improvements, renewable energy, power grid modernization, broadband, and more, these proposals are not included in our earnings per share guidance of $2 to $2.15 for 2021 or in our 5-year capital investment plan\nOverall, we are very satisfied with our performance in the first half of the year\nMDU Resources' focus has been and continues to be on generating significant long-term value through the execution of our business plans, organic growth projects, and targeted acquisitions\nWe maintain a strong balance sheet, solid credit ratings, and a good liquidity position\nFor the past 83 consecutive years, we have provided a competitive dividend for our shareholders and have increased it for the last 30 years\nAs always, MDU Resources is dedicated to operating with integrity and prioritizing safety while creating superior shareholder value, and we continue to act in accordance with our tagline of Building a Strong America\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'll highlight our 2020 achievements, outline my projections for 2021, and discuss our future plans.\nStephen will then provide a detailed analysis of our fourth quarter results and 2021 forecast.\nWe ended the year on a high note with fourth quarter performance surpassing expectations.\nDespite the challenges and uncertainties of the pandemic year, we delivered another robust quarter.\nOur operations showcased flexibility and determination to produce excellent financial outcomes, despite revenue pressures and declines in some of our target markets.\nThis trend persisted throughout the year.\nWe promptly implemented measures to protect our employees' health and safety at the start of 2020.\nOur teams worked diligently to adapt our manufacturing and supply chains multiple times during the year to meet our customers' evolving needs.\nWe excelled in serving customers while continuing to enhance efficiency and productivity.\nWe acted swiftly to manage expenses effectively.\nAs a result, we delivered exceptional margins for our shareholders, generated strong free cash flow, and strengthened our balance sheet.\nNotably, our customer performance metrics reached record levels in service, punctual delivery, and quality.\nWe achieved the best safety record in the company's history by year-end.\nOur factory productivity and supply chain initiatives contributed significantly to our financial success.\nWe also managed to introduce several employee training and development programs.\nI'm particularly impressed by how our employees found ways to work safely and innovate, not just to complete tasks, but to improve our processes.\nIt's no coincidence that we completed over 100 Lean Kaizen improvement projects in 2020, despite the constraints of social distancing, remote work, and COVID-19 precautions.\nIn December, we acknowledged these achievements by awarding all our employees worldwide, except the executive team, a $1,000 appreciation bonus.\nI'm proud of how our employees united to support each other, work safely during the pandemic, and continue to deliver excellent results for customers.\nLet me now share some thoughts on the outlook for this year and beyond.\nOur Machine Clothing segment's target markets seem to be improving.\nWe finished last year with a strong order book, which is promising for this year and beyond as the global economy recovers.\nAs a leader in machine clothing, we're well-positioned to grow with our customers, particularly in the expanding tissue and packaging sectors.\nOur long-standing strategy of continuous investment in technology and product development, coupled with operational discipline, has proven beneficial during the worst market downturn in over a decade.\nConsider this: during a global pandemic recession, our MC segment increased its adjusted EBITDA margin by 170 basis points in 2020.\nEven more impressively, since 2015, our MC segment has expanded its adjusted EBITDA margin by over 500 basis points.\nWe're also optimistic about our Engineered Composites segment's future, although it's a longer-term prospect as 2021 is expected to face challenges from the pandemic and the downturn in commercial aerospace and air travel.\nThroughout 2021, we anticipate slower production on some AEC lines due to excess inventory in our facilities and in our customers' supply chains, particularly for components of the Boeing 737 MAX, 787, and to a lesser extent, the F-35.\nTo continue managing costs, and in response to Boeing's recent downward revision of 787 demand, we implemented a workforce reduction in our Salt Lake City facility, where we produce 787 frames, just yesterday.\nWhile 2021 is expected to be slower due to inventory reduction, we anticipate long-term growth in Engineered Composites.\nWe're well-positioned in both military and commercial markets with solid programs such as the CH-53K, JASSM missile, F-35, and LEAP.\nOur position on LEAP engines with Safran should see early growth in the recovery, as narrow-body aircraft, which the LEAP engine powers, are expected to lead commercial aerospace out of the recession, with domestic air travel likely to recover first.\nNow, let me discuss our strategy.\nAlbany International has a 125-year history of innovation and developing new materials that benefit our customers.\nWe're committed to continuing this legacy by focusing on developing the next generation of engineered materials and advanced composites to help our customers enhance their products and production processes.\nOur Machine Clothing segment leads in PMC by offering a comprehensive range of advanced material belts used on paper machines, which operate at high speeds in harsh environments.\nWe've built a reputation for continuously improving our belt technology, durability, and performance.\nOur advancements enable our customers to produce higher quality paper products reliably at lower overall production costs under demanding conditions.\nThis technology-intensive collaborative partnership is highly valued by our customers.\nIn our Engineered Composites segment, we continue to advance the state of the art in advanced composites, including our proprietary 3D woven composite material used in LEAP engine fan blades and cases.\nIn 2020, despite the pandemic, we collaborated closely with Safran to further improve our 3D woven composite materials and reduce manufacturing costs, ensuring we'll be even more competitive as commercial aerospace rebounds.\nWe also expanded our collaboration with new customers and for new applications to diversify our customer base and develop future growth areas.\nOur technology development for the Wing of Tomorrow program with Airbus has continued through the pandemic.\nWhile this program is longer-term, it's crucial that we secure an early position and contribute our technology to design the next generation of aircraft.\nIn the medium and near term, we have other ongoing R&D efforts, which I call incubator projects, in both military and commercial areas.\nFor instance, our R&D team is supporting a major prime OEM in developing next-generation hypersonic materials and structures using our proprietary 3D woven composite materials.\nWe also have projects in unmanned vehicles, higher temperature materials, and thermoplastics.\nWe believe the current downturn in commercial aerospace is temporary and that long-term market forces will drive energy efficiency and continued replacement of metallic components with lighter composites.\nThis trend will become more important as the industry seeks to reduce its environmental impact with the next generation of more efficient aircraft.\nOur commercially proven 3D woven composite technology can meet the need for lighter weight and high strength, and we intend to increase our participation in the most demanding structural applications in aerospace.\nAs a company, we remain committed to investing in technology and product development of advanced materials for organic growth.\nIn fact, we're increasing our R&T budgets in both segments in 2021.\nThis is a crucial part of our capital allocation strategy.\nOrganic growth has been driven not only by our investment in hard capital such as new products, tooling, and production equipment but also by our investment in intellectual capital - the expertise, time, and effort necessary for successfully developing new products and process know-how over time.\nWe employ a disciplined approach to investments and success metrics.\nOur capital allocation decisions are guided by anticipated shareholder returns, prioritizing projects with the best risk-adjusted outcomes.\nOverall, we feel positive about what lies ahead.\nOur robust financial position and strong cash flow enable ongoing growth investments.\nI'll now pass the presentation to Stephen.\nI will discuss the quarterly results followed by our initial business outlook for the upcoming year.\nQ4 total company revenue was $226.9 million, down 12% from $257.7 million in the same period last year.\nExcluding currency effects, net sales dropped 13.6% year-over-year this quarter.\nIn Machine Clothing, after accounting for currency impacts, net sales decreased 6.6% year-over-year, with declines across most major product categories, partly offset by engineered fabrics growth.\nPublication grades saw the largest decline at over 21% on a constant currency basis, accounting for about 17% of our MC sales this quarter.\nNevertheless, we observe indications of an improving machine clothing market overall.\nWhile packaging and tissue grades declined year-over-year this quarter due to factors mentioned in Q3, the decreases were significantly smaller than in Q3.\nAdditionally, Q4 segment net sales exceeded Q3 and slightly surpassed our expectations.\nEngineered Composites net sales, adjusted for currency effects, fell 23.5% compared to last year, mainly due to significant reductions in LEAP and Boeing 787 program revenue, partially offset by growth in F-35 and CH-53K platforms.\nThis quarter's ASC LEAP program generated nearly $25 million in revenue, compared to $48 million in the same quarter last year.\nHowever, Q4 ASC LEAP revenue increased substantially from Q3, rising 48% as all three ASC LEAP facilities operated for the full quarter.\nThe company's Q4 gross profit was $91.3 million, a 5.5% decrease from the same period last year.\nOverall gross margin improved by 280 basis points from 37.5% to 40.3% of net sales.\nMC segment gross margin rose from 50.2% to 50.9% of net sales, driven by favorable exchange rates, increased efficiencies, and product mix.\nAEC gross margin improved from 19.6% to 21.7% of net sales, primarily due to favorable program revenue mix, partially offset by a smaller net favorable change in long-term contract profitability.\nWe recognized a $500,000 net favorable change in estimated long-term contract profitability this quarter, compared to a $3.3 million improvement in Q4 2019.\nQ4 selling, technical, general and research expenses increased from $51.3 million to $54.8 million year-over-year, and rose from 19.9% to 24.1% of net sales.\nThe expense increase was mainly due to higher incentive compensation and increased foreign currency revaluation losses, partially offset by reduced travel expenses.\nThe higher incentive compensation in Q3 and Q4 2020 included $3.9 million in corporate accruals for the special $1,000 employee bonus mentioned by Bill.\nTotal company operating income was $35.0 million, down from $43.6 million in the prior year quarter.\nMachine Clothing operating income decreased by $4.9 million due to lower gross profit, higher STG&R expense, and increased restructuring costs, while AEC operating income fell by $2.1 million due to lower gross profit and higher STG&R expense, partially offset by lower restructuring costs.\nOther income and expense in the quarter resulted in net income of $490,000 compared to a $350,000 expense in the same period last year.\nThe improvement was primarily due to more favorable foreign currency revaluation effects.\nThe Q4 income tax rate was 13.5% compared to 24.8% in the prior year quarter.\nDue to a foreign currency revaluation gain at an entity with no tax provision requirement, the tax rate for adjusted earnings per share is slightly higher at 17.8%.\nThis 17.8% tax rate is significantly lower than the full-year rate.\nFor the entire 2020, our tax rate, excluding discrete items, was 28.4%, compared to 28% for 2019.\nThe lower Q4 rate, mainly due to adjustments of earlier quarters' provisions, increased adjusted earnings per share by $0.12.\nIf we had known the final full-year rate earlier, that $0.12 would have been recognized as additional adjusted earnings per share in previous quarters.\nQ4 net income attributable to the company was $27.5 million, a 5.5% decrease from $29.1 million last year.\nThe reduction was primarily due to lower operating income, partially offset by the lower tax rate and improved other income and expense.\nEarnings per share was $0.85 this quarter compared to $0.90 last year.\nAfter adjusting for foreign currency revaluation effects, restructuring expenses, pension curtailment charges, and CirComp acquisition and integration costs, adjusted earnings per share was $0.89 this quarter compared to $0.97 last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased 10.4% to $57.3 million for the most recent quarter compared to the same period last year.\nMachine Clothing adjusted EBITDA was $50.9 million, or 35.3% of net sales, down from $52.8 million, or 35.1% of net sales, in the prior year quarter.\nAEC adjusted EBITDA was $21.3 million, or 25.7% of net sales, down from last year's $24.2 million, or 22.6% of net sales.\nRegarding our balance sheet, net debt decreased by about $46 million in Q4.\nConsequently, our absolute leverage ratio dropped from 0.89 at the end of Q3 to 0.74 at the end of Q4.\nThe net debt reduction was mainly due to strong Machine Clothing segment operating cash flow and lower capital expenditures, primarily from reduced LEAP program spending.\nNow I'll discuss our expectations for the coming year by comparing it to 2020 and providing initial 2021 financial guidance.\nWe anticipate another strong performance year in the Machine Clothing segment.\nFor the full year 2020, we achieved net sales of about $573 million, down 5% from about $601 million in 2019.\nQ4 2020 orders increased about 6% compared to Q4 2019.\nThis marked a significant change from the first three quarters when cumulative segment orders had decreased compared to 2019.\nThis trend gives us confidence as we enter 2021.\nWe expect Q1 2021 sales to increase compared to the relatively low Q1 2020 levels.\nOur initial net sales guidance for the segment is $570 million to $590 million.\nMachine Clothing had an exceptionally profitable year in 2020, generating $216 million in adjusted EBITDA.\nThree factors will make it challenging to achieve similar results in 2021.\nAs previously mentioned, we benefited from favorable foreign exchange rates in 2020, particularly with the weak Brazilian real and Mexican peso, currencies in which we have more expenses than revenues.\nOverall, favorable exchange rates added over $6 million to adjusted EBITDA in 2020 compared to 2019 rates.\nHowever, some of these beneficial effects had diminished by year-end.\nFor instance, the Mexican peso weakened from under 20 pesos per U.S. dollar in Q1 2020 to almost 25 in Q2, but returned to under 20 by year-end.\nIn 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced significantly reduced travel expenses in the segment compared to previous years.\nWhile this boosted the bottom line by about $6 million, it wasn't ideal for business, as we rely on strong customer relationships to understand their needs and drive product development and support.\nWe anticipate resuming our previous level of travel in 2021, although Q1 travel may still be affected by COVID.\nWe continue to face pressure on input costs, particularly in logistics where sea, rail, and air freight expenses are much higher than 12 months ago.\nTypically, we experience over $4 million in input cost pressure annually, and there's reason to believe this could be higher in 2021.\nAs usual, we expect to be unable to recover all of the increased costs through price increases.\nWe will, of course, strive to implement cost-saving measures to offset as much of the remainder as possible.\nDespite these three pressures on profitability, we expect the Machine Clothing segment to have another strong year of profit performance and are providing initial adjusted EBITDA guidance of $195 million to $205 million for the segment.\nFor Engineered Composites, 2020 was a difficult year in terms of revenue.\nOverall, segment revenue declined by about $125 million in 2020 compared to 2019, mainly due to lower sales on LEAP, 787, and other commercial programs, offset by growth in military programs.\nUnfortunately, 2021 will see a continuation of some of these trends, with the year shaping up to be one of finished goods inventory destocking across our customers' supply chains.\nFor the ASC LEAP program, we expect to continue producing components for the LEAP-1B variant, which powers the 737 MAX, at very low levels.\nAlthough the 737 MAX is re-entering service, there's considerable finished goods inventory in the channel at Boeing, Safran, and our own facilities, on which we've already recognized revenue as we do so at the time of production, not delivery.\nIn 2021, we currently expect to make components for fewer than 150 LEAP-1B engines, far below the 1,000-plus engine shipsets we'd expect to deliver annually in the long term.\nFor LEAP-1A, there's much less finished goods inventory in the channel, and we expect to produce components for well over 500 engine shipsets in 2021.\nOverall, while the total number of ASC LEAP engine shipsets produced in 2021 is expected to be somewhat higher than in 2020, this is offset by the absence of certain recoverable non-recurring expenses recognized as revenue in 2020, resulting in roughly flat revenues for ASC from 2020 to 2021.\nOur next largest commercial program, producing frames for the Boeing 787, also faces finished goods inventory destocking challenges.\nIn 2020, we had already seen some effect from Boeing's decision to reduce the 787 build rate, and our revenues from the program in 2020 were down over 20% from 2019.\nHowever, as Boeing further reduced the 787 build rate, there has been an increased buildup of our finished goods in Boeing's supply chain, resulting in drastic reductions in order quantities for delivery in 2021.\nAdditionally, we expect our start-up of production of the 787 aft fuselage frames will now shift from late 2021 into mid-2022 as it will take longer to consume the parts already in the supply chain that were produced by the previous supplier.\nOverall, in 2021, we expect our revenues on the 787 frames program to be $30 million to $35 million lower than in 2020.\nOn the military side, we support the Lockheed Martin F-35 through several contracts for different parts, including wing skins, edge seals, and engine components at both our Salt Lake City and Boerne locations.\nF-35 has been and remains a very important platform for us.\nIn 2020, we recognized over $85 million of revenue on the platform overall, up more than 25% from 2019.\nHowever, during 2020, Lockheed Martin produced finished F-35s at a lower rate than originally predicted due to pandemic-related supply chain issues and consumed fewer sustainment parts.\nAs a result, during 2020, there was a buildup of our finished goods in the F-35 supply chain; a situation we expect will reverse in 2021.\nThis year, to rebalance the supply chain, we expect our build rate will be lower than Lockheed Martin's aircraft completion rate.\nWe now expect our F-35 revenues in 2021 to be more than $15 million lower than in 2020.\nWe see similar patterns in several smaller commercial programs across the segment where the revenue on those programs in 2021 will be close to $15 million lower than in 2020.\nAll of these reductions will be offset by growth on other programs, most notably on the CH-53K.\nOverall for the Engineered Composites segment, we are providing initial guidance for net sales of $275 million to $295 million.\nRegarding Engineered Composites segment profitability, 2020 was a strong year with adjusted EBITDA margins over 26%, largely enabled by three factors: strong operating performance evidenced by about $10 million in net favorable adjustment to long-term contract profitability; a sales mix benefit as the majority of revenue decline from 2019 to 2020 was on the ASC LEAP program, which has a lower than average profit margin; and despite the revenue decline, there was limited loss of fixed cost absorption as the cost-plus nature of the ASC LEAP program allowed us to still recover all fixed costs of operating our three ASC facilities.\nUnfortunately, those factors will not help us again in 2021.\nThe lower revenue in 2021 at our non-ASC facilities, especially our Salt Lake City operation where all our 787 work and most of our F-35 work is performed, will create upward pressure on plant overhead rates.\nWhile we've announced a workforce reduction at our Salt Lake City facility, that alone won't offset these rate pressures.\nIn such an environment, it will be difficult to achieve the lower unit production costs required to deliver significant improvements to long-term contract profitability.\nThis is a change from recent years when growing revenue at our non-ASC facilities created a tailwind to long-term contract profitability.\nIn 2021, we'll see a product mix hit as the roughly $40 million to $50 million revenue decline we expect this year is on fixed price programs, which have a higher than average profit margin.\nUnlike 2020, we'll suffer from a loss of fixed cost absorption due to the fixed price nature of the programs with declining revenues.\nAs a result, the decremental margins will be much larger than the average margins on those programs.\nIt's not unusual for our fixed price programs to have EBITDA contribution margins in the 30% to 40% range.\nDue to the impact of these three factors in 2021, we expect not only the top line reduction discussed earlier but also EBITDA margins for the segment to fall from the 26.1% level delivered in 2020 into the low 20s.\nTherefore, we are providing initial 2021 guidance for Engineered Composites adjusted EBITDA of $55 million to $65 million.\nAt the company level, we are providing initial 2021 guidance as follows: revenue between $850 million and $890 million; effective income tax rate of 28% to 30%; depreciation and amortization between $70 million and $75 million; capital expenditures of $50 million to $60 million; GAAP and adjusted earnings per share between $2.40 and $2.80; and adjusted EBITDA between $195 million and $220 million.\nWhile we're not providing explicit cash flow guidance for 2021, we expect the free cash flow we generate in 2021 will be well above the roughly $100 million generated in 2020.\nIn 2021, we expect R&D expenses to be more than 25% higher than in 2020, reflecting ongoing investments in both segments mentioned earlier.\nWe are very pleased with the company's overall performance in 2020.\nDespite challenging operating environments, both segments met customer needs and delivered outstanding performance while maintaining a safe working environment.\nAlthough it appears we have one more year of channel destocking ahead before returning to growth in the Engineered Composites segment, we remain very excited about the future prospects for both segments.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Please refer to Slide 2 for additional details on calculating these pro forma metrics.\nPro forma comparisons for current and prior periods incorporate results from recent acquisitions and the PA Consulting investment.\nWe are also providing adjusted pro forma net revenue comparisons that exclude the impact of the extra week in Q4 fiscal 2020.\nLet's move on to the agenda on Slide 3.\nSteve will start by providing an update on our strategic progress and Jacobs' future ESG initiatives.\nBob will then discuss our performance across business lines.\nKevin will provide a more detailed analysis of our financial results, followed by updates on our Focus 2023 and M&A initiatives, as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow.\nI will now hand it over to Steve Demetriou, our Chair and CEO.\nMoving to Slide 4.\nBefore discussing our results, I'd like to mention that we're finalizing our new strategy.\nWe'll be holding an investor event in the week of March 7 to provide an in-depth look at the next phase of Jacobs' transformation.\nThree key initiatives have been identified.\nFirstly, we're implementing a purpose-driven plan, grounded in our values and strong culture, to maximize our next growth stage.\nSecondly, we've identified and allocated investment resources to capitalize on three long-term growth opportunities: global infrastructure modernization, climate response, and industry digitization.\nThirdly, we're taking a transformative approach to seize these opportunities by unleashing Jacobs' innovation potential, expanding our technology ecosystem, and accelerating our trajectory of profitable growth and sustainable cash flow generation.\nWe're excited to unveil this strategy at our upcoming investor event.\nNow, let's review our financial performance.\nI'm satisfied with our strong fourth quarter and fiscal year results, with net revenue growing 7% year-over-year.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by 12% in the quarter and 18% for the full year.\nBacklog at the end of the fourth quarter was up 12% year-over-year and 7% on a pro forma basis.\nPA Consulting continued to deliver exceptional results with 41% revenue growth.\nMore importantly, PA achieved this growth while maintaining adjusted operating profit margins of 24%.\nFor the full year, PA's revenues exceeded $1 billion, significantly surpassing our deal investment model expectations.\nLooking ahead, we now have certainty regarding unprecedented U.S. infrastructure funding with the recent passage of the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure and Jobs Act.\nMore broadly, global infrastructure modernization and national security needs are accelerating as our government and commercial clients address climate change challenges, advance digitization strategies, and tackle increasing cyber threats.\nAdditionally, our advanced facilities business is expected to show significant growth, driven by demand for additional semiconductor manufacturing capacity and post-pandemic life sciences priorities.\nGiven these strong growth dynamics, we're introducing fiscal 2022 guidance for double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth.\nLooking beyond 2022, we anticipate our strong organic growth will result in approximately $10 per share of adjusted earnings per share in fiscal year 2025.\nMoving to Slide 5.\nReflecting on climate change, it's globally recognized that humanity is at a critical juncture in efforts to limit global warming.\nJacobs and PA participated in the recent UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow to demonstrate our commitment to reinventing tomorrow through immediate and sustained action in transitioning to a net-zero economy.\nWe stood alongside business, financial, and government leaders, as well as activists and students, to ensure our voice was heard.\nWe engaged in activities to accelerate solutions to keep the world on track to meet the critical 1.5 degree Celsius trajectory, while preparing to adapt to inevitable climate change impacts.\nTurning to Slide 6, given our business nature, Jacobs' greatest opportunity to positively address climate change comes from the sustainable and resilient solutions we co-create and deliver with our clients.\nTo lead this effort, we've established a new Office of Global Climate Response and ESG to ensure sustainability is integrated into all our solutions across markets and geographies.\nWe're accelerating our established partnerships with public and private sectors to advance net-zero carbon outcomes, climate resilience, natural and social capital, and ESG business transformation, aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\nWe currently generate approximately $5 billion in ESG-related revenue annually and expect significant growth over the next several years, driven by strong capabilities in energy transition, decarbonization, climate adaptation, and natural resource stewardship.\nOur culture is a competitive advantage.\nOur people possess the knowledge, curiosity, and client trust to fulfill our purpose of creating a more connected, sustainable world.\nMoving to Slide 7 to review Critical Mission Solutions.\nDuring the fourth quarter, our CMS business maintained its strong performance.\nTotal CMS backlog increased 16% year-over-year, 7% on a pro forma basis, to $10.6 billion, driven by strategic new wins in cyber and intel, and nuclear and remediation.\nOur CMS strategy focuses on creating recurring revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned with critical national priorities.\nThree market trends we see offering continued strong growth include cyber, commercial space, and 5G technology for national security.\nStarting with cyber and intelligence, we're observing several major emerging threats to national security.\nFirst, cyber attacks on mission-critical infrastructure, which are increasingly stealthy and as disruptive as traditional attacks.\nSecond, the speed and complexity of near-peer threats, requiring real-time coordination between space and other domains as nation-state sponsored attacks intensify.\nThird, the adoption of data-intensive AI-based applications is dramatically increasing the need for real-time data security and integrity.\nFunding to address these threats is partially reflected in the unclassified federal government spending on cyber in FY '22, expected to exceed $20 billion, up 10% from the previous year.\nWe anticipate spending within classified budgets to be even higher.\nDuring the quarter, we were awarded a $300 million, seven-year contract with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency to modernize NGA's ability to rapidly gain and share insights from cross-domain inventory, including top-secret data classification.\nWithin the classified budget, we secured a $170 million, five-year new contract to develop highly secure and hardened software applications leveraging the latest advances in AI and machine learning.\nWe recently completed the BlackLynx acquisition, which provides software-enabled solutions for automating data collection at the edge and quickly gaining insights from extremely large volumes of structured and unstructured data.\nOur strong presence across the DoD and intelligence community, along with our digital enablement center, will provide the momentum for BlackLynx to commercialize and scale their solutions, resulting in highly profitable recurring revenue.\nWe also recently announced a strategic investment and distribution agreement with HawkEye 360, which will enhance our digital intelligence suite of technologies with their RF spectrum analytics and collection automation offering.\nRegarding space, with significant capital being infused into commercial space companies, space tourism is becoming more affordable, and other emerging opportunities such as satellite-based technologies and space debris impact assessment are accelerating.\nWe currently support commercial space companies with manufacturing process optimization, system and subsystem prototype work, and test facility studies and projects.\nAs commercial space matures, we are positioning our solutions for these emerging opportunities.\nDuring the quarter, we were notified of a significant increase to the ceiling of our contract at Marshall Space Flight Center, which also supports Artemis and SLS.\nThe U.S. Space Force selected Jacobs for a five-year contract to provide software and system support for its Patriot Excalibur system, which coordinates scheduling, training, and status of U.S. Space Force aircraft.\nLastly, our telecom business had a strong quarter.\nWe anticipate the rollout of 5G investment from clients like AT&T, Verizon, DIRECTV, T-Mobile, and Dish Network to accelerate in 2022 and beyond.\nThe recently passed Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill allocates $2.5 billion for 5G implementation at U.S. military installations, while the Department of Defense is making significant investments in 5G technology to support national priorities\nWe anticipate continued strong demand for our offerings in 2022\nThe CMS sales pipeline remains strong, with over $30 billion in potential new business opportunities projected for the next 18 months, including $10 billion currently under evaluation and an improving profit margin outlook\nLet's move on to Slide 8, where I'll review our People & Places Solutions division\nWe ended the year with solid financial results, achieving 7% year-over-year backlog growth and annual net revenue increases\nI'll discuss our performance across the key areas of climate response, pandemic solutions, infrastructure modernization, and digitization\nLet's begin with climate response\nAs the top-ranked global environmental consulting firm, Jacobs is spearheading efforts to mitigate climate change impacts, facilitate the transition to a clean energy net-zero economy, and provide rapid response to natural disasters\nThis quarter, Jacobs secured a multi-year contract with the U.S. Army's Engineer Research and Development Center to implement nature-based solutions that enhance climate resilience across Department of Defense facilities\nJacobs has been chosen to reimagine New York's Rikers Island, transforming the site through a comprehensive community revitalization project with a focus on equity, resilience, and multi-use development, incorporating our innovative social value analysis\nAs the initial phase of a 20-year citywide program, Jacobs' plan will consolidate four aging wastewater facilities into a state-of-the-art water resource recovery facility capable of processing 1 billion gallons per day, including a renewable energy hub\nIn the transportation sector, our experts have developed advanced charging technology enabling clients to transition to decarbonized operations, a key focus of economic stimulus packages\nOur transit team continues to secure contracts supporting clients with asset, operational, and technology shifts towards green fleets\nFor instance, we recently won and initiated a hydrogen rail facility study with Caltrans\nOur ongoing work with Brisbane Metro continues to showcase cutting-edge green transit solutions\nWith exponential growth predicted in the electric vehicle market, Jacobs has become the preferred firm for supporting leading EV battery and vehicle manufacturing companies worldwide\nWe've doubled our EV business in the past year and anticipate continued expansion\nWe also announced a strategic partnership and investment in Microgrid Labs, a provider of commercial fleet electrification and infrastructure solutions, including their proprietary SaaS platform\nThe transition to a green economy is driving increased investments in hydrogen and renewables\nOur team is delivering diverse solutions for various clients, from our involvement in the Bacton Energy Hub Consortium in the U.K. to energy transmission plans for potential offshore wind development in the U.S. and additional contracts with Iberdrola's Renewables Avonlie Solar Farm and the Swanbank waste-to-energy facility in Australia\nTurning to the theme of pandemic response\nWith ongoing supply chain disruptions, healthcare system challenges, and semiconductor chip shortages, Jacobs is gaining momentum with multi-year backlog across sectors, securing new wins in biopharma such as the next phase of a new $2 billion biotechnology facility\nJacobs has successfully won several healthcare opportunities in the U.S., Europe, and Australia as they reassess pandemic response operations\nThe most significant aspect of global supply chain disruption involves semiconductor shortages\nAs the world's leading technical services provider to the semiconductor industry, we are well-positioned for substantial growth in the electronics sector this year and expect our electronics business to accelerate further over the next several years\nIn fact, Jacobs is engineering several major investments for large chip manufacturers\nProjects like Intel's new Arizona Fab, which Jacobs is designing, are scheduled to be fully operational in 2024\nThe new fab will manufacture Intel's most advanced process technology and represents the largest private investment in Arizona's history\nInterconnected with climate response, pandemic solutions, infrastructure modernization, and digital transformation are driving long-term transformative growth with significant wins across all markets\nGlobally, we continue to secure pioneering transportation projects across all sectors and modes\nIn highways, we were recently selected by Transport for New South Wales, along with consortium partners, to undertake the $1.2 billion Warringah Freeway upgrade project to accommodate a third road crossing Sydney Harbour\nIn Ports and Maritime, we won the sustainable ports design and program management contract for King Abdul Aziz Port in Dammam, Saudi Arabia\nIn air transportation, we were chosen as the integrated program manager for the Solidarity Transport Hub in Poland, a greenfield airport and multimodal project including a high-speed rail network with an initial planned capacity of 45 million passengers\nThe program is of national significance and will set the benchmark for zero-carbon delivery, serving as a sustainable transportation platform for Eastern Europe's future travel demands\nOur long-standing relationships and existing framework agreements supported major wins with U.S. State Departments of Transportation and Transport for London, reinforcing our market-leading position in solving our clients' most complex transportation challenges\nIn summary, we see continued investment across the P&PS client sectors\nWe are already experiencing exciting global wins in the first quarter of our new fiscal year, indicating that we are well-positioned to develop and deliver unmatched value and capability to our clients as investment momentum builds from the U.S. Infrastructure Act and other economic stimulus initiatives\nMoving on to PA Consulting on Slide 9\nAs Steve mentioned, PA continues to exceed expectations, supported by an extension of consultative services to the U.K.'s National Health Service\nPA's efforts have expanded into longer-term vaccine deployment, testing and tracing, and future pandemic preparedness planning\nAdditionally, PA's growth is being enhanced by recent digital solution wins for confidential U.S. biopharmaceutical clients in the areas of cell and gene therapy and next-generation patient care models\nWe continue to make progress on our synergy growth and long-term collaboration\nThe Jacobs-PA team recently secured a biotechnology manufacturing plant expansion project to provide an end-to-end lifecycle solution incorporating critical digitized clinical trial information into the process design and facility layout\nFurthermore, we continue to receive joint strategic consultancy awards in the transportation sector globally\nI look forward to our continued success with collaborative and integrated offerings for our customers\nAt COP26, PA showcased its deep ESG expertise and successfully unveiled its innovative EV battery charging technology, ChargePoint\nMoreover, PA received industry recognition for their jointly developed COVID-19 awareness and situational intelligence tool with Unilever\nThe business exceeded current expansion targets for the year and is well-positioned for continued future growth\nLet's turn to Slide 10 for a financial overview of fourth quarter results, followed by our fiscal year review\nAs we have previously communicated, our fiscal fourth quarter 2020 had 14 weeks compared to our normal 13-week quarters, which impacted our quarter year-over-year growth rate by 7% and our full year growth rate by 2%\nFourth quarter gross revenue increased 2% year-over-year, and net revenue was up 7%\nIncluding the pro forma impact from all acquisitions and adjusting for the extra week in the previous year, net revenue was up 6% for the quarter\nAdjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 27.2%, up 370 basis points year-over-year\nConsistent with last year, the year-over-year increase in gross margin was driven by a favorable revenue mix in both People & Places and CMS, as well as the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin profile of nearly 50%\nWe will continue to focus on increasing gross margins as we bring higher-value solutions to market for our clients\nAdjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue increased year-over-year to 17%\nWithin G&A, during the quarter, we incurred an approximate $20 million or $0.12 per share charge related to a legal settlement cost, which affected both GAAP and our adjusted results\nThis charge was related to a CH2M legacy matter concerning a previously completed product advisory arrangement\nGAAP operating profit was $252 million and was mainly impacted by $46 million of amortization from acquired intangibles\nAdjusted operating profit was $303 million, up 17%\nOur adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10%, up 85 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis\nGAAP earnings per share from continuing operations rounded to $0.34 per share and included $0.45 primarily related to U.K. statutory tax rate changes and other tax-related items, $0.40 related to the final mark-to-market of the Worley stock and related FX impact, $0.23 of net impact related to amortization of acquired intangibles, $0.10 of transaction and other related costs, and $0.06 from Focus 2023 and other restructuring costs\nExcluding these items, fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.58, including the $0.12 burden from the previously discussed legal matter\nPA's strong performance added $0.23 of accretion, net of additional interest, during the quarter.\nFourth quarter adjusted EBITDA reached $310 million, rising 12% compared to last year and accounting for 10% of net revenue.\nLet's now discuss our bookings.\nOur Q4 revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.3, setting us up well for the anticipated growth momentum in fiscal year 2022.\nWe'll now review our full fiscal year 2021 results on Slide 11.\nGross revenue grew by 4% while net revenue increased by 7%.\nNet revenue rose 3% for the entire year when considering the pro forma impact of all acquisitions and adjusting for the extra week in the previous year.\nWe've been improving our portfolio with higher-value solutions, as evidenced by the gross margin as a percentage of net revenue reaching 26% for the year, an increase of 235 basis points from the previous year.\nWe anticipate mid-single-digit reported revenue growth in Q1 of fiscal 2022, with faster growth in the second half driven by U.S. infrastructure spending and new awards in our CMS business.\nGAAP operating profit totaled $688 million, primarily affected by $261 million in purchase price consideration for the PA Consulting investment and $150 million in amortization of acquired intangibles.\nAdjusted operating profit grew 23% to $1.188 billion, representing 10% of net revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 18% year-over-year to $1.244 billion, accounting for 10.6% of net revenue and slightly exceeding the midpoint of our revised fiscal 2021 outlook.\nGAAP earnings per share was $3.12, impacted by several factors including PA Consulting purchase price consideration, amortization of acquired intangibles, U.K. tax changes, Focus 2023 charges, and partially offset by gains from the sale of Worley and C3.\nExcluding these items, adjusted earnings per share reached $6.29, surpassing the midpoint of our updated outlook.\nPA Consulting contributed $0.48 to the adjusted earnings per share figure.\nBefore discussing LOB performance, I'd like to mention our ongoing efforts to optimize our real estate footprint.\nWe anticipate a potential non-cash impairment charge of $60 million to $70 million in the first half of fiscal 2022 as we finalize the plan.\nOur new office layout will support virtual work options, leveraging new technology and more collaborative spaces.\nIn Q4 2021, CMS revenue decreased by 5% year-over-year, but was relatively flat on a pro forma basis when adjusting for the extra week in Q4 2020.\nThe transition away from two lower-margin contracts impacted CMS revenue growth, resulting in a $175 million year-over-year revenue decrease during the quarter.\nExcluding this contract roll-off and adjusting for the extra week last year, pro forma CMS revenue grew by double digits year-over-year.\nWe expect a $210 million year-over-year impact from these contract roll-offs in Q1 2022, which will end in Q2.\nConsequently, we anticipate a slight year-over-year decrease in reported revenue for Q1 2022, despite stronger underlying growth.\nWe expect CMS growth to improve throughout the year, resulting in a mid-to-high single-digit full year 2022 growth rate.\nCMS operating profit for Q4 increased by 7% to $115 million, with operating profit margin rising 100 basis points year-over-year to 9.1%.\nFor the full year, CMS operating profit grew 20% to $447 million, with an 8.8% operating profit margin.\nThe improvement in operating margin for both the quarter and the year was due to our focus on higher-margin opportunities across the business.\nWe expect the operating profit margin to remain in the mid-8% range throughout fiscal 2022.\nRegarding People & Places, Q4 net revenue was unchanged year-over-year.\nAccounting for the extra week, P&PS grew net revenue by approximately 8% year-over-year in Q4 and 2% for fiscal year 2021.\nP&PS total operating profit decreased year-over-year in Q4 due to a $20 million legal settlement cost mentioned earlier.\nExcluding this cost, operating profit would have increased by 8% in Q4.\nFor the fiscal year, operating profit rose by 5%, or 8% excluding the legal settlement.\nPA's performance included $273 million in revenue and $66 million in operating profit for the quarter.\nQ4 revenue grew by 41% year-over-year, or 32% in sterling.\nQ4 adjusted operating profit margin was 24%, meeting our expectations.\nFor the full year, PA Consulting's revenue increased by 33% (24% in sterling), with an adjusted operating profit margin of 23%.\nNon-allocated corporate costs totaled $55 million for the quarter and $190 million for the full year.\nThese costs increased year-over-year as expected, primarily due to higher medical costs and IT investments related to new working methods.\nWe anticipate non-allocated corporate costs to range from $200 million to $250 million in fiscal 2022, reflecting continued increases in medical costs and other investments.\nThese corporate costs, along with Focus 2023 and CMS and P&PS investments, will precede our expected acceleration in revenue growth and profit later in 2022.\nAs a result of these increased investments ahead of growth, Q1 profitability and earnings per share are likely to remain relatively flat compared to Q4 results, with improvement in Q2 and further acceleration in the second half of the year.\nTurning to Slide 13 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet.\nWe generated $176 million in reported free cash flow during the fourth quarter, with DSO showing strong improvement again.\nThe quarter's cash flow included $22 million related to restructuring and $16 million for a real estate lease termination as we adapt to virtual working.\nFor the year, free cash flow was $633 million, mainly impacted by the $261 million PA purchase price consideration treated as post-closing compensation.\nNevertheless, our reported free cash flow represented 133% conversion against our reported net income.\nFor fiscal year 2022, we aim for an adjusted free cash flow conversion at or above one time.\nDue to our strong cash flow, we ended the quarter with $1 billion in cash and $2.9 billion in gross debt, resulting in $1.9 billion of net debt.\nOur pro forma net debt to adjusted expected 2022 EBITDA is approximately 1.3 times, demonstrating the strength of our balance sheet.\nDuring the quarter, we sold our Worley stock for $370 million and executed a $250 million accelerated share repurchase program.\nWe will continue to monitor for any significant dislocation in our share price, given the strong long-term secular growth opportunities for our company.\nGiven our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased by 11% earlier this year to $0.21 per share.\nWe are introducing our fiscal 2022 outlook for adjusted EBITDA to range from $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion, representing double-digit growth at the midpoint.\nOur adjusted earnings per share outlook for fiscal 2022 ranges from $6.85 to $7.45.\nWe anticipate a multi-year benefit from the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to support our growth in the second half of fiscal 2022.\nLooking beyond this year, we see substantial opportunities for sustained organic growth driven by infrastructure monetization, climate response, and digital transformation.\nWe anticipate approximately $10 of adjusted earnings per share through fiscal 2025.\nAt our in-person investor event in March, we will provide more details on our long-term strategy and financial model.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Ron Tsoumas, our Chief Financial Officer, is accompanying me today\nWe'll commence with the business highlights presented on Slide 4\nThe company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $288 million\nOur organic growth, when excluding favorable currency translation, increased by 45% compared to the previous year\nIt's important to mention that the first quarter of the previous year was considerably affected by the pandemic\nDuring this year's first quarter, our team encountered fluctuations in customer demand and challenges in the supply chain\nThese challenges encompassed the ongoing shortage of semiconductor chips, supply chain disruptions related to the pandemic, and congestion at ports, all of which put pressure on both sales and margins\nOur team once again worked hard to address many of these challenges, allowing us to deliver results within our projected ranges for the quarter\nNevertheless, these fluctuations in demand and disruptions in the supply chain continued to necessitate corrective measures, such as expedited shipping and premium pricing for components\nAs of now, we anticipate these conditions to persist at least until the end of the calendar year\nWhile we have reaffirmed our full-year guidance, persistent headwinds may cause our performance to fall below the midpoint of the ranges, as the situation remains highly volatile and challenging\nThe sales growth we experienced in the first quarter was attributed to increased demand across most of our businesses, with a particular focus on the automotive and commercial vehicle markets\nWe also saw growth in our Dabir business, although it continues to be hindered by the pandemic, limiting our opportunities for product evaluation in hospital operating rooms and ICUs\nIn terms of orders, we secured substantial awards for electric vehicle (EV), cloud computing, and e-bike applications\nRegarding EVs, we reported last quarter that sales for EV applications constituted 13% of consolidated sales\nThis quarter, EV sales accounted for 16% of consolidated sales, and we expect this figure to remain in the mid-teens for fiscal 2022\nMethode's combination of user interface, LED lighting, and power distribution solutions is proving successful in the EV sector\nDuring the quarter, we further reduced our debt, generated positive operating cash flow, and continued to return capital to our shareholders\nWe have sufficient liquidity, enabling us to execute our stock buyback program, through which we purchased $7.6 million of shares in the quarter, and to pay our dividend, which increased from $0.11 to $0.14 per share during the quarter\nWe maintained our balanced approach to capital allocation\nMoving on to Slide 5\nMethode had another strong quarter in terms of business awards\nThese awards continue to capitalize on key market trends such as vehicle electrification and cloud computing\nThe awards mentioned here represent some of the key business wins for the quarter and amount to over $30 million in annual business at full production\nIn the vehicle electrification sector, we secured awards for power distribution and LED lighting programs\nWe continue to win programs with OEMs globally in both automotive and commercial vehicle applications\nIn non-EV automotive, we were awarded programs for power, lighting, and traditional switch applications\nIn cloud computing, we observed demand for our power distribution and transceiver products in data center applications\nWe continue to be involved in the expansion of e-bikes, which employs our unique magneto elastic sensor technology.\nOur business awards are advancing our strategic goal of increasing both customer and geographic diversity, building upon the previous year.\nLet's move to Slide 6.\nAs I've noted in recent discussions, our business awards in the past couple of years have positioned us to compensate for the sales decline from our largest auto program.\nAs a result, we are seeing improvements in our customer and program diversity.\nOur electric vehicle, commercial vehicle, and cloud computing divisions have contributed to our customer diversification efforts.\nWhile GM and Ford have been and are expected to remain valuable customers who have driven Methode's past growth, we have deliberately and systematically expanded our client base in recent years.\nOur business outside of GM and Ford expanded to represent two-thirds of our total sales in fiscal 2021.\nTo summarize, despite ongoing demand fluctuations and supply chain challenges, we are still positioned to achieve strong organic growth for fiscal 2022.\nFirst quarter sales reached $287.8 million in fiscal year '22, compared to $190.9 million in fiscal year '21, representing an increase of $96.9 million or 50.8%.\nThe year-over-year quarterly comparisons include a positive foreign currency impact on sales of $10.3 million in the current quarter.\nThe increase was primarily due to lower sales in the prior year quarter resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and higher sales of electric and hybrid electric vehicles, which accounted for 16% of sales in the first quarter of fiscal year '22, aligning with our previous statement that electric and hybrid electric vehicle sales would make up mid-teens of our fiscal year '22 consolidated sales.\nAdditionally, stronger commercial vehicle sales contributed to the robust sales growth.\nFirst quarter net income rose by $8.4 million to $29.1 million or $0.76 per diluted share, up from $20.7 million or $0.54 per diluted share in the same period last year.\nNet income improved due to increased sales and favorable currency translation, partly offset by higher income tax expense, increased costs from supply chain disruption, higher selling and administrative expenses, and lower other income.\nFirst quarter gross margins were higher in fiscal year '22 compared to fiscal year '21, mainly due to increased sales, partially offset by higher material costs, increased logistic expenses including freight, and supply chain shortages.\nFiscal year '22 first quarter margins were 24.9% compared to 23.6% in the first quarter of fiscal year '21.\nThe negative impact of supply disruption and higher logistics costs, including freight, on the first quarter of fiscal year '22 gross margin was nearly 300 basis points.\nThese elevated costs experienced in the first quarter are expected to persist further into fiscal year '22.\nMoreover, we anticipate some cost inflation in the remainder of the current fiscal year.\nFirst quarter selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 11.4% compared to 13.9% in the fiscal '21 first quarter.\nThe fiscal year '22 first quarter percentage decrease was attributable to increased sales related to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fiscal '21 sales, partly offset by higher stock-based and performance-based compensation expenses.\nThe first quarter of fiscal year '22 selling and administrative expenses percentage was consistent with our historical norm, which should result in an efficient flow-through from gross margin to operating income.\nIn addition to the gross margin and selling and administrative items mentioned earlier, two other non-operational factors significantly impacted net income in the first quarter of fiscal year '22 compared to the same quarter last fiscal year.\nFirstly, income tax expense in the first quarter of fiscal year '22 was $5.7 million or 16.4% compared to a net tax benefit of $5.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal year '21.\nThe effective tax rate was lower in the first quarter of fiscal year '21 due to discrete tax benefits of $7.8 million in the quarter or $0.20 per diluted share.\nWithout the discrete tax benefits, the effective rate would have been 17.2%.\nThe year-over-year tax expense increase was $10.8 million.\nSecondly, other income net was lower by $1.6 million, primarily due to reduced international government assistance between the comparable quarters.\nMoving to EBITDA, a non-standard financial indicator.\nThe EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 was $48.5 million, compared to $29.3 million in the same timeframe of the previous fiscal year.\nEBITDA saw a positive influence from increased operating income, partly counteracted by reduced other income.\nFree cash flow, a non-standard financial measure, is calculated as the net cash from operating activities minus capital expenditures.\nThe first quarter of fiscal year 2022 saw a negative free cash flow of $6.2 million, in contrast to a positive $4.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nThis decline was primarily attributed to unfavorable changes in working capital, particularly inventory, stemming from logistical challenges and increased capital spending.\nDespite experiencing negative free cash flow in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we anticipate improvements for the rest of the fiscal year.\nWe expect to maintain our track record of generating consistent cash flows, enabling adequate funding for future organic growth, acquisitions, and shareholder returns.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we allocated approximately $15.9 million to capital expenditures, compared to $11.6 million in the same period of fiscal year 2021.\nThe higher first quarter capital expenditure aligns with our expectation that fiscal year 2022 would see increased investment compared to the previous year, estimated to range between $53 million and $57 million.\nOur robust balance sheet allows us to continue investing in our businesses to foster organic growth in the future.\nWe also actively seek opportunities for inorganic growth and maintain a balanced approach to returning capital to shareholders.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we decreased our gross debt by $4.7 million.\nSince acquiring Grakon in September 2018, we have reduced our gross debt by nearly $123 million.\nWe recently announced two capital allocation initiatives.\nOn March 31st, we introduced a $100 million share repurchase program, of which we executed $7.6 million in repurchases during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.\nSince the program's approval, we have bought back $15.1 million worth of shares at an average price of $46.45.\nAdditionally, we raised our quarterly dividend from $0.11 to $0.14 per share, a 27% increase.\nWe concluded the first quarter with $207.9 million in cash.\nAs mentioned earlier, we have reaffirmed our previously issued guidance for earnings per share and annual outlook.\nExternal factors and their potential impact on our financial results continue to pose ongoing challenges.\nWhile we have reconfirmed our full-year guidance, persistent headwinds may cause our performance to fall below the midpoint of the projected ranges, as the situation remains fluid and challenging.\nThe revenue projection for the entire fiscal year 2022 ranges from $1.175 billion to $1.235 billion.\nThe diluted earnings per share forecast spans from $3.35 to $3.75 per share.\nThis range accounts for uncertainties stemming from supply chain disruptions affecting semiconductors and other materials for both Methode and its customers.\nFrom a sales perspective, lower revenue could result from supply disruptions affecting us or our customers, potentially leading to reduced demand for our products or hindering our ability to meet customer needs.\nOngoing supply chain issues would also negatively impact gross margins due to additional expenses from premium freight, factory inefficiencies, and to a lesser extent, tariffs and other logistical factors, including port congestion.\nRising costs for materials, freight, and labor present a constant and dynamic challenge, and it remains unclear when these factors will stabilize.\nThat concludes my remarks.\nI believe we're prepared to take questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Kevin Blair, the president and CEO, will commence the presentation.\nWe kindly request that you restrict yourself to a single question and one follow-up inquiry.\nThroughout the presentation, we will be referencing non-GAAP financial metrics related to the company's performance.\nKevin Blair will now provide a summary of the quarter's results.\nOur team achieved another strong quarter, showing growth in revenue and earning assets while maintaining cost control that led to a 5% decrease in year-over-year quarterly expenses.\nMoreover, we continue to observe an improving credit outlook, resulting in a reduction of our allowance.\nWe have successfully achieved $75 million in pre-tax run rate benefits through the second quarter as part of our Synovus Forward initiatives and investments, with an additional $100 million expected by the end of 2022.\nLet me briefly remind you of our performance thus far compared to our expectations at the start of the year.\nWe indicated that we would achieve loan growth, excluding PPP loans, with acceleration in the latter half of the year.\nWe also stated that we would enhance our deposit mix and reduce our funding costs to stabilize the margin.\nFurthermore, we committed to implementing efficiency measures to restore positive operating leverage while effectively managing the uncertain credit environment and delivering the planned benefits from Synovus Forward.\nI'm happy to report that we are meeting these objectives and finished the first half of 2021 with significant momentum, feeling optimistic about future growth and expansion opportunities.\nOur commercial loan pipelines have returned to pre-pandemic levels, with continued growth in C&I outstandings and commitments, and line utilization slightly increased during the quarter.\nClients maintain strong liquidity, allowing us to further optimize our deposit mix and again reduce our funding costs this quarter.\nWe anticipate this trend to persist in the current low-rate environment.\nOur Wealth and Treasury and Payment Solutions divisions are performing exceptionally well.\nOngoing growth and operating margin expansion in these fee income-generating business units will help counterbalance the industry-wide decline in mortgage activity.\nCriticized and classified loans decreased for the quarter, further indicating that the heightened credit concerns arising from the pandemic continue to diminish and suggest the opportunity to gradually reduce the allowance toward day one CECL levels.\nDuring the first half of the year, we continued to invest in Synovus' future, focusing on key priorities to enhance customer experience and generate new sources of growth.\nSome examples include: our Treasury and Payment Solutions business introducing a new suite of integrated receivable solutions called Synovus Accelerate AR.\nThis solution has been well-received, and the sales pipeline is already growing, creating a new revenue stream while significantly benefiting our customers by saving them time and money.\nWe have also transferred approximately 25,000 business clients to Synovus Gateway, our new digital platform for business and commercial banking.\nWith enhanced functionality and capabilities, we are simplifying business operations for our customers and promoting higher levels of client retention.\nLastly, our smart analytics tool, which we've previously discussed, has been further implemented across our bankers and markets, and is beginning to impact pipeline growth and opportunities to increase our share of wallet from customers.\nThe second quarter reminded us that our focus on delivering a personalized and value-added customer experience is important and will continue to provide a foundation for future growth.\nIndustry-wide consumer satisfaction surveys once again demonstrate that our clients are more satisfied and loyal than those of our competitors.\nWe also received two awards of excellence for our family office during the quarter.\nThese scores and accolades are not success in themselves, but rather confirmation that our efforts and approaches are having meaningful impacts on our customers.\nFor all these reasons, as well as the vibrant economic expansion we expect to continue in the Southeast, we remain confident in our path forward.\nTurning to Slide 3, which presents our financial highlights for the quarter.\nTotal adjusted revenue of $489 million, adjusted expenses of $268 million, and a $25 million reversal of provision for credit losses resulted in adjusted net income of $179 million or $1.20 diluted earnings per share.\nWithout adjustments, net income was $178 million or $1.19 diluted earnings per share.\nPretax run rate benefits from Synovus Forward of $75 million have increased by $25 million from the first-quarter results.\nOur ongoing work on completed and future initiatives continues to reinforce our confidence in achieving an aggregate pre-tax run rate benefit of $100 million by year-end 2021 and $175 million by the end of 2022.\nTotal loans, excluding PPP loans, increased by $194 million in the second quarter.\nGrowth in the quarter was achieved in our core C&I portfolio, as well as third-party consumer lending, given the persistent high liquidity environment.\nDespite robust production levels, elevated prepayment activity remains a challenge in our commercial and consumer real estate portfolios.\nCore transaction deposits grew by $702 million or 2%, led by core noninterest-bearing deposits growth of $601 million or 4%.\nGiven the current loan-to-deposit ratio, we continue to strategically rebalance the deposit base by reducing higher-cost categories, including CDs and broker deposits.\nKey credit metrics remained stable with the NPA ratio decreasing by 4 basis points to 46 basis points, and the ACL coverage remains strong.\nA more favorable economic outlook and a 14% reduction in criticized and classified loans supported further allowance releases.\nThe ACL ratio, excluding PPP loans, declined 15 basis points to 1.54%.\nWe maintain a well-capitalized position with the CET1 ratio increasing to 9.8%, while completing nearly half of our $200 million share repurchase authorization in the quarter.\nWe also executed additional earning asset growth activities to monetize excess liquidity while maintaining capital above our operating target.\nAs shown on Slide 4, we concluded the quarter with earning assets of $51 billion.\nTotal loans decreased by $569 million, primarily due to PPP balance declines of $763 million.\nWhile gross production levels continue to improve, the liquidity environment continues to exert downward pressure on loan demand.\nAlthough our customers are utilizing less of their line commitments, we are consistently growing overall commitments through new client relationships and deeper existing relationships.\nThe annualized growth rate in total commitments over the past two years exceeds 3% compared to an annualized increase in funded loan balances of approximately 1%.\nA significant portion of that growth will translate into funded balances once C&I line utilization begins to normalize closer to the long-term average of 46 to 47%.\nBased on market intelligence and discussions with our clients, we believe increases in line utilization will occur later in the cycle as client liquidity diminishes.\nOur base assumption included in our loan growth guidance is that line utilization will remain near current levels through year-end.\nWhile commitment growth will support longer-term loan growth, our confidence in the near-term forecast is based on continued strong production, growth in the commercial loan pipeline, and our expectation that the elevated level of payoffs and paydowns will subside.\nAnother factor supporting our confidence in loan growth is more recent monthly data.\nIn June, total loans, excluding changes in PPP balances, grew by approximately $200 million.\nIn the second quarter, further declines in consumer mortgage and HELOC portfolios of $98 million and $74 million, respectively, continued to be impacted by accelerated prepayment activity and excess liquidity.\nCRE loan declines of $173 million this quarter largely resulted from accelerated payoffs as many owners are selling with the expectation that capital gains taxes will increase in 2022.\nC&I balances, excluding changes in PPP, increased $220 million with $469 million in commitment growth while C&I line utilization remained near historic lows.\nA normalization in C&I line utilization would lead to over $700 million in funded balances.\nWe funded about $150 million in second round P3 loans, minus unearned fees, which partly counterbalanced $927 million in forgiveness.\nP3 balances at quarter-end totaled $1.6 billion.\nAdditional information on P3 loan activity can be found in the appendix.\nGiven the current liquidity situation, we expanded the securities portfolio by roughly $616 million and the third-party consumer portfolio by about $273 million.\nThe risk profile of acquired assets was similar to those from the first quarter, focusing on mortgage-backed securities and secured third-party consumer loans.\nInvestment securities made up 17% of total assets at quarter-end and may increase further as we seek advantageous uses of liquidity in the latter half of 2021.\nAs illustrated on Slide 5, we maintained growth in core transaction deposits, which rose by $702 million or 2% compared to the previous quarter.\nThis was primarily due to core noninterest-bearing deposit growth of $601 million or 4%, which compensated for planned reductions in higher-cost deposits.\nWe successfully lowered our total deposit costs in the second quarter, decreasing from 22 basis points to 16 basis points, a reduction of 6 basis points.\nThis was achieved through optimizing deposit mix with a continued emphasis on strategically reducing high-cost time deposits, as well as lowering the expense associated with interest-bearing deposits.\nAlthough the rate of CD maturities will significantly decrease, there are still opportunities to enhance deposit mix and reduce rates on other interest-bearing deposits as we move through the second half of 2021.\nIn June, total deposit costs were 15 basis points, and we anticipate further reductions in total deposit costs this year.\nSlide 6 displays net interest income of $382 million, a $8 million increase from the previous quarter.\nNII grew as benefits from asset growth, reduced deposit costs, and day count outweighed the decrease in P3 fee income.\nThe net interest margin of 3.02%, a 2 basis point decline, was mainly affected by P3 forgiveness as P3 fee accretion decreased by $5 million from the previous quarter.\nOther factors are comparable to recent quarters, with asset repricing headwinds being offset by further reductions in liability costs.\nAs anticipated, slower prepayment activity in the latter part of the quarter helped improve the yield on the securities portfolio, supporting both margin and NII.\nBased on current mortgage trends, we expect a slight further improvement in that yield in the third quarter as the impact of a full quarter of more normalized prepay activity is realized.\nThe slowdown in prepayment activity resulted in a $3 million reduction of premium amortization in the second quarter, down from $20 million in the first quarter.\nRegarding asset sensitivity, we remain positively exposed to potential increases in interest rates.\nThis dynamic continues to be supported by the aforementioned shifts in our balance sheet, including funding mix, with the estimated exposure being split between both short-term and long-term rates.\nAs of June 30th, our loan portfolio is 54% variable and approximately 30% of those variable rate loans have floors at or above short-term index rates of 25 basis points.\nBased on current market conditions and our expectations for loan growth, we reiterate our expectation that quarterly net interest income, excluding P3 fee accretion, should increase in the second half of the year driven by loan growth, deployment of liquidity, a deceleration of prepayments and further deposit cost reductions.\nUsing the quarter-end forward curve and absent rate hikes, we expect a NIM of approximately 3%, excluding the impact of P3, with headwinds from the lapse of P3 fee accretion being offset by the continued deployment of excess liquidity and with notable upside coming from increases in either short-term or long-term interest rates.\nAs we've shared previously, we estimate NIM dilution of approximately 6 basis points per $1 billion of excess cash on deposit at the Federal Reserve.\nSlide 7 shows a total adjusted noninterest revenue of $106 million, down $6 million from the previous quarter.\nThe continued strength in fee revenue reflects diversified growth across our fee revenue sources, partially offsetting the ongoing normalization of the mortgage business from record-high production levels.\nCore banking fees were $41 million, up $3 million.\nIncreases were widespread, led by $1 million increases in account analysis fees that benefit from our treasury and payment solutions team and our recently in-sourced merchant business.\nNSF, or overdraft fees, which have received significant attention throughout the industry, remained unchanged at $6 million, accounting for less than 6% of noninterest revenue and 1.3% of total revenues.\nNet mortgage revenue declined $8 million in the second quarter to $14 million due to reductions in secondary production and gain on sale.\nThis remains above pre-pandemic levels, and we expect continued normalization in the second half of 2021.\nIncreases in fiduciary revenues of $3 million helped offset decreases in other areas, including capital markets income.\nAssets under management grew 3% in the quarter and 28% from the previous year.\nThe expansion of wealth management and other fiduciary services, particularly in South Florida, will continue to provide significant growth opportunities.\nTotal noninterest expense of $271 million is highlighted on Slide 8.\nAdjusted noninterest expense was $268 million up $2 million from the prior quarter and down $6 million from the prior year.\nAdjusted items include the impact of an earn-out liability, nonqualified deferred compensation and restructuring fees primarily related to branch closures.\nEmployment expense of $159 million was down $1 million from the prior quarter as seasonal decreases in payroll taxes was partially offset by an increase in pay days, as well as commissions and other variable compensation.\nExpenses of $42 million associated with occupancy, equipment and software increased $1 million from the previous quarter, largely due to an increase in the repairs and maintenance.\nAs Kevin will discuss later, we continue to evaluate and optimize our branch and non-branch real estate for additional efficiency opportunities.\nOther expenses of $67 million were up $3 million primarily due to the $4 million increase in third-party processing fees associated with the expenses from additional P3 forgiveness and third-party consumer loans.\nOur commitment to prudent expense management and profitable growth allows us to continue to invest in strategically compelling high-return growth vectors.\nWe have reduced our head count 6% year over year, approximately 85% of which was on the support side.\nThis reduction in headcount is a key priority in our expense management efforts, However, there are some offsetting costs as we promote team members who are taking on more responsibility and continue to hire customer-facing team members.\nOur expectations for expenses and benefits from Synovus Forward remain unchanged.\nSlide 9 highlights stable credit metrics, which remain near historical lows.\nWe continue to see improvement in the overall economic outlook, which is reflected in the reversal of provision for credit losses of $25 million and a 14% reduction in criticized and classified loans.\nSupport for the ratings improvements comes from client conversations and cash inflows.\nAs shown in the appendix, cash inflows from March to May are each up more than 10% compared to the same period from 2019, which we use as a pre-pandemic baseline.\nThe annualized net charge-off ratio for the quarter was 0.28%.\nWe expect net charge-offs to remain relatively stable in the second half of the 2021, assuming no material change in the economic outlook.\nDuring the second quarter, the NPA ratio declined 4 basis points to 46 basis points.\nCriticized and classified loans fell 14%, and we expect further reductions as we progress through the rest of the year.\nThe ACL ratio of 1.54%, excluding P3 loans, was down 15 basis points from the prior quarter and 27 basis points from the end of the year.\nWe continue to use a multi-scenario framework in our CECL modeling and a sign of 40% weighting to adverse scenarios, 55% weighting to the base scenario and 5% weighting to an upside scenario.\nAs noted on Slide 10, the CET1 ratio increased 1 basis point to 9.75% as a result of strong performance.\nThe building capital was deployed via risk-weighted asset growth, share repurchases and our common equity dividend.\nDuring the second quarter, we bought back $92 million worth of shares from the $200 million authorized for 2021, leading to a 1.3% decrease in average diluted outstanding shares.\nIn July, we've conducted about $15 million more in share repurchases.\nGiven the current economic conditions and outlook, we anticipate completing the entire authorized repurchase in the latter half of the year.\nWe'll strategically allocate capital from our balance sheet to shareholders while maintaining our CET1 ratio above the 9.5% target.\nWe're in a strong position to achieve our key strategic goals, with a focus on profitable growth, particularly through multi-solution relationships.\nAt 2020's start, we introduced our Synovus Forward plan to boost earnings potential through strategic actions aimed at improving efficiency and accelerating revenue growth.\nThe Synovus Forward initiatives align with our strategy to build a high-growth, low-risk, adaptable bank capable of increasing market share in our attractive southeastern markets.\nAs mentioned earlier, we've continued to increase our Synovus Forward pre-tax run rate benefits throughout Q2, now reaching about $75 million.\nSlide 11 illustrates that we've achieved these results through a mix of cost-cutting and revenue-boosting initiatives.\nBased on our progress and ongoing execution, we're confident we'll meet the 2021 and 2022 targets of $100 million and $175 million, respectively.\nOur expense reduction success has primarily come from three areas: lowering third-party expenditures, reducing headcount, and consolidating branch and corporate real estate.\nAbout $50 million of the $75 million pre-tax run rate benefit achieved by quarter-end is related to these specific efficiency measures.\nWe plan to increase savings in each of these areas and introduce new initiatives to achieve an additional $30-40 million in pre-tax benefits by the end of 2022.\nFuture efficiencies will be driven by further third-party savings, workforce optimization, reduced branch and non-branch square footage, process automation, and additional tax strategies.\nWe've also seen success on the revenue side of Synovus Forward, with $25 million in pre-tax run rate benefits.\nThe Treasury and Payment Solutions pricing-for-value initiative has resulted in annualized pre-tax run rate benefits of about $12 million in Q2.\nWe've implemented a broad-based price increase, supported by the competitive landscape, improved products and services, and a commitment to providing proactive, needs-based advice.\nWith a new pricing tool and the ongoing low-rate environment, we've reduced our cost of funds more than initially expected and now have a better capability to manage customer rate elasticity in a future higher-rate environment.\nOther areas of incremental revenue include in-sourcing our merchant business, expanding our merchant sponsorship business, and broadening solutions like trade finance and international payment and currency capabilities.\nFuture plans aim to achieve $60-70 million in pre-tax revenue benefits, primarily through analytics, new products and solutions, balance sheet management strategies, and ongoing talent and specialty team expansion.\nWe're making progress on our commercial analytics pilot, called the SMART tool, with encouraging feedback and utilization from bankers who are using actionable leads and insights to generate new sales and expand existing client relationships.\nWe plan to pilot in Q3 and roll out company-wide in Q4.\nWe've also started developing our retail analytics program to increase our share of wallet among consumer and wealth customers while reducing attrition.\nWe're growing our premium finance and specialty lending businesses, adding strong teams in attractive specialized verticals, and launching targeted, innovative products and capabilities for new revenue growth.\nSynovus Forward represents a continuous improvement mindset, not just a set of initiatives.\nOur team members are focused on innovation and finding new ways to increase efficiency and drive revenue.\nRegarding technology, we believe our competitive advantage will come from combining our high-touch approach with high-tech investments and partnerships.\nWe're enhancing both consumer and commercial client digital experiences, partnering with suitable fintechs to develop and deliver new products and solutions, and planning to transition to a modern core over time in a controlled manner.\nWe'll continue to focus on increasing online origination capabilities and exploring new technological opportunities, especially in payment and banking-as-a-service areas.\nMoving to Slide 12, we've updated our 2021 outlook with a few key changes.\nFor loan growth, we still expect to be within our 2-4% guidance, excluding P3 loans and third-party consumer loans, but likely at the lower end due to unexpected elevated prepayment activity.\nThis assumes line utilization remains low and prepayment activity normalizes.\nThird-party consumer loans, not included in this guidance, represent $1.5 billion in period-end balances, up $776 million in 2021.\nWe plan to continue this strategy while excess liquidity persists and future purchase returns remain attractive.\nWe're increasing our expectations for total adjusted revenue and expense, considering them together as some revenue-generating areas have associated expenses.\nWe remain committed to achieving positive operating leverage, a top priority for 2021.\nOur updated guidance doesn't assume significant interest rate changes, though we're more asset-sensitive now, meaning any rate increase would significantly boost net interest income.\nOur capital management target now includes a CET1 ratio of 9.5% or higher.\nStrong performance and a stable economic outlook may result in a CET1 ratio above 9.5%, even after completing the entire $200 million share repurchase authorization this year.\nAdditional tax strategies are expected to result in an effective tax rate of 22-24%.\nThese actions position us for success in the second half of 2021 and long-term, strengthening our currency and providing opportunities for strategic growth, both organic and inorganic.\nWe're excited about the second half of 2021 and our future of work operating environment rollout this quarter.\nOur balance sheet is well-positioned for growth with strong capital and liquidity, our team members are delivering passionately, and our pipelines show clients are ready to grow their business with Synovus as their partner.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:My name is Christine Marchuska and I serve as the vice president of investor relations at Diebold Nixdorf.\nInvestors are advised to read the shareholder letter for more details on the company's progress.\nWe've made a recent announcement about an upcoming change in our CEO position.\nShortly, we'll hear from our current president and CEO, Gerrard Schmid, as well as Octavio Marquez, who will be taking over as Diebold Nixdorf's next chief executive.\nIn his address, Gerard will discuss the current business climate, our achievements in 2021, and introduce Octavio.\nOur chief financial officer, Jeff Rutherford, will then present the company's financial results, including quarterly and annual highlights, along with our projections for 2022.\nWe'll then open the floor for questions.\nFor more information on these topics, please refer to the company's regular and yearly SEC filings.\nPlease note that future events may cause this information to become outdated.\nI'll now turn the call over to Gerrard.\nI'm glad to be speaking with you today.\nWe encountered exceptional difficulties in 2021 due to the ongoing pandemic.\nI'm happy to announce that we achieved our goals in the fourth quarter.\nThe final months of 2021 required intense and detailed effort.\nWe scrutinized every potential area for improvement.\nThis ranged from supply chain and logistics to financial transactions.\nWhat outsiders deemed impossible, we proved feasible.\nWe've once again demonstrated our resilience and strength.\nAlthough supply chain and logistical issues were major concerns in 2021, it's worth noting that we delivered more ATMs, self-checkout units, and point-of-sale devices than in 2020.\nThis showcases the durability of our business model.\nWhile the pandemic has disrupted our lives and forced us to reconsider the future, we've repeatedly shown our ability to create a flexible company that challenges norms and excels in execution.\nThe current situation has highlighted the rapidly changing consumer demands and the necessity for self-service options wherever possible.\nWe are ideally positioned to provide these solutions and growth opportunities for our clients, whether they're in banking, grocery, or retail.\nWe help them create more digital, flexible, and effective customer experiences.\nIn the retail sector, evolving consumer behavior and changing labor dynamics have increased demand for self-service and automation, with growth driven by customer interest in self-service solutions.\nIn 2021, we experienced above-market growth in Europe for self-service hardware, services, and software.\nWe also made progress in other markets, such as the United States and Australia.\nIn banking, we continue to see strong demand for cash recyclers as banks reconsider their branch layouts and move towards automation and efficiency in their real estate use.\nOur engagement with major U.S. customers has grown.\nIn 2021, our order levels in the Americas were 16% higher than in 2020 and 17% higher than pre-pandemic levels in 2019.\nLet me now highlight our world-class services organization.\nBoth we and our customers consider this one of our greatest assets, often playing a crucial role in DN winning new business and expanding existing relationships.\nIt also opens up opportunities in new areas like electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, which I'll discuss later.\nIn 2021, we continued improving our service delivery by reaching a milestone with connected devices for our all-connected data engine.\nWe now have about 150,000 banking self-service devices connected to the solution, representing approximately 122% year-over-year growth in connected devices.\nOur technology uses real-time Internet-of-Things capabilities to support our predictive maintenance offering, significantly reducing customer downtime.\nSimilarly, in retail, we continue to provide value and services to our customers.\nI must mention an ongoing success story with one of our key customers, a major UK-based retailer.\nThis client depends on us for flawless execution and excellent service across over 25,000 checkout lanes.\nWe successfully maintained 100% uptime for point-of-sale and self-checkout systems during the two busiest shopping days of the year.\nOur efforts helped the retailer enhance customer satisfaction by reducing queues and wait times, resulting in increased sales compared to the previous year.\nThis marks the tenth year in a row that we've met this performance target.\nIt's a clear demonstration of our service capabilities.\nWe replicated this successful program with another major European retailer, proving it's a reproducible model for the retail industry.\nWe believe that meeting or surpassing our customers' service expectations creates a solid foundation for introducing additional technology.\nBoth retailers placed more orders for self-checkout systems with us in December.\nWe were pleased to see retailers' continued trust in our ability to provide high-quality services to them and their customers.\nTo complement our strong service offerings, I'd like to briefly discuss our progress in the fourth quarter regarding electric vehicle charging stations, particularly in Europe.\nThe EV charging industry is currently fragmented, with various players including startups, medium-sized businesses, and large electronics corporations competing in the market.\nMoreover, there are multiple roles along the value chain that lack consistency.\nThis is a substantial and expanding market with considerable demand.\nBy 2026, the number of public EV charging stations in Europe and the United States will surpass the number of ATM machines.\nWith more EV drivers, especially in Europe where home charging is less common, and the shift towards electric vehicles in rental, fleet, and public transportation, there will be an increased need for public charging stations.\nThere are currently over 40 significant chargepoint operators globally, and we are in discussions with many of them.\nOur global service capabilities, including our technicians, expertise in global spare parts logistics management, and multilingual help desks, have appealed to several market participants who lack these skills as they aim to expand their businesses.\nAs of Q4 2021, we have contracts for several thousand charging stations in Europe and the US, with a near-term pipeline three times the size of our current base.\nThe team aims to service over 30,000 charging stations by the end of 2022.\nA notable recent success I'd like to highlight is our partnership with Compleo, a leading full-service provider of charging technology in Europe.\nThis partnership agreement will provide a comprehensive range of managed services for initially over 1,000 of Compleo's DC fast charging stations in public locations across Germany, with potential for expansion.\nFinally, as you're aware, diversity and sustainability have been key priorities for our company.\nI'm proud to report that in 2021, women made up over 60% of our senior hires at the vice president level and above.\nWe also made significant environmental progress, reducing our scope one and two carbon emissions by 6%.\nOur shareholder letter provides more details on our achievements in this area.\nI want to express my gratitude to our teams for their hard work and dedication in this crucial area.\nOver the last four years, we have undertaken a comprehensive restructuring and transformation initiative.\nThe company has made substantial strategic and operational advancements.\nWe have increased profitability, gained market share through our DN series and self-checkout solutions, and entered new growth markets.\nI'm proud that we've achieved these goals while also delivering four consecutive years of improvements in customer satisfaction.\nWe begin 2022 with a robust backlog, an experienced executive team, and operations that have proven resilient despite the pandemic and challenging macroeconomic conditions.\nAs we look forward to moving beyond the pandemic and building momentum in growth areas like EV charging services and payments, while continuing to optimize our core businesses in retail and banking, it's the appropriate time for Octavio to take on the CEO role.\nMany of our customers and employees are already familiar with Octavio.\nHe has been leading our global banking segment, which accounts for approximately 70% of the company's revenues, and he is deeply committed to our customers and our business.\nHe has a thorough understanding of our operations and is the ideal person to guide Diebold Nixdorf into the future.\nI will remain on Diebold Nixdorf's board of directors until my term concludes at the 2022 shareholder meeting.\nI will also work closely with Octavio and the rest of the leadership team as an advisor for several months to ensure a smooth transition.\nIt has been an immense honor to serve as CEO of Diebold Nixdorf.\nI believe we have significantly improved the operational and strategic direction of the organization.\nI'll now turn the call over to Octavio for a brief introduction.\nIt has been a pleasure to be part of our journey under your guidance.\nI am genuinely excited to lead Diebold Nixdorf moving forward.\nSince 2014, I've been employed at Diebold Nixdorf, where I've had the opportunity to contribute to our transformation into a leading provider of self-service banking and retail technology.\nI've had the privilege of collaborating closely with our customers worldwide.\nInitially, I worked with our Latin American clients, then managed our American banking customer segment, and for the last year and a half, I've been working closely with our global banking customers.\nI've witnessed firsthand the crucial role we play for our customers and how we can continue to innovate to provide them with a wider range of solutions.\nOur passionate and talented workforce has been crucial to the company's progress.\nI'm also excited about our growth prospects, such as our strong self-checkout growth in retail, our managed services initiatives in banking and retail, as well as our newer but equally promising opportunities in payments and EV charging services.\nWe've been diligent in improving our company's efficiency, and I'm eager to further enhance our execution.\nThe team and I value your contributions and wish you success in your future endeavors.\nIn the coming year, we anticipate overcoming the global macro challenges we've faced by utilizing our mitigation strategies and delivering results for our customers and shareholders.\nDiebold Nixdorf is well-positioned to capitalize on the strong demand for our products and solutions as customers continue to seek our market-leading devices, services, and software.\nThe market is shifting towards a self-service automation focus driven by consumer preferences.\nPlease refer to our shareholder letter for the complete financial details from the quarter and full year.\nI will now highlight some of our key performance metrics.\nIn Q4, total revenue was $1.6 billion, a 4% decrease from Q4 2020 as reported, and a 1% decrease excluding the $22 million foreign currency impact and $13 million impact from divested businesses.\nAdjusted for foreign currency and divestitures, product revenue increased by about 4%, services revenue decreased by approximately 6%, and software revenue increased by roughly 3% compared to Q4 2020.\nDuring the quarter, we experienced delayed revenue due to extended outbound transport times and inbound component delays.\nThis mainly affected the US, Latin America, and certain APAC countries, increasing our revenue deferral to 2022 by $30 million to a total of $150 million.\nSequentially, total revenue increased by approximately 11%.\nFull-year 2021 revenue was $3.905 billion, driven by demand for our DN series ATMs, particularly our cash recyclers, self-checkout devices, and tax services, offset by about $150 million of deferred revenue due to supply chain and logistics challenges.\nYear-over-year, 2021 revenue was approximately flat compared to 2020 as reported, and also flat excluding a $74 million foreign currency benefit and $60 million impact from divested businesses.\nAdjusted for foreign currency and divestitures, product revenue increased by about 4%, services revenue decreased by approximately 4%, and software revenue increased by roughly 2% for the full year 2021.\nIn Q4, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $126 million and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.9%.\nQ4 adjusted EBITDA results reflect a reduction in operating expenses fully offset by the decline in gross profit due to revenue deferral and non-billable inflation of approximately $30 million.\nFull-year 2021 adjusted EBITDA was $450 million, at the lower end of our guidance range primarily due to supply chain challenges, which increased revenue deferral to approximately $150 million, with non-billable inflation for the year at about $15 million.\nLast week, we delivered free cash flow of $407 million for Q4, resulting in $101 million for fiscal year 2021.\nThis record Q4 free cash flow was achieved through tremendous efforts by our sales, operations, and finance teams.\nQ4 marks the conclusion of the DN Now transformation and restructuring program.\nGoing forward, we will not present non-GAAP adjustments to earnings except for the amortization of intangible purchase accounting assets and, when appropriate, non-recurring items such as M&A activities.\nOur revenue guidance for full-year 2022 is $4 billion to $4.2 billion, reflecting approximately $150 million in revenue deferral from 2021 to 2022, organic growth and pricing growth, partially offset by model divestitures and terminated low-profit service contracts, and potential ongoing logistics and supply chain disruptions.\nWhile we're encouraged by the demand for our solutions, our guidance range also reflects caution regarding the timing of global logistics and supply chain environments.\nOur adjusted EBITDA outlook is $440 to $460 million, considering gross profit growth due to increased revenue and a modest gross margin expansion of about 100 basis points, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA will likely be weighted toward the second half of 2022 as our pricing and incremental cost management actions begin to take effect, and volume builds throughout the year.\nOur free cash flow outlook is $130 to $150 million, reflecting our EBITDA outlook, normalization of working capital, and conclusion of the DN Now transformation and restructuring program and related payments.\nIt's worth noting that our free cash flow guidance doesn't include any benefit from a potential debt refinancing.\nFor Q1, we expect gross margin to be comparable to Q4 2021 due to continued non-billable inflation.\nAdditionally, we'll see an increase in Q1 operating expenses due to wage inflation and growth in infrastructure investments.\nAs such, we expect Q1 to be the low point for 2022 operating profit and margin.\nThat concludes my review of the results.\nWith the transition to a new CEO just announced, I'll hand it over to the operator.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These declarations may be revised based on emerging information or future occurrences.\nAssured Guaranty achieved exceptional results in 2021 through a combination of insurance production, loss mitigation, and capital management strategies.\nThe year was marked by numerous significant achievements, including earning $470 million in adjusted operating income, an 84% increase from 2020.\nWe achieved a twofold increase in adjusted operating income per share, reaching $6.32 per share.\nAll three of our shareholder value indicators reached unprecedented levels.\nThroughout the year, shareholder's equity per share increased by 9% to $93.19.\nAdjusted operating shareholder's equity per share grew by 13% to $88.73, while adjusted book value per share rose by 14% to $130.67.\nWe bought back $10.5 million common shares, approximately 14% of our outstanding shares as of December 31, 2020, at an average price of $47.19.\nThese repurchases amounted to $496 million, and when combined with $66 million in dividends, we returned a total of $562 million to shareholders.\nWe generated $361 million in PVP during 2021 through robust new business production across our financial guarantee markets: U.S. public finance, international infrastructure finance, and global structured finance.\nDirect PVP surpassed $350 million for the third consecutive year, compared to an average annual direct PVP of $210 million from 2012 to 2018, making the past three years our most successful in over a decade for direct new business production.\nWe led the U.S. public finance bond insurance industry to its highest market penetration in twelve years, with more than a 60% share of new issue insured par sold.\nTaking advantage of exceptionally low interest rates, our U.S. holding company issued a total of $900 million in 3.15% 10-year and 3.60% 30-year senior debt to refinance $600 million of debt with higher coupons ranging from 5% to almost 7%.\nAs a result, annual debt service savings will amount to $5.2 million through the next maturity date.\nOur financial guarantee production was well-distributed across all our markets.\nU.S. public finance PVP of $235 million included its second-best direct production in at least a decade, surpassed only by the previous year's result, while $79 million of international infrastructure PVP marks the fourth year out of the last five that we have exceeded $75 million of direct PVP in that sector.\nGlobal structured finance PVP at $47 million was the second-best in direct production since 2012.\nOur markets and economic environment presented both opportunities and challenges during 2021, with U.S. municipal bond issuance reaching a record par amount of $457 billion.\nThis partly reflected investors' increased demand for tax-exempt paper in anticipation of higher tax rates and continued limitations on state and local tax deductions at the federal level.\nAdditionally, issuers were eager to take advantage of extremely low municipal interest rates to refinance bonds issued in the past at higher rates, with the option to execute tax-exempt advance refunding still unavailable.\nMany issuers also turned to the taxable market to replace higher coupon tax-exempt debt.\nTotal insured market volume increased to 8.2% of par issued, the highest annual rate over the past 12 years, up from 7.6% during 2020 and 5.9% during 2019.\nWe believe this increased penetration in 2021 indicates that the risk of unpredictable developments, which was highlighted by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, has made a lasting impression on investors.\nWe have also demonstrated that Assured Guaranty possesses the underwriting and risk management skills to build an insured portfolio that experienced minimal claims from the economic disruption caused by the pandemic, most of which have already been reimbursed.\nThe $37.5 billion of insured par in 2021 represented a 10% annual increase, following a 43% increase the prior year, resulting in a 57% growth of the insured market in just two years since 2019.\nAssured Guaranty's production was a driving force behind this growth, as we captured over 58% of new issue insured par sold in 2020, and more than 60% in 2021.\nOur highest annual market share since 2013, our $23 billion of insured new issue volume in 2021 was almost $3 billion more par than we insured in 2020, and was generated by more than 8,000 individual transactions.\nAn important trend in recent years has been the use of our guarantee to help launch some of the municipal bond market's largest transactions, indicating growing institutional demand for the security, relative price stability, and significant market liquidity our guarantee can provide.\nWe guaranteed $100 million or more on each of 48 large issues launched in 2021, up from 39 transactions in 2020 and 22 in 2019.\nNotably, we continue to add value on credits with underlying ratings in the double-A category from one or both of S&P and Moody's, insuring 109 such AA transactions totaling more than $3.5 billion of insured par.\nU.S. public finance constitutes the largest part of our uniquely diversified financial guarantee strategy.\nOur three-pronged strategy also targets insurable transactions in both infrastructure finance outside the United States and structured finance throughout the world.\nThis approach helps us during periods when one market or another shows temporary weaknesses, and it drives great results in years like 2021, when we are thriving in all three of our markets.\nFurther illustrating the diversity of our business, in 2021, we guaranteed financing of Spanish solar power facilities and UK higher education and healthcare projects.\nAdditionally, we worked with a UK water company to extend a debt service reserve guarantee, which is a unique product we developed as an alternative to bank liquidity facilities.\nWe also provided a number of secondary market guarantees.\nOur European business was historically based in the UK, which previously allowed us to operate throughout the European Union.\nWe have long been active and continue to believe that plentiful and diverse opportunities exist.\nOur Paris subsidiary, which we opened in 2020 to serve continental Europe more effectively, especially now that the UK has left the European Union, further grew its business around originations in 2021.\nAn important part of our global structured finance business is to provide institutions like banks and insurance companies with tools to optimize the capital utilization of their asset portfolios.\nDuring the year, we guaranteed large insurance securitizations and significantly increased our CLO activity.\nOur guarantees of CLOs attract new investors who might otherwise be discouraged by the higher capital requirements on uninsured CLOs.\nWe are seeing more opportunities to help investors reduce the capital consumption of both existing structured finance exposures and new investments.\nThe new business we wrote across all of our markets in 2021 enabled us to increase the year-end net par amount of our insured portfolio for the first time in many years.\nWe believe the trend going forward will be to continue increasing the par amount of our insured portfolio and increase our deferred premium revenue, which will further stabilize and grow our future earnings.\nWe have continued to reduce the risk in our insured portfolio and believe we can continue to do so as we continue to write new investment-grade business.\nThe portion of our insured portfolio rated below investment grade dropped to just over 3% by the end of 2021.\nNearly half of our below investment grade net par exposure relates to Puerto Rico, but we anticipate this figure will fall below 2.5% and continue decreasing as more Puerto Rico settlements are implemented, following court-approved resolutions for certain credits scheduled for mid-March this year.\nSignificant progress was made in 2021 regarding Puerto Rico's debt restructuring after years of complications, with creditors and the Commonwealth agreeing to support the Oversight Board's final restructuring plan for the central government, which received court approval in January 2022.\nThe Commonwealth government is expected to exit bankruptcy in mid-March.\nThe court also set the stage for favorable consideration of additional agreements supporting other Puerto Rico restructurings, such as those for highways and transportation authorities.\nThese developments indicate Puerto Rico's long-standing debt issues are being resolved satisfactorily, positioning the island for fiscal stability in the coming years, according to the Oversight Board's latest fiscal plan.\nWe achieved notable success in both our financial guarantee business and made substantial progress towards our asset management business objectives in 2021.\nAs one of the top 25 collateralized loan obligation (CLO) managers by assets under management, our overall investment performance was robust, allowing us to capitalize on the record-breaking CLO market.\nWe introduced six new CLOs in 2021, representing $2.5 billion in assets under management, more than doubling our 2020 issuance, and converted non-fee earning AUM to fee-earning AUM by divesting nearly all CLO equity held by Assured IM legacy funds where we had been rebating management fees.\nThese efforts resulted in an increase of CLO management fees from $23 million in 2020 to $48 million in 2021.\nWe also reset and refinanced 10 CLOs in the United States and Europe.\nIn the asset-backed sector, we closed a continuation fund for an auto finance investment.\nThe healthcare portfolio managed by Assured Healthcare Partners continued to expand as capital was deployed.\nWe believe Assured Guaranty's success in 2021 largely reflected growing market recognition of our financial strength, the security we provide to investors, and the benefits we deliver to bond issuers and other clients, underpinned by our careful underwriting, disciplined risk management, and persistent loss mitigation efforts.\nThe proven resilience of our financial guarantee business model and our strategic approach to capital management have enhanced our ability to protect policyholders and create shareholder value.\nWe believe this increased appreciation of our guarantee's value could drive higher demand as interest rates rise.\nWe anticipate market conditions in 2022 and beyond will differ significantly from those in 2021, as the Federal Reserve works to control inflation, the impact of COVID-19 diminishes, geopolitical events continue to disrupt markets, and municipal governments prepare for the end of extraordinary federal support.\nRising interest rates, widening credit spreads, and increased volatility tend to boost demand for financial guarantees.\nWe believe Assured Guaranty is better positioned for long-term success than ever before in our history.\nOur financial strength is at an all-time high.\nMost of the credit challenges in our legacy insured portfolio have been resolved.\nOur markets are extensive, our opportunities diverse, our human capital exceptional, and our business model has been proven through multiple economic cycles.\nWe are committed to meeting the high expectations of our policyholders, clients, and shareholders.\nOur fourth quarter 2021 adjusted operating income was $273 million, or $3.88 per share, a substantial increase from the fourth quarter 2020 adjusted operating income of $56 million, or $0.69 per share.\nThe primary factor driving the increase in fourth quarter 2021 total adjusted operating income was the insurance segment, where adjusted operating income grew by 134% from $109 million in Q4 2020 to $277 million in Q4 2021.\nThis improvement largely resulted from our loss mitigation strategies, particularly for our Puerto Rico exposure.\nAfter years of negotiations and loss mitigation efforts, we are close to resolving $1.4 billion in gross par associated with our Puerto Rico GO, PBA, CCDA, and PREPA exposures.\nThe increased certainty of the settlement, Puerto Rico's improved economic outlook, and the higher value of our actual and expected recoveries under the settlement agreements were the main drivers of the $186 million economic benefit in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nIn Q4 2021, we sold a portion of our salvage and subrogation recoverables related to certain matured Puerto Rico GO and PREPA exposures, generating proceeds of $383 million and realizing some of our expected recoveries early.\nWe continued to sell portions of our GO, PBA, and PREPA salvage and subrogation recoverables in 2022, resulting in additional proceeds of $133 million.\nThe prices at which we realized these recoveries, along with observed market pricing for similar instruments and the forward interest rate environment, are reflected in our updated assumptions regarding the value of the remaining recovery bonds and contingent value instruments we expect to receive in various Puerto Rico settlements.\nOther components of the insurance segment also performed well in Q4 2021.\nTotal income from investments, comprising net investment income on the fixed maturity portfolio and equity in earnings on short-term funds and other alternative investments, increased to $111 million from $94 million in Q4 2020.\nInvestments in Assured IM funds and alternative investments collectively generated $44 million in equity in earnings of investees in Q4 2021, compared to $24 million in Q4 2020, with the increase mainly due to a significant fair value gain on a specific private equity fund investment.\nEquity in earnings of investees, which reflects mark-to-market movements in Assured IM funds and other alternative investments, is more volatile than net investment income from the fixed maturity portfolio and will fluctuate between periods.\nOur fixed maturity and short-term investments, which constitute the largest portion of our portfolio, generated net investment income of $67 million in Q4 2021, compared to $70 million in Q4 2020.\nAs we reallocate fixed maturity assets to alternative investments, net investment income from fixed maturities may decline, but we are targeting enhanced long-term returns of over 10% on the alternative investment portfolio, exceeding our projected returns on the fixed maturity portfolio.\nRegarding premiums, scheduled net earned premiums slightly decreased to $91 million in Q4 2021 from $94 million in Q4 2020.\nPremium earnings from refundings and terminations were $20 million in Q4 2021, compared to $65 million in Q4 2020 when two large transactions were refunded.\nThe asset management segment reported an adjusted operating loss of $3 million in Q4 2021, an improvement from the $20 million loss in Q4 2020.\nThe asset management segment's improved results are mainly due to higher management fees from strategies introduced after acquiring Blue Mountain in 2019, and the absence of a one-time $13 million impairment charge on a lease right of use asset in 2020\nAsset management fees at the segment level reached $21 million in Q4 2021, up from $20 million in Q4 2020\nIncreased fees from healthcare opportunity funds and CLOs outweighed the decrease in fees from wind down funds as investors continued to receive distributions\nWind down funds' AUM decreased to $582 million by December 31, 2021, down from $1.6 million a year earlier\nThe effective tax rate in Q4 2021 was 15.1%, compared to 12.7% in Q4 2020, which included the release of a reserve for uncertain tax positions\nThe adjusted operating income's overall effective tax rate varies between periods based on the proportion of income in different tax jurisdictions\nThe fourth quarter concluded a year of successful implementation of our strategic plans\nOur achievements are reflected in the 2021 full year adjusted operating income of $470 million, which includes a $175 million pre-tax loss on debt extinguishment, or $138 million after tax\nDespite the debt extinguishment charge, the full year 2021 adjusted operating income showed an 84% increase compared to the 2020 figure of $256 million\nThe insurance segment was the main contributor to this increase, with $722 million in adjusted operating income for 2021, up from $421 million in 2020\nU.S. public finance saw improvements due to increased recovery assumptions for Puerto Rico exposures and U.S. RMBS benefits, mainly resulting from home price appreciation\nEconomic loss development, excluding deferred premium revenue effects, resulted in a $287 million benefit in 2021\nThe entire portfolio's loss expense in 2020 was $204 million, primarily related to Puerto Rico\nFor the full year, total income from the investment portfolio reached $424 million in 2021, compared to $371 million in 2020\nThe investment returns on the portion of the portfolio invested in Assured IM funds showcase a crucial aspect of the asset management segment's benefits, not just as a fee-earning business but also as an investment advisor for our insurance segments\nAssured IM funds in which insurance subsidiaries invested generated $80 million in gains for 2021, up from $42 million in 2020\nThe gains were spread across all strategies, particularly healthcare, CLOs, and asset-based, resulting in a year-to-date return of 20.8%\nThird-party alternative investments also produced gains of $64 million in 2021, an increase from $19 million in 2020\nThese gains more than compensated for the reduced net investment income on the available-for-sale fixed maturity portfolio, which decreased to $280 million in 2021 from $310 million in 2020\nThe year-over-year difference was primarily due to lower average balances, fixed maturity portfolio reinvestment yields, and income from loss mitigation securities\nTotal net earned premiums and credit-driven revenues amounted to $438 million in 2021, down from $540 million in 2020, including premium accelerations of $66 million and $130 million, respectively\nIn the asset management segment, we made significant progress in 2021\nWe attracted new third-party capital for our CLO, healthcare, and asset-based strategies\nWe increased fee-earning CLO AUM by issuing $2.8 billion in CLOs and selling CLO equity from legacy funds, while continuing to liquidate assets in wind-down funds\nThe asset management segment's operating loss improved from $50 million in 2020 to $90 million in 2021, mainly due to an increase in management fees from $59 million in 2020 to $76 million in 2021\nHigher fees from CLOs and opportunity funds more than offset the decline in fees from wind-down funds\nThe increase in opportunity fund fees was primarily due to new healthcare funds launched in late 2020, which raised additional third-party capital in late 2021\nThe corporate division reported an adjusted operating loss of $253 million in 2021, including a $175 million loss on debt extinguishment, or $138 million after tax\nThis resulted from $600 million in debt redemptions mentioned earlier, with the charge representing an acceleration of expenses that would have occurred over time\nIn the previous year, the corporate division's adjusted operating loss was $111 million\nThe debt redemptions were financed using proceeds from $900 million in new 10-year and 30-year debt issuances, reducing the average coupon on redeemed debt from 5.89% to 3.35% and decreasing our 2024 debt refinancing needs by $170 million\nThe debt refinancing also generated annual debt service savings of $5.2 million until the next maturity date and provided flexibility for continued share repurchases\nWe accomplished this without significantly affecting our debt leverage or interest coverage ratios, using the additional $300 million from debt issuances primarily for share repurchases\nIn Q4 2021, we repurchased 3.7 million shares for $192 million at an average price of $51.47 per share\nThis brings the full year 2021 purchases to 10.5 million shares, or $496 million, representing 14% of total shares outstanding at the beginning of the year\nThe ongoing success of this program helped drive our per-share book value metrics to record highs as of December 31, 2021\nAfter the quarter ended, we repurchased an additional 1.7 million shares for $91 million\nSince starting our repurchase program in January 2013, we have returned $4.2 billion to shareholders, resulting in a 69% reduction in total shares outstanding\nThe cumulative effect of these purchases benefited adjusted operating shareholder's equity per share by over $37 and adjusted book value per share by $65, driving these metrics to new record highs\nRegarding liquidity, the holding companies currently have cash and investments of approximately $274 million, with $124 million in AGL\nThese funds are available for liquidity needs or to pursue strategic initiatives to enhance our business or repurchase shares for capital management\nThis week, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $350 million of common shares\nUnder this and previous authorizations, the company is now authorized to purchase $364 million of its common shares\nAdditionally, we declared a dividend of $0.27 per share, a 13.6% increase from the previous dividend of $0.22 per share\nLooking ahead to 2022 and beyond, we are optimistic that our largest single BIG exposure, Puerto Rico, will be substantially resolved by year-end\nWe expect the interest rate environment to be more conducive to new insurance business production and that the asset management segment and alternative asset strategies will continue to contribute to the company's progress toward its long-term strategic goals\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:My name is Jeff Kotkin and I serve as the Vice President of Investor Relations at Eversource Energy.\nToday's speakers include our new President and CEO, Joe Nolan, and our Executive VP and CFO, Phil Lembo.\nJoining us are John Moreira, our Treasurer and Senior VP for Finance and Regulatory, as well as Jay Buth, our VP and Controller.\nWe sincerely hope that everyone on the call is in good health and that your loved ones are safe and well.\nI'm excited about the opportunity to meet many more of you in the coming years and share my positive outlook and enthusiasm for Eversource's future and its strong investment potential.\nI'm thankful to the Eversource Board of Trustees and Jim for entrusting me with the leadership of this exceptionally dedicated and high-performing organization.\nBy approving these changes at the executive level, the Eversource Board is demonstrating its faith in our long-term strategy, which focuses on our core regulated business and includes an exciting investment in offshore wind.\nIn today's world, customer service, safety, and reliability are more crucial than ever before.\nWe must always remember that our 4.3 million customers are the reason we exist; they are our highest priority.\nOur customers foot the bills and deserve the dependable and secure utility service that we are obligated to provide.\nIn the coming decades, we will invest tens of billions of dollars in our energy and water delivery systems, which will play a vital role in preparing New England for a clean energy future, and we anticipate being a key driver of that clean energy transition.\nHowever, I must first address our company's relationship with Connecticut.\nWe employ thousands of people in Connecticut who work tirelessly each day to provide our 1.7 million natural gas, water, and electric customers with the most reliable and responsive service possible.\nDuring emergencies, which we've experienced far too frequently over the past year due to unprecedented storm levels, our employees work up to 16-hour shifts for as long as necessary to ensure that our customers' service is restored quickly and safely, even during a pandemic.\nTherefore, it was deeply upsetting for me to read certain parts of the Tropical Storm Isaias decision released on April 28th.\nIt failed to acknowledge the dedication of our hardworking employees in the company I've been chosen to lead.\nOur customers, PURA, and our company all share the same goal: excellent service every day of the year.\nAnd when severe weather strikes, we aim to restore power as safely and quickly as possible.\nThe women and men of Eversource work diligently every day to meet these expectations.\nThe PURA report on storm response clearly identified areas for improvement.\nWe recognize that we need to enhance not only our response plan but also our relationship with PURA.\nThis was evident from the April 28 decision and subsequent notice of violation.\nI can assure you that we have received this message loud and clear and are already taking steps to improve on both fronts.\nShifting our focus to our clean energy initiatives.\nYou may be aware of the climate legislation that Massachusetts Governor Baker signed into law earlier this spring.\nAmong its many provisions, the law will permit each of the state's utilities to construct up to 280 megawatts of solar generation, allowing NSTAR Electric to increase its solar generation in rate base from 70 megawatts to 350 megawatts.\nAs Phil mentioned during our year-end earnings call, we have allocated approximately $500 million for this initiative from 2022 to 2025.\nAnother aspect that directly affects us is the 2,400 megawatt expansion of Massachusetts' offshore wind authorization, increasing it from 3,200 megawatts to 5,600 megawatts.\nThis expansion will help maintain Massachusetts' position at the forefront of offshore wind development in the United States.\nAs shown on Slide 2, there are now over 10,000 megawatts of unawarded offshore wind authorizations in Southern New England and New York, with Massachusetts set to award up to 1,600 megawatts later this year.\nIn fact, Massachusetts issued its RFP just last Friday.\nOur offshore wind partnership with Orsted is very important to me.\nHaving initiated this relationship and worked closely with our partner in recent years, it is a crucial element of our clean energy growth strategy.\nWe have already seen several positive offshore wind developments this year.\nAs shown on Slide 3, in early January, the Bureau of Ocean Management (BOEM) released its draft environmental impact statement on the South Fork project.\nComments were received by late February, and we anticipate seeing the final EIS this summer.\nThe Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is expected to decide on our final federal permits for the project in January 2022.\nIf the January timeline is met, we anticipate starting construction in early 2022 and finishing the project by the end of 2023.\nFurthermore, the New York Public Service Commission granted the required state siting permit for the project in late March, while East Hampton's local authorities approved the necessary real estate rights.\nNow let's discuss Revolution Wind.\nBOEM recently published a timeline for evaluating the 704 megawatt project.\nThe schedule indicates that a final environmental impact statement will be released in March 2023, with a final decision on the construction and operating plan expected by late July 2023.\nThe publication of this timeline marks a significant advancement for the project.\nRevolution Wind and South Fork are among only three projects in the Northeast to reach this important stage.\nIn the coming months, we and Orsted will examine the BOEM and Rhode Island permitting processes to estimate a construction timeline for Revolution Wind.\nWe anticipate receiving BOEM's review schedule for our 924 megawatt Sunrise Wind project later this year.\nWe continue to make considerable headway in preparing for the start of construction.\nRecently, we've announced agreements with two crucial ports that will serve as construction staging areas.\nNew London, Connecticut will be the hub for turbine assembly, while Providence, Rhode Island will focus on foundation construction.\nThese communities will experience substantial economic benefits from their involvement in our construction activities, including hundreds of direct jobs.\nWe are also very optimistic about the positive signals coming from Washington.\nPresident Biden has emphasized his backing for offshore wind development along the Atlantic coast and has enlisted several cabinet members to support this initiative.\nThe aim is to have approximately 30,000 megawatts of offshore wind turbines operational in the U.S. by 2030.\nWe expect to contribute significantly to this output through our collaboration with Orsted.\nMore than 1,750 megawatts are already under contract to supply power to Connecticut, New York, and Rhode Island.\nI'm looking forward to speaking with many of you at the upcoming AGA Virtual Conference.\nI'll now hand the call over to Phil.\nLet's begin with Slide 4, which shows that earnings were $1.06 per share in the first quarter, compared to $1.01 per share in the same period last year.\nBoth years' results included after-tax costs related to our recent acquisition of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts assets, amounting to $0.02 per share this year and $0.01 per share in 2020.\nThe Electric Distribution and Natural Gas Distribution segments showed the most notable year-over-year changes.\nElectric Distribution earned $0.27 per share in this year's first quarter, down from $0.39 per share in the same period last year.\nThis decrease was primarily due to two main factors.\nFirst, we recorded a $30 million charge, or $0.07 per share, mainly reflecting $28.4 million in customer credits and an additional $1.6 million penalty to be paid to Connecticut.\nThese penalties stem from a Notice of Violation issued by Connecticut regulators last week, regarding our power restoration performance following Tropical Storm Isaias last August.\nThe regulatory review of this penalty is set to conclude in mid-July this year.\nAdditionally, Electric Distribution results were negatively impacted by roughly $20 million in higher storm-related expenses in the first quarter of 2021, compared to a relatively quiet and mild first quarter in 2020.\nWe experienced 31 separate storm events across our three states this quarter, in contrast to limited activity in Q1 2020.\nConversely, our Natural Gas Distribution segment showed a significant increase in earnings, now being about 50% larger than a year ago.\nIt earned $0.43 per share in the first quarter of 2021, up from $0.26 per share in the same period last year.\nThe improved results were primarily due to the addition of Eversource Gas of Massachusetts, which contributed $0.14 per share in the quarter.\nWe also saw higher revenues at NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas, partially offset by increased O&M and depreciation expenses.\nIt's worth noting that the transition process for Eversource Gas of Massachusetts continues to progress exceptionally well.\nWe are transitioning from NiSource systems to Eversource platforms, aiming to cut expenses and enhance customer service\nSignificant progress has been made, with over 80% of business processes now transferred to Eversource from NiSource\nCustomers, communities, and staff are responding positively to Eversource's ownership of the distribution system, and we are meeting or surpassing our set financial and operational goals\nIn the Electric Transmission segment, our earnings per share increased from $0.38 in Q1 2020 to $0.39 in Q1 2021\nThe improved results were primarily due to increased investment in transmission facilities, partially counteracted by dilution from additional share issuance\nOur Water Distribution segment's earnings rose from $2.1 million in Q1 2020 to $3.6 million in Q1 2021\nThe improvement in results was mainly attributable to reduced interest expenses and a lower effective tax rate\nAquarion recently announced plans to acquire a small investor-owned water system operating in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire\nThe company, called New England Service Company, provides water to approximately 10,000 customers across three states and has a rate base of about $25 million\nThis acquisition aligns with our growth strategy for our water delivery business\nPending timely regulatory approvals, we anticipate finalizing the transaction by year-end and expect it to be immediately accretive in 2022\nWe are maintaining our long-term earnings-per-share growth rate projection in the upper half of the 5% to 7% range\nWe have adjusted our 2021 earnings guidance to account for customer credits, now projecting earnings per share towards the lower end of the $3.81 to $3.93 range, including a $0.07 per share impact from the credits\nWhile our main operating companies don't have pending base rate reviews, we have several ongoing regulatory dockets in Connecticut\nPURA has identified a 90 basis point reduction in our authorized distribution ROE, likely to be addressed in the current CL&P interim rate decrease proceeding\nBased on PURA's revised schedule, we believe any ROE reduction would not take effect until October 1st this year\nTo provide context, CL&P's current authorized ROE is 9.25%, with approximately $5 billion of rate base\nPURA recently finalized an interim decision on the recovery of certain tracked costs by CL&P, with some changes to be implemented on June 1st and others deferred until October 1st\nThe interim decision incorporated several positive modifications from an earlier draft, which we appreciate\nPURA is also reviewing other dockets, including potential grid modernization initiatives, AMI electric vehicle programs, and storage\nWe were disappointed by recent developments regarding FERC's ongoing notice of proposed rulemaking concerning incentives for utilities participating in regional transmission organizations\nFERC will be accepting comments and replies on the proposed changes before making a final decision\nAs a general guideline, a 10 basis point reduction in our transmission ROE affects consolidated earnings by about $0.01 per share\nWe've completed $450 million in debt issuances this year, primarily to repay maturities at Eversource parent and Aquarion in Connecticut\nWe haven't issued additional equity this year beyond our ongoing dividend reinvestment and employee incentive programs\nWe continue to expect to issue approximately $700 million of new equity through an after-market program at various points during our forecast period\nOur operations have had a strong start this year, with electric reliability in the top industry quartile\nOur safety record has improved further, with fewer employee injuries compared to Q1 2020\nAll three of our natural gas utilities are exceeding their emergency response requirements\nAquarion's water quality is consistently surpassing its target\nSummary: ",
    "output": "compname reports q1 earnings per share of $1.06.\nq1 earnings per share $1.06.\nreaffirmed projected long-term earnings per share growth rate in upper half of range of 5 to 7%.\nestimates it will earn toward lower end of 2021 recurring earnings per share guidance of $3.81 to $3.93 per share.\n",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Yesterday evening, we made public the outcomes of our Q4 for the 2021 fiscal year, which can be found in the IR portion of our site.\nTo offer a clearer picture of our operational performance, we utilize certain non-GAAP financial metrics that involve modifications to GAAP outcomes.\nIt's important to note that any presented non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for the financial measures mandated by GAAP.\nErica will delve into the specifics of the business segments and corporate finances.\nOne year ago today.\nI discussed our readiness to succeed as the recovery unfolds, and I believe 2021 demonstrates that we were indeed prepared.\nThe 2021 fiscal year was exceptional for Cabot, as we bounced back from the COVID-induced lows of 2020 to achieve record-breaking results.\nWe attained this through a blend of exceptional execution and our dedication to fostering growth via distinctive investments.\nI'd like to take a moment to reflect on the year's achievements.\nThe Cabot operational model is grounded in commercial and operational excellence, and our proficiency in these areas drove our outstanding performance in fiscal year 2021.\nWe achieved a record adjusted earnings per share of $5.02 and a total segment EBIT of $550 million.\nOur emphasis on cash management resulted in an unprecedented discretionary free cash flow of $353 million.\nThe economic landscape in 2021 demanded resilience and adaptability, and I'm immensely proud of how the Cabot team worked tirelessly to meet our customers' changing needs.\nOur team is driven by the desire to serve our customers and innovate alongside them.\nThis task was made more challenging in 2021 due to the numerous global supply chain disruptions faced by companies and the ongoing evolution of necessary COVID safety protocols, which altered our usual working methods.\nFurthermore, companies encountered rapidly increasing input costs, necessitating dynamic commercial management.\nOur teams collaborated closely with our customers to navigate this environment, and we were successful in our pricing strategies to maintain robust margins and invest in supporting our customers' long-term supply requirements.\nThe 2021 fiscal year marked the sixth year of our advancing the core strategy, and I'm very satisfied with our execution record and the growth prospects for our company.\nAdjusted earnings per share has grown at a compound annual rate of 11% since the inception of our strategy, surpassing our 7% to 10% target.\nOur approach has been characterized by a focus on growth centered around our core segments and disciplined execution.\nWhile we're pleased with our results since 2015, I'm even more excited about the growth opportunities ahead and the progress we made in 2021.\nOur growth strategy is based on the principle of investing from positions of strength and in areas where we believe we have a competitive advantage.\nSeveral highlights from 2021 are particularly noteworthy.\nOur unrivaled portfolio of conductive carbon additives and our strong customer-focused model led to a doubling of revenue in our battery materials business compared to the previous year.\nWe're advancing with the conversion of our Xuzhou, China plants to specialty carbons, and this investment will drive growth across our wide range of specialty carbon applications while freeing up additional capacity to support battery materials.\nOur inkjet business is well-positioned to capitalize on the shift from analog to digital printing in the commercial and packaging segments, and we secured multiple OEM qualifications in 2021, setting us up for growth as inkjet presses penetrate these markets.\nLastly, we're continuing to execute a project to construct a specialty compounds production line in Cilegon, Indonesia, which will enable us to meet customer demand for black masterbatch in this high-growth region.\nWhile growth and execution are highlights of 2021, these accomplishments have been achieved with sustainability at the forefront.\nWe continued our sustainability journey in 2021 with several notable achievements.\nFirst and foremost, we pledged to align our disclosures with the recommendations of the Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) and engaged a third party to help us assess climate risks and opportunities following the TCFD guidelines.\nWe plan to share the results of this work in the coming months.\nDespite the challenging operating environment of 2021, I'm very proud of our performance in employee safety.\nOur total recordable incident rate of 0.34 keeps us firmly among the top-performing chemical and industrial companies.\nWe also completed a major air emissions control project at our carbon black manufacturing facility in Louisiana.\nThis investment in control technology will improve air quality by substantially eliminating nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions and ensure that we can support our customers' supply needs sustainably over the long term.\nAdditionally, waste heat from the plant is being recovered and used to generate up to 50MW of cogeneration power without creating any additional emissions.\nIn August, we unveiled a new $1 billion revolving credit facility with pricing linked to our credit ratings and performance in reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions.\nThis deal underscores our dedication to sustainability and was among the first such agreements in the U.S. chemical sector.\nAs a chemical industry, we must attract diverse and talented individuals from the next generation to pursue careers in chemistry.\nCabot is participating in the Future of STEM Scholars Initiative (FOSSI), which aims to create opportunities for students from historically black colleges and universities to enter and excel in STEM careers within the chemical industry.\nWe are proud to be a founding sponsor of this initiative, which will have a significant and transformative impact on both the students and our industry.\nWe achieved excellent financial results and made significant progress towards our strategic goals in 2021.\nThis comprehensive success demonstrates the strength of our portfolio and the exceptional quality of our team.\nI'd like to share a few thoughts on the fourth quarter.\nI'm happy to report strong fourth quarter results, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.11.\nThis performance was 63% higher than the same period last year, despite challenges from the semiconductor chip shortage, ongoing global supply chain issues, and increased maintenance spending due to the timing of turnarounds.\nWe maintained momentum in battery materials, ending the year with EBITDA within our previously stated range of $15 million to $20 million.\nCash flow from operations was robust at $100 million for the quarter, despite the impact of higher raw material costs.\nLet's begin by examining the results of the Reinforcement Materials segment.\nIn the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2021, EBIT for Reinforcement Materials grew by $8 million and $167 million respectively, compared to the same periods in the previous year.\nThese increases were primarily due to improved unit margins and higher volumes.\nMargins improved due to higher spot pricing, especially in Asia.\nThe volume increases in the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2021 were attributable to a strong recovery across all regions from the COVID-related impacts in fiscal 2020.\nFourth quarter results were also affected by higher costs related to plant maintenance.\nGlobally, volumes rose by 6% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year, with 6% growth in the Americas, 5% in Europe, and 7% in Asia.\nHigher volumes were driven by strong demand across all regions as the replacement tire market remained robust.\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we anticipate a sequential increase in EBIT due to lower fixed costs from reduced plant maintenance spending and a modest increase in volumes as demand for replacement tires remains solid.\nTurning to Performance Chemicals, EBIT increased by $20 million in the fourth quarter and $93 million for the full year compared to the same periods in fiscal 2020, primarily due to improved product mix, stronger volumes, and higher customer pricing.\nThe improved product mix was driven by increased sales in automotive and conductive carbon applications within our specialty carbons and compounds product line.\nPricing improved year-over-year in our fumed silica product lines, particularly in China.\nYear-over-year volumes in the fourth fiscal quarter grew by 2% in performance additives but decreased by 8% in formulated solutions.\nVolumes were impacted during the quarter, largely due to two plant outages as discussed in last quarter's call.\nThis segment experienced increased maintenance costs in the fourth fiscal quarter as expected, but these higher costs were offset by $7 million in insurance proceeds related to a claim from earlier in fiscal 2021.\nLooking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect sequential volume growth as one of the impacted plants has resumed operations and we anticipate positive growth in our battery materials product line.\nWe foresee higher input costs in the first quarter that will temporarily impact results until our latest round of announced price increases and surcharges can be fully implemented to recover the rising costs.\nRegarding Purification Solutions, EBIT in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased by $4 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, and full year EBIT increased by $7 million.\nThese increases were driven by lower fixed costs resulting from the sale of the mine in Texas and the related long-term activated carbon supply agreement, as well as the positive impact of improved pricing in our specialty applications.\nLooking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect EBIT to decline sequentially due to seasonally lower volumes and higher maintenance costs associated with planned turnaround activities.\nNow, let's discuss corporate items.\nWe concluded the quarter with a cash balance of $168 million, and our liquidity position remains strong at approximately $1.3 billion.\nIn Q4 of fiscal 2021, operational cash flows amounted to $100 million, including a $4 million reduction in working capital\nQ4 fiscal 2021 saw capital expenditures of $80 million, with an additional $20 million allocated for dividend payments\nThroughout fiscal 2021, operational cash flow reached $257 million, encompassing a $222 million rise in net working capital\nThe increase in working capital was primarily attributed to higher raw material costs affecting inventory and accounts receivable, as price increases were passed on to customers\nBusiness growth year-on-year also contributed to the increase\nCapital expenditures for fiscal 2021 totaled $195 million, covering targeted growth investments and U.S. EPA compliance projects\nFor fiscal 2022, capital expenditures are projected to range between $225 million and $250 million\nThis projection includes ongoing U.S. EPA compliance spending and increased investment in high-confidence, high-return growth projects\nGrowth-related capital includes upgrading our new China carbon black plant for specialty carbon production, expected to be operational in the latter half of 2022\nWe are also developing a new specialty compounds unit in Indonesia and planning capacity expansions in battery materials and inkjet\nDuring the fiscal year, an additional $80 million was used for dividend payments\nThe operating tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 27%, with an expected range of 27% to 29% for fiscal 2022\nLooking forward to 2022, I am enthusiastic about our growth prospects\nAllow me to outline our key objectives for the coming year\nOur first priority is to conclude 2022 tire customer agreements, with positive expectations as supply security remains crucial for customers\nDemand is strong and projected to remain robust across all regions\nLow inventory levels throughout the supply chain and ongoing global transportation challenges are increasing the value of local supply\nOur second focus is to progress various strategic growth investments across the company\nIn battery materials, we plan to increase capacity at our carbon nanotube facility in Zhuhai, China\nThe conversion of our Suzhou plant to specialty carbons will provide 50,000 metric tons of additional capacity and allow our network to support battery materials growth\nWe anticipate completing our new specialty compounds production unit in Indonesia later in 2022, strengthening our position in the rapidly growing ASEAN region\nLastly, we aim to maintain our track record of delivering earnings growth and strong cash flow while preserving our investment grade rating and industry-leading dividend\nThis overview should provide insight into our 2022 priorities\nTo conclude my prepared remarks, I'll discuss our outlook for the year\nWe're pleased with the momentum from fiscal 2021 and optimistic about the new year\nWe anticipate improved performance in Reinforcement Materials starting in Q2, based on expected positive outcomes from our 2022 customer agreements\nWe expect improved results across all Performance Chemicals product lines, with above-market growth in battery materials and inkjet products\nBased on these factors, we project adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2020 to range from $5.20 to $5.60\nFirst quarter results are expected to align with the fourth quarter, with performance improving throughout the year\nRegarding cash flow, we anticipate strong free cash flow from year-over-year earnings growth, partially offset by increased working capital to support growth\nCash flow will be allocated to fund advantageous growth investments, dividends, and opportunistic share repurchases\nOverall, I'm very optimistic about our company's current position and future direction\nOur growth opportunities are more promising than ever during my tenure as CEO\nThe long-term fundamentals of our businesses remain strong\nOur end markets are robust, and we continue to perform at a high level\nLooking ahead, we believe we have a winning combination: a talented team, an excellent portfolio of growth-oriented businesses, and a strong balance sheet\nThese factors position us to achieve our strategic objectives and maintain our industry leadership and growth\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:In line with our goals, our communities, guided by field staff, have continued operations and resident services while following CDC guidelines and local regulations.\nOur corporate staff has adapted well to the new work environment, maintaining support for field teams and advancing strategic objectives.\nI believe we've achieved some of our best work in the company's 27-year history during its most challenging period.\nThe next generation of ACC employees seems to be learning a lot about our business from their parents each day.\nAt the start of the pandemic, in accordance with our company values and objectives, we promised that no resident would lose their home due to inability to pay rent on time.\nWe pledged to be understanding of the financial difficulties our residents and their parents might face due to COVID and government shutdowns.\nWe also committed to being the best possible partner to our long-term ACE university associates.\nHonoring these commitments resulted in short-term financial impacts reflected in the quarter's results.\nAt our off-campus apartments and on-campus communities leased in the open market, an average of 93.7% of residents paid rent in April, May, and June.\nFor those facing hardship, we provided nearly $9 million in direct financial assistance to over 6,500 residents and their parents through our hardship program.\nWe offered an additional $15 million in financial relief to students and parents at ACE on-campus communities where our university partners manage leasing, rent collection, and residence life.\nOur waiving of rent payment and collection fees resulted in over $2 million of budgeted revenue not being collected this quarter.\nAs the team will discuss, this $24 million in financial relief and waived fee income accounts for most of our reduced revenue this quarter.\nWe offset some of this through expense reductions that didn't compromise the quality of service to our residents.\nWith most current leases ending soon and a new academic year approaching, unlike typical apartment renters, student tenants' financial situations may improve somewhat.\nAs many remember from college or parenting college students, each year students can apply for needs-based financial aid including grants, scholarships, and loans.\nIn spring and summer 2019, when financial aid assessments were made for the current academic year, the US economy was near all-time highs with record-low unemployment across demographics.\nThese favorable economic conditions likely influenced students' financial aid applications based on their and their parents' financial status at that time.\nWhen COVID hit in March 2020, mid-academic year, many students and parents saw their income decrease significantly without additional financial aid support.\nIn contrast, as students applied for financial aid in spring and summer 2020 for the upcoming year, those experiencing financial hardship due to the pandemic are likely to qualify for more aid than the previous year.\nWe believe this needs-based increase in financial aid typically occurs during US recessions, possibly contributing to the student housing industry's resilience during economic downturns.\nLooking ahead to the next academic year, while we don't expect a full return to normalcy in fall 2020, we're cautiously optimistic based on four factors.\nFirst, universities are focusing on policies to promote safe academic delivery, facilitating some in-person instruction. Currently, 63 of our 68 served universities plan some in-person classes.\nSecond, universities now have data on COVID's impact on 18-22 year olds and understand how modern student housing facilitates sanitization and isolation during outbreaks.\nThird, students desire to be in a college environment with peers rather than at home, even if instruction is mostly online.\nFourth, we're seeing continued improvement in overall leasing data, with above-normal activity in traffic, applications, leases, and renewals at our open market properties as of July 17.\nAs reported, with 5-11 weeks before classes start, we're 90% pre-leased for the upcoming year, 340 basis points behind last year.\nWhile the variance to last year increased from 230 basis points in our May 31 update, the gap at our open market properties has decreased since then.\nThe recent velocity trends in traffic, applications, leases, and renewals suggest this variance should continue to decrease for our core properties.\nI'll now break down our cautious optimism in terms of ongoing risks and opportunities that may affect our final leasing numbers.\nFirst, focusing on risks, we routinely manage three categories in every annual lease-up: renewal skips, relet requests, and no-shows.\nWe aim to relet any accommodations that become available for these reasons before classes begin.\nA renewal skip occurs when a current leaseholder who signed a renewal lease for the next year vacates their apartment and stops paying rent, effectively skipping out on both leases.\nThese students are removed from our pre-leasing statistics due to their definitive actions.\nSo far, we've had 178 renewal skips, consistent with historical levels.\nRegarding potential no-shows and relet requests, we started our management process earlier than usual to identify students not planning to return and those wanting help releasing their accommodations.\nThese potential no-shows and relet leases are included in our current pre-leasing numbers, as they always have been at this point.\nWe typically attempt to release these accommodations until the end of the lease-up process, then remove any actual no-shows and unsuccessful relets from our final statistics.\nHistorically, we only lose 35-60 basis points of final occupancy due to this process, which is reflected in our reported final leasing statistics.\nOur final fall lease-up occupancy, averaging 97.5% over the years, has always accounted for these impacts.\nWe believe our diligent management of this process contributes to our occupancy rates typically exceeding the industry average by 200 basis points.\nThis year, we've implemented an extensive communication process to engage with residents about their plans, without directly asking if they intend to take possession or no-show.\nFor our open market properties, we currently have 72,009 leases for fall, with 28,057 renewals and 43,952 new leases, the latter presenting a higher no-show risk.\nWe've made 64,029 phone calls and had direct conversations with 68% of new leases and 20% of renewals.\nCurrently, we're seeing an increase in potential no-shows and relet requests compared to last year, though we're unsure how much of this increase is due to COVID versus our expedited process.\nAs of July 20, we've identified 689 potential no-shows compared to 135 last year.\nConcerning relet requests, we presently have 1,563 for this year compared to 956 last year.\nThe total potential no-show relet for this year currently represents about 230 basis points of possible lost occupancy versus 110 basis points last year.\nHistorically, the number of no-shows typically rises in early August, coinciding with the first rent payment due date.\nFor instance, last year, the 135 potential no-shows as of July 20 peaked at 446 on August 5.\nThrough our standard procedures, we effectively managed the final impact to only 38 basis points of decrease due to actual no-shows and successful reletting.\nWe will vigilantly monitor rent payments and increases in potential no-shows during early August to determine if normal or above-average increases occur or if our efforts to expedite these processes actually accelerated identification of potential no-shows and relets earlier than usual.\nAs of July 20, the combined no-show and relet net difference compared to last year is 1,161, representing 120 basis points of potential lost occupancy.\nReletting both no-show and relet requests in the COVID environment will likely be more difficult.\nThis year, with fewer properties fully leased and often lacking waiting lists to facilitate this process, we'll need to rely mainly on increased traffic, applications, and leasing velocity compared to last year to fill these potential no-shows and relet requests.\nRegarding opportunities that may further boost our leasing velocity beyond historical levels in the late stages of our lease-up, I'd like to discuss universities' fall housing de-densification activities due to COVID.\nEach of these alternative uses has returns on paper equal to or exceeding the development's planned primary purpose.\nRegarding San Francisco State University, officials have ordered a significant reduction in available on-campus housing for fall 2020 as part of efforts to decrease density.\nOur project operates under a marketing and licensing agreement, with San Francisco State handling leasing administration for this academic year.\nFollowing discussions with the University, we expect the project to open at 60% capacity with single occupancy configuration this fall.\nThere's a possibility of returning to full designed bed capacity for spring and summer 2021, and we'll continue to monitor the situation and collaborate closely with the University.\nConcerning USC Health Sciences phase two, we are currently 72% pre-leased and are processing ongoing leasing activity and the no-show procedure for fall.\nWe will offer a comprehensive update on all fall deliveries during the Q3 call.\nTurning to our on-campus P3 business.\nWe have a robust pipeline of on-campus development with 10 projects at various pre-development stages.\nWe expect to close and begin construction on our third-party project at Georgetown University in Q3 this year as initially planned.\nHowever, due to COVID-19 disruptions, our third-party projects at Concordia, University of California, Berkeley, Upper Hearst and University of California, Irvine, are likely to be delayed until next year.\nWe currently anticipate closing and starting construction on all three projects in 2021, with Concordia aiming for delivery in fall 2022 and UC Berkeley and UC Irvine targeting fall 2023 delivery.\nWe continue to advance in the early stages of pre-development on our previously announced projects at MIT, Virginia Commonwealth University, Princeton, Northeastern, UC Berkeley and West Virginia University.\nThe final structure, scope, feasibility, fees and timing for all pre-development projects have not yet been determined.\nOverall, while some procurement and housing initiatives have been temporarily delayed or suspended due to COVID-19, we continue to pursue numerous active procurements and see a promising future pipeline of on-campus development opportunities.\nAs Bill mentioned, universities nationwide have had to reduce density in on-campus housing, primarily affecting older traditional dorms with shared bathrooms.\nConsumer preferences have also favored more modern apartment and suite-style accommodations that allow for easier sanitization and isolation within units if necessary.\nAdditionally, due to de-densification, reduced revenue streams, and related financial impacts, universities will use off-balance sheet financing structures to update their housing stock, including both project-based financing and equity-based models like our ACE program.\nWe anticipate that these factors will further accelerate the need to modernize outdated on-campus housing using P3 financing methods, and believe ACC is well-positioned as the established best-in-class partner to capitalize on this growing opportunity.\nIn addition to what we believe will be an expanding on-campus opportunity, ACC is also preparing to execute on opportunistic investments that may arise from the COVID-19 crisis and corresponding economic environment.\nGiven that our recent cost of public equity remains disconnected from private market valuations, it's prohibitive for us to execute on many investments in the current environment.\nAs such, we are expanding our joint venture equity strategy to pursue external growth.\nWe have engaged a financial advisor and are currently seeking equity sources for a joint venture or fund in which ACC would invest minimal equity or contribute existing assets as a minority general partner.\nIn addition to our existing partnership with Allianz, identifying external equity partners will allow ACC to pursue external growth off-balance sheet, while also offering further access to liquidity via dispositions if the current economic crisis continues.\nWe plan to use this off-balance-sheet structure to execute our proven core competency of identifying and implementing investment opportunities that drive outsized returns for both ACC and our strategic capital partners.\nACC will benefit through earnings per share and FFO growth from generating fees and potential promotes upon outperformance while requiring minimal equity investment to preserve our balance sheet for more accretive investments.\nWe will keep the market informed as we make progress.\nLooking ahead to the fall 2021 academic year, we continue to see favorable reductions in new supply across our owned markets.\nWithin ACC's 68 markets, we are tracking 17,600 beds currently under construction for 2021, with a potential additional 1,200 beds planned but not yet under construction, reflecting a 14% to 20% decline in new supply following the current year's 20% decrease.\nEven if all planned beds were delivered for fall 2021, this would be the lowest number of beds delivered in our markets since 2011.\nWe will update the market regarding these potential deliveries on our third quarter call.\nAs reported last night, total FFOM for the second quarter of 2020 was $50.9 million or $0.37 per fully diluted share.\nAs discussed, Q2 was significantly impacted by COVID-19 effects and associated governmental shelter-in-place orders implemented across the country.\nWhile we can't completely isolate every pandemic-related item, we believe approximately $23 million to $24 million in FFOM was lost due to pandemic-related situations this quarter.\nOverall, owned property revenue was negatively impacted by $32.4 million due to COVID-related rent relief, lost summer camp revenue, increased bad debt, waived fees, and other items.\nPartially offsetting the lost revenue, owned property operating expenses were $8 million lower than originally budgeted as we reduced spending in all areas except for the uncontrollable insurance and property taxes.\nAs a result of the lower than originally budgeted property NOI, ground lease expense was approximately $500,000 less due to reduced outperformance rent paid to our university ground lessor partners.\nJoint venture partners' noncontrolling interest in earnings was approximately $1.2 million lower.\nAdditionally, third-party management fee income was approximately $1 million lower and FFOM contribution from our on-campus participating properties was almost $800,000 lower due to universities refunding a portion of spring rents at properties in both business segments.\nLastly, we created approximately $800,000 in G&A and third-party overhead expense savings relative to our original plan for the quarter.\nDue to continued uncertainty created by the pandemic and the ultimate effect of university actions regarding curriculum delivery for the 2021 academic year, we are not issuing new 2020 earnings guidance at this time.\nHowever, we want to make you aware of some additional pandemic impacts expected as we close out the current academic year in the first couple of months of the coming quarter.\nJuly will be the last month of current in-place leases at most of our properties, and we expect delinquencies will not differ significantly from recent months.\nWe also anticipate additional refunds in our on-campus ACE portfolio for the remainder of the summer term, expected to range from approximately $1.5 million to $2.5 million, which should still keep us within the originally communicated range of expected refunds.\nRegarding other income, we continue to expect little to no summer camp business, and we are continuing to waive late fees and convenience fees through the remainder of the current academic year, which combined is expected to result in a $5 million to $6 million loss in other income in the third quarter.\nAs William discussed, we now believe it's likely that the three third-party development projects at the University of California, Irvine, Berkeley and Concordia University originally scheduled to commence in 2020 will be delayed until 2021.\nThese projects were expected to contribute a combined $4 million in development fee income in 2020.\nWhile there will be some continued financial impacts of the pandemic in the immediate future, the consumer sentiment and university policies Bill discussed give us confidence that our operating results will return to normalized levels in the long term.\nMeanwhile, we have a strong, healthy balance sheet and substantial liquidity to absorb the disruption.\nWe further improved the Company's balance sheet liquidity in June with a well-received 10-year $400 million bond offering, using the proceeds to reduce the outstanding balance on the Company's $1 billion revolving credit facility.\nAs of June 30, we had over $800 million available on our revolver, with no remaining debt maturities in 2020 and a manageable $167 million in secured mortgage debt maturing in 2021.\nAs detailed on page S15 of our earnings supplemental, including all projects currently under development for delivery through 2023, we have only $279 million in remaining development capital needs.\nAs of June 30, the Company's debt to total asset value was 40.9% and net debt to EBITDA was 7.6 times.\nAlthough our leverage ratios are temporarily elevated relative to our historically communicated targets due to the short-term COVID-related disruption discussed, we feel confident about the capital plan outlined on page S15, which will bring the Company's debt to total assets back into the mid-30% range and debt to EBITDA back to the high-5 times to low-6 times range.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Before commencing, I'd like to note that Earl is a recent addition, having joined less than a month ago following the end of the fiscal year; while he's quickly adapting to the business, please direct any post-call inquiries to Investor Relations.\nIt's surprising that we're already discussing our fourth quarter results as 2020 comes to a close.\nConversely, we're about to review only the second complete quarter showing COVID-19's financial impact.\nOur fourth quarter revenue was approximately $1.5 billion.\nThis shows a 9.9% decrease compared to last year, but a significant sequential improvement from our over 15% decline in Q3.\nOur diverse clientele once again demonstrates our business's resilience.\nThe Technology & Manufacturing sector grew by nearly 7%, while Business & Industry and Education sectors showed only slight revenue decreases.\nAs anticipated, our Aviation segment was the main cause of our organic decline compared to the previous year.\nTechnical Solutions also experienced a substantial revenue drop and continued to face challenges with site access, affecting churn rates.\nOn a positive note, Technical Solutions has a healthy backlog of committed work and a strong pipeline for 2021.\nConsidering all factors, the quarter's revenue performance was satisfactory.\nRegarding profitability, we saw continued demand for higher-margin COVID-related work orders and our enhanced cleaning program, particularly in Business & Industry and Technology & Manufacturing sectors.\nOur variable labor model and ability to adjust staffing based on demand protected our financial performance, and we continued to see profit advantages by efficiently managing labor as we scaled and consolidated staff during the quarter.\nThis has been a key factor in our financial performance throughout the pandemic.\nDue to these factors, we increased earnings on both a GAAP and adjusted basis compared to last year.\nIncome from continued operations increased to $53.1 million or $0.78 per share.\nOn an adjusted basis, we achieved $46.7 million or $0.69 per share.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin rose to 6.2% from 5.6% last year.\nThese results are even more impressive considering they include a non-cash reserve we took for an entertainment-related project within our Technical Solutions segment.\nThis was a unique client situation and not indicative of our broader project portfolio within Technical Solutions.\nThis had a 120 basis point impact on our adjusted EBITDA margin and earnings.\nEven including this unusual event, our performance continues to show consistent strength and execution quarter after quarter.\n2020 will be remembered as a transformative year for ABM in many ways.\nThe pandemic has shifted public perception, with professional Class A janitorial services now undeniably viewed as essential and non-discretionary.\nFacility owners must now prove they're providing clean, healthy, and safe spaces that occupants can trust.\nThis will not only be required but will also reflect on their brand.\nOur EnhancedClean service response gives clients peace of mind through studied protocols and practices that maintain facility safety, setting us apart from competitors.\nAs a company with over 110 years of history, ABM has endured and grown through many global events.\nHowever, 2020 tested us in unprecedented ways, and I've never been more inspired by our organization.\nI'd like to highlight some of our team's specific accomplishments.\nSince March, we've been at the forefront of battling a pandemic that has disrupted nearly every industry.\nWhile navigating a constantly changing environment as we learned more about the virus, we prioritized the health and safety of our employees and clients above all else.\nOur procurement team excelled in providing PPE and maintaining our global supply chain when others in our industry struggled to meet surging demands.\nWe also joined forces with large cleaning contractors to form the Cleaning Coalition of America, representing our industry which played a crucial role in restoring our country.\nThe Coalition aims to advocate for vaccine priority for our industry and has developed a focused campaign to raise awareness about what distinguishes best-in-class providers.\nAt ABM, we take pride in proactively developing our own expert-backed certified programs to address our clients' needs with disinfection protocols, including specialized training and signage, electrostatic spraying of disinfectant, and air filtration.\nThis is all supported by one of our most comprehensive marketing campaigns to date.\nIt's important to recognize that we mobilized multiple cross-functional task forces across all critical areas of our business, enhancing our adaptability and creating lasting improvements beyond the pandemic.\nThese task forces led to improved operating procedures for labor management, sales, and financial activities.\nFor instance, our approach to collections resulted in generating over $450 million in cash flow from operations and $420 million in free cash flow, both company records.\nThis translates to nearly $1 billion in liquidity, including $400 million in cash, which is an extremely advantageous position during these uncertain times.\nAs we enter 2021, we aim to capitalize on this momentum and shift from a defensive to an offensive strategy.\nStarting with our executive team, we recently announced several appointments to better align our internal organizational structure with our business strategies.\nEarl is an experienced finance executive who joins us from Best Buy, a leading Fortune 500 provider of consumer technology products and services with 125,000 employees in North America.\nEarl held various executive positions in finance, and most recently was responsible for leading enterprise capital project planning, transformation and procurement, as well as supporting digital and technology and global real estate.\nDuring his time at Best Buy, Earl also spearheaded several strategic initiatives targeting labor and logistics.\nEarl joined less than three weeks ago but is quickly familiarizing himself with our business.\nI'm also pleased to announce that Rene Jacobsen has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer and will lead all of our client-facing industry groups.\nIn his eight years at ABM, Rene has consistently driven our operational performance and service excellence, and his leadership was undoubtedly crucial in our successful navigation of 2020.\nAs COO, he will provide strategic guidance for our operations and drive financial results across all our platforms.\nRene will continue to work closely with Sean Mahoney, our new President of Sales and Marketing.\nSince Sean joined ABM in 2017, we've broken sales records each year, achieving another record in 2020 with new sales at $1.2 billion - an impressive accomplishment in any year, but especially in a year when much of the economy was at a standstill.\nThe combined leadership of Rene and Sean proved to be a powerful force for our operations and sales teams in 2020 and will undoubtedly exceed our expectations in 2021.\nRegarding 2021, we will be sharing our refreshed business strategy later in the year, which builds on the positive changes and acceleration we saw with our 2020 vision.\nAt that time, we will review our technology plan and path toward a digital platform for our employees and clients.\nAs mentioned last quarter, some of our near-term investments involve restarting IT projects that were put on hold due to the pandemic, such as our ERP system and data management roadmap.\nSome investments will be novel due to opportunities emerging from the pandemic, like EnhancedClean and its associated program development.\nRegarding that, from a return on investment perspective, we ended the year with over $300 million in revenue from our EnhancedClean program and COVID-related activities.\nWe have exciting marketing and sales initiatives planned in the coming months to further accelerate growth and differentiate ourselves in the market.\nWe will take a responsible approach to investments given the uncertain environment, while balancing long-term planning with intense focus on near-term developments.\nConditions remain unpredictable, especially as we operate through the winter season.\nCOVID cases are increasing nationwide and you've likely observed or experienced various levels of closures in your own areas.\nUnfortunately, the business environment is no more predictable now than it was three months ago.\nClients are generally planning for the short-term as they respond to resurgences, causing occupancy fluctuations, and they can't yet forecast when most employees will return to workplaces.\nWhile vaccine news is positive, the timeline for widespread availability and uptake is still unknown, which could affect the timing of recovery and reopenings.\nAs a result, our visibility remains limited and we are not providing guidance for the full 2021 fiscal year as you would expect.\nHowever, we will share our expectations for the upcoming first fiscal quarter.\nWe anticipate this will be the only time we provide such a short-term outlook, given the unique circumstances.\nFor Q1, we project GAAP earnings of $0.53 to $0.58 per diluted share, or adjusted earnings of $0.60 to $0.65 per diluted share.\nThese ranges represent significant year-over-year increases compared to last year's $0.41 and $0.39 respectively.\nWe also expect adjusted EBITDA margin between 6.1% and 6.4%, an expansion from 4.3% last year.\nCurrently, we believe revenue declines due to COVID-19 may have bottomed out.\nSequentially, we may see organic declines similar to or slightly better than Q4.\nWe anticipate continued strong demand for pandemic-related work orders and EnhancedClean throughout Q1.\nThe investments I mentioned earlier should continue in Q1, reflected in both our segment profit and corporate lines.\nGenerally, investments will continue throughout fiscal 2021, but the scale and timing will depend on our long-term strategy and the broader recovery outlook.\nEarl will provide more details on assumptions for the quarter and year, which remain fluid.\nIf we gain better visibility for the full year by Q2, we would plan to provide full-year guidance at that time.\nThis mission has never been more meaningful than it is now.\nOur value to clients has increased as our teams have acted as brand ambassadors and demonstrated the operational excellence that distinguishes ABM from competitors.\nNine months ago, we couldn't have predicted how 2020 would conclude for ABM.\nWe not only surpassed our pre-COVID expectations, but actually reached our long-term EBITDA margin target range of 5.5% to 6% ahead of schedule.\nOur 2020 vision strategy has culminated in a pivotal transition, leading us into the next phase of growth and excellence, building on a strong foundation to propel us forward.\nNext year will mark our 50th anniversary on the NYSE, and we look forward to commemorating this milestone in ABM's history.\nWhile last year was certainly memorable for our organization, I'm now excited about the opportunities ahead and more enthusiastic than ever.\nI'll now hand it over to Earl to discuss our financial results.\nI'm thrilled to join the ABM team.\nI quickly recognized that the culture here is exceptional and unique.\nEven in my first few weeks, I've observed an extraordinary drive for collaboration and execution that clearly sets ABM apart.\nAs I delve deeper into the business over the coming months, I look forward to developing and sharing my perspectives on our financial strategies in future calls.\nNow, let's review our quarterly results.\nQuarterly revenue was $1.5 billion, a total decrease of about 9.9% compared to last year, reflecting our second full quarter of COVID-19 revenue declines, particularly in Aviation and Technical Solutions.\nPartially offsetting this revenue decline was continued demand for higher margin work orders we've been providing to clients during the pandemic, especially in Business & Industry and Technology & Manufacturing.\nGAAP income from continuing operations was $53.1 million or $0.78 per diluted share compared to $48.1 million or $0.71 last year.\nThese results reflect ongoing favorable claims trends related to health insurance reserves.\nWe saw a $21.3 million benefit in self-insurance adjustments, of which $6.2 million was related to the current year.\nOn an adjusted basis, income from continuing operations for the quarter increased to $46.7 million or $0.69 per diluted share compared to $44.7 million or $0.66 last year.\nSimilar to Q3, our GAAP and adjusted earnings growth versus last year was primarily driven by a significant increase in higher margin work orders as clients respond to COVID-19, as well as continued management of direct labor to align with demand for legacy services.\nPartially offsetting these results was a $17.6 million reserve for notes receivable related to a project with a unique family entertainment customer in the Technical Solutions segment.\nWe are currently working with the client to resolve this issue.\nAdditionally, operational investments in areas like our EnhancedClean program continued, which was reflected in our operating segment results.\nWe also resumed certain corporate projects, such as IT investments, that were previously paused as we prioritized business continuity during the pandemic.\nThis amounted to approximately $10 million for the quarter.\nYear-over-year, Q4 also had one fewer workday, equating to about $6 million in labor expense savings.\nI'll discuss the workday schedule for fiscal 2021 later, but Q4 of fiscal 2021 will be comparable with 65 days.\nOur overall performance this quarter resulted in adjusted EBITDA of approximately $92.5 million at a margin rate of 6.2% compared to $93 million or 5.6% last year.\nNow, let's review our segment results.\nAs a reminder, these results reflect the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on revenue.\nOperating profit reflects the shift toward higher margin work orders, labor adjustments for legacy service demand, and operational investments such as EnhancedClean.\nB&I revenues were $794.3 million, down just 1.6%.\nWe're encouraged by the sequential top-line improvement compared to a 6.3% decline last quarter.\nThe negative effects of the pandemic on our parking and entertainment sectors persisted this quarter, mirroring the situation in Q3.\nTo counterbalance this COVID-related downturn and the reduction in some lower-profit activities, we experienced steady demand for higher-margin pandemic-related services.\nThis resulted in a more advantageous mix of B&I operations, leading to a growth in operating profit of over 65% to $84.7 million, with a margin rate of 10.7%.\nOur T&M division has also shown remarkable resilience during the pandemic.\nQuarterly revenue reached $245.5 million, a 6.7% increase compared to the previous year.\nOperating profit grew by more than 30% to $23.5 million, resulting in an operating margin of 9.6%.\nThis division primarily consists of crucial service providers such as biopharma, logistics, and industrial manufacturing.\nConsequently, demand has been driven by work orders and EnhancedClean services, more than making up for any COVID-related and other account losses throughout the year.\nIn the education sector, we reported revenue of $212.2 million, reflecting the new academic year and the implementation of hybrid models across our K-12 and higher education portfolios.\nThe operating profit of $15.1 million, or 7.1% margin, reflects labor-related savings due to modified staffing at site locations during the pandemic.\nAs many of us are likely experiencing with our own children today, there remains significant variability in this sector as different cities respond to resurgences, especially leading up to the holiday season.\nWe continue to monitor developments and collaborate with our clients to address both daily cleaning and disinfection needs, as well as long-term budget constraints, where our technical solutions offering can be appealing.\nAviation reported revenues of $141 million and an operating profit of $3.5 million, clearly demonstrating the pandemic's ongoing dramatic impact on the industry.\nHowever, as mentioned last quarter, our aim was to reach at least a breakeven position by the fourth quarter.\nWe are pleased to have ended the year profitably.\nMoving on to Technical Solutions, which reported revenues of $123.1 million compared to $175.5 million last year.\nIt's worth noting that this segment experienced exceptional growth last year, surpassing 25% during Q4 of fiscal '19.\nIn addition to tougher comparisons, site access has been hindered by the pandemic.\nBacklog remains in our healthy range, which we've historically defined as above $150 million.\nWe are closely monitoring our ability to progress through these projects.\nThe operating loss of $3.6 million was caused by a reserve of notes receivables related to a single entertainment customer and associated with the client's increased credit risk resulting from the pandemic, which we continue to pursue.\nRegarding cash and liquidity, we generated a record $198.7 million in cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $189.6 million for the quarter.\nThis resulted in $457.5 million in cash flow and $419.5 million of free cash flow for the year.\nThese results include $101 million in deferred U.S. payroll taxes due to the CARES Act, which will be due in 2021 and 2022.\nEven without this, these are record figures for the year.\nDue to our strong cash position, we concluded the quarter with total debt, including standby letters of credit, of $883.4 million and a bank adjusted leverage ratio of 2.1 times.\nAdditionally, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $394.2 million.\nDuring the quarter, we paid our 218th consecutive quarterly cash dividend, totaling approximately $12.3 million.\nTo summarize our annual results, total revenues were approximately $6 billion, a 7.9% decrease compared to last year.\nThe revenue decline was attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on business operations, mainly during the third and fourth quarters of this year.\nOur GAAP income from continuing operations for fiscal 2020 was $0.2 million.\nOn an adjusted basis, income from continuing operations for the year was $163.5 million or $2.43 per diluted share.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year increased by 6.6% to $361.9 million, and we concluded the fiscal year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 6%.\nRegarding our guidance outlook, we are providing guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2021.\nWe currently expect GAAP earnings per share to range from $0.53 to $0.58 and adjusted earnings per share to range from $0.60 to $0.65.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin is anticipated to be between 6.1% to 6.4%.\nThis guidance assumes organic growth will be sequentially flat to slightly improved compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nWe anticipate higher margin work orders and labor efficiencies to continue into the first quarter.\nAs Scott discussed extensively, we plan to invest in fiscal 2021.\nThe first quarter will see the same level of investments as the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, approximately $10 million.\nThe first quarter will also have one fewer working day compared to last year, potentially leading to approximately $6 million in lower labor expenses.\nHowever, we are preparing for possible higher payroll taxes beginning in January for SUI, FUI, as well as federal taxes such as FICA.\nRegarding interest, based on our operating expectations for the first quarter and our current cash position, we do not anticipate an increase in borrowings compared to the fourth quarter.\nTherefore, interest expense should decrease slightly due to the continuing amortization of our term loan.\nThe tax rate for the quarter is expected to be approximately 30%.\nThis rate excludes discrete tax items such as the work opportunity tax credit and the tax impact of stock-based compensation awards, which we currently expect will total less than $1 million in Q1.\nConcerning cash flow, we assume government-related benefits in the U.K. and U.S., such as the CARES Act, will not recur.\nThis should be considered when evaluating free cash flow for the new fiscal year.\nHowever, we achieved higher free cash flow due to improved operational practices in response to the pandemic.\nWe intend to maintain these standards and disciplines.\nLastly, regarding taxes, in fiscal '20, our full-year impact for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit was $4 million, reflecting the pandemic's effect on traditional hiring practices.\nCurrently, WATSI is expected to expire on December 31 of this calendar year.\nHowever, we are closely monitoring Congress for related action, including a potential extension of WATSI.\nFollowing such strong results for 2020, I look forward to sharing more information with you in the coming quarters.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These declarations are not assurances of forthcoming achievements or occurrences and are founded on current management expectations.\nReal outcomes and events may vary significantly.\nElements that could lead to differing results include factors outlined in our Q3 2021 Form 10-Q report, our 2020 yearly report on Form 10-K, and other recent SEC submissions.\nMoreover, some comments may allude to non-GAAP financial metrics.\nI'm delighted to announce that AIG experienced another exceptional quarter as we continue to gain traction and implement our strategic objectives.\nWe persist in fostering underwriting excellence across our portfolio.\nWe're implementing AIG 200 to instill operational superiority in all our endeavors.\nWe are progressing with the separation of the life and retirement division from AIG.\nAnd we're exhibiting an ongoing dedication to prudent capital management.\nI will begin my comments with an overview of our consolidated financial performance for the third quarter.\nI will then examine our general insurance results, where we continue to demonstrate market leadership in addressing risk issues for clients while delivering enhanced underwriting profitability and more stable outcomes.\nI'll also discuss certain market dynamics, particularly in the property sector, as well as recent catastrophe activity and related reinsurance considerations as we approach year-end.\nFollowing that, I'll review results from our life and retirement business, which we continue to prepare for independence.\nI will also provide an update on the substantial progress we're making on the operational separation of life and retirement from AIG and our effective execution of AIG 200.\nI will then discuss capital management, where our short-term priorities remain consistent with those I've previously outlined: debt reduction, returning capital to shareholders, investing in our business through organic growth and operational enhancements.\nLastly, I will conclude with our recently announced senior executive changes that further position AIG for long-term success.\nThese appointments were made possible due to our strong internal talent pool and significantly enhance the leadership team across our organization.\nBeginning with our consolidated results.\nAs I mentioned, AIG had another outstanding quarter, continuing the excellent trends we've experienced throughout 2021.\nIn the face of a very active catastrophe season and the persistent global pandemic, our global team of colleagues continue to perform exceptionally well, delivering value to our clients, policyholders and distribution partners.\nAdjusted after-tax income in the third quarter was $0.97 per diluted share compared to $0.81 in the same quarter last year.\nThis outcome was driven by significant improvements in general insurance profitability, very good results in life and retirement, continued expense discipline and savings from AIG 200, and execution of our capital management strategy.\nIn general insurance, global commercial drove robust top line growth.\nWe were particularly pleased with our adjusted accident year combined ratio, which improved 280 basis points year over year to 90.5%.\nThese excellent general insurance results validate our strategy to vastly improve our portfolio quality and build a top-performing culture of disciplined underwriting.\nOne data point that I believe demonstrates our incredible progress is our accident year combined ratio for the first nine months of 2021, which was 97.7%.\nThis represents a 770-basis-point improvement year over year, with 600 of that improvement coming from the loss ratio and 170 from the expense ratio.\nIn life and retirement, we again had solid results primarily driven by improved investment performance and increased call and tender income.\nThis business delivered a return on adjusted segment common equity of 12.2% for the third quarter and 14.3% for the first nine months of the year.\nWe recently achieved an important milestone in the separation process by closing the sale of a 9.9% equity stake in life and retirement to Blackstone for $2.2 billion in cash.\nWe continue to prepare the business for an IPO in 2022 and will begin moving certain assets under management to Blackstone.\nWe ended the third quarter with $5.3 billion in parent liquidity after redeeming $1.5 billion in outstanding debt and completing $1.1 billion in share repurchases.\nYear-to-date, we have reduced financial debt outstanding by $3.4 billion and have returned $2.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nWe expect to redeem or repurchase an additional $1 billion of debt in the fourth quarter and to repurchase a minimum of $900 million of common stock through year-end to complete the $2 billion of stock repurchase we announced on our last call.\nThrough these actions, we've clearly demonstrated our ongoing commitment to active and thoughtful capital management.\nNow, let me provide more detail on our business results in the third quarter.\nI will start with general insurance, where, as I mentioned earlier, growth in net premiums written continued to be very strong and we achieved our 13th consecutive quarter of improvement in the adjusted accident year combined ratio.\nAdjusting for foreign exchange, net premiums written increased 10% year over year to $6.6 billion.\nThis growth was driven by global commercial, which increased 15%, with personal insurance flat for the quarter.\nGrowth in commercial was balanced between North America and International, with North America increasing 18% and International increasing 12%.\nGrowth in North America commercial was driven by excess casualty, which increased over 50%; Lexington Wholesale, which continued to show leadership in the E&S market and grew Property and Casualty by over 30%; financial lines, which increased over 20%; and Crop Risk Services, which grew more than 50% driven by increased commodity prices.\nIn international commercial, financial lines grew 25%, Talbot had over 15% growth and Liability had over 10% growth.\nAdditionally, gross new business in global commercial grew 40% year over year to over $1 billion.\nIn North America, new business growth was more than 50% and in International, it was more than 25%.\nNorth America new business was strongest in Lexington, financial lines and retail property.\nInternational new business came mostly from financial lines and our specialty businesses.\nWe also had very strong retention in our in-force portfolio, with North America improving retention by 200 basis points and International improving retention by 700 basis points.\nStrong momentum continued with overall global commercial rate increases of 12%.\nIn many cases, this is the third year where we have achieved double-digit rate increases in our portfolio.\nNorth America commercial's overall 11% rate increases were balanced across the portfolio and led by excess casualty, which increased over 15%.\nFinancial lines, which also increased over 15% and Canada, where rates increased by 17%, representing the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit rate increases.\nInternational commercial rate increases were 13% driven by EMEA, excluding specialty, which increased by 22%.\nU.K., excluding specialty, which increased 21%.\nFinancial lines, which increased 24% and Energy, which was up 14%, its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit rate increases.\nTurning to global personal insurance.\nWe had a solid quarter that reflected a modest rebound in net premiums written in travel and warranty, offset by results in the private client group due to reinsurance cessions related to Syndicate 2019 and non-renewals in peak zones.\nShifting to underwriting profitability.\nAs I noted earlier, general insurance's accident year combined ratio ex CAT was 90.5%.\nThe third quarter saw a 150-basis-point improvement in the accident year loss ratio ex CAT and a 130-basis-point improvement in the expense ratio, all of which came from the GOE ratio.\nThese results were driven by our improved portfolio mix, achieving rate in excess of loss cost trends, continued expense discipline and benefits from AIG 200.\nGlobal commercial achieved an impressive accident year combined ratio ex CATs of 88.9%, an improvement of 290 basis points year over year and the second consecutive quarter with a sub-90% combined ratio result.\nThe accident year combined ratio ex CAT for North America commercial and international commercial were 90.5% and 86.8%, respectively, an improvement of 370 basis points and 210 basis points.\nIn global personal insurance, the accident year combined ratio ex CATs was 94.2%, an improvement of 220 basis points year over year driven by improvement in the expense ratio.\nGiven the significant progress we have made to improve our combined ratios and our view that the momentum we have will continue for the foreseeable future, we now expect to achieve a sub-90% accident year combined ratio ex CAT for full year 2022.\nAfter three years of significant underwriting margin improvement, we believe that the sub-90% accident year combined ratio ex CAT is something that not only will be achieved for full year 2022, but that there will continue to be runway for further improvement in future years.\nAs I said earlier, the third quarter was very active, with current industry estimates ranging between $45 billion and $55 billion globally.\nWe reported approximately $625 million of net global CAT losses with approximately $530 million in commercial.\nThe largest impacts were from Hurricane Ida and flooding in Europe, where we saw net CAT losses of approximately $400 million and $190 million, respectively.\nWe have put significant management focus into our reinsurance program, which continues to perform exceptionally well to reduce volatility, including strategic purchases for wind that we made in the second quarter.\nReinsurance recoveries in our International per occurrence, private client group per occurrence and other discrete reinsurance programs also reduced volatility in the third quarter.\nWe expect any fourth quarter CAT losses to be limited given that we are close to attaching on our North America aggregate cover and our aggregate cover for rest of the world, excluding Japan.\nWe have each and every loss deductibles of $75 million for North America wind, $50 million for North America earthquake and $25 million for all other North America perils and $20 million for international.\nOur worldwide retention has approximately $175 million remaining before attaching in the aggregate, which would essentially be for Japan CAT.\nSince 2012, excluding COVID, there have been 10 catastrophic events with damages surpassing $10 billion, with 9 of those occurring between 2017 and Q3 of this year.\nThe average catastrophe losses over the past 5 years have reached $114 billion, representing a 30% increase from the 10-year average and a 40% rise from the 15-year average.\nCatastrophe losses exceeded $100 billion through 2021, with $90 billion already recorded by the third quarter.\nThis marks the fourth time in five years that natural disasters have surpassed this threshold.\nThree key observations can be made.\nFirstly, while catastrophe models were generally accurate over the past two decades, this has not held true for the last five years.\nSecondly, in the past five years, models have underestimated expected values by 20% to 30% at lower return periods, with wildfire inclusion significantly increasing these figures.\nThirdly, industry losses compared to model predictions at the lower end of the curve have been insufficient, necessitating rate adjustments to reflect the substantial increase in catastrophe frequency.\nTo tackle these issues, AIG has heavily invested in its catastrophe research team to develop an independent risk assessment in this new environment.\nThis includes wind, storm surge, flood, and various other international perils.\nAIG will continue to utilize new scientific studies, improvements in vendor models, and their own claims data to refine their risk perspectives over time, ensuring appropriate pricing of catastrophe risks.\nAcross the portfolio, AIG's strategy and primary focus has been and will remain delivering risk solutions that meet client needs while aligning with their risk appetite, considering terms and conditions, strategic limit deployment, and acknowledging increased frequency and severity.\nThe significant emphasis on this critical work is reflected in AIG's financial results throughout 2021, with improving combined ratios both including and excluding catastrophes.\nTurning to life and retirement, earnings remain strong in the third quarter, supported by stable equity markets, slightly improving interest rates compared to Q2, and significant call and tender income.\nAdjusted pre-tax income for Q3 was approximately $875 million.\nIndividual retirement, excluding sold retail mutual funds, maintained upward momentum with 27% year-over-year sales growth.\nThe largest retail product, Index Annuity, saw a 50% increase compared to the same quarter last year.\nGroup retirement collectively increased deposits by 3%, with new group acquisitions ahead of the previous year but below a robust second quarter.\nManagement continues to actively address impacts from low interest rates and tighter credit spreads, with the previously provided range for expected annual spread compression remaining unchanged as third-quarter base investment spreads fell within the annual 8 to 16 basis points guidance.\nRegarding the operational separation of life and retirement, considerable progress has been made on multiple fronts.\nThe goal is to achieve a clean separation with minimal business disruption, emphasizing speed, execution, operational efficiency, and thoughtful talent allocation.\nNumerous work streams are in execution mode, including designing a target operating model for a successful stand-alone public company, separating IT systems, data centers, software applications, real estate, and material vendor contracts, and determining transition service requirements while minimizing their duration with clear exit plans.\nAn IPO is expected in Q1 2022 or potentially Q2, subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions.\nDue to the sale of the affordable housing portfolio and execution of certain tax strategies, there are no longer constraints on how much of life and retirement can be sold in an IPO.\nCurrently, AIG expects to retain over 50% interest immediately following the IPO and continue consolidating life and retirement's financial statements until ownership falls below 50%.\nThe timing of further secondary offerings will depend on market conditions and other relevant factors.\nRegarding AIG 200, the program continues to advance and remains on track to deliver $1 billion in run-rate savings across the company by the end of 2022, against a cost to achieve of $1.3 billion.\n$660 million of run-rate savings are already executed or contracted, with approximately $400 million recognized in the income statement to date.\nSimilar to the underwriting turnaround that created a culture of underwriting excellence, AIG 200 is fostering a culture of operational excellence that is becoming standard practice across AIG.\nRecently announced senior leadership changes reflect the significant progress made during the first nine months of 2021 across strategic priorities and the momentum heading towards year-end.\nMark will assume the newly created role of Global Chief Actuary and Head of Portfolio Management for AIG on January 1, leveraging his critical role in repositioning AIG over the past three years.\nShane Fitzsimons will take over as Chief Financial Officer on January 1, bringing strong leadership that has accelerated aspects of AIG 200 and instilled discipline in finance transformation, strategic planning, budgeting, and forecasting processes.\nElias Habayeb has been named Chief Financial Officer of life and retirement, bringing deep expertise about AIG and ensuring a seamless transition.\nOverall, management is pleased with the team, third-quarter results, and the tremendous progress being made across AIG.\nThe strong adjusted earnings of $0.97 per share and profitable general insurance calendar quarter combined ratio of 99.7% including catastrophes are particularly noteworthy.\nYear-over-year adjusted earnings per share improvement was driven by a 750-basis-point reduction in the general insurance calendar quarter combined ratio, strong growth in net premiums written and earned, and a related 280-basis-point decrease in the underlying accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes.\nLife and retirement also produced strong adjusted pre-tax income of $877 million, with a healthy adjusted ROE of 12.2%.\nThe quarter's strong operating earnings and consistent investment performance helped increase adjusted book value per share by 3% sequentially and nearly 9% compared to one year ago.\nThe strength of the balance sheet and strong liquidity position were highlights, with continued progress on leverage goals, including a GAAP debt leverage reduction of 90 basis points sequentially and 350 basis points year-over-year to 26.1%.\nIn general insurance, achieved profitable growth, demonstrable volatility reduction, and smart cycle management increase confidence in achieving the stated goal of a sub-90% accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes for full year 2022, rather than just exiting 2022.\nCurrent market conditions persist in strength and show resiliency, with AIG's global platform continuing to see rate strengthening internationally, adding to overall uplift unlike more U.S.-centric competitors.\nInternational commercial rate increases now surpass those in North America, in some areas meaningfully so.\nThese rate increases continue to outstrip loss cost trends globally across a broad range of assumptions and contribute to additional margin expansion.\nOver the three-year period from 2019 through 2021, product lines achieving cumulative rate increases near or above 100% include excess casualty (both admitted and non-admitted), property lines (both admitted and non-admitted), and financial lines.\nThese levels of tailwind are expected to continue driving earned margin expansion into the foreseeable future.\nIn the current inflationary environment, products with inflation-sensitive exposure bases act as inflation mitigants and are subject to additional audit premiums as the economy recovers.\nU.S. portfolio loss cost trends are now estimated at 4% to 5%, gravitating toward the upper end of this range.\nU.S. loss cost trends range from approximately 3.5% to 10%, depending on the line of business.\nAIG is integrating near-term inflationary impacts into rating and portfolio tools and not lowering any line of business loss cost trends, as lighter claims reporting may be misconstrued due to COVID-19 societal impacts.\nAll North America commercial lines loss cost trends, except for workers' compensation, are materially lower than corresponding rate increases.\nThe strong market and significant underwriting transformation at AIG have driven other aspects of the portfolio affecting loss ratios, with cumulative rate changes substantially outpacing cumulative loss cost trends in many lines and classes of business.\nThese factors result in significantly lower loss ratio estimates between 2018 and 2021.\nTypically, external discussions on this topic end prematurely.\nIn actuality, this is just the beginning of a more comprehensive analysis.\nSeveral other elements can substantially improve the profitability of underlying businesses, including: contract terms and conditions, which can be as impactful as pricing; a more balanced distribution of insured risk quality, enhancing rate adequacy and reducing adverse selection; strategic allocation of capacity across insurance layers, leading to preferred positioning and client retention; and reinsurance that reduces volatility and net losses.\nEven modest positive impacts from each of these factors would further reduce the 2021 projected loss ratio beyond what rate versus loss trend alone would indicate.\nThese effects are real and currently occurring.\nThere are at least four reasons why insurers book product lines at this implied profitability level.\nInsurers take on varied risks from others, with exposures changing yearly, making precise on-level projections difficult.\nMost policies are occurrence-based, allowing for challenges to policy language for years or decades, potentially including novel liability claims.\nMany lines are highly volatile, even with perfect underwriting.\nSetting an overly optimistic initial loss ratio increases the likelihood of future unfavorable development.\nThese issues necessitate caution when establishing initial loss ratio estimates for most commercial insurance lines.\nWe will now discuss our third quarter reserve review.\nThis quarter, we reviewed approximately $42 billion in reserves, bringing the year-to-date total to about 90% of carried pre-ADC reserves.\nI'll explain the results of our quarterly reserve analysis, which showed minimal net change, confirming our strong overall reserve position.\nPrior-year development was $153 million favorable on a pre-ADC basis, $3 million favorable post-ADC, and $50 million favorable when including the $47 million ADC amortization on the deferred gain.\nThis indicates our reserves remain adequate, with balanced favorable and unfavorable development across business lines, resulting in an improved yet neutral reserve alignment.\nBefore examining the quarter by segment, let's remove some distracting elements to focus on the core details.\nThis quarter's reserve analysis should be viewed as conducting all scheduled product reviews, then overlaying two seemingly unrelated impacts from a large subrogation recovery for the 2017 and 2018 California wildfires.\nThe subrogation recovery directly reduced North America personal insurance reserves by $326 million and required reversing a previously recorded $206 million reinsurance recovery in North America commercial Insurance, as the attachment point was no longer reached.\nThese subrogation recovery impacts resulted in $120 million of net favorable development.\nExcluding these impacts, the total general insurance prior year development was $70 million unfavorable, rather than the $50 million favorable mentioned earlier.\nThis provides a better framework for discussing the underlying reserve movements this quarter.\nThe $70 million global unfavorable development comprises $85 million unfavorable in global catastrophe losses and $50 million favorable in global non-catastrophe or attritional losses.\nThe $85 million unfavorable catastrophe development stems from minor adjustments to multiple 2019 and 2020 events.\nThe $15 million non-catastrophe favorable development results from $255 million unfavorable in global commercial offset by $270 million favorable development, mainly from short-tail personal lines in the 2020 accident year, predominantly in our International book.\nIn line with our reserving philosophy, we are cautious about reacting to this $270 million favorable indication until the accident year matures further.\nNorth America commercial experienced $112 million unfavorable development, driven by approximately $400 million strengthening in financial lines, offset by favorable development in other lines, led by workers' compensation with about $200 million from accident years 2015 and prior, and roughly $100 million across various other units.\nNorth America financial lines were negatively impacted by primary public D&O, mainly in complex national accounts and private not-for-profit D&O, as well as some excess coverage mostly in public D&O, with 90% coming from accident years 2016 to 2018.\nInternational commercial had $143 million unfavorable development, including financial lines strengthening of about $300 million in D&O and professional indemnity, primarily in the UK and Europe, but with more dispersed accident year impacts.\nFavorable development was led by specialty businesses at roughly $110 million, with an additional $50 million from various lines and regions.\nAs Peter mentioned, our recent changes to underwriting culture and risk appetite, combined with strong market conditions, are now reflected in our financial results.\nU.S. financial lines, through careful underwriting and risk selection, has significantly reduced exposure to securities class actions (SCAs) in recent years.\nThis underwriting shift is evident in the proportion of SCAs covered by U.S. operations, decreasing from 42% of all U.S. federal security class actions in 2017 to just 14% through nine months of 2021.\nThis is significant as 60% to 70% of public D&O loss dollars historically come from SCAs.\nThe North America private not-for-profit D&O book has also undergone substantial transformation.\nThe policy retention rate between 2018 and 2021 is just 15%, while cumulative rate increases over the same period are nearly 130%.\nThis intentional shift in risk selection criteria from large private companies and nonprofit universities and hospitals to a more balanced middle market book will drive substantial profitability improvements.\nInternational financial lines has implemented similar underwriting actions with comparable three-year cumulative rate increases and unified global underwriting authority for U.S.-listed D&O exposure through collaboration with the U.S. Chief Underwriting Office.\nIn summary, our reserving approach remains prudent and conservative.\nThis is demonstrated by our gradual recognition of attritional improvements in short-tail lines from accident year 2020 and the decision to strengthen Financial Line reserves, despite interpretive challenges from a difficult claims environment, recent changes in internal claims operations, and potential COVID-19 impacts on claim reporting patterns.\nThese underwriting actions over recent years bolster our confidence in our overall reserve position across both prior and current accident years.\nRegarding life and retirement, the year-to-date ROE has been a strong 14.3% compared to 12.8% in the first nine months of last year.\nThird quarter APTI saw higher net investment income and fee income, offset by the unfavorable impact of the annual actuarial assumption update, which reduced ROE by about 250 basis points annually and earnings per share by $0.15.\nThe main impact was in Individual retirement, associated with fixed annuity spread compression.\nLife insurance reflected a slightly elevated COVID-19-related mortality provision, but our exposure sensitivity of $65 million to $75 million per 100,000 population deaths proved accurate based on reported third quarter COVID-related deaths in the U.S.\nNon-COVID-19 mortality was also slightly elevated in the period.\nIn Individual retirement, excluding Retail Mutual Funds, net flows were positive $250 million this quarter, compared to net outflows of $110 million in the prior-year quarter, largely due to recovery from COVID-19-related sales disruptions.\nPreviously communicated sensitivities to yield and equity market movements affecting APTI remain valid.\nNew business margins generally remain within our targets at current new money returns due to active product management and disciplined pricing.\nIn other operations, the adjusted pre-tax loss before consolidations and eliminations was $370 million, $2 million higher than the prior-year quarter, driven by higher corporate GOE primarily from increased performance-based employee compensation, partially offset by higher investment income and lower corporate interest expense from year-to-date debt redemption activity.\nOverall net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.3 billion, a $78 million increase from the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting higher private equity gains.\nLife and retirement benefited most due to asset growth, higher call and tender income, and strong private equity returns.\nGeneral insurance's NII declined about 6% year-over-year due to continued yield compression and underperformance in hedge fund positions.\nGeneral insurance has a higher percentage allocation to private equity and hedge funds, which may change in the future.\nRegarding share count, our average total diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 864 million, and we repurchased approximately 20 million shares.\nThe end-of-period outstanding shares for book value per share purposes was about 836 million, expected to be around 820 million at year-end 2021, depending on share price performance and additional share repurchases.\nLastly, our primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well-capitalized, with general insurance's U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for the third quarter estimated between 450% and 460%, and the life and retirement U.S. fleet estimated between 440% and 450%, both above our target ranges.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:In the second quarter of 2020, our consolidated earnings were $0.26 per diluted share, a decrease from $0.38 in the same period of 2019.\nThe year-to-date consolidated earnings for 2020 stood at $0.98 per diluted share, compared to $2.14 in the previous year.\nI will now hand over the conversation to Dennis.\nWe sincerely hope everyone is maintaining their health and safety during these challenging times.\nIt's surprising to realize that we've been dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic for five months already.\nI continue to be motivated daily by our employees' unified efforts in responding to the crisis on all fronts.\nI'm extremely proud of our organization's vigilance and adaptability to rapidly changing policies and procedures in the states we operate in.\nI value their endurance, determination, and professionalism as we collectively navigate this unprecedented situation to establish a new normal, all while continuing to provide essential energy to our customers.\nOur highest priority remains safeguarding the wellbeing of our customers, employees, contractors, and communities.\nAs regional economies in our service areas experience uneven recovery, we're doing our utmost to assist struggling customers.\nRecently, the Avista Foundation distributed over $500,000 to support 37 organizations across our service area.\nIn total, our foundation has provided more than $1.5 million in aid so far this year.\nDespite most of our employees working remotely, we've maintained our ability to complete crucial tasks across our operations.\nWildfires remain a significant concern for our industry and company, particularly during this season.\nPrior to the wildfire season, we improved our 10-year wildfire resilience plan to enhance our existing measures for preventing, mitigating, and reducing wildfire impacts, aiming to minimize potential fires and related service interruptions.\nOur team developed this plan over the past year through internal workshops, industry research, and collaboration with state and local fire agencies.\nThe plan focuses on key areas including grid fortification, vegetation control, situational awareness, operations and emergency response, and worker and public safety.\nWe anticipate spending approximately $330 million to implement the plan's components over its 10-year duration.\nWe're eagerly anticipating the completion of construction on the Catalyst Building and the Scott Morris Center for Energy Innovation.\nWe're excited for the buildings to open next month, realizing Scott Morris' vision of creating the world's five smartest blocks.\nThis will allow Avista to continue innovating and testing new ideas about energy sharing in a shared economy model.\nOur findings could potentially shape the future grid's operation and provide a revolutionary new model for the entire utility industry.\nLast year, we set a goal to provide our customers with 100% clean electricity by 2045 and 100% carbon-neutral resources by 2027.\nIn line with this goal and our 2020 Integrated Resource Plan, we are inviting proposals from renewable energy project developers capable of constructing, owning, and operating up to 120 average megawatts.\nWe aim to acquire the production from renewable energy sources, encompassing power, capacity, and related environmental benefits.\nThis will enable us to reduce our reliance on market purchases and fossil fuel-based generation, which is crucial for achieving our objectives.\nRegarding performance, our Q2 consolidated earnings met expectations, and we're progressing well towards meeting our 2020 earnings projections for Avista Utilities, AEL&P, and our other ventures.\nTherefore, we are reaffirming our 2020 consolidated earnings guidance range of $1.75 to $1.95 per diluted share.\nTo conclude, one final note.\nOur Senior VP, Chief Legal Counsel, and Corporate Secretary, Marian Durkin, retired on August 1.\nThroughout her time with us, Marian identified our business requirements and established our legal department from scratch, developing it into the strong team it is today.\nAs compliance has become increasingly important across various sectors, Marian also consolidated the company's compliance efforts and elevated our compliance department significantly.\nAdditionally, under Marian's guidance, Avista was recently recognized as one of Ethisphere's World's Most Ethical Companies.\nI have some exciting information to share.\nI'm thrilled about this.\nDue to the pandemic, the Blackhawks qualified for the playoffs and are currently tied 1-1 with Edmonton, with a game scheduled for tonight.\nFor those on the East Coast, it's a late 10:30 game, but I encourage you to stay up and cheer for my Blackhawks.\nIn Q2 2020, Avista Utilities contributed $0.26 per diluted share, down from $0.32 in 2019.\nThe decrease in earnings compared to Q2 2019 was due to lower electric utility margin resulting from higher power supply costs and reduced loads related to COVID-19, partially offset by rate relief and customer growth.\nWe also experienced lower operating expenses in Q2 2020.\nThe Energy Recovery Mechanism in Washington provided a small benefit of $0.4 million this year, compared to a larger benefit of $6 million in 2019.\nYear-to-date, we recognized a pre-tax benefit of $5.6 million in 2020, compared to $3.5 million in 2019, all related to the ERM.\nRegarding COVID-19 impacts on our results, we recorded an additional $3.3 million in bad debt expense year-to-date and anticipate the total incremental amount to be $5.7 million for the full year, including the first half, compared to our initial forecast.\nIn July, the Idaho Commission issued an order allowing us to defer certain costs, net of any decreased costs and other benefits related to COVID-19.\nIn Q2, we deferred $1.1 million of bad debt expense associated with this order.\nCompared to normal, Q2 saw a decrease of about 6% in overall electric loads, with approximately 10% decrease in commercial and 14% decrease in industrial, partially offset by a 4% increase in residential loads.\nThese load decreases reduced earnings by about $0.03 in Q2, and we expect continued lower loads for most of the year, with a gradual recovery towards year-end.\nWe anticipate offsetting most of the lower utility margin through cost management efforts, which is reflected in our consolidated guidance.\nA gradual economic recovery is anticipated, but unemployment is expected to remain high, suppressing load and customer growth into 2021.\nRegulatory mechanisms, including decoupling, help alleviate the impact of load changes on our revenues for residential and certain commercial customers.\nRegulatory mechanisms cover more than 90% of our utility revenue.\nIn the second quarter, we experienced supply chain delays due to COVID-19, ranging from two to six weeks in some instances.\nWe don't anticipate these delays to significantly affect our planned projects, and we remain committed to investing in our utility infrastructure, with expected spending of about $405 million in 2020.\nAs of June 30, we had $160 million available under our $400 million credit line and $100 million in cash from a term loan.\nWe extended our credit line agreement by one year to April 2022 during the second quarter.\nThis year, we plan to issue approximately $165 million in long-term debt and up to $70 million in equity, including $24 million issued through June.\nWe are reaffirming our 2020 guidance with a consolidated range of $1.75 to $1.95.\nAt Avista Utilities, we expect the COVID-19 impacts of increased operating expenses, bad debt, reduced industrial loads, and higher interest to be largely offset by anticipated tax benefits from the CARES Act and implemented cost reduction measures.\nWe have requested deferred accounting treatment in all of our jurisdictions.\nThe Idaho Commission has allowed us to defer certain COVID-19 related costs, net of any decreased costs and other benefits, with recovery subject to future determination of appropriateness and prudency.\nRegulatory lag is expected to continue until 2023, with rate cases filed in Oregon in March 2020 and planned for Washington and Idaho in the fourth quarter of this year.\nAfter 2023, we anticipate long-term earnings growth of 4% to 6%.\nRegarding specific segment ranges:\nAvista Utilities is expected to contribute between $1.77 and $1.89 per diluted share.\nThe midpoint of our range excludes any ERM expense or benefit, but we currently expect a benefit in the 90/10 sharing band, adding $0.06 per diluted share.\nOur Avista Utilities outlook assumes normal precipitation, temperatures, and hydroelectric generation for the rest of the year, along with implemented cost reduction measures to mitigate COVID-19 related expenses.\nAEL&P is projected to contribute between $0.07 and $0.11 per share in 2020, assuming normal precipitation and hydroelectric generation for the remainder of the year.\nOther businesses are expected to incur a loss between $0.09 and $0.05 per diluted share.\nOur guidance typically includes only normal operating conditions and excludes unusual items like settlement transactions or acquisitions and dispositions until their effects are known and certain.\nThe duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be predicted.\nMore severe and prolonged economic restrictions and business disruptions will have a greater impact on our operations, results, financial condition, and cash flows.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Joining me for today's call are our Chief Executive Officer, Vic Grizzle, and our Chief Financial Officer, Brian MacNeal.\nResults may vary significantly from projections or expectations.\nYou can find both on our company's website.\nI'm pleased to be here today to discuss our first quarter performance.\nWe've had a strong beginning to what we anticipate will be a year of significant growth for Armstrong.\nThroughout the quarter, we continued to observe gradual improvement and recovery in our markets.\nOur company-wide daily shipping rates showed progressive improvement, gaining momentum towards the quarter's end and continuing to accelerate into April.\nThis quarter's comparison is against the last period of pre-pandemic market conditions, as COVID-19 had minimal impact on our base period.\nIn the first quarter of 2021, adjusted revenue reached $253 million, a 2% increase from the previous year, propelled by sales from our 2020 acquisitions, which more than compensated for pandemic-related volume decreases in our core business.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $85 million showed a 12% decrease from last year, affected by COVID-related volume reductions, ongoing investments in growth strategies, and the reinstatement of spending that was postponed when the pandemic began.\nThe Mineral Fiber division has begun the year as anticipated.\nOur Mineral Fiber daily shipping rate demonstrated its third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement as people return to workplaces and markets continue to reopen.\nPricing on comparable products surpassed input cost inflation, product mix improved with premium offerings outperforming other product lines, and channel mix remained a challenge, though less pronounced, due to relatively strong sales in the lower-priced home center channel.\nThe channel mix issues experienced during the pandemic have already begun to diminish and are not expected to be a hindrance moving forward.\nThe regional mix challenges we faced in recent quarters have lessened as New York City and the other six major metropolitan areas we've highlighted are now performing similarly to the rest of the country.\nIn terms of operations, our Mineral Fiber plants performed well, maintaining solid productivity despite challenges posed by winter storms.\nOur WAVE joint venture also performed admirably, successfully pricing ahead of rising steel costs to deliver strong first-quarter results.\nOur architectural specialty business achieved impressive top-line growth of 25% compared to the same quarter last year, driven once again by our 2020 acquisitions of Turf, Moz, and Arktura.\nA notable highlight of the quarter was the acceleration in order intake, with sequential organic order intake reaching record levels, resulting in a stronger-than-anticipated backlog.\nWe continue to be encouraged by our success rate on projects and our ability to differentiate our offerings from competitors.\nGiven our robust backlog, we remain confident in achieving our 2021 sales projection of over 30% growth.\nDuring the quarter, we maintained our investment in architectural specialties to further enhance our capabilities and capacity, supporting our expectation of continued strong growth in this segment.\nThe integration of our three new acquisitions is progressing well, and I remain excited about the potential for incorporating their technology and design capabilities across the Armstrong platform.\nOur acquisition pipeline is robust and continues to expand, and we possess the financial resources, liquidity, and willingness to execute additional acquisitions and partnerships.\nRegarding the overall macroeconomic environment and market conditions, markets have improved and are showing signs of gaining momentum.\nI am encouraged by the trends we're observing in the data and by the tone of conversations with our customers and distribution partners.\nBidding activity continued to improve throughout the quarter, and more projects delayed last year are being reactivated.\nGDP estimates are being revised upward, which is a positive leading indicator for increased renovation activity.\nCEO confidence is rising and return-to-office statistics are improving, signaling a desire and expectation for market recovery.\nThere's a strong desire to bring students and teachers back to classrooms where they can be most productive, and to reunite work teams for effective collaboration, innovation, and networking.\nThese trends, along with the potential for trillions of dollars in government infrastructure spending, including funds specifically earmarked for school renovations, are fostering greater optimism and a more favorable economic backdrop.\nAlongside the stronger economic outlook, inflationary pressures are intensifying.\nThe raw material most affected in our operations thus far has been steel, used primarily in our WAVE joint venture for manufacturing suspension systems.\nConsequently, starting in December, we have implemented five price increases totaling over 40%.\nThis has been a challenging task for both our sales teams and distribution partners to manage, but they have performed well, as evidenced by WAVE's first-quarter results.\nWe are also experiencing rising input and freight costs in our Mineral Fiber and Architectural Specialties segments.\nAs a result, we have announced a larger-than-usual 10% price increase on Mineral Fiber products and moved the effective date up to May, earlier than normal.\nThis is in addition to the 7% increase implemented in February.\nIn Architectural Specialties, we have also raised prices on standard products and are adjusting our quoting processes for custom projects.\nWith these actions, I remain confident that we will once again achieve like-for-like price realization greater than input cost inflation.\nOverall, both segments are operating at a high level.\nFortunately, we have not experienced any supply chain disruptions, allowing for outstanding service levels.\nThanks to our recent digitalization initiatives, we are maintaining closer connections with our customers and partners than ever before, supporting a strong project backlog position.\nOur teams are effectively implementing pricing strategies to combat inflation.\nGiven our strong operational status, positive first quarter results, and market expectations for the rest of the year, we are maintaining the full-year 2021 guidance provided in February.\nI will discuss our first quarter 2021 results and our full-year forecast.\nWe'll start with our consolidated first quarter results on Slide 4.\nAdjusted sales increased by 2% compared to last year, reaching $253 million.\nThese adjusted sales include roughly $700,000 in purchase accounting adjustments related to our acquisitions in 2020.\nThis adjustment will not be applied in future quarters.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by 12% and EBITDA margins reduced by 520 basis points.\nThis reduction was anticipated due to ongoing pressure from COVID-related demand decreases, continued investments in growth initiatives, and the reinstatement of costs that were temporarily cut last year.\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that when examining our adjusted EBITDA reconciliation in the appendix on slide 12, Q1 2020 earnings as reported were significantly affected by our Q1 pension annuitization.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.84 were 23% lower than the previous year's results.\nThis figure includes $6 million or $0.09 of amortization expense related to our 2020 acquisitions.\nAdjusted free cash flow decreased by $13 million compared to the previous year.\nOur financial position remains robust, ending the quarter with $397 million in available liquidity, including $122 million in cash and $275 million available on our revolving credit facility.\nAlthough net debt of $587 million was $43 million higher than Q1 2020, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.9 times, calculated under our credit agreement terms, remains well below our covenant threshold of 3.75 times.\nWe have significant flexibility in this measure.\nWe repurchased 126,000 shares for $10 million at an average price of $79.60 per share in the second quarter.\nSince the start of our repurchase program in 2016, we have bought back 9.9 million shares at a cost of $616 million, averaging $62.57 per share.\nWe currently have $584 million remaining in our repurchase program, which ends in December 2023.\nSlide 5 outlines our Mineral Fiber segment results.\nSales decreased by 5% compared to last year due to COVID's impact.\nMineral Fiber shipments ended the quarter positively, with March shipments matching the previous year on a rate-per-day basis.\nAs of Friday, April's month-to-date daily ship rate has increased by 58% compared to last year and surpasses 2019 levels.\nPositive like-for-like pricing and favorable product mix continued, but channel mix negatively impacted the fall-through rate this quarter.\nWe expect this to be the final quarter affected by this channel mix fall-through rate issue.\nMineral Fiber segment adjusted EBITDA declined by 10% due to COVID-related volume decreases, increased SG&A spending to support growth investments, and the reinstatement of temporary cost reductions from 2020.\nThe Mineral Fiber plants performed well, generating productivity that improved the bottom line.\nInput cost inflation was temporarily offset by inventory valuations, but inflation is clearly increasing and driving our proactive pricing actions.\nWAVE has been implementing price increases ahead of rising steel costs.\nTurning to our Architectural Specialties (AS) segment on Slide 6.\nAdjusted sales grew by 25% compared to last year, reaching $13 million as the 2020 acquisitions of Turf, Moz, and Arktura contributed $17 million in the quarter, more than compensating for the $4 million organic sales decline due to COVID.\nEBITDA for our AS segment decreased by $3 million as EBITDA contributions from the 2020 acquisitions were outweighed by AS organic performance.\nSales for our AS organic business remain inconsistent as projects were delayed beyond the first quarter, and we made growth investments in both capacity and capability to support our top-line expectations for AS.\nWe remain confident in our sales guidance for the AS business due to the positive trajectory of order intake in the first quarter.\nAs sales increase throughout the year, we anticipate EBITDA margins will improve.\nSlide 7 illustrates the factors influencing our consolidated adjusted EBITDA results for the quarter, including a breakdown of the impact from our 2020 acquisitions.\nSales from our acquisitions essentially balanced out organic volume declines.\nAUV positively contributed, driven by like-for-like pricing in the Mineral Fiber segment, but was offset by higher SG&A expenses.\nSlide 8 displays adjusted free cash flow performance for the quarter compared to the first quarter of 2020.\nCash flow from operations decreased by $13 million due to lower earnings.\nIt's important to note that the first quarter typically has the weakest free cash flow generation as we build inventory to meet strong summer demand.\nWe remain confident in our ability to achieve the 19% free cash flow margin we've projected for the year.\nThe ninth slide provides a summary of our projections for 2021.\nWe are maintaining our forecast of 10% to 13% sales growth, 9% to 13% adjusted EBITDA increase, 5% to 15% rise in adjusted earnings per share, and a free cash flow yield of 19%.\nThe beginning of April has been promising, and we are hopeful about the emerging trends for the second quarter.\nIt's premature to modify our yearly forecast, and we will offer an updated guidance in July when we have more information.\nSlide 10 reconfirms the expected sales pattern for 2021.\nWe don't usually share this information as our seasonal trends are typically consistent year after year.\nHowever, due to the disruptions in 2020, the year-over-year sales pattern will be unusual in 2021, so we've included this information to provide more insight.\nTo sum up, I remain optimistic about the prospects for 2021, with improving health and economic conditions, an evolving range of healthy spaces products, and new digital tools and capabilities, Armstrong is in a strong position to enhance our value creation model in 2021.\nBefore we move to the Q&A session, I'd like to discuss a few key initiatives in the company, specifically ESG, Healthy Spaces, and our new digital platform Kanopi by Armstrong.\nIn our previous call, I mentioned that ESG would be a priority for us in 2021 and beyond.\nAs we expand our history of community involvement and corporate responsibility, it's becoming increasingly important to all our stakeholders and aligns well with our mission, history, culture, and strategy.\nAs many of you have noticed, we recently launched a redesigned sustainability section on our website that highlights our three focus areas: People, planet, and product, and establishes our 2030 goals in these areas.\nFurthermore, work is progressing and on schedule to complete our first sustainability report this summer.\nThis comprehensive report will address the requirements of GRI, SASB, and TCFD.\nGiven the significance of this work, I want to acknowledge the considerable effort and dedication of our teams in documenting our achievements so far, establishing a baseline for improvement, and developing meaningful long-term goals.\nWe will provide more updates on this important initiative as we progress, which aligns well with our strategic focus on Healthy Spaces.\nAs Healthy Spaces continues to be a key factor in economic recovery, ceilings are becoming increasingly important.\nAs the finishing element of an interior space, ceilings play a crucial role in managing air flow, providing optimal ventilation, and delivering acoustic performance and design aesthetics.\nThese trends are revitalizing the ceiling category and making it more relevant for current and future healthy indoor space needs.\nThis development is particularly favorable for Armstrong.\nAs the long-standing category leader, Armstrong is gaining recognition as a thought leader on the importance of comprehensive space planning, design, and construction, and the impact this approach can have on people's confidence and well-being while indoors, where we spend most of our time.\nWe believe that our growth investments in 2020 will yield results in 2021, with gains from new Healthy Spaces solutions and our new digital capabilities.\nOur product innovations are well-aligned with post-pandemic market demands.\nHealthy Spaces is not just a temporary trend, but a lasting change.\nWhile Healthy Spaces has always been important, the pandemic has permanently altered our definition of health and our expectations for indoor spaces.\nArchitects, designers, facility managers, and business owners are seeking solutions to bring people back into commercial spaces and make them more suitable for future use.\nAs offices reduce density and large collaborative spaces become the norm, the need for acoustic performance in ceilings will increase, along with the need for improved cleaning and air flow management.\nCeilings are central to providing these solutions.\nOur 24/7 Defend product line, including AirAssure, CleanAssure, and VidaShield ceiling solutions, is specifically designed to improve air quality and ventilation sustainably.\nIt's encouraging that despite being launched just five months ago, 24/7 Defend products have been sold across all our core sectors: office, education, healthcare, retail, and transportation.\nThis clearly demonstrates the wide-ranging potential for Healthy Spaces.\nThese product innovations, timed for the Healthy Spaces trend, combined with our new digital platform Kanopi by Armstrong, position Armstrong well to capitalize on the evolving market recovery opportunity.\nLaunched earlier this year, Kanopi by Armstrong (with a lowercase 'k') is available online at kanopibyarmstrong.com.\nKanopi uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide early access and enhanced visibility to a large portion of the market opportunity that we previously couldn't efficiently track.\nThis technology allows us to influence Armstrong solutions and simplifies the purchasing process.\nKanopi offers facility owners and managers a comprehensive solution, including diagnostic tools, consulting, and pre-certified installation services.\nUser-friendly and supported by our top-tier distribution network, Kanopi is tapping into pent-up renovation demand in smaller commercial spaces and driving Mineral Fiber volume growth.\nInitial results are promising.\nWe are seeing growth across all key metrics: website traffic, orders, order value, and sales.\nEach month has significantly outperformed the previous one, and I expect this trend to continue throughout the year.\nOnce again, we are encouraged by the improving market conditions and the increasing relevance of the ceiling category.\nWe are particularly excited about the upcoming market opportunities that Armstrong is well-positioned to capture, enabling us to fulfill our commitment to deliver strong results for our shareholders and our mission to make a positive impact by creating healthier spaces where we live, work, learn, heal, and play.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Scott Oaksmith, Senior Vice President of Real Estate and Finance, will be accompanying them.\nWe are grateful for your participation.\nI'm happy to announce that Choice Hotels continued to achieve impressive RevPAR growth in the third quarter, significantly outperforming the industry.\nWe continue to increase our market share across all segments we operate in.\nBased on these performance trends, we anticipate exceeding 2019 RevPAR and adjusted EBITDA levels for the full year 2021.\nBy consistently executing our long-term strategy, we have positioned Choice Hotels to capitalize on post-pandemic trends favoring leisure travel, limited service hotels, and extended stays.\nMoreover, our business traveler demand has recovered to levels comparable to the third quarter of 2019.\nThe third quarter was outstanding, marking our strongest quarter of the year.\nOur RevPAR grew by 11.4% compared to the third quarter of 2019, surpassing our previous quarterly RevPAR projections.\nIn fact, RevPAR has exceeded 2019 levels for five consecutive months, with this trend continuing into the fourth quarter.\nFor more than 18 months, we've maintained significantly higher RevPAR index share gains against competitors compared to 2019.\nThis trend continued in the third quarter, with our RevPAR index increasing by nearly four percentage points compared to 2019 versus local competitors, reflecting ongoing growth in both weekday and weekend RevPAR index as reported by STR.\nChoice's ability to continue gaining market share even as the broader industry recovers demonstrates that our strategic investments are yielding results and gives us greater confidence in our future revenue trajectory.\nDue to our strategic investments before and during the pandemic, we are better positioned today to capitalize on significant growth opportunities in the long term, which we expect will create value and elevate our performance to new heights.\nThe most impressive aspect is our continued strong performance through both rate improvement and occupancy share gains.\nChoice's average daily rate growth has outpaced the industry in the third quarter, thanks to our new revenue management tool and expanded capabilities.\nAdditionally, our comprehensive merchandising strategy has enabled us to achieve occupancy share gains compared to local competitors.\nWe continue to make substantial investments that are improving our owners' performance and contributing to our brand's superior results.\nEarlier this year, we introduced a new revenue management capability designed to enhance our franchise owners' ability to effectively drive top-line revenue.\nThis tool represents a significant improvement that we were able to provide to our franchisees at a crucial point in the recovery.\nAs the first mobile-enabled revenue management app, it allows our franchisees to more effectively manage their channels, rates, and inventory by adapting to local market trends in real-time through repricing and competitive rate shopping multiple times daily, from virtually anywhere.\nThis enhanced capability has contributed to Choice gaining significant RevPAR index share, specifically driving average daily rate index gains versus local competitors, and we expect this trend to continue.\nThe acceptance rate of pricing recommendations by our franchisees has been significantly higher than with our previous tool, demonstrating our owners' confidence in the solutions we provide.\nThis tool, combined with expert advice from our experienced revenue management consultants, is helping our franchise owners swiftly execute the right pricing strategy, which is particularly important in an inflationary environment.\nSimultaneously, we continue to improve unit economics for our franchisees, focusing on investments like housekeeping upon request that reduce their ownership costs while driving continued performance improvements.\nRecently, we deployed a new digital registration capability integrated with our property management system.\nThis cost-effective cloud-based solution is designed to streamline the hotel registration process for front desk staff, reduce labor costs, expedite check-in, and enhance our guests' overall experience.\nFurthermore, our recent brand investments are designed to appeal to future guests while providing a compelling return on investment for our franchisees.\nA few weeks ago, we introduced a new Cambria hotel prototype option designed for secondary and leisure markets.\nWe're excited about Cambria's future growth potential, as we expect this prototype will allow developers the flexibility to build at a lower cost, expanding the markets available for growth while maintaining our design-forward experience.\nI will now provide a brief update on our key segments, where 11 out of our 12 brands achieved RevPAR index gains versus their local competitors in the third quarter compared to 2019.\nOur strategic investments in the extended-stay segment have allowed us to quadruple the portfolio size over the past five years, reaching 467 domestic units with a domestic pipeline of nearly 310 hotels.\nThis segment, a significant growth engine for the company, expanded by over 45 hotels in the third quarter year-over-year and now represents over 10% of our total domestic rooms.\nIn addition to strong unit growth, we've also driven impressive RevPAR growth across our extended stay brands.\nSpecifically, when compared to the third quarter of 2019, our extended-stay portfolio grew RevPAR by over 18%, driven by occupancy levels of 82% and a 9% increase in average daily rate.\nThis outperformed the industry's RevPAR change by over 20 percentage points.\nThe WoodSpring Suites brand celebrated a key milestone with the recent opening of its 300th hotel.\nThe brand's pipeline expanded by over 20% year-over-year as of the end of September, reaching nearly 160 domestic hotels, further demonstrating developer demand for this brand due to its cycle resilience.\nWe expect that WoodSpring's robust pipeline will provide a strong platform for future brand growth.\nOverall, we are pleased with the significant increase in developers' interest in extended stay projects.\nIn the third quarter, we executed two dozen extended-stay domestic franchise agreements, an 85% increase year-over-year and a 20% increase compared to 2019 levels.\nAdditionally, the first hotel for our newest extended-stay brand, Everhome Suites, is currently under construction and scheduled to open next summer, with nearly 20 additional projects already in the pipeline.\nOur mid-scale brands, which represent over two-thirds of our total domestic room portfolio and approximately half of the total domestic pipeline, continued to outperform the segment's RevPAR growth.\nOur mid-scale and upper mid-scale portfolio grew RevPAR by nearly 10%, driven by average daily rate growth of over 9%, outpacing the industry's mid-scale and upper mid-scale segment growth by nearly seven percentage points when compared to the third quarter of 2019.\nOur flagship brand, Comfort, recently celebrated the highest number of conversion hotel openings since 2014, while increasing new construction agreements threefold in the third quarter year-over-year.\nThe Comfort brand's domestic unit growth exceeding 2% and RevPAR index outperformance against local rivals showcase the appeal of this iconic brand to both hotel developers and guests.\nOur upscale portfolio saw significant growth in the third quarter year-over-year, with domestic room count increasing by nearly 22%, driven by Cambria and the Ascend Hotel Collection.\nThe upscale portfolio also set a record for domestic openings in the first three quarters of the year.\nCambria continued its positive trajectory, expanding by over 9% to 58 units year-over-year, with 17 projects under active construction at September's end and five more hotels slated to open this year.\nIn August, we marked the opening of a Cambria hotel in the heart of Napa Valley, one of the world's premier wine regions.\nOur upscale portfolio improved its RevPAR index compared to local competitors and surpassed the industry's RevPAR change by 15 percentage points while raising the average daily rate by 11% compared to the third quarter of 2019.\nThis progress demonstrates the attractiveness of Choice Hotels' value proposition in the upscale segment for current and potential owners.\nThe strong performance across our entire brand portfolio confirms our strategy of growing in key segments, which we believe will further enhance the long-term revenue intensity of our system.\nRegarding demand trends, we continued to see improvements in our weekday occupancy index share during the third quarter compared to 2019.\nWe believe these share gains are partly driven by long-term consumer trends, such as remote work and increased early retirements, which give Americans more flexibility in their leisure travel timing.\nWe noticed guests extending their trips into shoulder days of the weekend, giving us optimism about future travel trends following the busy summer season.\nWe also observed a higher proportion of revenue coming from longer stays compared to 2019.\nLike our broader occupancy share gains, these weekday demand increases were achieved through our merchandising capabilities and strategy, using targeted promotions at optimal times for the right customers.\nOur investments have allowed us to capitalize on demand that historically drove our core business while attracting a larger share of leisure travelers.\nWhile our most loyal Choice Privileges members continued to spend more at our hotels during the third quarter, we also successfully appealed to new customers, increasing their revenue contribution compared to 2019 levels.\nWe see ongoing momentum in business travel trends, with potential for further growth.\nWe've witnessed sequential quarter-over-quarter increases in business travel bookings in the third quarter of 2021, with overall business performance similar to 2019 levels.\nAs a customer-focused company, Choice constantly seeks innovative ways to better serve evolving consumer needs and anticipate future guest expectations.\nWe are the first lodging company to collaborate with Bakkt, a digital asset marketplace, allowing us to offer guests more currency options and redemption methods.\nOur 50 million-plus Choice Privileges loyalty members can now convert their rewards points to cash for Bitcoin purchases, transfer points to friends, or use them online or in-store wherever Apple Pay or Google Pay is accepted.\nRegarding franchisee business delivery and brand demand, we saw growth compared to 2019 and 2020 through increased revenue contribution from choicehotels.com and other proprietary digital channels in the third quarter.\nThese channels significantly improve our owners' profitability by delivering strong rates at the lowest cost, making them a key focus for enhancing our value proposition.\nGiven our strong value proposition, it's unsurprising that Choice maintains an industry-leading franchisee voluntary retention rate and our franchise owners continue to develop our brands.\nBolstered by our compelling value proposition and record performance, we continue to see demand for new franchise contracts.\nIn the third quarter, we awarded 89 new domestic franchise agreements, a 10% increase over the same period in 2020.\nDemand for our new construction brands in the third quarter increased by over 50% year-over-year.\nWe're excited to announce that our WoodSpring brand expanded internationally in late October, entering the Canadian market with a commitment for more than 15 units from a well-known developer and operator.\nOur development team dedicated to promoting diverse ownership of Choice franchise hotels among underrepresented and minority owners has awarded 18 franchise contracts year-to-date through September, bringing the total to over 280 since the program's inception 15 years ago.\nMore than half of the 18 agreements this year were awarded to women entrepreneurs.\nThese accomplishments are due to the resilience and hard work of our dedicated associates.\nWe remain committed to investing in and supporting our associates, and we're proud to be the only hotel company recently recognized as a Best Work-life Balance Employer by Comparably.\nWe're confident in our continued ability to create value and deliver results for owners and shareholders through strategic investments, strong performance, and an award-winning culture focused on diversity, equity, and belonging.\nI'll now hand over to our CFO.\nI hope you and your families are well.\nI'll provide additional insights on our third quarter results, update you on our liquidity and capital allocation, and share our outlook for the future.\nAs discussed previously, we're comparing our financial performance and RevPAR results to 2019 for a more meaningful analysis of trends, as the prior year's quarterly results were significantly impacted by the pandemic.\nFor the third quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2019, total revenues, excluding marketing and reservation system fees, were $166.5 million, an 8% increase.\nAdjusted EBITDA rose 18% to $133.2 million, driven by improving RevPAR performance, revenue-intensive unit growth, and strong effective royalty rate growth, combined with continued cost discipline.\nOur adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 80%, a seven percentage point increase.\nAs a result, our adjusted earnings per share were $1.51 for the third quarter, a 10% increase versus 2019.\nTurning to our three key revenue levers, starting with royalty rate, which remains a significant source of our revenue growth.\nThe company's domestic effective royalty rate rose by 0.08% year-on-year to about 5% in comparison to Q3 2020.\nThis outcome demonstrates the ongoing enhancement of our value offering to franchise owners, their sustained interest in associating with our established brands, and the promising outlook of our pipeline.\nIt further confirms the validity of our long-term past, present, and future investments on behalf of our franchisees.\nWe anticipate maintaining the current growth trajectory of this factor for the entire year of 2021 and growing at our historical rate in the future as owners continue to seek Choice Hotels' proven ability to deliver strong top-line revenues that maximize return on investment while helping reduce their total ownership costs.\nOur domestic systemwide RevPAR outperformed the overall industry by 16% in Q3, showing an 11.4% increase compared to 2019.\nSpecifically, our average daily rate increased by nearly 9%, and our occupancy levels rose by almost two percentage points compared to the same quarter in 2019.\nOur Q3 results indicated that we continue to surpass the primary chain scale segments in which we compete, as reported by STR, by six percentage points compared to 2019.\nNotably, our strong RevPAR trends have persisted into Q4.\nAs we've mentioned in previous calls, we've long focused our brand strategy on driving growth across the higher value and more revenue-intensive upscale, extended-stay, and mid-scale segments.\nThe investments we've made continue to yield results, as these strategic segments have allowed us to significantly outperform the industry in RevPAR growth and achieve gains compared to our local competitors.\nAllow me to highlight a few impressive performance achievements for our brands in Q3.\nAs a reminder, we're comparing the growth figures with the same period in 2019.\nOur WoodSpring brand achieved 23% RevPAR growth, reaching an average occupancy rate of nearly 86% and experiencing an 11% increase in average daily rate.\nAscend Hotels saw their average daily rate grow by over 17% and outperformed the upscale segment's RevPAR growth by more than 20 percentage points.\nSimultaneously, the Comfort family increased RevPAR by over 8%, reflecting a 9% rise in average daily rate.\nLastly, both our Cambria and MainStay Suites brands gained 12 percentage points in RevPAR index compared to their local competitors.\nMore specifically, our average daily rate and occupancy improved from the previous quarter, and our average daily rate index and occupancy index continue to increase compared to 2019, resulting from our investments in revenue management tools for our franchisees and the merchandising capabilities and strategy we've implemented.\nOur third revenue lever is units and rooms growth, which benefits from the absolute size of our portfolio and the revenue intensity of the totals.\nTo ensure the long-term quality of our brand portfolio, we continue to terminate underperforming economy hotels at the lower end of the portfolio, as well as quality hotels that cannot maintain mid-scale brand standards.\nWe believe these actions will not only ensure an even stronger brand portfolio over time, but we also expect these targeted terminations to present an opportunity for royalty revenue growth as we plan to replace these hotels with higher quality and more revenue-intensive units.\nNevertheless, we continue to expand the overall size of our domestic franchise system.\nAcross our more revenue-intensive brands in the upscale, extended-stay, and mid-scale segments, we observed stronger unit growth, increasing the number of hotels by 2% and rooms by 2.6% year-over-year.\nOur developers are increasingly optimistic about the long-term fundamentals of the lodging industry.\nIn fact, one-third of total domestic franchise agreements awarded in Q3 were for new construction contracts, representing an increase of more than 50% compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\nAt the same time, demand for our conversion brands from January to September increased by 25% year-over-year.\nLet me share a few highlights on specific brands.\nThe Ascend Hotel Collection leads the industry as the first launch and currently the largest soft brand, expanding its domestic room count by 27% year-over-year.\nSimultaneously, Clarion Point has nearly doubled its portfolio year-over-year, ending Q3 with nearly 35 hotels open in the U.S. and 15 additional hotels awaiting conversion this year.\nOur MainStay Suites mid-scale extended-stay brand portfolio expanded to nearly 100 domestic hotels open, representing more than 30% unit growth year-over-year.\nFinally, our suburban extended stay portfolio of 70 domestic hotels open experienced 13% year-over-year unit growth.\nNow, a few words about our liquidity profile and an update on capital allocation.\nAs a result of our strong performance, the company has an even stronger liquidity position.\nSpecifically, at the end of Q3 2021, the company had over $1 billion in cash and available borrowing capacity through its revolving credit facility.\nWe are also pleased to report cash flow from operations of $142.8 million for Q3 2021, a 53% increase compared to Q3 2019.\nCurrently, our gross debt-to-EBITDA leverage levels remain at the low end of our target range of 3 to 4 times.\nAt the end of Q3 2021, our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage level was at 1.8 times.\nThese impressive results, combined with our strong liquidity and confidence in our ability to generate high levels of cash, leave us well-positioned to continue growing our business and returning excess cash flow to shareholders well into the future.\nFrom January through October, we have returned over $35 million to our shareholders in the form of cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock.\nWe will continue to monitor the environment for other investment opportunities and evaluate capital returns in the context of our leverage levels, market conditions, and our overall capital allocation strategy.\nFinally, let's discuss our expectations for the future.\nWe currently expect full-year domestic RevPAR to surpass 2019 levels and grow by approximately 1% compared to full-year 2019.\nAssuming the broader RevPAR and economic recovery trends continue, we now expect our 2021 adjusted EBITDA to exceed 2019 levels and range between $382 million and $387 million, even with planned incremental investments in Q4.\nOur view is reinforced by our Q3 results, which extend our strong year-to-date financial performance, broader macro trends, and our continued investments to support growth for the remainder of 2021 and beyond.\nWe will continue to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 across the business, and we'll provide further updates in February during our next earnings call.\nIn conclusion, we remain confident in our long-term strategic approach and resilient business model. Coupled with our disciplined capital allocation strategy and strong balance sheet, we believe these strengths will allow us to further capitalize on growth opportunities and drive outsized returns for years to come.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We'll also be covering certain non-standard financial metrics.\nToday's participants include our CEO Steve Strah, CFO Jon Taylor, and Vice Chairperson John Somerhalder.\nSeveral other executives will be available for questions later.\nOur first quarter 2021 results showed GAAP earnings of $0.62 per share and operating earnings of $0.69 per share, at the higher end of our projected range.\nAs Jon will explain, our performance reflects successful implementation of investment strategies, increased weather-adjusted residential usage, and strict control of operating costs.\nI was recently appointed as FirstEnergy's CEO and joined the Board of Directors.\nI'm grateful for the Board's confidence in me since becoming President last May and Acting CEO in October.\nI take great pride in FirstEnergy and our employees' dedication to serving customers and communities.\nI'm honored to continue leading the company through current challenges and towards long-term stability and success.\nAs we move FirstEnergy forward, I'm prioritizing employee and customer safety.\nWe're focused on embedding ethics, accountability and integrity into our culture, supported by a robust compliance program.\nWe're implementing FE Forward to maximize our potential, deliver long-term results, and increase near-term financial flexibility, while investing in infrastructure growth like electrification, grid modernization, and renewable integration for customer benefit.\nI'll provide updates on the DOJ investigation, regulatory matters, our FE Forward initiative, and other business developments.\nJohn Somerhalder will discuss the Board and management's efforts to establish a compliance culture based on the highest ethical standards.\nAs mentioned previously, we're taking decisive action to rebuild our reputation, focus on the future, and cooperate with ongoing government investigations.\nWe've initiated talks with the DOJ about resolving this matter, potentially through a deferred prosecution agreement.\nWe can't predict the timing, outcome, or impact of a possible DOJ resolution at this time.\nWe aim to take a comprehensive and transparent approach with stakeholders across all matters under review.\nThis aligns with changes we're making to our political and legislative engagement.\nWe've ceased all contributions to 501(c)(4) organizations.\nWe've suspended all other political disbursements, including from our PAC.\nWe've limited our involvement in political processes.\nWe've suspended or terminated various political consulting relationships.\nWe'll expand our disclosures on political spending for greater transparency.\nWe've committed to posting updates on our website about corporate political activity, trade association relationships, and our revised corporate political activity policy.\nA comprehensive and open approach is also central to our regulatory activities.\nIn Ohio, we're taking proactive steps to reduce regulatory uncertainty for our utilities.\nThis includes crediting Ohio utility customers about $27 million in late March.\nThis covers revenues collected through the decoupling mechanism plus interest, our partial settlement with the Ohio Attorney General to stop collecting decoupling revenues, and our decision not to seek recovery of lost distribution revenues from Ohio customers.\nThese actions fully address the requirements of Ohio House Bill 128 and the related rate impact of House Bill 6 on our customers.\nThese are important steps to move past this issue.\nIn other Ohio regulatory matters, we've updated our testimony in the ESP quadrennial review case with individual company SEET values.\nWe're in settlement discussions with interested parties on this and the consolidated 2017, 2018, and 2019 SEET cases.\nWe're engaging with regulators to refund customers for certain vendor payments in each affected jurisdiction.\nIn Ohio, at the PUCO's request, our annual Rider DCR audit has been expanded to review these payments.\nOutside Ohio, our regulatory focus is on customer-oriented initiatives supporting the transition to a cleaner climate.\nJCP&L filed a petition with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities for approval of its EV driven program.\nIf approved, this four-year, $50 million program would offer incentives and rate structures to support EV charging infrastructure development in our New Jersey service area, aiming to accelerate EV adoption and benefit residential, commercial, and industrial customers.\nThe Pennsylvania PUC approved our five-year, $390 million energy efficiency and conservation plan, supporting the PUC's consumption reduction targets.\nWe completed the sale of JCP&L's 50% stake in the Yards Creek pump-storage hydro plant, receiving $155 million in proceeds.\nWe declared our intention to divest Penelec's Waverly New York distribution assets, which cater to approximately 3,800 customers, to a local cooperative.\nThe transaction, pending regulatory approval, will streamline Penelec's operations by concentrating solely on Pennsylvania clientele.\nIn our fourth quarter briefing, we introduced FE Forward, our company-wide initiative to transform FirstEnergy into a more robust, efficient industry leader that delivers exceptional value to customers and shareholders.\nWe anticipate that the FE Forward initiatives will provide a more contemporary experience for our clients, with efficiencies in operations and capital expenditures that can be strategically reinvested into our business, supporting our growth and investments in a more intelligent and environmentally friendly electric grid, while maintaining affordable electricity rates.\nDuring the initial stage of the project, we assessed our processes, business practices, and cultural norms to identify areas for improvement.\nAlthough our safety and reliability performance is robust, we discovered opportunities in numerous areas to enhance and automate processes, adopt a more strategic approach to operating expenditures, and modernize experiences for our customers and employees.\nWe've identified over 300 opportunities and are now delving deeper into these concepts, developing detailed, executable plans as we prepare for implementation starting later this quarter.\nExamples of this work include improving planning and scheduling through system integration to enable our employees to deliver their best to our customers, utilizing advanced technologies like drones and satellite imagery to enhance our vegetation management programs, employing predictive analytics and web-based tools to offer our customers more self-service options and improve their experience, and leveraging purchasing power to optimize payment terms.\nAs part of these efforts, we plan to evaluate the appropriate timing to initiate rate cases on a state-by-state basis to best support our customer-focused strategic priorities.\nWe will also remain attentive to emerging technologies, smart grid, electric vehicle infrastructure, and our customers' evolving energy needs as we consider ways to reduce our carbon footprint.\nWe've had a strong start to the year, and yesterday we reaffirmed our 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share.\nOur leadership team is dedicated to upholding our core values and behaviors and executing our proven strategies as we prioritize our customers in everything we do.\nWe will take the necessary steps to fulfill our promise to make FirstEnergy a better company, one that is respected by our customers, investors, regulators, and employees.\nIt's an honor and a pleasure to join you today.\nI'd like to begin by sharing my impressions of FirstEnergy after nearly two months in this position.\nThis company has a solid foundation, including a commitment to improve governance and compliance, a dedication to customers by embracing innovation and technology to ensure the strength, resilience, and reliability of its transmission and distribution businesses, a deeply ingrained safety culture, and strong potential to deliver significant value to investors through customer-focused growth.\nSince joining the team, I've been supporting senior leadership in advancing the company's priorities, strengthening our governance and compliance functions, and improving our relationships with external stakeholders, including regulators and the financial community.\nSteve discussed our business priorities, so I will focus my comments today on our compliance work, including remedial actions.\nFirst, I'd like to provide an update on our internal investigation, which has uncovered no new material issues since our last earnings call.\nThe focus of the internal investigation has shifted from a proactive investigation to continued cooperation with ongoing government investigations.\nManagement and the Board, with assistance from the compliance subcommittee of the Audit Committee, have been collaborating to establish a best-in-class compliance program.\nThrough these efforts, we have identified improvement opportunities in five broad categories: governance, risk management, training and communications, concerns management, and third-party management.\nAs part of these efforts, FirstEnergy is committed to enhancing its compliance culture to be best-in-class.\nSome of the actions completed to date include hiring our Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, Hyun Park, in January; Antonio Fernandez, who joined as Vice President and Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer last week; and myself.\nOn the Board side, Jesse Lynn and Andrew Teno from Icahn Capital joined us in March.\nThe Board has also nominated a new Independent Member, Melvin Williams, for election at the Annual Shareholders Meeting when Sandy Pianalto's term ends next month.\nI believe the insights and experience of these new leaders are helping to complement a very committed and confident Board and management team.\nIn March, the Board affirmed our confidence in Steve by appointing him CEO.\nSteve has consistently demonstrated the integrity, leadership skills, strategic acumen, and deep knowledge of our businesses required to position FirstEnergy for long-term success and stability.\nThese changes, along with the Board's reinforcement of the executive team's commitment to setting the appropriate tone at the top, support a culture of compliance going forward.\nFor example, we recently held an event where the Chairman and the Chair of the Compliance subcommittee addressed the company's top 140 leaders regarding expectations to act with integrity in everything we do.\nOur legal department recently completed training on up-the-ladder reporting, and we have enhanced our onboarding process for new employees and third parties regarding expectations around our code of business conduct.\nOver the next few months, the company will take many more steps to enhance our compliance program, such as continuing to build the new, more centralized compliance organization under Antonio's leadership; addressing our processes, policies, and controls, including additional oversight for political contributions; continuing to emphasize our values and expectations in ongoing communications with our employees; incorporating compliance into our goals and performance metrics and holding all employees to the same standards regardless of title; enhancing channels for incident reporting and developing thorough and objective processes to investigate and address allegations of misconduct; and ensuring increased communications with and training of employees regarding our commitment to ethical standards and integrity of our business procedures, compliance requirements, our code of business conduct, and other company policies, as well as understanding and utilizing the process for reporting suspected violations of law or the code of business conduct.\nWe have also enhanced our internal controls around disbursements to require additional approvals, targeted reviews of any suspicious payments, and a reassessment of approval levels across the entire company.\nAdditionally, in the area of disbursements, we will update and clarify policies and procedures, conduct training, and institute a regular audit program that reviews payments and services performed.\nA detailed list of the corrective actions we are taking can be found on Pages 8 and 9 of our first quarter FactBook.\nOver the next several months, we expect to make significant progress in the areas of compliance led by Antonio's organization, which will continue to be overseen by the Board and the newly established management steering committee for Ethics and Compliance.\nThrough these efforts, we expect the material weakness associated with the tone at the top to be remediated by the time we file our fourth quarter earnings.\nOur leaders are continuing to emphasize the importance of compliance and working to regain the trust of employees and our stakeholders by modeling appropriate behavior and consistently communicating that compliance and ethics are core values, just like safety.\nWe are committed to ensuring that employees understand what is expected of them and feel comfortable reporting ethical violations without fear of repercussions.\nBy consistently stressing the significance of adhering to our plans and vision, as well as showing exemplary leadership, we aim to instill trust in our staff that the executives and directors are taking appropriate, decisive steps to advance the company.\nI'm confident that we've gained valuable insights from recent obstacles and are implementing the right measures to emerge as an improved, more resilient organization with promising prospects.\nI'll now hand over to Jon Taylor to discuss the first quarter performance and provide a financial update.\nWe've introduced new information in three key areas within our Investor FactBook.\nOur initiatives to support a more environmentally friendly and efficient power grid, additional information about our balance sheet, including our funds from operations target and the actions we're taking to reach our objectives, and enhanced disclosures on environmental, social, and governance matters.\nIt's worth mentioning that we continue to provide more comprehensive information on return on equity, including more detailed sensitivity analyses.\nWe reported GAAP earnings of $0.62 per share and operating earnings of $0.69 per share for the first quarter of 2021, with the latter being at the higher end of our projected range.\nThe 2021 GAAP results include two exceptional items: regulatory charges for customer reimbursements related to previously collected Ohio decoupling revenues and expenses linked to the ongoing investigation.\nOur distribution business results for this year's first quarter, compared to 2020, show increased residential usage on both actual and weather-adjusted bases, as well as growth from additional riders and rate increases, such as DCR and grid modernization in Ohio, the distribution system improvement charge in Pennsylvania, and the implementation of our base rate case settlement in New Jersey.\nThese positive factors were partially counterbalanced by a $0.10 per share impact due to the absence of Ohio decoupling revenues and our decision to forgo collecting lost distribution revenues from residential and commercial customers.\nOur total distribution deliveries for the first quarter of 2021 decreased by 2% on a weather-adjusted basis compared to last year, reflecting a 2% increase in residential sales as customers continued to spend more time at home, a 7% decline in commercial sales, and a 3% decrease in industrial sales.\nIt's important to note that total distribution deliveries through the first quarter align with our internal load forecast, with residential demand 2% higher than anticipated, while industrial load is 2% lower.\nIn our regulated transmission business, earnings declined due to higher net financing costs, which included an adjustment to previously capitalized interest, partially offset by the impact of rate base growth at our ATSI and MAIT subsidiaries.\nIn our corporate segment, results show lower operating expenses, offset by the absence of a first quarter 2020 pension OPEB credit related to Energy Harbor's emergence from bankruptcy, as well as higher interest expense.\nWe've had a strong start to the year and are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share for 2021.\nWe've also introduced second quarter guidance of $0.48 to $0.58 per share.\nAdditionally, our strong focus on cash management helped drive a $125 million increase in adjusted cash from operations and a $185 million increase in free cash flow compared to our internal plan for the first quarter.\nRegarding other financial updates, our 2021 debt financing plan remains on schedule.\nIn March, FirstEnergy Transmission issued $500 million in senior notes in a robust, well-supported bond offering that highlighted the strength of our transmission business.\nThe offering was oversubscribed and comparable to an investment-grade offering.\nWe used the proceeds to repay $500 million in short-term borrowings under the FET revolving credit facility.\nWe also repaid $250 million at the FirstEnergy Holding Company.\nIn April, we successfully issued $200 million in first mortgage bonds at MonPower, which also received strong support.\nThis aligns with our earlier commitment to reduce short-term borrowings and our goal to improve our credit metrics at FirstEnergy, regain investment-grade status as quickly as possible, and maintain strong credit ratings at our utilities.\nWe continue to provide regular updates to the rating agencies on our business and are collaborating with them to develop a clear outline of what's needed for FirstEnergy to regain investment-grade credit ratings.\nKey milestones include governance and compliance changes at our company, resolution of the DOJ investigation, and solid credit metrics.\nRegarding longer-term financing needs, through the execution of FE Forward, we have reduced our debt financing plan by approximately $1 billion through 2023, primarily at the FirstEnergy and FirstEnergy Transmission holding companies.\nFurthermore, as previously mentioned, equity is a crucial part of our overall financing plan, with intentions to raise up to $1.2 billion of equity over 2022 and 2023.\nAs stated before, we will adjust these plans as necessary and are exploring various alternatives to raise equity capital in a manner that could be more beneficial to all stakeholders.\nThese actions, combined with new rates at JCP&L and our 60% plus formula rate capital investment program, will generate $150 million to $200 million of incremental cash flow annually, while maintaining relatively stable adjusted debt levels through 2023, all of which will support our targeted 12% to 13% FFO to debt range.\nRegarding our pension, our funding status was 81% as of March 31, up from 78% at the end of last year, resulting in a $500 million reduction in our unfunded pension obligation, which improves our adjusted debt position with the rating agencies.\nThe extended funding timeframe permitted under the American Rescue Plan, along with the modification of interest rate stabilization rules, means that we don't anticipate any funding requirements for the foreseeable future, assuming our plan achieves a 7.5% expected return on assets.\nAlthough we plan to make contributions to the pension next year, this legislation provides us with additional discretion and flexibility to make voluntary contributions as we evaluate our capital allocation plans.\nAs Steve mentioned, discussions have begun with the Department of Justice.\nWhile no contingency has been reflected in our consolidated financial statements, we believe it's probable that we will incur a loss in connection with the resolution of this investigation.\nHowever, we cannot yet reasonably estimate the amount.\nLastly, President Biden recently introduced the American Jobs Plan, which includes a corporate tax increase and proposed minimum tax, as well as potential opportunities related to a proposed infusion into electric vehicle infrastructure and the energy grid.\nIt's clearly very early in the process, but the corporate tax provision could be slightly cash positive for us if implemented in its current form.\nOur solid first quarter results and expectations for the year reflect our strong operating fundamentals and the continued success of our strategies to modernize and enhance our distribution and transmission systems.\nAs we move our company forward, we are intensely focused on unlocking opportunities and increasing value for our shareholders, customers, and employees.\nLet's now open the call for your questions and answers.\nSummary: ",

Miller, Total Care Auto (powered by Landcar), Kahlo Chrysler Jeep Dodge, Arapahoe Hyundai-Genesis, and the Stevinson Automotive Group, collectively representing about $6.6 billion in yearly revenue.\nThese purchases involve the appropriate brands in expanding markets and align with Asbury's corporate culture.\nWe anticipate leveraging our combined capabilities and expanding together, and I'm thrilled to welcome our new team members to the Asbury family.\nAsbury achieved unprecedented success in 2021.\nThroughout the year, we increased adjusted EBITDA by 94% and adjusted earnings per share by 112%.\nWe achieved an adjusted operating margin of 8.1%.\nWe successfully incorporated excellent dealerships in targeted high-growth markets and completed the implementation of Clicklane, our online transaction platform, across all legacy Asbury locations.\nDespite challenges in the new vehicle market, we attained record profitability by enhancing our new vehicle margins, boosting used vehicle sales, and expanding our parts and service operations, all while sustaining improved employee productivity and utilizing our robust cash flow for acquisitions.\nOur diverse business lines enable us to adapt and consistently deliver strong earnings regardless of market conditions.\nWe plan to implement Total Care Auto in our existing stores and introduce Clicklane to our recent acquisitions, allowing us to further increase our earnings.\nOur balance sheet remains robust due to our record performance and strong cash flow.\nOur adjusted operating cash flow for 2021 was $632 million, a $189 million increase from 2020.\nOur net leverage ratio at the end of this quarter was 2.7 times.\nWe will continue to utilize our free cash flow to manage our leverage and maximize shareholder returns through share repurchases and acquisitions.\nI'd like to provide a brief update on our five-year plan.\nOur same-store adjusted revenue grew by nearly 12% last year, surpassing expectations.\nClicklane continues to produce impressive results, generating over $570 million in additional revenue for three quarters in 2021.\nDespite lower new vehicle inventory levels, Clicklane contributed an additional 7% to our same-store growth.\nAs previously mentioned, we had a highly successful year in terms of acquisitions.\nGiven these results, we remain fully confident in the execution of our growth strategy.\nBased on our 2021 performance, we will revise our five-year plan during our Q1 2022 earnings call.\nI will now pass the call to Dan to discuss our operational performance.\nWe achieved strong results, enabling us to deliver an impressive gross margin of 20.4%, an all-time record and a 370 basis point increase compared to the fourth quarter of last year.\nOur teams continue to maximize employee productivity, resulting in adjusted SG&A as a percentage of gross profit of 54.3%, a 710 basis point improvement over the previous year.\nOur total revenue for the quarter increased by 19% year-over-year, and total gross profit rose by 46%.\nWe improved our adjusted operating margins for the quarter from 6% in 2020 to 8.9% in 2021, and we will continue to optimize our portfolio in the future.\nNow, I will discuss our same-store performance compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, unless otherwise specified.\nStarting with new vehicles.\nGiven current market conditions, we remain focused on being opportunistic with our inventory and improving gross profits to maximize profitability.\nOur new average gross profit per vehicle was $6,335, an increase of $3,441 or 119% from the same period last year.\nAll segment margins showed significant improvement compared to the prior-year period.\nBy the close of December, our new vehicle stock was valued at $207 million with an eight-day supply, which was 32 days less than the previous year.\nWe anticipate the supply days to stay low as we enter 2022, with a slight increase expected towards the year's end.\nLet's now discuss pre-owned vehicles.\nOur used retail sales volume grew by 15%, with a gross margin of 8.2%, equating to an average profit of $2,623 per vehicle.\nOur performance led to a 64% increase in retail gross profit.\nOur used vehicle inventory at quarter-end was $402 million, representing a 34-day supply, which is three days more than last year.\nThe ratio of used to new vehicles for the quarter stood at 109%.\nOur consistent and robust growth in F&I resulted in a $213 increase to $1,961 per vehicle sold compared to the same quarter last year.\nIn Q4, our front-end yield per vehicle rose by $2,169 to reach a record high of $6,362.\nNow, let's look at parts and service.\nOur parts and service revenue grew by 13% this quarter.\nWarranty revenue decreased by 19%.\nOur customer-paid revenue continues to show healthy recovery, growing by 17%.\nWe reached a new record of over 149,000 online service appointments, a 16% increase from the same quarter last year.\nIncreasing online service appointments benefits customer experience, retention, conversion rates, margins, and shareholder returns.\nAfter three full quarters of Clicklane implementation in all legacy stores, we'd like to share some performance data.\nIn Q4, we sold over 5,000 vehicles through Clicklane, with 47% being new and 53% used.\n91% of these transactions were with customers new to Asbury's dealership network.\nAverage transaction time remained consistent with the previous quarter: 8 minutes for cash deals and 14 minutes for financed deals.\nThe total variable front-end yield was $4,298, and the F&I front-end yield was $1,846.\nThe average credit score is higher than the average at our physical stores.\n80% of financing applicants received instant approval, while an additional 10% needed some offline assistance.\n90% of applicants were approved for financing.\n43% of Clicklane sales included trade-ins, with 78% of these trades reconditioned and resold to consumers, yielding a total front-end of $4,490.\n92% of Clicklane deliveries occur within a 50-mile radius of our stores, allowing us to retain these new customers for parts and service.\nAs expected, Clicklane customers are converting at higher rates than traditional internet leads.\nIn the first few months after launching Clicklane, about 60% of sales were new vehicles.\nWe can't fully assess Clicklane's potential until inventory levels normalize.\nWe remain enthusiastic about Clicklane's continued growth.\nYou've all created outstanding organizations that align with our goal of being the most customer-focused automotive retailer.\nOur future looks promising, and I'm eager to meet all of you.\nI'll now pass the call to Michael to discuss our financial performance.\nI'd like to present some financial highlights from what was another record-breaking quarter for our company.\nIn comparison to the same period last year, our efforts to manage gross profit and control expenses resulted in a fourth quarter adjusted operating margin of 8.9%, a 290 basis point increase and an all-time high.\nAdjusted net income grew by 89% to $163 million, while adjusted earnings per share rose by 68% to $7.46.\nThe fourth quarter 2021 net income was modified to account for acquisition expenses and related financing costs of $289 million or $1.02 per diluted share.\nThe fourth quarter 2020 net income was adjusted to reflect a gain of $3.9 million or $0.15 per diluted share from dealership divestiture.\nOur fourth quarter 2021 earnings per share were negatively affected by the interest and additional shares issued as part of the acquisition financing completed before the acquisition closure, in addition to the aforementioned net income adjustments.\nHad the financing concluded simultaneously with the Larry H. Miller acquisition, our adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter would have benefited by $0.87 due to reduced interest expenses and fewer outstanding shares.\nLet's review the full year 2021 results in comparison to 2020.\nThe adjusted operating margin reached an all-time high of 8.1%, a 240 basis point increase.\nAdjusted net income surged by 120% to $549 million, and adjusted earnings per share grew by 112% to $27.29.\nOur effective tax rate decreased from 24.8% in 2020 to 23.7% in 2021.\nWe acquired $6.6 billion in annualized revenue this quarter.\nTo fund the acquisitions, we issued debt and equity offerings totaling approximately $2.1 billion, arranged a syndicated mortgage facility of about $700 million, and borrowed from our expanded syndicated credit facility.\nWe invested approximately $34 million in capital expenditures during the quarter.\nWe generated $632 million in adjusted operating cash flow for the year.\nOur financial position remains strong, ending the quarter with about $437 million in liquidity, including cash (excluding Total Care Auto), floorplan offset accounts, and availability on both our used line and revolving credit facility.\nAt the quarter's end, our net leverage ratio was 2.7 times, below our target of three times.\nAs David mentioned earlier, our board has approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization from $100 million to $200 million.\nFor 2022, we anticipate a tax rate of roughly 25% to 26% and capital expenditures of about $150 million.\nThis figure excludes real estate purchases and potential lease buyout opportunities that we consider financing transactions.\nOur primary goals are: Ensure a smooth transition for all new team members; optimize capital allocation to maximize shareholder returns; continue developing and expanding Clicklane, implementing this fully transactional tool across our recent acquisitions nationwide; integrate Total Care Auto, our insurance and F&I product provider, across all Asbury dealerships to increase our F&I PVR; implement company-wide training to foster the growth and development of our employees; and maintain our industry-leading operating margins and SG&A.\nI'd like to share our expectations for this year.\nWe're optimistic about 2022.\nWe foresee favorable conditions for automotive retail and expect demand to outpace supply for most of the year.\nWe anticipate a gradual improvement in inventory levels during the second half of 2022 as OEM production increases.\nConsequently, we're planning our business based on a SAAR of 15.5 million to 16 million units and vehicle margins similar to 2021.\nWe'll remain flexible and alert to adapt to changing conditions.\nSG&A as a percentage of gross profit should continue to benefit from proactive expense management and improved employee productivity.\nWe aim to continue delivering strong results for our shareholders, partner effectively with our OEMs to steward their brands, and provide an environment where our team members can thrive while offering the most customer-focused experience in automotive retail.\nTo conclude, I want to address all Asbury team members.\nOur ability to add high-quality stores that share our commitment to serving customers and engaging with communities is a direct result of your efforts.\nYou've enabled us to thoughtfully expand our core business by aligning with our vision.\nPeople are the key differentiator in any organization, and you're making Asbury a better workplace and creating an environment that attracts business.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Greg Wright, Chris Sharp, and Corey Dyer, who hold executive positions, are present and will answer questions.\nPlease consult our 10-K and subsequent SEC filings for a comprehensive overview of business-related risks.\nNet income reconciliations can be found in the supplementary package submitted to the SEC and accessible on our website.\nWe've improved our product range with a notable increase in contributions from our sub-1 megawatt and interconnection category.\nWe reinforced our commitment to sustainability by releasing our third yearly ESG report.\nFor the second consecutive quarter, we've increased our revenue and EBITDA projections, paving the way for accelerated cash flow growth.\nWe further improved our financial position by redeeming high-interest preferred stock and issuing low-cost, long-term fixed-rate debt.\nOur strategy for creating long-term value is based on a global, interconnected, and sustainable approach.\nWe made progress in these areas during the second quarter.\nOur company continues to expand globally.\nWe achieved strong results and bookings across all regions once again.\nOur comprehensive product offering continues to grow, with record sub-1 megawatt bookings in Q2 and regional peaks in both EMEA and APAC.\nThe sub-1 megawatt category, including interconnection, represented nearly half of our total bookings, showing customers' enthusiasm for PlatformDIGITAL in their digital transformation efforts.\nI will address our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3.\nIn June, we received the Green Lease Leader Gold award for the third consecutive year from the Institute for Market Transformation and the U.S. Department of Energy.\nWe remain the sole data center provider to receive this recognition, which acknowledges Digital Realty's leadership in incorporating green leasing provisions to align our interests with customers and promote high-performance, healthy buildings.\nDuring Q2, we released our third annual ESG report, detailing our 2020 sustainability efforts, including using 100% renewable energy across our European and U.S. colocation portfolios, meeting 50% of our global energy needs, and progressing towards our science-based target.\nOur ESG report showcases various ongoing initiatives, including diversity, equity, inclusion efforts, and community involvement.\nDigital Realty is dedicated to being an active community member and giving back to the areas where we operate globally.\nWe promote and celebrate community involvement and employee engagement through our Do Better Together initiative.\nWe recently emphasized our commitment to transparency and accountability in our diversity, equity, and inclusion journey by publishing our EEO-1 report.\nRecent events have shown that ESG is more important than ever for our business.\nI'm proud of our leadership in this area as we work towards delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders, including investors, customers, employees, and the communities we serve worldwide.\nLet's review our investment activity on Page 4.\nWe continue to invest in our global platform with 39 ongoing projects worldwide as of June 30, adding nearly 300 megawatts of capacity, mostly scheduled for delivery in the next 12 months.\nWe're investing heavily in EMEA with 19 projects totaling over 150 megawatts under construction.\nMost of this capacity is highly connected, including projects in Frankfurt, Marseille, Paris, and Zurich.\nDemand remains strong across these metros, attracting service providers and enterprise customers globally, contributing to the region's outstanding Q2 performance in the up-to-1 megawatt category.\nIn North America, over half of our construction capacity is in Portland and Toronto, two hot markets often overlooked in favor of traditional North American data center locations.\nWe've had great success in these two metros recently.\nWe have 30 megawatts under construction in Hillsboro, Oregon, now fully pre-leased, while our Toronto connected campus is gaining momentum as Canada's premier hub for global cloud service providers and enterprise customers.\nIn Asia Pacific, we're accelerating organic growth in this underserved region.\nWe opened our third data center in Singapore, a 50-megawatt facility permitted before the construction moratorium.\nDemand for this scarce capacity is strong, and we have another 18 megawatts largely presold and set to open this quarter.\nWe're also opening MC Digital Realty data centers in Japan soon.\nAs the world watches Tokyo for the Olympics, we're opening a new facility poised to win the gold medal.\nWe're also opening another data center in Osaka this quarter and our first carrier-neutral offering in Seoul, Korea, in Q4.\nWe're very excited about the Seoul opportunity.\nEarlier this month, we announced plans to enter India in partnership with Brookfield Infrastructure.\nConsidering our successful collaboration on the Ascenty platform in Latin America, our complementary abilities and knowledge, and the substantial growth potential in India, we are thrilled to broaden our presence in this strong and vibrant market\nLet's examine the macroeconomic situation on Page 5\nWe are privileged to be operating in an industry driven by long-term demand factors\nOur position as industry leaders gives us a special perspective to identify global trends as they emerge on PlatformDIGITAL\nThe increasing significance of data gravity for Global 2000 companies is the first of these trends\nWe introduced the Data Gravity Index last year, our market intelligence tool that predicts the increasing intensity of enterprise data creation and its gravitational effect on global IT infrastructure across key global markets\nWe published an industry manifesto earlier this year, promoting connected data communities to guide cross-industry collaboration, address data gravity challenges, and usher in a new era of growth opportunities for all companies\nWe recently announced a partnership with Zayo to enhance interconnection business by creating an open fabric-of-fabrics\nThis initiative will allow multinational enterprises to connect vast data sets through fabric and orchestration, addressing the challenges of exploding data sets and increasing data gravity issues\nThird-party research continues to emphasize the growing importance of data gravity\nGartner, a Market Intelligence firm, recently conducted its 6th annual survey of chief data officers, revealing that less than 35% of these executives reported their businesses achieving their data sharing goals, including data exchange with external sources that drive revenue-generating business outcomes\nProblems often arise due to multiple data hosting and processing locations, combined with the need for appropriate security measures and the inability to overcome latency issues with direct private interconnection between numerous counterparties\nPlatformDIGITAL was created to address these challenges\nDigital transformation is exacerbating this enterprise data and connectivity issue\nRecent studies show that enterprise workflows use an average of 400 unique data sources while exchanging data with 27 external cloud products\nDigital Realty's enterprise and service provider clients are using PlatformDIGITAL to overcome these challenges by setting up their own data hubs and using interconnection to securely exchange data within and across multiple metro areas\nOur industry leadership is being recognized by experts and influencers\nDigital Realty was named a global leader by IDC MarketScape for data center colocation and interconnection services for the second consecutive year, further acknowledging our continuously improving customer capabilities\nThis recognition reflects our successful implementation of the PlatformDIGITAL roadmap, offering unique and differentiated value to customers with our purpose-built, comprehensive global capabilities\nCloudscene recently ranked Digital Realty as the top provider of data center ecosystems in EMEA for the second year in a row\nDigital Realty was ranked second in both North America and Latin America and moved up three positions to number 5 in Asia Pacific\nGigaOm published their analysis of edge infrastructure capabilities in July\nDigital Realty was ranked as an industry leader across multiple criteria in three broad categories\nOur capabilities were rated highest in vendor positioning and evaluation metrics comparison and second in key criteria comparison\nGiven the resilience of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our platform in meeting customer needs, we believe we are well-positioned to continue delivering sustainable growth for customers, shareholders, and employees, regardless of future macroeconomic conditions\nLet's review our leasing activity on Page 7\nWe signed total bookings of $113 million in the second quarter, including a $13 million contribution from interconnection\nNetwork and enterprise-oriented deals of 1 megawatt or less reached a record high of $41 million, demonstrating our consistent momentum and the growing success of PlatformDIGITAL as we continue to capture a larger share of enterprise demand\nThe average lease term was over eight years\nWe acquired 109 new customers during the second quarter, with strong performance across all regions, further demonstrating the strength of our global platform\nThe geographic and product mix of our new activity was well-balanced, with APAC and EMEA each contributing about 20%, the Americas representing nearly 50%, and interconnection responsible for just over 10%\nThe megawatt or less plus interconnection category accounted for almost half of our total bookings, with particular strength in the cloud, content, and financial services sectors\nRegarding specific wins during the quarter and around the world, we secured a top five cloud service provider to anchor our new Tokyo campus\nShortly after this significant customer deployment, Japan's most popular social media application chose PlatformDIGITAL on the same campus\nNAVER, the leading Korea-based cloud provider serving the greater APAC region, selected our new carrier-neutral facility in Singapore to support data-intensive workloads for their high-performance computing and AI-intensive technology-based platform\nA European broadcaster is using PlatformDIGITAL in Vienna and Frankfurt to restructure their network, focusing on data-intensive interconnection with benefits in performance, scalability, and cost savings\nA Global 2000 enterprise data platform is adopting PlatformDIGITAL in Amsterdam, Dublin, and Frankfurt to manage workloads across hundreds of ecosystem applications, delivering improved performance, security, cost savings, and simplicity\nIn London, PlatformDIGITAL is supporting a top three global money center bank's efforts to strengthen their business continuity capabilities without compromising their data-intensive interconnection requirements\nOn the continent, our connectivity and operational capabilities are helping two independent fintech customers improve performance and enhance access to their connected data communities\nFinally, in North America, a life sciences digital marketing firm chose PlatformDIGITAL to improve their network architecture and enable future growth\nLet's examine the details on Page 9 of our backlog report.\nThe current backlog of signed but not yet started leases decreased slightly from $307 million to $303 million, as lease commencements slightly exceeded new space and power lease signings this quarter.\nThe time between lease signing and commencement was slightly longer than our typical average, at just over seven months.\nLet's now look at renewal leasing activity on Page 10.\nWe renewed $178 million worth of leases in the second quarter, in addition to signing new leases.\nThe average lease term for renewals signed in Q2 was just under 3 years, reflecting more enterprise deals under 1 megawatt.\nWe kept 77% of expiring leases, with slightly positive cash releasing spreads on renewals, also indicating more sub-1 megawatt renewals overall.\nRegarding Q2 operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy decreased by 0.6% as we introduced new capacity across six metro areas during the quarter.\nSame capital cash NOI growth was -1.5% in Q2, mainly due to the churn in Ashburn at the year's start.\nNote that the Westin Building in Seattle, Interxion platform in EMEA, Lamda Helix in Greece, and Altus IT in Croatia are not yet in the same-store pool, making these comparisons less representative of our current business than usual.\nLet's review our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 11.\nThe U.S. dollar fluctuated in Q2 but remained lower than last year's average, providing a slight FX benefit.\nWe manage currency risk by issuing debt in local currencies as a natural hedge, so only our net assets in each region are exposed to currency risk economically.\nBesides managing credit and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by converting short-term variable rate debt into longer-term fixed rate financing.\nGiven our strategy of matching long-lived assets with long-term fixed-rate debt, a 1% change in benchmark rates would impact full year FFO per share by about 0.75%.\nRegarding earnings growth, Q2 core FFO per share was unchanged year-over-year but decreased 8% from last quarter due to a $0.12 non-cash deferred tax charge related to the UK's higher corporate tax rate, effective in Q2.\nExcluding this unexpected tax charge, we exceeded our internal forecast due to better-than-expected top-line performance, slight FX benefits, and operating expense savings, partly due to reduced property-level spending during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe are increasing our full-year projections for total revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the second time this year, reflecting our business's underlying momentum.\nThe deferred tax charge impacts core FFO per share but not AFFO, as it's non-cash.\nMost guidance factors remain unchanged, but we're reducing our expected recurring CapEx spend for the rest of the year, setting the stage for accelerated cash flow growth.\nThe bridge chart on Page 12 shows we expect our bottom-line results to improve sequentially for the rest of the year as the deferred tax charge is removed from the quarterly run rate and our underlying business momentum continues to accelerate.\nWe still anticipate some normalization in our cost structure, with increased property-level operating expenses that were postponed due to COVID, and higher G&A expenses as we return to the office and resume normal travel. Your model should account for these increased costs.\nFinally, let's examine the balance sheet on Page 13.\nWe completed the sale of non-core assets in Europe for $680 million late in Q1, which reduced Q2 adjusted EBITDA by about $10 million.\nConsequently, net debt to adjusted EBITDA was slightly elevated at 6x at Q2's end but is expected to return to our long-term range over the year through asset sale proceeds and cash flow growth as signed leases commence.\nFixed charge coverage decreased slightly, also reflecting the short-term impact of asset sales, but remains well above our target and near an all-time high at 5.4x, demonstrating the success of our proactive liability management.\nWe continue to implement our financial strategy of maximizing available capital options while minimizing costs and extending liability duration to match our long-lived assets.\nIn mid-May, we redeemed $200 million of preferred stock at 6.625%, bringing total preferred equity redemptions over the past 12 months to $700 million at an average coupon of just over 6.25%, effectively reducing leverage by 0.3 turns.\nWe issued 0.5 million shares through our ATM program in mid-June, raising about $77 million.\nIn early July, we raised an additional $26 million by selling our remaining Megaport stock.\nWe also entered the Swiss bond market in early July, raising approximately $595 million through a dual tranche offering of Swiss green bonds with an average maturity of over 6.5 years and an average coupon of about 0.37%.\nThis successful execution of our financial strategy showcases the strength of our global platform, which provides access to a wide range of public and private capital, distinguishes us from competitors, and allows us to prudently fund our growth.\nAs shown on Page 13, our average debt maturity is nearly 6.5 years, and our average coupon has decreased to 2.2%.\nLess than half of our debt is U.S. dollar-denominated, reflecting our global platform's growth and serving as a natural FX hedge for investments outside the U.S. 90% of our debt is fixed rate to protect against rising rates, and 98% is unsecured, offering maximum flexibility for capital recycling.\nLastly, as seen on the left side of Page 13, we have a clear runway with minimal near-term debt maturities and manageable amounts in future years.\nOur balance sheet is prepared to withstand challenges and poised to support growth opportunities for our customers worldwide, in line with our long-term financing strategy.\nAndrew, please begin the Q&A session.\nSummary: ",

Dean Shigenaga.\nAs Michael Jordan stated, some individuals desire things to occur, some hope for them to happen, while others make them a reality.\nAlexandria turns ideas into reality.\nLet's briefly discuss key aspects of the second quarter: unprecedented demand for Alexandria's laboratory spaces and the crucial lab operations that accompany them.\nAlexandria is leading the charge in meeting the historic and unparalleled demand from many of our over 750 tenants for current growth needs and critically important future expansion.\nThe fundamental drivers of demand are stronger than ever before.\nRent increases continue unabated, with no excess supply currently visible.\nWe're proud of our nearly 7% quarter-over-quarter FFO growth per share, over 40% rental rate increase, almost 18% NOI growth, nearly 8% same-store NOI growth, and an annual NOI run rate exceeding $1.3 billion, not to mention about $545 million in additional revenue from our development and redevelopment pipeline.\nAlexandria clearly has a demonstrable pricing advantage in each of our cluster markets.\nWhen life science tenants make a choice, they typically prefer Alexandria's lab spaces and our operational excellence based on our critical lab operations.\nNature Biotechnology magazine wrote in April: 2020 was a year of broken records.\nBiotech played a crucial role, and the pandemic attracted a flood of private and public investors.\nThe pandemic seemingly reinforced the need for long-term, value-focused investors of all types to have exposure to life sciences.\nLife science demand has indeed reached an all-time high as the world has recognized the importance of next-generation therapies in addressing current and future complex healthcare challenges.\nJenna will elaborate on this further.\nI'll highlight a couple of points for now.\nThe pandemic has emphasized the importance of supporting the National Institutes of Health and investing in basic science, which are crucial for maintaining U.S. leadership in life sciences and maximizing national preparedness for current and future health challenges.\nThere's currently a proposal to increase the fiscal year '22 NIH budget to $51 billion, nearly a 20% increase from fiscal year '21.\nThe FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) approved 23 new molecular entities in the first half of 2021, putting it on track to surpass 2020's near-record high of 53 approvals.\nFollowing a historic 2020, venture capital in Life Sciences continues at a robust pace, with almost $36 billion raised in the first half of 2021, on track to exceed 2020's all-time high of $46 billion.\nThis unprecedented level is likely to persist throughout the year due to substantial available funds for life science investments and increased participation from institutional, generalist, and traditional life science investors.\nFollowing a record-breaking 2020 for IPOs and follow-on offerings, the first half of this year has continued to set new highs, with over $8 billion raised in 52 IPOs and over $17 billion raised in numerous follow-ons, positioning 2021 to be a record-breaking year for public market investment in life sciences.\nR&D has continued with remarkable productivity and resilience through COVID, enabling the industry to swiftly deliver novel vaccines and therapies to combat the global pandemic.\nNew biology, drug discovery platforms, and increasing focus on complex medicines as the future of therapeutic innovation have all demonstrated the life science industry's ability to effectively address current and future healthcare challenges and provide strong returns to investors.\nA final note would be that, similar to how Project Warp Speed brought together a historic public-private partnership between the government and private biotech and pharmaceutical companies to rapidly research, develop, and commercialize COVID vaccines in record time, as well as ensure timely manufacturing and supply, we truly need a 21st-century infrastructure package, not the 20th-century package currently being debated in Congress.\nWe need to make the U.S. self-sufficient in semiconductor production, as we currently only produce about 11% to 13%, and self-sufficient in next-generation manufacturing of complex medicines.\nAs Joel highlighted last quarter and continues to be reinforced by the fundamentals he just shared, there's a significant paradox in this pandemic moment for the life science industry.\nDespite the challenges of recent months, COVID has illuminated the power of science and the industry's ability to transform the future of human health.\nNot only have many of our tenants in the industry, as Joel mentioned, risen to the challenge of combating global pandemics, but R&D and bioinnovation have generally persisted with remarkable productivity, resilience, and advancements throughout this period.\nWe cannot stress enough how crucial it is for us to preserve, prioritize, and continue to catalyze this groundbreaking innovation that has and will continue to save countless lives.\nTurning to a COVID-specific update for a moment.\nA total of 3.7 billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide, with nearly 10% of these doses in the U.S. alone.\nApproximately 57.5% of the vaccine-eligible population in our country (those 12 and over) have been fully vaccinated with either Pfizer or Moderna's 2-shot mRNA-based vaccine or Johnson & Johnson's single shot.\nThis represents just over 49% of the total U.S. population, and we hope this number of fully vaccinated individuals will continue to rise steadily.\nThese figures are astounding.\nBefore we discuss where we are now, I want to emphasize that despite the COVID fatigue we all continue to feel, even with some relief from easing restrictions over the past few months (albeit with the likely return of some new ones), none of our progress in the recovery process should be taken for granted.\nThe fact that the biopharma industry, spearheaded by many of our tenants, was equipped with the knowledge, resources, and technology to create safe and effective vaccines to combat a novel viral pathogen would have been unimaginable just a few decades ago.\nThe fact that our tenants Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson were able to develop, conduct robust clinical trials, manufacture, and distribute billions of vaccines at scale in less than 12 months is truly unprecedented.\nThese vaccines achieved astounding safety and efficacy rates in the 90-plus percent range when the FDA had set the original bar at 50%, with an amazingly low incidence of side effects reported from the millions of people who have now received them.\nThe collaboration between the biopharma industry, government, and many other public and private agencies to ensure all of this transpired at a pace and level sufficient to provide adequate vaccine supply to inoculate the entire U.S. population, unlike most nations around the world, should not be undervalued.\nThe tireless efforts of the FDA in reviewing thousands of COVID-19-related applications to maximize the availability of high-quality testing and safe and effective vaccines and therapies against COVID-19 cannot go unrecognized.\nSo where are we now?\nIt's been just over 18 months since the first U.S. COVID case was reported on January 21, 2020.\nYet despite all of the progress with vaccines, countries around the world are still very much combating new COVID-19 surges, driven most recently in part by the increasing prevalence of the so-called Delta variant.\nIn the U.S., this highly contagious Delta variant, approximately 50% more transmissible with 1,000 times higher viral load, accounts for at least 83% of COVID cases.\nAverage daily confirmed COVID case counts now exceed 50,000, which is five times that of the mid-June lows, with hospitalizations and deaths rising as well.\nHowever, as worrying as this trend may seem, breakthrough infections (those occurring in vaccinated people) are still relatively uncommon.\nThe vast majority of these breakthrough cases have not caused serious illness, hospitalization, or death.\nMore than 95% of people hospitalized for COVID-19 are unvaccinated, and the vaccines still remain effective even against the Delta variant.\nWhile they may not entirely prevent transmission, they do seem almost entirely able to prevent severe disease and death.\nRegarding vaccine safety, there have been very few adverse events reported overall (less than seven per million), with nearly all cases resolving without long-term side effects.\nAs such, the strong safety and efficacy profile will likely lead to full FDA approval for mRNA-based vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna this fall.\nRegarding pregnancy and women of childbearing age, though data is more limited, based on the safety data generated to date and our understanding of how vaccines work in the body, the CDC encourages pregnant women to get vaccinated, especially given that pregnant and recently pregnant women are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.\nRegarding children, Pfizer has an emergency use authorization for children over 12, and the FDA is urging Pfizer and Moderna to expand their studies in children aged five to 11.\nLooking ahead, the evolving data on the duration of immunity and COVID-19 variants of concern suggests that COVID-19 and the need for vaccines and boosters will likely persist long-term.\nHowever, the faster we can vaccinate the population in this country and increase access to vaccines in the rest of the world, the more effectively we can slow the emergence of new variants and the sooner we can turn this virus into a less deadly pathogen, even if still contagious.\nGiven that COVID will likely remain on the planet for the foreseeable future, therapies will continue to be important in mitigating the severity of COVID-19, such as the recently authorized antibody treatments from our tenants Bayer and GSK.\nEqually important is continued COVID testing, both for active virus in symptomatic individuals and surveillance testing across the population to detect new outbreaks, sequence emerging variants, and track overall transmission.\nLastly, I want to address the FDA, which has received somewhat relentless criticism over the past several months despite their herculean COVID efforts while maintaining a near all-time record high pace of new drug approvals, as Joel highlighted.\nThis criticism has been mounting due to several factors, including the lack of a fully appointed FDA commissioner, the growing backlog of review requirements for new investigational drug applications given the strong pace of innovation in our industry, the lack of fully approved vaccines despite their authorization under the emergency use authorization pathway, and most recently, the historic and highly controversial approval of Biogen's Aduhelm to treat Alzheimer's disease.\nThis marked the first approval for this chronic neurodegenerative condition in almost 20 years, impacting over 6 million individuals in the United States alone.\nThe FDA's unwavering dedication during the COVID-19 pandemic to expedite the evaluation of numerous COVID-related applications for tests, treatments, and vaccines was crucial in keeping the nation from falling behind, despite the record number of industry submissions.\nThis achievement is remarkable and deserves the highest praise.\nThe FDA plays a vital role in guaranteeing the safety of all pharmaceuticals available in the U.S. while striking a balance between effectiveness and timeliness.\nThe upcoming leadership and productivity of the agency, to be revealed by November this year, is of paramount importance to everyone.\nThe FDA is essential for maintaining the momentum and vigor of biomedical innovation in our nation.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is emerging from the COVID-19 crisis into a new era of unprecedented biotechnological and scientific advancement.\nThe global community now recognizes the value of this sector and the potential of cutting-edge medicines, as demonstrated by Moderna and Pfizer's innovative vaccines addressing current and future health challenges.\nUndoubtedly, the contradictory nature of this pandemic has reaffirmed Alexandria's commitment to dedicating our business, enthusiasm, and purpose to propelling this crucial industry forward.\nI'd like to provide some historical context for the growing demand, which has resulted in rapid leasing of Alexandria's large-scale campuses.\nAt Alexandria's Investor Day in December 2017, we presented an ambitious plan to nearly double the company's yearly rental income from just over $800 million to $1.5 billion by the end of 2022.\nWe are happy to report that our annualized revenues for Q2 2021 have already surpassed $1.5 billion.\nThe Alexandria team has achieved this lofty goal more than a year ahead of schedule.\nThe company has also expanded its essential operating asset base and development pipeline from 29 million square feet at the end of 2017 to 62 million square feet by the end of Q2 2021.\nThis represents remarkable growth, more than doubling the company's footprint, and importantly, concentrated in our core areas with disciplined execution, ensuring the continuation of high-quality cash flows.\nWhen questioned in 2020 about whether the robust leasing activity for Alexandria's large campus platform was perhaps a temporary spike driven by COVID-19, the second quarter of this year's leasing volume of over 1.9 million square feet - the highest quarterly leasing volume in company history - further demonstrates the company's unique position as a trusted partner to the expanding life science industry, providing a lasting and sustainable competitive edge in the market.\nI'll review some exceptional highlights, including leasing performance.\nAs mentioned, the 1.9 million square feet leased represents the highest quarterly leasing activity in the company's 27-year history.\nPage two of the supplemental indicates that the 3.4 million square feet under construction is 80% leased, and the additional 3.6 million square feet expected to begin construction in 2021-2022 is 89% leased or in negotiations.\nThis strong leasing and our growth pipeline provide excellent clarity, and these projects will generate additional revenues exceeding $545 million.\nWe also have outstanding core results.\nThis quarter saw cash increases of 25.4% and GAAP increases of 42.4%.\nOccupancy remained solid at 94.3% in the operating portfolio, which would have been 98.1% if not for the 1.4 million square feet of vacancy in recently acquired properties, which offer potential near-term incremental annual rental revenues surpassing $55 million.\nRegarding market health, demand continues to accelerate for Alexandria's branded and highly desirable large campuses, while supply remains constrained across all our markets in 2021, with no disruptive large-scale projects expected to be completed in 2022-2023.\nWe're closely monitoring Greater Boston's ground-up pipeline, which is 56% leased.\nIn the San Francisco area, we're tracking leasing activity at two or three ground-up lab projects.\nAs previously noted, there have been no significant lab sublease spaces put on the market for several quarters.\nIn conclusion, the first half of 2021 continues Alexandria's strong performance, and our focus on operational excellence has positioned the company well to enhance its industry-leading brand.\nI will now provide updates on our development pipeline and construction cost trends, comment on recent asset sales, and report on some transactions that indicate the private market's continued strong appetite for life science assets.\nAs Steve and Joel mentioned, we're experiencing unprecedented demand and have responded by implementing our unique life science strategy at an accelerated pace, expanding our collaborative campuses and asset base in each of our cluster markets.\nA significant indicator of the life science industry's health is our substantial expansion in almost all our markets.\nIn many of our submarkets, the supply-demand imbalance has been exacerbated by a lack of near-term expansion opportunities, leading Alexandria to push the boundaries of those markets.\nExamples include successful ventures into Watertown and Seaport in Greater Boston, new large campuses in Sorrento Mesa, expansion of San Diego's Science sector to the north and east, and a highly successful large campus underway in San Carlos.\nThis high demand, combined with our experienced development teams, resulted in another productive quarter for Alexandria.\nIn Q2, we delivered 755,565 square feet across five assets in South San Francisco, San Carlos, Long Island City, San Diego, and the Research Triangle.\nThis is twice what we delivered in Q1, and these deliveries will generate over $31 million in annual rental revenue over the next year.\nAdditionally, this unprecedented demand has led to improved quarter-over-quarter leasing numbers and leases under negotiation, despite adding two new assets with minimal marketing time.\nNotable assets contributing to this outcome include 840 Winter Street in Waltham, Massachusetts, showcasing our ability to meet demand for next-gen manufacturing facilities; 3160 Porter Drive in Palo Alto, a joint effort with Stanford to commercialize the University's most innovative science; and 5505 Morehouse in Sorrento Mesa, benefiting from Alexandria's placemaking expertise and strong demand drivers in San Diego.\nWe expect to commence construction on another 3.6 million square feet across 19 properties this year and next, which are already 89% leased or under negotiation.\nThese properties will collectively add approximately $545 million in annual rental revenue once fully delivered.\nConstruction costs remain elevated, with some trades and commodities holding steady while others continue at unexplainable and unprecedented levels.\nLumber prices have shown positive trends, potentially foreshadowing what may happen with other commodities.\nA year ago, lumber was $500 per thousand board feet, about $100 above its historical norm.\nIt peaked at $1,700 in early May but has since dropped to $600 and continues to decline.\nThis drop resulted from many residential projects being put on hold due to high lumber prices, allowing mills to catch up and stabilize pricing.\nA similar correction due to decreased demand is expected to eventually normalize all construction commodities.\nCopper prices have shown signs of dropping but remain twice their historical norms.\nAlternatives like aluminum are being considered to alleviate pricing pressures, and widespread adoption could lead to price stabilization.\nDespite promising news with lumber and copper, rolled steel remains volatile with no signs of stabilizing.\nRolled steel is used in metal decks, studs, and ductwork, significantly impacting multilevel buildings with large HVAC needs, such as lab buildings.\nWe must maintain high-end cost escalation assumptions despite the noted drop in some commodities.\nThe reported reason is both a commodity and labor issue at shops that create products from raw materials.\nCOVID-19 caused many to shut down, and when demand exploded, shops struggled to bring back labor.\nAttempts to solve this by scheduling longer shifts were hampered by insufficient rolled steel supplies, keeping prices high, with metal studs up 75% since January.\nWe assure you that we're closely monitoring commodities and developing strategies to counter these increases.\nBy employing prudent underwriting practices, we will maintain our track record of delivering projects punctually and within budget.\nI'll finish by discussing our recent sales and mentioning a few recently announced comparables.\nWhile I previously mentioned our record-breaking 4% cap rate at 213 East, I'd like to add that we also achieved an impressive 9.6% unlevered IRR and a 56% value creation margin, calculated by dividing our gain by gross book value.\nWe attained a remarkable 12% unlevered IRR and 61% value creation margin on this sale, showcasing the high-quality assets we've developed and continue to develop in Seattle and other locations.\nApart from the Alexandria transactions, there are a couple of noteworthy deals in our submarkets that demonstrate the high value private investors are placing on life science properties currently.\nIn Sorrento Mesa, a property called The Canyons, comprising just over one-third lab and manufacturing space with the rest being office, sold at a 4.48% cap rate and $575 per square foot.\nThe cash flow comes from a credit-worthy tenant with no immediate upside potential, indicating the yield a private investor was willing to accept in a submarket that would have commanded a cap rate above 6% not long ago.\nSimilarly, another comparable comes from Rockville, Maryland, which some analysts recently considered a 7% cap rate submarket.\nA U.S. insurance company purchased 9615 Medical Center Drive in the Shady Grove submarket, adjacent to several Alexandria properties, for a 5.18% cap rate and $610 per square foot.\nThe property is a leasehold interest subject to a long-term ground lease owned by Alexandria.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Dean.\nWe reported outstanding operational and financial results for the first half of 2021 and provided a robust outlook for the rest of the year.\nSecond quarter revenue and net operating income increased by 16.6% and 16.8% respectively compared to the same period in 2020.\nSecond quarter NOI rose 6.9% compared to the first quarter of 2021.\nVenture investment gains included in FFO per share totaled $25.5 million for the second quarter, consistent with the first quarter of 2021.\nLooking at the past two quarters, we raised our FFO per share outlook by $0.03 when reporting first quarter results.\nDuring the second quarter, we further increased our FFO per share outlook by $0.02.\nThis $0.02 increase was announced in a Form 8-K filing on June 14, when we had clear visibility into the strong core results for the quarter.\nSame-property NOI growth in the first half of 2021 benefited from our high-quality tenant base, with 53% of annual rental revenue coming from investment-grade rated or large-cap publicly traded companies.\nSame-property NOI growth for the first half of 2021 was robust at 4.4% and 7.4% on a cash basis.\nStrong rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing of space was the primary factor in improving our 2021 same-property net operating growth outlook to 2% to 4% and 4.7% to 6.7%, increases of 30 and 40 basis points respectively.\nWhile our 2021 acquisitions have primarily been driven by tenant demand for current and future development and redevelopment projects, some acquisitions included operating properties with potential for growth through vacancy lease-up.\nThese operating properties contributed to NOI growth in the first half of 2021.\nIt's worth noting that leasing up 1.4 million rental square feet of vacancy at these properties will generate over $55 million in additional annual rental revenue.\nOur reported occupancy as of June 30 was 94.3%, or 98.1% excluding vacancy from recently acquired properties.\nImportantly, disregarding recently acquired properties, our occupancy is set to improve by 100 basis points in 2021.\nWe believe it's crucial to highlight the strategic advantages of having a team with extensive experience in designing, constructing, and operating sophisticated laboratory office buildings, as well as long-standing partnerships with innovative tenants.\nAs mentioned earlier, we have one of the highest credit-quality tenant rosters in the REIT industry.\nWe boast one of the highest adjusted EBITDA margins in the REIT industry at 69%.\nWe reported our lowest accounts receivable balance since 2012 at $6.7 million, which is remarkable considering our total market capitalization exceeded $26 billion as of June 30.\nWe continue to report consistently high collections, with 99.4% for July.\nWe achieved record leasing activity with over 3.6 million rentable square feet executed in the first half of this year.\nThis pace significantly surpasses the strong leasing volume of 2020 and is on track for exceptional rental rate growth ranging from 31% to 34% and 18% to 21% on lease renewals and releasing of space, with the latter figures on a cash basis.\nAs a trusted partner with access to over 750 tenants in our portfolio, we are well-positioned to capture the substantial demand from our tenant roster and life science industry relationships.\nWe have an exciting pipeline of projects under construction, totaling 3.4 million rentable square feet, 80% of which is leased or in negotiations.\nNear-term project starts, 89% leased or under negotiations, total 3.7 million square feet.\nCombined, these projects amount to about 6.9 million square feet, 90% of which is related to space requirements from existing relationships.\nThese projects will generate an impressive increment in annual rental revenue exceeding $545 million, a 34% increase above the annualized second quarter rental revenues of $1.6 billion.\nImportantly, we also anticipate starting additional projects between now and December 2022.\nOur venture investments portfolio continues to demonstrate our science and technology team's exceptional talent for underwriting high-quality innovative entities.\nAs of June 30, unrealized gains were $962 million on an adjusted cost basis of $990 million.\nRealized gains on our venture investments for the second quarter were $60.2 million, including $34.8 million excluded from FFO per share.\nFor the first half of 2021, we realized gains totaling about $57.7 million related to significant gains in three investments that were excluded from FFO per share as adjusted.\nWe're pleased that the venture investment program is generating capital exceeding our initial 2021 forecast, potentially reaching over $100 million for the entire year.\nTurning to our robust and flexible balance sheet that supports our strategic growth initiatives.\nWe continue to maintain one of the strongest balance sheets in the REIT industry, providing access to attractive long-term capital costs.\nWe remain on track to achieve a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.2 times by year-end.\nOur fixed charge coverage ratio for the fourth quarter has increased to over five times.\nWe maintain significant liquidity of $4.5 billion as of June 30.\nWe're in a solid position regarding debt maturities, with our next maturity of only $184 million due in 2024.\nWhile it's difficult to predict when property owners will decide to sell, two to three transactions accounted for about half of our 2021 acquisition target.\nFor the remainder of the year, we aim to be highly selective with acquisitions.\nOur team is advancing several important dispositions, primarily focused on partial interest sales in high-value, low cap rate properties for reinvestment into our strategic value creation development and redevelopment projects.\nTo date in 2021, we have completed $580 million in dispositions at cap rates between 4% and 4.2%.\nWe have about $1.4 billion in process at various stages and expect to pursue additional dispositions that will exceed the top end of our current range of $2.2 billion.\nWe are targeting approximately $1 billion in dispositions to close in the third quarter and the remainder in the fourth quarter.\nImportantly, each of these pending transactions will continue to highlight the tremendous value we have created and continue to create for our stakeholders.\nThis guidance updates our previous guidance for the year disclosed in our Form 8-K dated June 14.\nWe narrowed the guidance range from $0.10 to $0.08 for both earnings per share and FFO per share.\nEPS was updated to a range of $3.46 to $3.54, and FFO per share as adjusted was updated to a range of $7.71 to $7.79, maintaining the midpoint of $7.75 for FFO per share diluted as adjusted.\nAs a reminder, since our initial FFO per share guidance for 2021, we have increased the midpoint of our guidance by $0.05, representing a 6.1% increase over 2020.\nI'd also like to express our team's gratitude for the continued recognition by an independent panel of judges for a sixth NAREIT Gold Award for Communication and Reporting Excellence to the investment community.\nOperator, we can now proceed to questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These declarations are founded on our current perspective and understanding.\nFuture outcomes may vary significantly due to potential risks and uncertainties.\nSome of the information presented today includes non-GAAP financial metrics.\nThese alternative financial measures should be considered in conjunction with, not as a substitute for, our GAAP results.\nTom will offer insights on our performance and provide an overview of the current operational landscape.\nBernadette will subsequently present details of our Q2 results and revised fiscal 2022 projections.\nWe're satisfied with the enhancements in our production and supply chain operations, as well as the progress in our financial performance this quarter, and I'm impressed by how the Lamb Weston team has managed this challenging economic environment.\nWe achieved strong sales, and robust demand across our food service channels drove volume growth, while our recent pricing strategies began to counteract inflationary pressures.\nFurthermore, our efforts to stabilize our manufacturing operations are progressing well, including increasing staff in our processing facilities to enhance production rates and output.\nCollectively, our sales and operational momentum led to sequential gross margin improvement in the quarter, positioning us well to manage the upcoming cost pressures from this year's exceptionally poor potato harvest in the Pacific Northwest.\nAlthough our operations and financial results haven't yet reached our desired levels, we're on track to meet our financial goals for the year, and our investments in capacity and productivity will position us well for higher margins and sustainable long-term growth.\nBefore Bernadette delves into the specifics of our second quarter results and outlook, let's briefly review the current operational landscape, starting with demand.\nIn the United States, overall french fry demand and restaurant traffic remained strong during the quarter, particularly at quick-service restaurants where demand has consistently exceeded pre-pandemic levels.\nFull-service restaurant traffic was also robust during the quarter but remained below pre-pandemic levels.\nRecently, restaurant traffic has declined as the spread of COVID variants has reduced consumer interest in on-site dining and as restaurants have temporarily closed due to staff shortages.\nWhile we expect this COVID wave will continue to dampen demand for on-site dining in the near future, we don't anticipate it will significantly affect traffic or demand at quick-service restaurants.\nDemand at non-commercial outlets also improved during the quarter but remained below pre-pandemic levels.\nAs with on-site dining, we expect the spread of COVID variants will impact near-term demand.\nThe french fry attachment rate in the U.S., which measures how often consumers order fries when visiting restaurants or other food service outlets, continues to exceed pre-pandemic levels.\nThis supported our out-of-home fry demand during the quarter.\nThe increase in the fry attachment rate has been consistent since the pandemic began, and we don't foresee this changing in the near future.\nFrench fry demand in U.S. retail channels during the quarter was up by mid-teens compared to pre-pandemic levels, and we expect it to remain strong in the near term as the pandemic continues to affect demand in out-of-home channels.\nOutside the U.S., demand in Asia and Oceania has been strong, although a shortage of shipping containers and disruptions to ocean freight networks continue to hinder our ability to fully serve customers in these markets.\nDemand in Europe, which is served by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture, has also been strong, although consumer reactions and the impact of recently imposed government lockdowns may reverse some of the recovery in restaurant traffic and fry demand in the near term.\nOverall, we're encouraged by the resilience of demand and long-term trends for the category, but we anticipate some near-term softness due to another COVID wave in the U.S. and our key international markets.\nRegarding pricing, we're making good progress in implementing recent pricing actions to manage input cost inflation.\nIn the second quarter, we began to see the initial benefits of price increases that took effect in the summer in our foodservice and retail segments, as well as in some of our international businesses.\nWe expect the benefit of these price increases to grow as the year progresses.\nIn December, we began implementing another round of pricing actions in our foodservice and retail segments.\nWhile these actions didn't affect our second quarter results, we'll see a gradual benefit from them over the next six months.\nIn our global segment, we saw some benefit from pricing actions in the second quarter but expect to see a greater impact during the latter half of the year.\nThis reflects price increases related to contract renewals as well as the benefit of price escalators for most of the global contracts that aren't up for renewal this year.\nWe expect these price increases across our business segments will collectively mitigate much, but not all, of our cost inflation pressures.\nWe'll continue to assess the pace and scope of further cost inflation and may take additional pricing actions as the year progresses.\nRegarding costs, input cost inflation remains the primary driver of the increase in our cost per pound during the quarter.\nCommodity and transportation costs each rose by double digits, and we expect this trend to continue through fiscal 2022, especially as our raw potato costs significantly increase in the second half of the year.\nBeyond cost inflation, we're making good progress in stabilizing our supply chain to improve costs, production rates, and throughput.\nWe've taken steps to simplify our manufacturing processes and drive savings through a series of productivity initiatives, eliminating underperforming SKUs, and increasing potato utilization rates.\nImportantly, after making changes to how we staff production crews, compensation, and other incentives, we've steadily reduced our staffing shortfall.\nWe're working to continue this positive trend but recognize it's challenging in a very difficult labor environment.\nThe impending implementation of government-mandated COVID testing and vaccine regulations may also slow our progress and that of our suppliers in attracting and retaining workers in the near term.\nRegarding the crop, the yields and quality of potato crops in our primary growing regions in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, and Alberta are well below average due to extreme heat over the summer.\nSimilar to previous years, we had contracted with farmers to purchase potatoes to meet our production needs, assuming an average crop year.\nHowever, due to the extreme heat, the contracted acres yielded fewer potatoes and the quality is also poor.\nAs a result, we're purchasing our remaining potato needs in the open market to meet our production forecast.\nWe were able to reduce the number of potatoes we'd otherwise have been required to purchase in the open market by successfully partnering with our customers to secure changes in product specifications.\nGiven that raw potato supply is tight and fry demand has largely recovered, we've been purchasing open potatoes at a premium to contracted potato prices.\nWhen possible, we've been securing them from nearby growing regions, but we've also transported potatoes from the Midwest and Eastern North America, resulting in increased transportation costs.\nWe included an estimate of these additional costs in our updated earnings outlook.\nWe'll begin to see more of the financial impact of this year's poor crop, including the high cost of open market potatoes, in our third quarter results.\nIn summary, we feel positive about our financial and operational progress this quarter.\nThe overall demand environment is solid but may soften in the near term due to another COVID wave, and we're implementing the right pricing and operational strategies to navigate this challenging environment.\nAs Tom mentioned, we're happy with our quarterly performance.\nWe saw robust sales and solid demand across our North American restaurant and foodservice channels, increased volume, and implemented price adjustments.\nWe believe our pricing strategies and cost-reduction measures have positioned us well to handle the current challenging business climate and support long-term sustainable profitable growth.\nIn particular, our quarterly sales grew by 12% to just over $1 billion.\nThis marks only the fourth time in Lamb Weston's history that we've exceeded $1 billion in quarterly sales.\nOur sales volumes increased by 6%.\nThe foodservice segment drove volume growth, reflecting the ongoing year-over-year recovery in on-premise dining and strong shipments to major chain restaurant customers in North America served by our global segment.\nOur retail segment saw increased sales volumes of branded products, but overall segment volume decreased primarily due to reduced shipments of private label items.\nWhile our overall volume growth was strong this quarter, it was hampered by industry-wide upstream and downstream supply chain issues, including delays in obtaining spare parts, edible oils, and other key materials for our factories, as well as labor shortages affecting production rates and output at our processing facilities.\nIn our global segment, volume growth was also limited by the scarcity of shipping containers and disruptions at ports and in ocean freight networks.\nWe anticipate these production and logistics challenges, along with the short-term impact of COVID variants, will restrict our volume growth at least until the end of fiscal 2022.\nOur price mix rose by 6% as we realized benefits from previously announced pricing actions across all four segments.\nWe began implementing product pricing actions in the first quarter as the main strategy to counter inflationary cost pressures, typically taking a couple of quarters for these actions to fully materialize in the market.\nWe've also taken steps to more frequently adjust the freight rates we charge customers to better reflect market rates.\nIn the past, we only adjusted these rates once or twice annually.\nThe majority of the price mix increase this quarter reflects these product and freight pricing actions, with favorable mix contributing only modestly.\nThis quarter's gross profit decreased by $18 million as the benefit of increased sales was outweighed by higher manufacturing and transportation costs per pound.\nDouble-digit inflation in commodities and transportation costs accounted for nearly 90% of the cost per pound increase.\nOf these two factors, commodities played a larger role, led again by edible oils, particularly canola oil, which nearly doubled compared to the same quarter last year, as well as ingredients like wheat and starches used in batter and other coatings, and containerboard and plastic film for packaging.\nFreight costs increased, especially for ocean freight and trucking, as global logistics networks continued to face challenges.\nOur costs also rose due to an unfavorable mix of higher-cost trucking versus rail to meet service obligations for certain customers.\nAs Tom noted, we also experienced higher costs per pound compared to last year due to additional expenses and inefficiencies caused by lower production rates and throughput at our factories, resulting in fewer pounds to cover fixed overhead.\nLost production days and unplanned downtimes were primarily due to labor shortages across our manufacturing network, including COVID-related absenteeism.\nWhile the cost drivers in the first two quarters of the year have been largely consistent, we began to see initial benefits from our pricing and cost-mitigation actions discussed in our previous earnings call during the second quarter.\nAs a result of these efforts, our gross margin increased sequentially by 500 basis points to over 20% compared to the first quarter.\nAlthough pricing actions provided the larger boost to the sequential improvement in gross margins, our production rates and throughput also improved, mainly due to our efforts to stabilize factory labor.\nWhile still below average, labor retention rates showed modest improvement compared to the first quarter, and the number of new applicants has remained steady.\nWith increased stability, we were able to increase factory throughput.\nAdditionally, our portfolio optimization efforts are yielding benefits.\nWe've eliminated underperforming SKUs to streamline our portfolio and boost factory throughput.\nWe've also successfully collaborated with our major customers to secure changes in product specifications, mitigating some of the operational impact of this year's poor potato crop quality.\nIn summary, although our run rate and cost structure are not yet at desired levels, we're pleased with the significant sequential progress made this quarter and believe we're well-positioned to navigate the challenging near-term environment of increased costs and poor potato crop quality.\nShifting focus from cost of sales.\nOur SG&A increased by $7 million this quarter, primarily due to two factors.\nFirst, it reflects higher labor and benefit costs, as well as increased sales commissions associated with higher sales volumes.\nSecond, it includes a $2.5 million increase in advertising and promotional expenses as we increased support for our retail products.\nWhile these expenses have increased compared to last year, they remain below pre-pandemic levels.\nThe rise in SG&A was partially offset by reduced consulting expenses related to improving our commercial and supply chain operations as those projects concluded, as well as fewer expenses in the current quarter related to the design of a new enterprise resource planning system.\nWe incurred approximately $2 million in ERP-related expenses this quarter, primarily consisting of consulting fees.\nThis is down from about $5 million in similar expenses in the same quarter last year.\nWe plan to resume our efforts in the second half of fiscal 2022 to design the next phase of our new ERP system.\nDiluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.22, a decrease of $0.44.\nAbout $0.28 of this decline was related to costs associated with redeeming and writing off previously unamortized debt issuance costs for senior notes originally issued during our spin-off from ConAgra in November 2016.\nWe've identified these costs as items affecting comparability in our non-GAAP results.\nExcluding the impact of these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.50, a decrease of $0.16 due to lower income from operations and equity method earnings.\nTurning to our segments.\nOur global segment's sales increased by 9% this quarter.\nPrice mix rose by 5%, reflecting a balance of higher freight charges, pricing actions related to customer contract renewals, and inflation-driven price escalators.\nVolume increased by 4%.\nThe volume increase was driven by higher shipments to large chain restaurant customers in North America, while logistics constraints limited our international shipments.\nOverall, the global segment's total shipments continued to exceed pre-pandemic levels.\nThe global segment's product contribution margin, which is gross profit minus A&P expenses, decreased by 13% to $81 million.\nHigher manufacturing and distribution costs per pound outweighed the benefits of favorable price mix and increased sales volumes.\nWe will now discuss our foodservice segment.\nRevenue grew by 30%, with volume increasing 22% and price/mix rising 8%.\nThe sales volume increase was driven by recovering demand from smaller restaurant chains, independent eateries, and non-commercial customers.\nPrice mix improvement resulted from initial product and freight pricing actions implemented earlier this fiscal year, as well as favorable mix.\nFoodservice product contribution margin increased 19% to $104 million, as positive price mix and higher sales volumes outweighed increased manufacturing and distribution costs per pound.\nLet's move on to our retail segment.\nPrice mix rose 5%, reflecting early benefits from pricing actions in our branded portfolio, higher freight charges, and improved mix.\nSales volume decreased 4% as branded product volume growth was offset by reduced private label shipments, due to losses in certain low-margin business.\nRetail shipments were also affected by industry-wide supply chain constraints and production disruptions mentioned earlier.\nRetail product contribution margin fell 29% to $21 million.\nThe decline was caused by higher manufacturing and distribution costs per pound, a $2 million increase in A&P expenses, and lower sales volumes.\nRegarding our liquidity and cash flow.\nOur liquidity remains strong.\nAt the end of the first half of fiscal 2022, we had nearly $625 million in cash and $1 billion available on our undrawn revolver.\nIn the first half, we generated over $205 million from operations.\nThis is approximately $110 million less than the same period last year, primarily due to lower earnings.\nWe invested almost $150 million in capital expenditures during the first half, continuing construction of our chopped and formed expansion in American Falls, Idaho and new processing lines in American Falls and China.\nWe're working hard to manage material, equipment, and labor availability issues to keep our capital projects on schedule.\nIn the first half, we returned $145 million to shareholders, including nearly $70 million in dividends and $76 million in share repurchases.\nThis includes $50 million of share repurchases in the second quarter alone.\nWe recently announced a 4% increase in our quarterly dividend rate, amounting to about $144 million annually, and a $250 million increase to our current share repurchase plan, demonstrating our confidence in the long-term potential of our business.\nWe now have approximately $344 million authorized for share repurchases under the updated plan.\nDuring the quarter, we redeemed and issued nearly $1.7 billion of senior notes.\nThis increased our average debt maturity from four to over seven years and reduced our annual interest expense by about $8.5 million.\nWe remain committed to our capital allocation priorities.\nOur primary focus is reinvesting in our business, both organically and through M&A.\nWe then aim to return free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases over time.\nRegarding our updated outlook.\nWe still expect our full-year sales growth in fiscal 2022 to exceed our long-term target of low to mid-single digits.\nWe anticipate price mix in the third quarter will increase sequentially compared to the 6% rise in the second quarter, as previously announced product pricing actions continue to take effect across our core segments.\nWe expect volume growth in the third quarter to slow compared to the 6% growth in the second quarter due to COVID variants impacting restaurant traffic and demand, ongoing industry supply chain constraints and labor challenges affecting production, and global logistics disruptions and container shortages impacting domestic and export shipments.\nWe anticipate further deceleration in the fourth quarter as we begin to compare against higher volumes from the previous year.\nRegarding earnings, we continue to expect net income and adjusted EBITDA including joint ventures will face pressure throughout fiscal 2022 due to significantly higher potato costs in the second half, resulting from the poor crop, double-digit inflation for key inputs and freight, and higher SG&A expenses.\nFor the full year, we expect our gross margin to be 600 to 700 basis points below our pre-pandemic rate of 25% to 26%, suggesting a target range of 18% to 20%.\nThis is a revision from our previous outlook of 17% to 21%.\nWe narrowed the range for several reasons.\nWe're confident about the implementation of our product and freight price increases.\nWe expect to build on the progress made in the second quarter to stabilize our supply chain operations and achieve savings through our cost-mitigation efforts.\nHowever, we anticipate that improvements in our operations and costs will be gradual, reflecting broader labor market challenges likely to persist through fiscal 2022.\nWe also have a clearer understanding of the net cost impact from this year's exceptionally poor potato crop.\nWe'll begin to see the full financial impact of the poor potato crop in the third quarter, continuing through most of the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\nWe expect SG&A expenses to increase by $100 million to $110 million in the third and fourth quarters as we begin planning the second phase of our new ERP project.\nEquity earnings will likely remain under pressure due to input cost inflation and higher manufacturing costs in Europe and the U.S.\nWe project interest expense to be around $110 million, excluding the $53 million associated with redeeming senior notes in the second quarter.\nThis is lower than our previous estimate of approximately $115 million.\nOur estimates for total depreciation and amortization expense of about $190 million, an effective tax rate of approximately 22%, and capital expenditures of around $450 million remain unchanged.\nIn summary, we're seeing the benefits of our pricing actions, which led to sequential improvements in our top line and gross margin this quarter.\nAlong with pricing actions, we're progressing with our cost-mitigation initiatives, positioning us to manage the impact of the poor crop.\nFor fiscal 2022, we continue to expect net sales growth above our long-term target of low to mid-single digits, and we've narrowed our previous target gross margin rate based on our sales and cost outlook.\nTo conclude, we're pleased with our progress this quarter and are taking appropriate steps in pricing and supply chain operations to navigate this challenging environment.\nWe're on track to meet our targets for the year and believe we'll return to pre-pandemic profit levels after the impact of the poor crop subsides in the first half of fiscal 2023.\nWe remain committed to investing in growth and creating long-term value for our stakeholders.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The year commenced exceptionally well, with our first-quarter consolidated net income reaching $64.4 million and earnings per share at $0.59\nThese figures represented increases of 93% and 90% respectively compared to the same period last year, driven by improved performance in both our utility and banking sectors\nDuring Q1, Hawaiian Electric saw benefits from ongoing savings generated by the comprehensive cost management initiative launched last year\nThese savings will be reflected in customer rates starting June, and along with other timing factors, we anticipate the utility will remain within the full-year guidance range announced in February\nAmerican's Q1 performance demonstrates effective execution in a climate that remains difficult for bank profitability\nOur results were enhanced by a release of provisions as we continue to prudently manage credit in Hawaii's improving economic landscape\nAs Greg will elaborate, we're revising our bank guidance and consolidated HEI guidance upward for the year to reflect this improvement\nWe're observing a strengthening local economy as Hawaii continues to effectively manage the virus and vaccine distribution progresses\nUnemployment decreased to 9% in March\nThough still above the national average, it's trending positively, having fallen from a peak of nearly 24% a year ago\nWe've witnessed substantial growth in tourism arrivals this year\nRecently, we've had several days where arrivals have neared pre-pandemic levels\nCurrently, almost all our arrivals are from the U.S. mainland, as the COVID situation and vaccination efforts abroad have been more challenging than domestically\nHawaii's real estate fundamentals are robust and continue to support the conservative portfolio mix at the bank\nFrom January to March, Oahu's sales volumes increased by 19% for single-family homes and 53% for condos\nMedian prices also rose by 17% to $950,000 for single-family homes and 4% to $450,000 for condos\nIn its March outlook, the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization expedited its forecast for the state's economic recovery by 18 months, now projecting GDP growth of 3.7% in 2021 and 3.1% in 2020\nHawaii's COVID-19 cases have remained significantly lower than the mainland\nAs of May 6, the seven-day rolling average was 94 for the state, ranking fifth lowest per capita among U.S. states\n40% of our residents are now fully vaccinated, with over half having received at least one dose\nWhile this is promising, we're aware that we're still in the early stages of Hawaii's economic recovery, and uncertainty remains regarding the pandemic's trajectory\nAt the utility, our main priorities continue to be cost efficiency, transitioning to the new PBR framework, and advancing our clean energy future\nWe and our stakeholders are adapting to the new PBR framework, designed to align our interests as we collaborate to increase renewable energy and decarbonize our economy in an affordable, reliable, resilient, and equitable manner\nOur dedication to cost efficiency positions us favorably as we transition into PBR\nThe utility has successfully implemented efficiencies and achieved savings to fulfill our management audit savings commitment and the customer dividend\nWe'll begin returning these savings to customers through the Annual Revenue Adjustment (ARA) when PBR takes effect on June 1\nCost management will remain a priority as we operate under PBR\nWe've been collaborating with stakeholders to finalize the new PBR performance incentive mechanisms (PIMs), as well as the scorecards and metrics we'll report on going forward\nWe anticipate the PUC will soon issue an order outlining the parameters of the new PIMs\nAs we've previously stated, achieving our shared clean energy and decarbonization goals must be done in a \"kakou\" manner, a Hawaiian term meaning it requires everyone working together\nWe're striving to bring projects from Hawaii's largest-ever renewable energy and storage procurement online as quickly as possible\nWe are fully committed to this endeavor, which is challenging given the number of projects, the scale of this procurement relative to our small system, community considerations, land constraints, and the need to ensure reliability on isolated island grids\nWe're actively collaborating with independent power producers, government agencies, and other stakeholders to overcome obstacles and expedite project completion\nLast week, the PUC instructed us to establish regulatory liabilities to track costs to customers resulting from delays in commercial operations of approved Stage 1, Stage 2, and CBRE Phase 1 projects\nAlthough we don't believe we're liable for any amount, we think the PUC's intention may be to track rather than record costs before a determination is made\nConsequently, we'll be seeking reconsideration or clarification\nLast week, the PUC also conditionally approved our agreement for the Kapolei Energy Storage project, a standalone battery project that will help ensure reliability when the Oahu coal plant retires and enable integration of more renewable energy\nWhile technically an approval, the order imposes conditions that may prevent us and the developer from proceeding with this project\nThe regulatory process allows us to voice our concerns to the PUC, and we'll be filing a motion for reconsideration on Monday\nAnother key focus is accelerating the addition of more distributed energy resources (DERs) and demand response\nOn May 3, we submitted our recommendations to achieve this acceleration while emphasizing the importance of equity and fairness in program design\nWe're advancing programs to benefit all customers, including expanding our community solar program, proposing a rooftop rental program, and procuring aggregated grid services from DERs\nGrid modernization is crucial for facilitating faster deployment and effective use of demand response and DERs\nIn March, the PUC approved our proposal to shift from an opt-in to an opt-out approach for advanced meters in targeted areas, allowing us to deploy advanced meters more rapidly and thus enabling operational efficiencies and more advanced rate programs\nRegarding the bank, American continues to perform well in a challenging environment\nIn Q1, we maintained strong mortgage production and deployed an additional $150 million of ASB CARES or Paycheck Protection Program loans to support small businesses in round two of that program\nYear-to-date, that amount has increased to over $170 million\nRecord deposit growth, largely driven by federal stimulus, continues to outpace lending opportunities in this early stage of Hawaii's economic recovery\nWe're taking a balanced approach to managing our portfolio, optimizing fee income and loan portfolio growth in a low interest rate environment\nWhile net interest margin remains under pressure, record-low funding costs and balance sheet growth are helping increase net interest income in line with our expectations\nThe release of credit loss reserves in our first quarter reflects our customers' resilience and the improving credit risk environment as Hawaii's economy starts to recover.\nWe are maintaining a conservative approach in managing our credit loss reserves.\nAmerican has maintained its efforts to control costs, resulting in reduced noninterest expenses in Q1 while investing in our anytime, anywhere banking transition.\nThe bank's increased profitability is enabling a higher dividend payment to HEI.\nWe're speeding up our digital transformation to allow customers to bank with us at any time and place.\nCurrently, 44% of deposits are made through self-service channels like ATMs and mobile, which is more than twice the pre-pandemic levels.\nCustomer satisfaction has improved across all channels during this period.\nWe're upgrading our digital offerings to simplify banking for our customers.\nThis includes new online financial wellness tools, upgrading ATMs, improving our mobile app, expanding online services, and opening digital centers where our staff will assist customers with digital banking solutions.\nGreg will now present our financial results and outlook.\nGreg, please take it from here.\nLet's review our first quarter results.\nConsolidated earnings per share were $0.59 compared to $0.31 in the same quarter of the previous year.\nBoth the utility and bank showed strong performance, demonstrating the resilience of our company and Hawaii's economy, which is showing signs of strengthening recovery.\nThe utility's earnings reflect reduced O&M expenses due to cost-cutting efforts and delayed generation overhauls, along with increased revenues from our annual rate adjustment mechanism, including timing-related charges for target revenue recognition to eliminate seasonal impacts.\nThe bank benefited from releasing credit loss provisions as certain credits improved, and we observed stable credit trends amid an improving economic outlook.\nWhile the holding company's loss aligns with expectations, we increased charitable contributions during the quarter, including a $2 million donation to support our community during challenging times.\nCompared to the same period last year, consolidated trailing 12-month ROE improved by 80 basis points to 10%.\nUtility ROE increased by 160 basis points to 9%, and bank ROE, which we assess on an annualized basis, was 16%.\nThe utility outlook remains unchanged, but ROE expectations will be affected by management audit savings and customer dividend, as O&M cost reductions that improved quarterly earnings will be used to reduce customer bills under PBR.\nThe utility's net income for the quarter was $43.4 million, compared to $23.9 million in Q1 2020.\nThe main factors contributing to the variance were $10 million lower O&M expenses compared to Q1 last year.\nThree key factors led to lower O&M: reduced staffing and improved efficiency from ongoing cost management; timing-related items, including higher bad debt expense in Q1 2020 due to COVID-19, which has since been deferred; and fewer generating facility overhauls, some of which will occur later this year.\nThere were also higher costs in 2020 related to an increased environmental reserve and increased outside service costs for the PBR docket and other customer service projects.\nIn addition to lower O&M, we saw a $5 million revenue increase from higher rate adjustment mechanism revenues; a $4 million revenue increase due to timing of target revenue recognition, which will have no net impact on 2021 and is due to a change in methodology eliminating seasonality in recognizing target revenues within the year; a $1 million lower enterprise resource planning system implementation benefit to be passed on to customers; and $1 million lower nonservice pension costs due to a reset of pension costs in rates following a final rate case decision.\nThese were partially offset by $1 million higher depreciation.\nRegarding utility performance drivers for the rest of the year, we don't expect significant contributions from performance incentive mechanisms in 2021.\nWe currently have about $22 million in COVID-related costs, primarily bad debt expense, accrued in a deferred regulatory asset account.\nWe will continue deferring COVID-related costs through June 30.\nThe moratorium on customer disconnections is in place until May 31, 2021, and we continue to work with customers on extended payment plans and other bill assistance options.\nWe plan to file a separate application for cost recovery once actual costs are known.\nWe will also file a request to continue deferring COVID-related costs beyond June 30.\nAs mentioned, our O&M expense benefited from the timing of overhauls.\nWe expect some of these overhauls to occur later this year, in line with our annual guidance.\nThe utility's ability to achieve accelerated management audit savings commitment is a key driver of O&M expenses.\nThe utility is on track to achieve the savings needed to meet the annual $6.6 million commitment, which will be returned to customers starting June 1.\nUtility capital investments for the quarter, approximately $60 million, were lower than planned due to unexpected delays.\nSome delays were caused by extended repairs at one of our substations, limiting work on other parts of the electric system.\nWe also experienced additional design work requirements for T&D projects, COVID travel limitations, and meter deployment delays affecting our grid modernization work.\nDespite these delays, we still expect to meet our utility capital investment plan for 2021.\nWe are maintaining our capex and rate base growth guidance from the previous earnings call, expecting 2021 capex of about $335 million to $355 million, reflecting rate base growth of 4% to 5%.\nRegarding the bank, ASB's net income for the quarter was $29.6 million, compared to $15.7 million last quarter and $15.8 million in Q1 2020.\nThe increase primarily reflected moderation of the elevated credit risk environment as Hawaii's economy begins to recover, and results benefited from a release of credit loss reserves, which I'll discuss further.\nNet interest income reflects the impact of strong deposit growth, lower loan demand, and increased growth of our investment portfolio.\nNoninterest income benefited from strong mortgage origination and sales, in line with plan despite being below the prior year's quarter.\nNoninterest expense remained in line with the plan as ASB continues to focus on strategic investments to drive efficiency and productivity.\nASB's net interest margin compressed 17 basis points during the quarter.\nNIM was 2.95% compared to 3.12% in Q4 2020.\nThe low interest rate environment and record deposit growth both contributed to NIM compression.\n$3.1 million in fees from PPP lending and a record low cost of funds helped mitigate pressure on asset yields.\nThe mean expense of capital decreased by 0.01% from the previous quarter and 0.16% from the year before, reaching 0.08%\nWe anticipate ongoing challenges due to low interest rates and excess liquidity resulting from strong deposit growth and reduced reinvestment yields\nAs a result, we're adjusting our NIM guidance range to between 2.80% and 3%\nWe expect that growth in the balance sheet should still result in net interest income meeting yearly projections\nIn Q1, the bank reduced its provision for credit losses by $8.4 million, compared to increases of $11.3 million in Q4 and $10.4 million in Q1 of the previous year\nThis change reflects improvements in commercial loan credit ratings, decreased exposure to riskier but profitable consumer unsecured loans, and lower net charge-offs as Hawaii's economy begins to recover and the credit risk environment improves\nASB's net charge-off ratio for the quarter decreased to 0.18%, down from 0.36% in Q4 and 0.44% in Q1 2020\nNonaccrual loans increased slightly to 1%, up from 0.89% in Q4 and 0.90% the previous year\nWe maintain a cautious stance as we observe Hawaii's economic recovery\nOur allowance for credit losses, at 1.73% at the end of the quarter, was the highest among our Hawaiian peers\nWe are observing positive trends in loan deferrals across ASB's portfolio\nAlmost all deferred loans have resumed regular payment schedules\nCurrent active deferrals make up only 0.2% of the total loan portfolio\nWe have seen a decrease in delinquencies in the higher-risk commercial and consumer portfolios\nWhile there has been a slight increase in delinquencies in the residential portfolio, it remains low-risk and is secured by appreciating Hawaii real estate\nThese factors have contributed to a reduction in the overall risk profile of our loan portfolio\nASP continues to manage liquidity and capital conservatively, maintaining sufficient liquidity and robust core capital ratios\nThe bank has access to approximately $4 billion in available liquidity from various reliable sources\nASB's Tier one leverage ratio of 8.33% was well above the required level for being considered well-capitalized\nLooking ahead, given our portfolio's lower risk profile, we plan to manage closer to an 8% or higher Tier one leverage ratio while aiming for competitive profitability metrics, growth in ASB dividends, and maintaining a strong capital position\nWe anticipate higher bank dividends to HEI this year than previously indicated in our February guidance, due to ASB's strong performance, outlook, and efficient capital structure\nWe now project dividends of approximately $50 million to $60 million, up from the previously estimated $40 million\nFor the quarter, the ASB Board has approved a $23 million dividend to HEI\nWe do not currently anticipate the need to issue any external equity in 2021 at HEI unless we identify significant additional accretive investment opportunities\nWe are dedicated to maintaining an investment-grade profile\nAt the utility, we're pleased to report recent credit rating upgrades by S&P to BBB flat and Moody's to Baaone, both with stable outlooks\nRegarding our guidance, we're reaffirming our previously issued utility guidance\nAlthough the utility had a strong first quarter, we'll be returning cost savings to customers starting June 1 and expect additional overhauls later in the year\nAdditionally, while the first quarter benefited from higher revenues due to a methodology change to remove seasonality in recognizing target revenues, some of that will reverse later in the year\nHowever, we are revising our banking consolidated guidance\nOur updated guidance is $0.67 to $0.74 per share, increased from our prior guidance of $0.52 to $0.62\nWe're adjusting our NIM expectations at the bank to 2.8% to 3%, down from 2.90% to 3.15%\nThe impact on net interest income should be offset by balance sheet growth\nGiven improving credit dynamics and outlook for the Hawaii economy, we now expect provision to range from $0 to $10 million, which we believe remains appropriately conservative given continued uncertainty for the economy until we see increased vaccination levels and the eventual return of international travel\nWe anticipate that stronger bank profitability will lead to consolidated earnings growth as well as increased bank dividends to the holding company\nWe're raising HEI earnings per share guidance to $1.90 to $2.05 per share\nI'm proud of our employees' dedication and our companies' resilience as we continue to provide essential electricity and banking services and deliver solid financial results while helping Hawaii achieve its ambitious climate goals and recover stronger\nWe recently published our second consolidated ESG report, which includes our ESG priorities and our first Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures-aligned reporting\nWe're evaluating the implications for our companies of the Biden administration's goal to reduce carbon emissions by 50% from a 2005 baseline by 2030\nWe believe our goals and plans in Hawaii and our ongoing efforts position us well to achieve a net-zero future\nWe're updating our planning and analysis, and we'll provide further updates in the future\nLastly, we bid farewell to Rich today as he departs American to pursue other opportunities\nRich achieved significant accomplishments during his more than 10 years leading American\nRich leaves American in excellent condition, as demonstrated by ASB's strong first quarter earnings and Greg's earlier comments\nUnder Rich's leadership, ASB has grown its assets, expanded its customer base, products and services, and improved operational efficiency\nHe and his team have provided excellent customer service and simplified banking for customers\nAnn Teranishi, currently the bank's Executive Vice President of Operations, will succeed Rich as President and CEO later today\nAnn is a strong, collaborative leader with extensive banking industry knowledge and a 14-year track record of success at American\nWe look forward to Ann's leadership\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Additional details can be found in our latest annual Form 10-K report, subsequent quarterly Form 10-Q reports, and other SEC filings.\nI'm glad to join you today.\nLabcorp continues to fulfill its mission of enhancing health and lives by utilizing scientific advancements, cutting-edge technology, and innovative approaches.\nThis enables us to implement our strategy, deliver robust results for stakeholders, and effectively address global issues such as the pandemic.\nOur company concluded an exceptional 2021 with another impressive quarter, setting the stage for continued success in 2022 and beyond.\nIn Q4, we generated $4.1 billion in revenue, achieved $6.77 in adjusted earnings per share, and produced $548 million in free cash flow.\nFor the entire year, we recorded $16.1 billion in revenue, $28.52 in adjusted earnings per share, and $2.6 billion in free cash flow.\nOur core business continued to improve during the quarter, with diagnostics and drug development revenues growing by 8.8% and 8.2% respectively.\nIn the diagnostics sector, core business organic volume increased as both specialized and routine procedures saw year-over-year growth.\nThe drug development division finished the year with a solid trailing 12-month net book-to-bill ratio of 1.25 and a robust backlog of $15 billion, representing a $579 million increase from the third quarter.\nFurthermore, decentralized clinical trial awards increased by 62% compared to the previous year.\nShifting focus to the pandemic.\nOur ongoing response exemplifies how innovation can drive success.\nFor almost two years, Labcorp has devoted substantial resources to curbing the spread of the virus.\nWe are proud of our accomplishments so far, although the emergence of variants like Omicron and surges in infection rates indicate that our work is not complete.\nWe continue to utilize Labcorp's comprehensive capabilities to expand testing access, identify and monitor new variants, and advance vaccine and treatment development.\nIn the fourth quarter, COVID testing volumes exceeded expectations.\nTo date, we have conducted over 74 million COVID tests, with approximately 8.6 million performed in the fourth quarter.\nThis increased demand persisted into the new year, although current volume is significantly lower than in December or January.\nEven during the latest surge, COVID PCR test results were typically available within one to two days on average.\nAs we have done throughout the pandemic, we are maintaining high capacity levels to respond quickly to spikes in testing needs.\nWe continue to invest in equipment, increased staffing levels, and our supply chain.\nAdditionally, we remain prepared and staffed to support further drug development work for vaccines, including boosters or additional therapies.\nThe company's COVID-related innovations during the quarter included the introduction of observed self-collection for COVID PCR testing at over 1,000 patient service centers.\nAt the beginning of the fourth quarter, we announced FDA Emergency Use Authorization for a combined COVID and flu at-home collection kit.\nThese offerings reflect our efforts to make COVID testing faster, easier, and more accessible.\nNow I'll discuss our enterprise strategy, where we made significant progress in 2021.\nI'll provide a few highlights to give you an idea of our growth and forward momentum.\nIn oncology, we made substantial progress in strengthening our position as a leader by expanding diagnostic offerings and clinical trial opportunities.\nSimultaneously, we fulfilled our commitment to improve access to cancer care.\nLast year, we established our oncology business unit and introduced our enterprise oncology offering.\nGenomic profiling of tumors is crucial for identifying the most effective targeted therapy for oncology patients.\nIn December, we announced our agreement to acquire Personal Genome Diagnostics (PGDx).\nThe company has a strong portfolio of innovative liquid biopsy and tissue-based products that complement our existing capabilities.\nThrough PGDx's kitted solutions, we can provide oncologists access to tumor profiling at the hospitals where patients are treated or centralized to one of our laboratories.\nThese solutions may also enable us to expand tumor profiling globally to help our pharmaceutical sponsors find the right novel treatment for patients.\nWe anticipate the transaction will close in the first quarter of this year.\nOther exciting additions to our oncology test menu included clonoSEQ, the first and only FDA-cleared test for monitoring residual blood cancer, and OmniSeq INSIGHT, a pan-cancer tissue-based sequencing test for individuals with late-stage solid tumors.\nAll of these offerings can assist physicians in making more informed treatment decisions for their patients and help bring new cancer medicines to market.\nIn 2021, we intensified our customer focus and integrated technology and data throughout our business.\nThis included enhancements to the patient experience in our service centers.\nThese upgrades aimed to create a seamless journey from appointment scheduling to service center visits to easier access to results.\nOur acquisition of Ovia Health strengthened our position as a vital source of information for women's health, which we support through diagnostic, genetic, and specialty testing expertise as well as clinical trials.\nWe will continue to identify opportunities to enhance Ovia Health's innovative platform that provides family planning, pregnancy, and parenting support.\nAdditionally, we began deploying Labcorp Diagnostic Assistant.\nThis new tool delivers a detailed view of a patient's lab history along with clinical insights directly to the point of care to inform diagnostic decisions.\nWe opened an automated kit production line in Belgium in the spring.\nIn the fourth quarter, we opened an integrated laboratory in Singapore, which enhances our bioanalytical services in the Asia Pacific region.\nJust this month, we announced the launch of Labcorp OnDemand, which builds on the success of Pixel by Labcorp.\nThis suite of health tests and services offers easy and convenient access to a wide variety of trusted tests.\nIt's another way that Labcorp is meeting people where they are and offering more options for people to stay healthy.\nThroughout the year, we pursued numerous opportunities with long-term and high-growth potential.\nWe accomplished this through tuck-in deals and strategic acquisitions including: OmniSeq, Ovia Health, PGDx, and Myriad Autoimmune's Vectra test, which analyzes biomarkers to measure rheumatoid arthritis.\nYesterday, we announced a comprehensive strategic agreement with Ascension, one of the largest health systems in the United States.\nThrough our new long-term relationship with Ascension, we will manage its hospital-based laboratories in 10 states, and we will purchase select assets of its outreach laboratory business for approximately $400 million.\nThe projected annual revenue for the first year from the merged hospital business and laboratory asset acquisition is anticipated to range between $550 million and $600 million.\nInitially, operating margins are expected to be lower than segment margins, but they are projected to improve annually.\nThe deal is predicted to boost our earnings and cash flow in the first year and should recover its capital costs by the second year.\nThis represents a significant opportunity for us and is one of the most important transactions of its kind in the industry.\nIt broadens our clinical services across multiple states nationwide and builds upon our proven history of establishing similar partnerships.\nThe agreement with Ascension also highlights our capacity to assist health systems in navigating industry-wide changes.\nAs part of our collaboration, we will investigate clinical trial and oncology opportunities that improve patient access to care.\nWe are enthusiastic about this new partnership and look forward to welcoming new team members to Labcorp.\nWe have also entered into agreements with other hospitals and health systems, including North Memorial Health based in Minnesota.\nWe remain enthusiastic about our strong merger and acquisition pipeline and anticipate more activity in the coming months.\nIn 2021, we delivered top-quality service to our customers and patients, and made significant investments in our workforce.\nLabcorp has consistently received recognition for the impact of our work and the value we place on our employees.\nWe were once again included in Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies.\nFor the fifth year in a row, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation named Labcorp as the best workplace for LGBTQ+ equality.\nNewsweek also recognized us as one of America's most responsible companies for 2022.\nIn 2021, our management and board of directors, along with external advisors, conducted a thorough review of our organizational structure and capital allocation strategy.\nAs part of our comprehensive structural review, we engaged in extensive discussions with third parties and considered a wide range of options, including major acquisitions, divestitures, spinning off businesses, and merging those businesses with strategic partners.\nThe board unanimously determined that the company's current structure best serves the interests of all stakeholders at this time.\nNevertheless, we maintain that Labcorp's shares are undervalued in the market.\nTo address this, we have announced several initiatives aimed at increasing shareholder value.\nThese initiatives include introducing a dividend starting in the second quarter of 2022 and implementing a $2.5 billion share repurchase program, with $1 billion being repurchased on an accelerated basis.\nWe are also launching a new LaunchPad business improvement initiative targeting $350 million in savings over the next three years.\nToday, in addition to providing guidance for 2022, we will also share a longer-term outlook.\nBeginning with our first quarter results, we will offer additional business insights through enhanced disclosures.\nGoing forward, we are dedicated to achieving profitable growth through investments in science, innovation, and new technology.\nAs we implement our strategy, management and the board will continue to explore all avenues for enhancing shareholder value.\nIn summary, our strong core business performance, combined with significant progress on our strategic priorities in 2021, positions us for long-term success.\nThis gives us great confidence in our longer-term, growth-oriented outlook, which Glenn will discuss along with our 2022 guidance.\nI am proud of the achievements of the Labcorp team in 2021 and am excited about the future as we continue to deliver value for all our stakeholders.\nI will begin my remarks by reviewing our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment, our full-year guidance for 2022, and conclude with our longer-term outlook through 2024.\nThe quarter's revenue was $4.1 billion, representing a 9.7% decrease compared to the previous year due to a 10.3% decline in organic revenue and 0.1% from divestitures, partially offset by 0.6% from acquisitions and a 10 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency translation.\nThe 10.3% decrease in organic revenue was caused by a 15.3% reduction in COVID testing, partially mitigated by a 5% increase in the company's organic base business.\nThe quarter's operating income was $731 million, or 18% of revenue.\nWe incurred $93 million in amortization and $79 million in restructuring charges and special items during the quarter.\nExcluding these items, the quarter's adjusted operating income was $902 million, or 22.2% of revenue, compared to $1.4 billion or 31.8% in the previous year.\nThe decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to reduced COVID testing.\nExcluding COVID testing, the base business experienced higher adjusted operating income and margins compared to the previous year's base business, due to organic growth and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by increased personnel costs.\nThe quarter's tax rate was 19.3%.\nThe adjusted tax rate, excluding restructuring charges, special items, and amortization, was 24.6% compared to 24.8% in the previous year.\nLooking ahead, we continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 25%, excluding any impact from potential tax reform.\nThe quarter's net earnings were $553 million, or $5.75 per diluted share.\nAdjusted earnings per share, which exclude amortization, restructuring charges, and special items, were $6.77 in the quarter, down from $10.56 in the previous year.\nOperating cash flow for the quarter was $698 million, compared to $775 million a year ago.\nThe decrease in operating cash flow was due to lower cash earnings, partially offset by favorable working capital.\nCapital expenditures totaled $150 million, compared to $99 million in the previous year.\nAs a result, free cash flow for the quarter was $548 million, compared to $675 million in the previous year.\nDuring the quarter, we used $1 billion of our cash flow for our accelerated share repurchase program and invested $171 million in acquisitions.\nNow, I will review our segment performance, starting with diagnostics.\nThe quarter's revenue for diagnostics was $2.6 billion, a 16.9% decrease compared to the previous year due to a 17.8% decline in organic revenue, partially offset by 0.7% from acquisitions and a 20 basis point favorable impact from foreign currency translation.\nThe decrease in organic revenue was due to a 21.8% reduction in COVID testing, partially offset by a 4.1% increase in the base business.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for base business revenue was 5%, primarily due to organic growth.\nTotal volume decreased by 8.7% compared to the previous year, as organic volume decreased by 8.9%, partially offset by 0.3% acquisition volume.\nThe decrease in organic volume was due to a 14.6% decline in COVID testing, partially offset by a 5.7% increase in the base business.\nPrice mix decreased by 8.2% compared to the previous year due to a 7.2% reduction in COVID testing and a 1.6% decrease in the base business, partially offset by 0.5% from acquisitions and 0.2% from currency.\nDiagnostics organic base business revenue growth was 7.2% compared to its base business in the previous year, with 8.1% coming from volume, partially offset by a 1% decline in price mix.\nThe decrease in pricing mix was mainly attributed to the rebound of our Canadian operations, which have a lower average order price.\nThe adjusted operating income for diagnostics in the quarter was $776 million, representing 29.6% of revenue, compared to $1.2 billion or 39.1% in the previous year.\nThe reduction in adjusted operating income and margin was caused by a decrease in COVID testing.\nCOVID testing margins declined compared to the previous year, primarily due to a volume decrease of about 50%, while the company maintained its capacity.\nBase business margins improved compared to last year, driven by organic base business growth and LaunchPad savings, partially counterbalanced by increased personnel expenses.\nDiagnostics successfully achieved its target of delivering approximately $200 million in net savings from its three-year LaunchPad program.\nI will now examine the performance of the drug development segment.\nThe quarterly revenue was $1.5 billion, a 3.9% increase from last year, due to organic base business growth of 7.9% and acquisitions of 0.3%, partially offset by a 4% decrease in COVID testing performed through its centralized business and divestitures of 0.3%.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for base business revenue was 9.9%, mainly driven by organic growth.\nThe segment's adjusted operating income was $206 million, or 14.2% of revenue, compared to $248 million or 17.8% in the previous year.\nThe decline in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to reduced COVID testing.\nIn the base business, higher personnel and other inflationary costs, as well as investments in oncology capabilities, were partially offset by organic growth and LaunchPad savings.\nWe continue to exclude the enterprise component of drug development bonus expense, which is reflected in corporate unallocated and amounted to $11 million for the quarter.\nAlthough margins decreased in the quarter, they improved for the full year compared to 2020, and we anticipate further margin increases in 2022.\nFor the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remained strong at $7.3 billion and 1.25, respectively.\nThe backlog at the quarter's end was $15 billion, an 8.7% increase compared to last year.\nWe expect approximately $5 billion of this backlog to be converted into revenue over the next 12 months.\nI will now discuss our 2022 guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of December 31, 2021, for the full year.\nThe guidance includes the slowdown we experienced in January due to Omicron, which we expect to recover throughout the rest of the quarter.\nThe enterprise guidance also incorporates the impact of currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted for acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividends, which we will initiate in the second quarter.\nWe anticipate enterprise revenue to decline between one and a half to six and a half percent compared to 2021.\nThis guidance range includes the expectation that the base business will grow seven and a half to 10%, while COVID testing is expected to decline 60% to 75%.\nWe expect diagnostics revenue to decrease between 11 and a half to 17 and a half percent compared to 2021.\nThis guidance range includes the expectation that the base business will grow three and a half to 6%.\nCOVID testing revenue is projected to decline 60% to 75%.\nAt the midpoint of our base business guidance range, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 would be 4.4%, primarily driven by organic growth in both volume and price mix.\nWe anticipate drug development revenue to increase 7% to 9.5% compared to 2021.\nThis guidance includes the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 40 basis points.\nThe guidance range also includes the expectation that the base business will grow seven and a half to 10% compared to 2021.\nGiven the available capacity in diagnostics, we've assumed that no COVID testing will be performed in the drug development central lab business in 2022.\nWe expect to benefit from broad-based growth across all three businesses, contributing to continued margin improvement in the segment.\nAt the midpoint of our base business guidance range, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 would be 11.3%.\nOur adjusted earnings per share guidance is $17.25 to $21.25 compared to 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $28.52.\nThe adjusted earnings per share guidance reflects the expectation of lower COVID testing in 2022, while the base business continues to grow profitably.\nFree cash flow is projected to be between $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion compared to $2.6 billion in 2021.\nI will now discuss our longer-term outlook, which reflects our current view of the business from 2022 to 2024.\nWe expect enterprise base business organic revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4% to 7% compared to 2021.\nWe also anticipate revenue growth from acquisitions to represent additional annual growth of 2% to 3%.\nWe expect diagnostics base business organic revenue to grow at a two and a half to four and a half percent CAGR compared to 2021.\nThis outlook is higher than historical growth, driven by a continued recovery in our base business relative to 2021, broad-based growth including hospitals and health systems, and the lower incremental impact of PAMA in the outlook period.\nWe anticipate drug development base business organic revenue to grow at a 7% to 10% CAGR compared to 2021.\nThis outlook is higher than our historical growth, and we have added capacity and inorganic investments in the last few years in our faster-growing early development and late-stage clinical businesses.\nAs we continue to prioritize profitable growth, we expect enterprise margin expansion of 30 to 50 basis points on average annually through the outlook period compared to 2021, which was approximately 14 and a half percent.\nThis margin expansion is partly due to the company's LaunchPad initiative, which is expected to deliver $350 million of cost savings over the time period to help offset inflationary costs.\nWe expect adjusted earnings per share to grow at an 11% to 14% CAGR compared to 2019 adjusted earnings per share of $11.32.\nWe continue to use 2019 as the base year comparison for earnings growth to better reflect the earnings potential of the company excluding COVID testing.\nThe adjusted earnings per share outlook reflects the expectation that both base businesses will continue to grow profitably organically.\nAdditionally, we expect to benefit from capital allocation directed toward accretive acquisitions and share repurchases while maintaining our targeted gross debt leverage of two and a half to three times.\nFor additional comparison purposes, we've included in the supplemental deck on our investor relations website a view of 2021 fourth quarter and full year results, 2022 guidance, and our longer-term outlook.\nIn conclusion, the company delivered another quarter of strong performance.\nWe remain committed to playing a crucial role in response to the global pandemic while also growing our base business.\nFor 2022, we expect to drive continued profitable growth in our base business, while COVID testing volumes are anticipated to decline throughout the year.\nFurthermore, our longer-term outlook is expected to deliver double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth driven by top-line growth, margin improvement, and capital allocation.\nWe will now take questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Today, you will hear prepared statements from each of them\nJim will present an overview of the financial situation and provide a strategic update, while John will give an operational summary and Devina will delve into the financial details\nJohn will elaborate on our performance in terms of yield and volume, which generally refers to internal revenue growth or IRG from yield or volume, unless otherwise specified\nDuring the presentation, Jim, John, and Devina will talk about operating EBITDA, which is defined as income from operations before depreciation and amortization\nAll comparisons will be made against the third quarter of 2020, unless stated differently\nNet income, EPS, operating EBITDA and margin, operating expenses, and SG&A expense results have been adjusted to exclude certain items that management believes do not accurately reflect our core business performance or operational results, in order to improve comparability\nThese adjusted measures, along with free cash flow, are considered non-GAAP measures\nVisit wm.com for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures and non-GAAP projections\nThe time-sensitive information provided during this call on October 26, 2021, may not be accurate at the time of a replay\nOur third-quarter results showcased the exceptional cash-generating ability of our business model, as we produced nearly $1.2 billion in cash from operations\nOur strong performance puts us on track to achieve the higher full-year financial outlook we provided last quarter, despite facing some of the highest inflation rates in years, along with labor and supply chain constraints\nAlmost every sector of the economy, including government and private businesses, has been impacted by these unprecedented inflationary and supply chain challenges\nThis surge in inflation intensified throughout the third quarter, during which we experienced approximately $60 million in labor inflation and about $100 million in inflation across other operating cost categories\nOur overall underlying labor inflation for the third quarter was 8.7%\nThat's the challenging aspect\nThe positive aspect is that the business continues to perform well, as evidenced by our expectation to finish the year within our previously adjusted operating EBIT raise, adjusted operating EBITDA, and free cash flow guidance ranges\nWe anticipate exceeding our prior revenue range due to effective price execution and improving volumes\nJohn, Devina, and I will discuss our short-term and medium-term strategies to address these labor and inflationary pressures\nAs expected, our disciplined pricing strategies are the primary tool to combat cost inflation\nOur pricing programs achieved a core price of 4.6% and collection and disposal yield of 3.5% in the third quarter\nThe residential line of business continues to show outstanding performance with a yield of 5%, while MSW yield improved to 3.5%\nHowever, it's important to note that price escalations for about 40% of our revenue are linked to an index, often based on the previous year's performance, resulting in a delay in adjusting index pricing when costs increase as rapidly as they have\nIt's crucial to understand that a portion of the remaining 60% of our business won't receive the full 7% to 10% price increases we believe are necessary to cover rising costs until their next price increase cycle\nFor example, a customer who received a 4% increase in May won't get the full cost recovery price increase until the following May\nNevertheless, we're observing a favorable pricing environment across our open market businesses, as evidenced by our lowest level of rollbacks in over a decade\nWe're intensely focused on directly addressing the labor challenges\nJohn will discuss the quarterly impact and our immediate actions to address this issue\nStrategically, we view this acute challenge as an opportunity to accelerate the automation of certain jobs\nWe've previously stated that we consider the automation of certain high-turnover positions as both a competitive advantage and a risk-mitigation strategy in today's labor market, where certain jobs no longer attract the interest they once did\nRecent examples include the customer setup role, which we've just finished fully automating, and the 35-plus percent reduction in labor we've seen where we've upgraded and rebuilt our single-stream recycling plants\nGiven the success of these rebuilds and the recent labor inflation challenges, we've accelerated the retooling of the remaining single-stream plants and expect to address 90% of single-stream volume by the 2023-2024 timeframe\nIn the quarter, we observed some of the positive impacts of those new single-stream plants in our outstanding performance in our recycling business\nRecycling earnings and margins reached record levels, propelled by high demand for recycled materials and excellent performance from new cutting-edge Material Recovery Facilities.\nOur renewable energy division also delivered impressive results, with continued robust growth driven by increased Renewable Identification Number sales and higher pricing.\nWM is ideally positioned to assist current and future clients with their evolving sustainability requirements, thanks to our extensive experience, ongoing growth in sustainability solutions, and unmatched asset network.\nThere is a growing demand for recycled content as our customers increasingly seek circular solutions for their materials.\nWe've increased the amount of plastics we recycle by 25% since 2019, due to our emphasis on extracting more plastic from the waste stream.\nOur annual sustainability report, released earlier this month, highlights recycling and renewable energy as two key growth areas.\nThe report details WM's progress towards our sustainability goals and outlines investments made to advance our sustainability efforts.\nThis year's report specifically highlights the individuals behind WM's progress over the past year and their contributions to caring for customers, neighbors, the environment, and communities across North America.\nThe quarter's key takeaway is that we achieved higher-than-anticipated volume and revenue growth, positioning us favorably for 2022.\nWe successfully navigated an unexpectedly severe and rapidly evolving challenge from inflation, supply chain issues, and labor shortages, while still expecting to meet our 2021 guidance targets.\nThis challenge provides an opportunity to take more decisive action in strategic areas such as automation, sustainability, and workforce planning, further distinguishing ourselves in the industry.\nThey continue to excel, driving another quarter of double-digit growth in revenue, operating EBITDA, and free cash flow.\nDespite a challenging operating environment, our team continues to perform exceptionally well, generating over 7% organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business during the third quarter.\nThis growth, combined with the ongoing integration of Advanced Disposal, resulted in a more than 14% increase in operating EBITDA.\nAs Jim mentioned, we're experiencing pressure on labor and other cost categories, which we're addressing through pricing strategies, controllable cost management, efficiency improvements, and workforce planning.\nAdjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenue rose by 180 basis points to 62.2% in the third quarter due to inflationary costs, supply chain constraints, and stronger-than-expected volume growth.\nThe costs associated with hiring and training new employees particularly impacted labor expenses in the third quarter.\nOvertime hours also increased as the team adjusted to meet higher-than-anticipated collection volumes.\nWe anticipated much of this labor pressure affecting our costs and proactively made market wage adjustments earlier in the year to address potential labor shortages and meet growing demand.\nWe're also working to automate various roles where we foresee long-term challenges in attracting and retaining employees.\nIn the residential sector, we're still working through the final 40% of our routes, including those from ADS that aren't fully automated, while remaining highly selective about the business we take on, as evidenced by our yield and volume results in the third quarter and recent years.\nWhile we're now incurring costs related to these investments, we're only beginning to see the benefits.\nThe labor market and supply chain constraints intensified in Q3, coupled with robust volume growth, have also added pressure to our fleet operations.\nRepair and maintenance costs are rising as we hire additional technicians and incur overtime hours to address the continued strong volume growth in our collection lines of business.\nWe've also had to temporarily reintroduce some of our higher-cost trucks to meet volume demands.\nAdditionally, our third-party subcontractors at transfer stations are facing similar pressures and passing on increased costs to us.\nOverall, efficiency in the collection business improved in the third quarter when adjusting for increased training hours.\nThe core aspects of our business remain strong, and we're committed to recovering cost increases through pricing, removing the most expensive trucks from service, and reducing the most costly hours of the day.\nI'd like to highlight several positive aspects of the quarter.\nRegarding our strong revenue performance, third-quarter collection and disposal volume grew by 3.8%, surpassing our expectations.\nWe continue to observe strong volume driven by economic reopening, with commercial volume up 4.6% and special waste volume up by 16.6%, and we anticipate continued solid performance in the fourth quarter.\nCustomer metrics were also strong during the quarter.\nFor the second consecutive quarter, service increases surpassed service decreases by more than double, and the churn rate was 8.7%.\nNet new business for small and medium-sized business customers has grown by over 10% so far this year.\nThe incorporation of Advanced Disposal is progressing well.\nApproximately 70% of the acquired operations have been integrated into our billing and operational systems, and we expect to transfer almost all ADS customers by year-end.\nWe've reached $26 million in annual run rate synergies in the third quarter, bringing the total for the year to $60 million.\nIncluding the $15 million of annual run rate synergies achieved in Q4 2020, we're on course to hit $100 million by year-end.\nWe anticipate capturing an additional $50 million in 2022 and 2023 through a mix of cost and capital savings.\nAs observed throughout the year, strong volume growth, high recycling commodity prices, and increased collection and disposal core price continued to drive top-line growth beyond expectations in Q3.\nConsequently, we are updating our revenue forecast for the year once again.\nThe company's total revenue growth is now projected to be between 17% and 17.5%, with yield and volume in our collection and disposal business at about 6.5%.\nThis projection also assumes continued strength in recycled commodity prices and RIN values.\nWe are reaffirming our most recent 2021 adjusted operating EBITDA guidance of $5 billion to $5.1 billion, representing an increase of about 17% from the previous year at the midpoint and nearly 5% higher than our initial outlook for the year.\nQ3 SG&A was 9.7% of revenue, showing a 40-basis-point improvement compared to 2020.\nOur results include approximately $16 million in increased digital investments as we develop technology to enhance customer engagement and reduce our long-term cost to serve.\nWe continue to focus on managing our controllable spending, ensuring that we allocate funds to initiatives that will improve our business.\nQ3 net cash provided by operating activities reached $1.18 billion, a 15% increase.\nThe growth in cash from operations continues to be driven by our substantial increase in operating EBITDA, including contributions from the ADS acquisition and lower interest costs.\nDespite a slight unfavorable working capital comparison in Q3, primarily due to the timing of cash from CNG credit and our deferral of payroll taxes in 2020, overall improvements in working capital demonstrate the benefits of the tools we're implementing to enhance our systems and processes.\nCapital spending in Q3 amounted to $464 million, bringing total capital expenditures for the first nine months of the year to $1.13 billion.\nOur 2021 capital spending pace has been slower than planned due to supply chain constraints and extended construction project timelines.\nAs mentioned last quarter, we are proactively advancing capital investment, particularly in recycling, where we anticipate strong returns.\nInvestments in recycling technology and equipment at our MRFs are expected to reach about $200 million for the year.\nWhile we still aim for full-year capital spending at the lower end of our $1.78 billion to $1.88 billion guidance range, 2021 spending could fall below targeted levels, with some expenditures shifted to 2022, mainly due to supply chain constraints.\nWe generated $773 million in free cash flow during Q3.\nThrough September, our business has generated $2.29 billion in free cash flow, putting us on track to meet our full-year target of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion.\nWe've returned over $1.7 billion to shareholders in the first nine months, paying $730 million in dividends and repurchasing $1 billion of our stock.\nWe still expect to repurchase up to our full authorization of $1.35 billion in 2021.\nOur leverage ratio at the end of Q3 was 2.71 times, as our strong business performance and successful integration of the acquired ADS business led to achieving our targeted leverage ratio ahead of schedule.\nAs we approach the end of 2021, our teams are focusing on accelerating our disciplined pricing programs, managing controllable costs, positioning WM as an employer of choice, and capturing growing volumes.\nWe are confident that our strategy will lead to a strong finish for 2021.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Yesterday evening, we disclosed the financial outcomes for the second quarter of our 2021 fiscal year, with reports available in the Investor Relations area of our site.\nTo enhance clarity regarding our operational performance, we utilize certain non-GAAP financial metrics that involve adjustments to the standard GAAP results.\nIt's important to note that any presented non-GAAP financial measurements should not be viewed as substitutes for the financial metrics mandated by GAAP.\nErica will provide an overview of the financial outcomes for both our business segments and corporate operations.\nI'm thrilled with the outstanding operational results we achieved this quarter, as we witnessed continued robust performance across our various business lines.\nThis quarter, we achieved a second consecutive record-breaking adjusted earnings per share of $1.38 and a segment EBIT of $149 million.\nThe adjusted earnings per share saw a 79% increase compared to the second fiscal quarter of 2020, primarily due to strong volumes across all regions, healthy unit margins, meticulous operational execution, and impressive performance in our targeted growth initiatives.\nThe Cabot team exhibited remarkable operational flexibility despite ongoing COVID restrictions, weather-related disruptions, and constraints in global shipping markets.\nThis operational adaptability was made possible by the exceptional efforts of our commercial and supply chain teams, as well as the robustness of Cabot's manufacturing network.\nDuring the quarter, we observed strong volumes in the tire and automotive sectors, along with sustained strength in our infrastructure, packaging, and consumer-driven applications.\nWe're pleased to note improvements in automotive production and passenger car miles driven, although they generally remain below pre-COVID levels.\nConversely, truck miles driven are particularly strong, fueling a substantial replacement tire market.\nWith both automotive and tire markets projected to remain below previous peaks in the 2021 forecast, we're optimistic about our growth potential in the coming years.\nIn the short term, COVID cases remain stubbornly high in certain areas, particularly across Europe, South America, and India.\nWhile vaccines offer hope, the economic recovery is likely to remain uneven and struggle to reach its full potential until the public health crisis is completely resolved.\nRaw material prices continued to rise across most value chains, and our businesses were no exception.\nWe successfully implemented price increases to offset these rising costs, which, combined with favorable product mix, resulted in robust unit margins.\nExamining our major segments, Reinforcement Materials achieved record EBIT performance this quarter with $89 million, driven by strong customer demand and favorable Asia pricing.\nPerformance Chemicals results improved significantly compared to the previous year, with segment EBIT of $58 million versus $31 million last year, as the business achieved double-digit volume growth in both Performance Additives and Formulated Solutions, and benefited from a favorable product mix.\nOverall, I'm very satisfied with how we've navigated the pandemic, and I believe Cabot is emerging from the COVID crisis as a stronger company.\nOur customers increasingly value our global manufacturing footprint, service capabilities, and leading product portfolio.\nAlthough the 2020 recession necessitated a strong focus on cost and cash preservation, we continued to maintain our assets and make crucial investments in sustainability and long-term growth.\nOne of our most exciting growth investments is in the battery sector, and I'd like to provide an update on our progress in this area.\nWe're witnessing a genuine turning point in demand for electric vehicles and energy storage as pressure to reduce greenhouse gases intensifies.\nCabot is well-positioned to support this transition with our leading portfolio of highly engineered, conductive carbon additives and formulation capabilities.\nOur business is showing strong growth this year, and we expect this trend to continue into the future.\nI'll begin with some observations about the overall market.\nLithium-ion batteries are experiencing rapid growth and are expected to maintain a 25% to 30% compound annual growth rate through 2030, with electric vehicles serving as the primary growth driver as countries establish CO2 reduction goals and accelerate the shift away from internal combustion engines.\nFurther technological advancements in batteries are crucial to enabling this transition, and the materials industry will play a vital role in efforts to reduce costs and increase range.\nCabot currently serves this market by offering a variety of materials and formulations for use in energy storage applications.\nThese materials can be categorized into two groups: conductive carbon additives, which include conductive carbon black, carbon nanostructures, and carbon nanotubes, and non-carbon additives, which include products in our fumed metal oxides business.\nAlthough conductive carbon additives comprise a small portion of battery composition, they are crucial to its function.\nThese additives facilitate the movement of electrons into and out of the active phase during battery charging and discharging cycles.\nTwo types of conductivity are necessary for effective performance: short-range and long-range conductivity.\nDifferent shapes and properties of conductive carbon additives provide varying levels of conductivity performance.\nCarbon nanotubes excel in long-range conductivity, while conductive carbon blacks are superior for short-range conductivity.\nConsequently, there is no single ideal additive for this application.\nThe ability to offer various types of conductive carbon additives and their blends is essential to provide customized solutions that meet specific customer needs.\nSeveral factors set Cabot apart in the conductive carbon additive industry.\nWe have established an unparalleled global presence and application expertise to support our customers as they expand manufacturing worldwide.\nIn recent years, we have built a leading technical support team through the establishment of our Asia Technology Center and the R&D capabilities acquired from Sanshun.\nThis expertise, combined with our global manufacturing network, makes us highly attractive to our customers.\nThrough organic growth and strategic acquisitions, including the recent Sanshun purchase, Cabot is the only carbon additive supplier with proven commercial capabilities in conductive carbon black, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanostructures, and dispersions.\nThis diverse range of conductive carbon additives allows us to create tailored solutions for our customers and collaborate on future technologies.\nCabot has a long history of innovation in challenging technical applications.\nOur experience in the CMP market for semiconductors and inkjet printing has provided valuable practices and protocols that will be crucial for the battery market.\nWe anticipate that the battery application will become a significant contributor to the Performance Chemicals segment's financial performance in the coming years.\nThe current market for conductive carbon additives in lithium-ion batteries, including both CNTs and conductive carbon black, is valued at approximately $400 million.\nWe project this market to grow to about $1 billion in value by 2025.\nOur energy materials business is performing well in fiscal 2021, with projected revenue of around $80 million for the year.\nOver the past five years, revenue has grown at a compound annual growth rate of about 50%, including the acquisition of our CNT business in China.\nAlthough we are making substantial investments to drive qualification and enhance our technical capabilities, EBITDA is expected to be between $15 million and $20 million in fiscal year 2021.\nWe are optimistic about the potential of this emerging application and will continue to support customers and capitalize on the opportunities in energy storage.\nI will begin by discussing the results of the Reinforcement Materials segment.\nThe Reinforcement Materials segment achieved record operating results with EBIT of $89 million, a 46% increase compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2020, mainly due to significantly higher volumes across all regions and improved unit margins driven by favorable spot pricing in Asia.\nGlobally, volumes increased by 18% in the second quarter compared to the same period last year, primarily due to 30% growth in Asia and 10% higher volumes in the Americas and Europe.\nHigher volumes were driven by key end market demand that continued to recover from COVID-related impacts in fiscal 2020.\nResults also benefited from higher margins due to continued strong pricing in Asia, which included a second consecutive quarter of price increases ahead of rising feedstock costs.\nLooking ahead to the second half of 2021, we expect volumes to remain strong.\nWe also anticipate higher feedstock cost flow-through in Asia, while fixed costs are expected to increase due to the timing of planned plant maintenance spending, following delayed spending in 2020 and the first half of this fiscal year.\nTurning to Performance Chemicals, EBIT increased by $27 million compared to the second fiscal quarter of 2020, primarily due to strong volumes across the segment and improved product mix, driven by increased sales in automotive applications.\nYear-over-year volumes increased by 10% in Performance Additives and 14% in Formulated Solutions, driven by increases across all our key product lines from higher demand levels and some customer inventory replenishment during the quarter.\nWe anticipate overall volumes to remain robust for the latter half of fiscal 2021\nWe expect a slight decrease in demand for automotive applications due to the semiconductor chip shortage, which will negatively affect product mix compared to the first half of the year\nWe foresee higher fixed costs in the second half of the fiscal year due to the timing of expenditures\nEBIT in Purification Solutions for Q2 2021 decreased by $1 million compared to Q2 2020\nThe decline in demand for mercury removal applications was partly compensated by reduced fixed costs, resulting from the sale of our Marshall, Texas mine and associated long-term supply agreements\nFor the second half of fiscal 2021, we anticipate EBIT improvement driven by seasonally higher volumes\nI'll now discuss corporate matters\nWe concluded the quarter with $146 million in cash and maintain a strong liquidity position of approximately $1.3 billion\nIn Q2 of fiscal 2021, operating activities generated $65 million in cash flow, including an $80 million increase in working capital\nThe working capital increase was primarily due to growth-related networking capital as accounts receivables rose with higher sales and inventory increased from purchases of more expensive raw materials\nQ2 capital expenditures were $40 million, and we expect full-year capital expenditures to be around $200 million\nThis estimate includes ongoing EPA-related compliance spending and capital for upgrading our new China carbon black plant to produce specialty products\nAdditional cash uses during the quarter included $20 million for dividends\nOur year-to-date operating tax rate was 28%, and we project an operating tax rate between 27% and 29% for the fiscal year\nWe are delighted with the record-breaking results in Q2 2021, as volumes continue to recover from the COVID-related lows experienced in fiscal 2020 and excellent execution across the organization\nWe achieved another record-setting quarter in reinforcement materials and very strong results in the performance chemicals segment\nI am pleased with the team's execution throughout the first half of the year\nOur manufacturing plants continue to operate effectively in the COVID environment to meet customer needs\nWe reached an important milestone in our sustainability journey by completing the air pollution control project at our Franklin, Louisiana plant\nWe are progressing with the integration of our CNT acquisition in China, and our inkjet investments are on track to deliver growth in the packaging segment\nWe continue to improve our work methods to drive more efficient and effective processes through digital solutions implementation\nI'm proud of the Cabot team for their efforts to strengthen our foundation and establish our platform for sustainable growth\nRegarding our current outlook, we continue to observe robust and widespread demand globally, including in our key tire, automotive, and industrial end-use markets\nWe believe the underlying demand will remain strong during the second half of the year\nGiven this demand outlook, we expect some impact

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Our consolidated earnings per diluted share decreased from $0.26 in Q2 2020 to $0.20 in Q2 2021.\nYear-to-date consolidated earnings per diluted share increased from $0.98 in 2020 to $1.18 in 2021.\nI'll now hand over to Dennis for further discussion.\nI trust you're having a good summer and keeping safe.\nMost remaining pandemic-related restrictions were lifted in Washington State on June 30.\nWe're pleased to see continued recovery in our local economies.\nWe're observing higher energy consumption and steady customer growth.\nWe're closely monitoring the pandemic situation, including variants and case numbers in our areas, like many other companies.\nWe're prepared to adapt our operations as necessary while continuing to support those in need.\nLet's review some key points from our second quarter performance.\nWe faced a tough second quarter, including an extreme heat wave that brought several days of record-breaking triple-digit temperatures to the region.\nSpokane's temperature reached a new all-time high of 109 degrees on June 29, with even higher temperatures recorded in some neighborhoods.\nOn that day, Avista experienced its highest energy usage in the company's 132-year history due to increased customer demand.\nThe extreme heat and record energy consumption put stress on parts of our electrical system, causing some grid equipment to overheat.\nThe heat affected six of our 140 distribution substations.\nWe implemented protective outages for customers served by the most heat-affected equipment to prevent overloading and avoid extensive, costly damage to our electric system.\nWe managed to reduce customer impact through system adjustments during the event.\nWe thank our customers who experienced outages for their understanding.\nThe extended heat wave led to higher customer energy consumption, which was the main cause of increased net power supply costs, negatively impacting the Energy Recovery Mechanism (ERM).\nThe Pacific Northwest has experienced hotter and drier weather than usual, resulting in reduced hydroelectric generation and higher power prices.\nWe had to rely on more expensive thermal generation and purchased power to meet the additional demand.\nConsequently, Avista Utilities' earnings were lower than expected in the second quarter.\nAEL&P's earnings met expectations for the second quarter and are on track to meet full-year guidance.\nOur other businesses performed well, exceeding expectations due to investment gains and the sale of certain subsidiary assets related to the Spokane steam plant.\nAvista continues to prioritize wildfire resilience.\nOur region has been extremely dry throughout spring and summer, and combined with high temperatures, the wildfire risk is significant.\nAvista has been operating in \"dry land mode\" since late June to reduce the risk of wildfires that could occur when reactivating power lines in response to current conditions.\nUnder typical circumstances, these lines in rural or forested areas are usually reactivated automatically.\nHowever, during the present dry weather, Avista's staff physically inspects the outage area before reactivating a line.\nThis approach may take longer to restore power but reduces the potential fire hazard.\nThis procedure aligns with Avista's wildfire resilience plan, which was introduced last year, expanding on long-standing prevention and response strategies.\nAvista has pledged to implement a comprehensive 10-year wildfire resilience plan that includes enhanced defense strategies and operational practices for a more robust system.\nRegarding regulatory issues, we are satisfied to have reached a unanimous settlement in our Idaho general rate case.\nThe newly established rates are equitable for our customers, the company, and our shareholders, and will enable Avista to continue receiving a fair return in Idaho.\nOur Washington general rate cases are progressing through the regulatory process.\nOur hearings have concluded, and we anticipate a decision by the end of September.\nIn Oregon, we plan to submit a rate case in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nWe are reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance with a consolidated range of $1.96 to $2.16 per diluted share.\nWhile maintaining our consolidated range, we are modifying our 2021 segment ranges by decreasing Avista Utilities by $0.10 per diluted share and increasing other by $0.10 per diluted share.\nFor 2022, we are reducing consolidated earnings guidance by $0.15 per diluted share to a range of $2.03 to $2.23 per diluted share.\nFor 2023, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance with a consolidated range of $2.42 to $2.62 per diluted share.\nAlthough we anticipate challenges in 2022 due to regulatory lag, we are confident in our ability to meet our earnings guidance for 2023 and achieve our allowed return.\nMoving forward, we will maintain our focus on utility operations while making prudent capital investments to maintain and upgrade our infrastructure, ensuring safe, reliable, and affordable energy for our customers and communities.\nEveryone is eagerly anticipating the Blackhawks' next acquisition, which is a Spokane native.\nWe've acquired Tyler Johnson, a two-time Stanley Cup Champion who hails from Spokane.\nWe're quite excited about this development.\nThat concludes your Blackhawks update.\nAs Dennis mentioned, we're reaffirming our 2021 earnings guidance, lowering our utility guidance for 2021 and 2022, and confirming our 2023 consolidated guidance.\nI'll elaborate on our guidance.\nOur projections assume, among other factors, timely and appropriate rate relief in our jurisdictions.\nThis is crucial as we require - as Dennis noted, we've settled our Idaho case.\nWe're still awaiting approval from the commissions, which we expect before those rates take effect on September 1.\nFor 2021, we anticipate Avista Utilities will contribute between $1.83 and $1.97 per diluted share, with the lower end of our guidance for 2021 and 2022 for Avista Utilities primarily due to increased regulatory lag.\nThis is primarily attributed to increased capital expenditures driven by growth and higher-than-anticipated depreciation costs.\nWe believe this is merely a matter of timing, and as we prepare for our upcoming Washington general rate case, to be submitted early in Q1 2022, we anticipate it will be a multi-year rate plan as mandated by new legislation.\nOur aim is to incorporate all capital investments through the end of the rate plan period into rates, striving to achieve our authorized return by 2023.\nFurthermore, as Dennis noted, we have observed an increase in both actual and projected net power supply expenses.\nWhile the midpoint of our guidance range excludes any ERM-related benefits or expenses in Washington, the rise in power supply costs has diminished our chances of reaching the upper half of the guidance range.\nOur current ERM projection indicates a surcharge position within the 90-10 company sharing band, which is expected to reduce earnings by $0.08 per diluted share.\nIt's worth noting that in the previous quarter, our ERM estimate for the year was in a beneficial position, anticipated to contribute $0.06 per diluted share.\nMoreover, we are absorbing additional net power supply costs under the PCA in Idaho.\nFor 2021, as Dennis mentioned, we anticipate AEL&P will contribute between $0.08 and $0.11.\nWe've raised the range in our other businesses by $0.10, effectively counterbalancing the utility reduction, largely due to a range of $0.05 to $0.08 per diluted share resulting from investment gains and the profit from the Spokane Steam Plant sale.\nOur guidance typically only accounts for normal operating conditions and excludes unusual or non-recurring items until their effects are known and certain.\nLet's now discuss the earnings for the second quarter.\nAvista Utilities contributed $0.11 per diluted share, down from $0.26 in 2020.\nCompared to the previous year, our earnings declined due to higher net power supply costs, as Dennis mentioned, mainly caused by increased customer demand during the heat wave and lower-than-normal hydroelectric generation due to hot and dry conditions.\nOur hydroelectric generation is approximately 91% of our normal expectations for this year.\nThe ERM in Washington also experienced a significant shift.\nWe recorded a pre-tax expense of $7.6 million in Q2 2021, compared to a pre-tax benefit of $0.4 million in 2020.\nYear-to-date, we've recognized $3.3 million in expenses for 2021, compared to $5.6 million in benefits for 2020.\nIn addition to higher power supply costs, we also incurred increased operating expenses in the quarter, primarily due to the timing of maintenance projects, as many were postponed in 2020 due to COVID-19, whereas in 2021, we resumed our original schedules and conducted maintenance in the second quarter.\nThe increased maintenance costs were partially offset by lower bad debt expense as we continue to defer bad debt through our COVID-19 regulatory deferrals.\nLet's now discuss capital expenditures.\nAs Dennis mentioned, we remain committed to investing necessary capital in our utility infrastructure.\nWe currently project Avista Utilities to increase capital expenditures to $450 million in 2021, $445 million in 2022, and $445 million in 2023.\nThis represents increases of $35 million in 2021, and $40 million each in 2022 and 2023.\nThese increases are primarily to support continued customer growth.\nOur customer growth rate is approximately 1.5%, up from previous expectations of 0.5% to 1%.\nWe plan to issue about $140 million in long-term debt and $90 million in common stock, including $16 million already issued through June for common stock in 2021.\nThe increase in long-term debt and common stock issuance is intended to fund the higher capital expenditures.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Arnold Donald, the President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc, is speaking.\nI'm accompanied on this call by our Chairman, Micky Arison, CFO David Bernstein, and Beth Roberts, Senior VP of Investor Relations.\nWe're ecstatic to resume our core business of providing exceptional, unforgettable vacation experiences to our customers.\nOur staff members are delighted to be back on the ships, which is evident in the fantastic experiences our guests are having.\nThe onboard spending by guests is exceeding expectations, and our customer satisfaction scores are remarkably high.\nI've recently visited several ships in the United States and overseas.\nThe vessels are in pristine condition, and the crew is full of enthusiasm.\nThere's a remarkable atmosphere on board.\nOur safety measures have been effective, starting with a smooth boarding process, allowing us to increase occupancy levels rapidly as we bring more ships back into service.\nOur brands have performed exceptionally well in this initial return to service phase, despite significant international travel restrictions limiting our usual diverse itinerary options, as well as operational requirements in certain areas that restrict our typically high occupancy levels.\nOur itinerary planners devised innovative deployment alternatives, our marketing team made them accessible with minimal investment, our yield managers priced them appropriately to reach occupancy targets, and paired them with package deals to drive exceptionally high onboard revenue.\nDespite the additional safety measures, our crew delivered an outstanding guest experience.\nThis combination allowed us to offer cruise vacations on a large scale while generating significant cash from these modified voyages.\nWhile we don't usually share this level of information, we wanted to give you an idea of why we consider the restart highly successful, beyond the enthusiasm of our guests and crew and the unprecedented customer satisfaction scores.\nIt was challenging because most of our voyages, while cash flow positive, were programs that couldn't be compared to 2019 and would typically be priced lower than the 2019 alternatives.\nFor instance, in the UK, we could only offer cruises for seniors without any port stops, which were not comparable in ticket prices to peak season Mediterranean or Baltic sailings offered in summer 2019.\nNevertheless, even with occupancy restrictions, these cruises generated cash for our stakeholders.\nThey facilitated the return of our workforce and successfully served guests, resulting in high satisfaction levels.\nFor Carnival Cruise Line, we were able to offer itineraries more comparable to 2019, with revenue per passenger day up 20% compared to 2019, including the impact of incentives from previous cancellations, despite the last-minute nature of the bookings.\nIn fact, Carnival Cruise Line restarted more ships from U.S. ports than any other cruise brand and still achieved over 70% occupancy, all of which combined to generate an even greater cash contribution.\nCarnival Cruise Line continues to be a top-performing brand.\nAlthough the Delta variant and its impact on consumer confidence has created numerous operational challenges for us to navigate in the short term and led to some booking volatility in August, it hasn't significantly affected our overall plan to return our entire fleet to guest operations by spring 2022.\nIn our previous quarterly update, we anticipated a dynamic environment, which has indeed been the case.\nAdaptability has been crucial for us over the past 18 months, and we continue to manage aggressively to optimize our performance in this ever-changing landscape.\nWhile we're not yet at full occupancy by design, we have individual sailings with over 4,000 guests.\nSo far this year, we've carried over half a million guests.\nOn any given day, we're successfully hosting around 50,000 guests, and we expect this number to increase as we introduce more capacity and increase occupancy in the coming months.\nThe Delta variant has certainly impacted our protocols, which will continue to evolve based on local conditions.\nIn markets like the U.S. with higher case counts, we've quickly implemented additional safety measures, such as extra testing requirements and indoor mask mandates, with all U.S. sailings operating under CDC vaccination requirements.\nOur protocols exceed the terms of the conditional sailing order and are much stricter than comparable land-based alternatives.\nOur top priority remains compliance, environmental protection, and the health, safety, and well-being of everyone - our guests, the people in the communities we visit and serve, and of course, our Carnival family, both onboard and onshore.\nThe Delta variant has also disrupted our supply chain, affected the timing of destination openings, and created increased uncertainty, reflected in the broader travel sector and our booking trends.\nWe quickly adjusted our deployment by postponing the start date for some select voyages.\nFor some of our more exotic winter itineraries, like our popular world cruises, we rebooked guests for our 2023 departures.\nWe've effectively managed our near-term capacity to optimize the current environment, as we said we would.\nThe changes we've made to our fleet rollout pace will optimize our cash position in the short term.\nLooking ahead, we're still working towards resuming full operations by spring, in time for our crucial summer season when we generate most of our operating profit.\nWe have sufficient liquidity to see us through to full operation.\nWe continue to focus prudently on cash management to ensure flexibility under various scenarios.\nThe current environment, while unpredictable, has improved significantly since last summer and should improve further by next summer if vaccine rollout and therapeutic advancements continue at their current pace.\nIn markets like the UK, where vaccination rates are already higher, consumer confidence remains strong, and we're seeing positive momentum.\nWe've announced the resumption of guest cruise operations for 71 ships across eight of our nine brands through next spring.\nWe're evaluating the remaining ships through next spring, focusing on maximizing future cash flow while providing an excellent guest experience that prioritizes public health.\nEven at this early stage of our rollout, our ships are generating positive cash flow.\nBased on our current rollout plan, we expect the company's overall cash from operations to turn positive early next year.\nLooking ahead, we believe we have the potential to generate higher EBITDA in 2023 compared to 2019, given our modest growth rate, additional capacity, and improved cost structure.\nRegarding booking trends, we're well-positioned to build on a solid book position and intentionally constrained capacity for the rest of 2021 and into the first half of 2022.\nHere are the paraphrased sentences:\nGiven current demand and limited capacity, we are concentrating on maintaining prices.\nDespite recent uncertainty from the Delta variant impacting travel decisions broadly, we continue to hold prices steady.\nWe've made future cruise bookings available earlier for 2023, seeing strong demand and favorable pricing for these advance reservations.\nBuilding on that success, we've begun offering 2024 sailings even sooner.\nThese initiatives contributed to a $630 million rise in customer deposits, particularly long-term deposits.\nDeposits for bookings over 12 months out are triple historical levels, partly due to our proactive efforts to offer more future inventory.\nWe anticipate guest deposits will keep growing as we resume more ship operations and increase occupancy.\nThese positive trends persist despite significantly reduced marketing expenditures.\nWe're focusing on cost-effective channels like direct marketing to our extensive database of over 40 million past guests, and leveraging media coverage from new ship launches and restart news.\nMost crucially, we are delivering excellent guest experiences.\nPersonal recommendations remain the primary reason people take their first cruise.\nAs mentioned, our Net Promoter Scores are exceeding historical averages on ships that have resumed service.\nWe continued our track record of responsible financial management this quarter.\nWe completed two refinancing transactions, among other efforts, significantly reducing annual interest expenses.\nWe have numerous refinancing opportunities ahead and are pursuing them aggressively.\nImportantly, we've made further progress in our sustainability initiatives.\nWe recently published our 11th Annual Sustainability Report, \"Sustainable from Ship to Shore,\" available on our sustainability website.\nThe report expands on our 2020 goal achievement, detailing our 2030 goals and 2050 aspirations.\nIt highlights six focus areas guiding our long-term sustainability vision, including climate action, circular economy, sustainable tourism, health and well-being, diversity and inclusion, and biodiversity conservation.\nThese areas align with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.\nClimate action is a top sustainability priority.\nWe aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.\nDespite 25% capacity growth, our absolute carbon emissions peaked in 2011 and will remain below those levels.\nWe're working to transition to alternative fuels and investing in low-carbon technologies.\nDue to the pause in operations, 2020 sustainability metrics aren't comparable to previous years.\nHowever, the report contains valuable information on our sustainability progress despite an incredibly challenging year.\nCOVID-19 severely impacted our company, but I'm proud of our collective efforts to sustain our organization through these difficult times, including our actions for guests, stakeholders, and our Carnival family.\nI believe our pandemic response demonstrates our company's sustainability.\nI again express deep gratitude to our shipboard and shoreside team members who consistently went above and beyond.\nI'm humbled by the dedication shown over the past 18 months.\nWe continue to make positive progress.\nThroughout the pause, we've proactively prepared to resume operations as an even stronger company.\nOur strategic decision to retire 19 ships has left us with a more efficient fleet, reducing our capacity growth to about 2.5% annually from 2019 through 2025, down from 4.5% pre-COVID.\nWe've strategically rebalanced our portfolio through ship exits, transfers, and newbuild schedule adjustments to optimize asset allocation, maximize cash generation, and improve return on invested capital.\nWhile capacity growth is limited, we'll benefit from exciting new ships across our brands, capitalizing on pent-up demand and generating enthusiasm around our restart.\nWe'll achieve structural cost benefits in 2023 by introducing larger, more efficient ships while retiring our least efficient vessels.\nWith our aggressive actions, optimized portfolio, and reduced capacity, we're well-positioned to capitalize on pent-up demand and emerge as a leaner, more efficient industry leader.\nWe've secured sufficient liquidity to sustain us until full operations resume.\nOnce fully operational, our cash flow will primarily drive our return to investment-grade credit over time, creating greater shareholder value.\nI'll begin with an overview of our guest cruise operations and third quarter monthly average cash burn rate.\nThen I'll update you on booking trends and conclude with insights into our refinancing activities.\nRegarding guest cruise operations, it's wonderful to discuss operations again.\nWe began the quarter with only five ships in service.\nDuring Q3, we successfully restarted ships across eight brands.\nWe ended the quarter with 35% of our fleet capacity in service.\nWe plan to restart 27 more ships in Q4 and December.\nBy New Year's Day, we anticipate having 55 ships, or nearly 65% of our fleet capacity, back in service.\nFor Q3, occupancy was 54% across operational ships.\nOur brands performed exceptionally well.\nOccupancy increased progressively throughout the quarter, reaching 59% in August from 39% in June and 51% in July.\nOur North American brands' occupancy reflects our policy of vaccinated cruises, which currently limits the number of families with children under 12 who can sail with us.\nOur European brands' occupancy is affected by capacity restrictions, including social distancing requirements for Continental European brands and a 1,000-person limit per sailing for part of the quarter in the U.K. In the third quarter, North American brands had 68% occupancy, while European brands had 47%.\nDespite current limitations on itinerary offerings, which excluded many high-yielding, destination-rich routes offered in 2019, revenue per passenger cruise day in the third quarter of 2021 increased compared to a strong 2019.\nAs Arnold mentioned, our guests are having an excellent experience, resulting in exceptionally high Net Promoter Scores.\nSatisfied guests typically lead to improved onboard revenue.\nOur onboard and other revenue per day increased significantly in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2019, partly due to bundled packages and onboard credits used by guests from cruises canceled during the pause.\nWe saw substantial growth in onboard and other per diem revenue on both sides of the Atlantic.\nThe main contributors to onboard revenue increases were bar, casino, shops, spa, and Internet services.\nIn the past two years, we have offered more bundled package options, which our guests have increasingly chosen.\nWe will continue to see the benefits of these bundled packages in onboard and other revenue, as we did in the third quarter of 2021.\nThe distinction between passenger ticket revenue and onboard revenue is becoming less clear due to these bundled packages.\nFor accounting purposes, we divide the total price paid by guests between these two categories.\nThe best way to evaluate our performance is by looking at our total cruise revenue metrics.\nAs previously indicated, the ships in service during the third quarter were cash flow positive.\nThey generated nearly $90 million in ship-level cash contribution.\nThis was achieved with only a two-month U.S.-based restart during the third quarter, as our North American brands began guest cruise operations in early July.\nWe anticipate the ship-level cash contribution to increase as more ships return to service and we improve our occupancy percentages.\nFor those modeling our future results, it's important to note that ship operating expenses per available lower berth day (ALBD) in 2022 are projected to be higher than in 2019, despite the benefit of 19 smaller, less efficient ships leaving the fleet. This is due to the cost of part of our fleet being in pause status during the first half of 2022, restart-related expenses, and the cost of maintaining enhanced health and safety protocols.\nKeep in mind that because part of the fleet will be in pause status during the first half, we are spreading costs over fewer ALBDs.\nWe expect most of these costs and expenses to end with 2022 and not recur in fiscal 2023.\nOur monthly average cash burn rate for the third quarter of 2021 was $510 million, which was better than our previous guidance and in line with the $500 million per month for the first half of 2021.\nThe improvement compared to our guidance was due to the timing of capital expenditures, which are now likely to occur in the fourth quarter, and some other minor working capital changes.\nWith certain capital expenditures now shifting to the fourth quarter, the company expects its monthly average cash burn rate for the fourth quarter to be higher than the monthly average rate for the first nine months of the year.\nOther positive factors affecting the fourth quarter include restart expenditures to support not only the 22 ships restarting during the fourth quarter but also additional ships restarting in the first quarter of 2022, along with a significant increase in dry dock days during the fourth quarter, driven by the restart schedule.\nAll these expenditures have been anticipated, and given the announced restarts, many are now occurring in the fourth quarter.\nWe are forecasting positive cash flow from the 50 ships that will have guest cruise operations during the fourth quarter.\nALBDs for the fourth quarter are expected to be 10.3 million, which is approximately 47% of our total fleet capacity.\nRegarding booking trends, our booking volumes for all future cruises during the third quarter of 2021 were higher than booking volumes during the first quarter.\nThis trend continued over the first couple of months of the third quarter, leading us to expect that the third quarter would end with higher booking levels than the second quarter. However, we achieved this despite lower booking volumes in August when the Delta variant impacted travel and leisure bookings generally.\nThe impact on bookings in August was primarily seen on near-term sailings, but it quickly stabilized within the month.\nOur cumulative advanced book position for the second half of 2022 is ahead of a very strong 2019 and has reached a new historical high.\nPricing for our second half 2022 bookings is higher than pricing for 2019 sailings at the same time, driven partly by the bundled pricing strategy for several of our brands, excluding the dilutive impact of future cruise credits (FCCs).\nIncluding the dilutive impact of FCCs, pricing for our second half 2022 bookings is now in line with pricing for 2019 sailings at the same time.\nThis improved position results from positive pricing trends we observed during the third quarter.\nThis is a significant achievement, considering that pricing for 2019 sailings is a challenging comparison as it was the high watermark for historical yield.\nRegarding our refinancing activities, we are focusing on pursuing opportunities to extend maturities and reduce interest expenses.\nTo date, through our debt management efforts, we have reduced our future annual interest expense by over $250 million per year.\nWe have completed cumulative debt principal payment extensions of approximately $4 billion, improving our future liquidity position.\nThe $4 billion extension results from three actions: first, the July refinancing of 50% of our first lien notes for $2 billion; second, the completion of European debt holiday amendments, which deferred $1.7 billion of principal payments (to be made over a five-year period beginning in April 2022); and third, the extension of a $300 million bilateral loan with one of our banking partners.\nLooking ahead, given the support from debt capital market investors and commercial banks, we will pursue additional refinancing opportunities to significantly reduce our interest expense and extend our maturities over time.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Our keynote presenters today are our President and CEO Mark Parrell, Chief Operating Officer Michael Manelis, and Chief Financial Officer Bob Garechana.\nWhether you're performing essential maintenance or concierge duties on-site, engaging with potential clients remotely using our new contactless leasing system, or working from home in various corporate roles that keep Equity Residential running smoothly, you're helping our company continue to operate.\nLet's now discuss our business operations.\nThe past seven weeks can be best characterized as resilient.\nWe collected approximately 97% of our usual cash intake from our residential business in April.\nAlthough no sector of our nation's economy will be completely shielded from the impending recession, we believe our property portfolio, with residents earning an average annual household income of $164,000 and often employed in technology and other knowledge-based industries, will perform comparatively well.\nOur operations team has also demonstrated resilience.\nWhen the pandemic reached its peak in mid-March, Michael Manelis and his team swiftly adapted, significantly modifying our leasing and service operations over a few weeks.\nMichael and his team quickly developed a contactless process for leasing that made our customers feel at ease.\nIn terms of service, we concentrated on essential maintenance tasks and cleanliness, helping our current residents feel secure and comfortable living with us during this pandemic.\nMichael will provide more details about all of this shortly.\nWhen lockdowns were first announced, our leasing activity decreased significantly, but demand has since increased, as mentioned in our release.\nWe view this recent uptick in demand as further evidence that our properties and markets will continue to be attractive living options for our target demographic.\nOverall, we believe our people and properties have shown resilience with a capital R throughout this crisis.\nWe've further strengthened our already robust balance sheet, as Bob Garechana will explain shortly.\nWe're also actively preparing for our properties to operate with fuller staffing as lockdowns across the country are eased.\nWe'll keep the safety of our employees and residents in mind as we restructure our business.\nEquity Residential has historically performed well during downturns, and we expect this time to be no different.\nWe're optimistic about our operational performance given these circumstances and anticipate opportunities to add high-quality assets to our platform as the economy navigates through this recession.\nLastly, we withdrew guidance in our release.\nWe're unable to accurately estimate the ongoing impact of the pandemic and the timing and nature of the reopening process on our business.\nThis makes it impossible to provide the high-quality near-term business projections you're accustomed to receiving.\nWe've provided substantial information on April's preliminary results, which we hope is helpful.\nToday, I'll offer a brief summary of our operations over the past 45 days.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, we had a strong start to the year.\nOur occupancy was exceeding expectations, and we were well-prepared for the main leasing season.\nThen COVID-19 struck, forcing us to adapt our operations to this unprecedented challenge.\nI'd like to begin by recognizing the dedication and hard work of our employees during these extraordinary times.\nTheir ability to quickly adjust operations while maintaining a strong focus on our customers, properties, themselves, and their families is truly inspiring.\nGovernors in our markets mandated shelter-in-place orders in early to mid-March.\nFor us, this meant that our more than 150,000 residents began staying at home 24/7.\nIn response to the shelter-in-place orders, we implemented several key operational changes.\nWe shut down shared facilities, enhanced sanitization, and swiftly adapted our website and AI responses to shift the entire sales process online.\nUsing video content and virtual sales conversations enabled us to maintain business operations without interruption.\nThis transformation would typically have required several months to complete.\nWe restricted access to the office to promote social distancing while keeping the business operational by implementing staff rotations to reduce on-site employee numbers.\nComparing mid-March to the same period in 2019, we observed a 50% decrease in traffic and applications.\nNevertheless, we continued to receive over 375 new applications weekly through March's end, which we interpret as a validation of our new leasing approach.\nWith fewer visitors coming through the front entrance, we've prioritized retaining current residents.\nWe're currently offering residents the opportunity to renew their leases without any increase in rent.\nOverall, retention rates in April and May have improved, with renewals now in the mid to upper 60% range, representing a 300 basis point increase from last April and nearly 800 basis point increase from last May.\nNew York is showing the strongest renewal rates, approaching 70% for March, April, and May.\nDespite this positive retention, our overall occupancy has decreased by 130 basis points since March 31.\nWe anticipate the impact on occupancy to be most significant in the second quarter, establishing a new baseline from which we hope to see improvement as stay-at-home orders are lifted.\nAllow me to provide some insight into April's performance.\nEarly in April, we began to notice an uptick in demand, with both traffic and leasing activity rebounding by nearly 30% and now trending similarly to last year.\nIn fact, we received over 900 applications last week, a substantial improvement from the 375 we were averaging in late March, which is very encouraging for us.\nGiven the activity in the past 45 days, we'd like to see that volume increase even more to compensate for the lower demand we experienced in March and to match the higher number of applications we typically receive in May.\nIt's evident that our high-quality, well-situated portfolio continues to attract prospective residents.\nWhile the pandemic is certainly a deterrent, people still need to move due to life changes such as new jobs or relationships.\nOn Page 13, we've reported the first quarter and April monthly pricing statistics by market.\nI'd like to remind everyone that this is just one month of data, and longer periods are usually necessary to establish definitive trends.\nMark highlighted the strength and quality of our resident base.\nThis is demonstrated by the fact that we received a very robust 97% of cash collections in April compared to our March collections.\nThis resilience resulted in a 5.4% delinquency rate, which is quite good given these unprecedented circumstances.\nNotably, Seattle and Denver were our markets with the lowest delinquency at below 3%, while Los Angeles lagged behind at close to 8%.\nThe rest of our markets were clustered around the average.\nWe've also analyzed property types, and in most of our markets, our garden-style or more suburban properties have experienced higher delinquency rates than our mid-rise, high-rise urban locations.\nAs we navigate the ongoing disruptions caused by COVID-19, we remain strategic in our pricing approach.\nAs of today, our base rents are down 4% compared to the same week last year.\nLet me provide some insight into notable markets.\nOverall, Seattle is our strongest market, demonstrating great resilience with limited delinquency and the best overall revenue growth performance in the portfolio.\nNew York presents a mixed picture.\nWhile it boasts the strongest retention of any market, it hasn't exhibited the recovery signs seen in other areas regarding traffic and applications.\nIn the long run, we anticipate the New York market will thrive due to limited new supply and expanding technology companies.\nWe're optimistic that leasing activity will pick up as the heavily impacted New York region overcomes the worst of the pandemic.\nWe began 2020 expecting Los Angeles to face significant challenges due to new supply pressures.\nThe COVID situation will undoubtedly exacerbate this.\nDespite recent improvements in applications, we anticipate this market will continue to struggle with significant pricing pressures as new supply becomes available.\nWhat's our next move?\nWe're currently in the initial stages of adapting our properties for the new reality.\nWe anticipate changes will occur gradually.\nCurrently, the new normal will emphasize enhanced cleaning protocols at properties, redesigning common areas like fitness centers and lounges to ensure social distancing, striking a balance between virtual leasing and customer engagement, and implementing staggered work shifts to limit on-site employee numbers.\nThese are difficult times, but our business is adaptable, and our teams are ready to deliver.\nWe've updated our disclosures to better represent our current business situation.\nWe've done this by providing April operational and collection data, separating our same-store performance into residential and nonresidential categories, and offering updates on liquidity and balance sheet information.\nThis includes revising the schedules on Pages 10 through 12 of the release.\nWe've defined several key terms at the end of the release to ensure clarity and specificity in our disclosure.\nThe new disclosure includes a breakdown of nonresidential operations for our same-store portfolio.\nThis minor component of our business accounts for 4% of total revenues, primarily consisting of ground floor retail and public nonresident parking at our well-situated apartment communities.\nGround floor retail comprises about two-thirds of this 4%, with public nonresident parking making up the remainder.\nAs expected, many retail tenants renting our space have been significantly affected by stay-at-home orders.\nThis is reflected in the 58% April collection rate for all retail, which, while lower than desired, may be higher than many other retail landlords.\nDrugstores, bank branches, and national chains occupying many of these spaces have generally continued paying rent, while local small businesses have struggled.\nFor nonresident parking, we've observed an approximately 30% decrease in parking volume for April due to the lack of public events and increased work-from-home arrangements.\nWe expect this may improve as stay-at-home orders are gradually lifted.\nOur balance sheet ended the first quarter in a strong position with a net debt to normalized EBITDA of 4.9 times and nearly $1.8 billion in liquidity under our revolving credit facility.\nAfter the quarter's end, we further strengthened our position by securing an attractively priced 2.6% or $195 million 10-year GSE loan and selling an asset in the San Francisco Bay Area.\nCurrently, over 84% of our total NOI is unencumbered, with about $150 million in commercial paper outstanding and readily available liquidity exceeding $2.2 billion under our revolving credit facility, which matures in 2024.\nThis liquidity is more than adequate to cover our expected development expenses, minimal debt maturities in 2020, and address our next significant debt maturity in December 2021.\nOur balance sheet is well-prepared to withstand challenges and capitalize on potential opportunities.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The Company has no requirement to revise this data.\nWhitestone's Q2 earnings release and supplementary operational and financial information have been submitted to the SEC and can be accessed on their website in the Investor Relations area.\nWe'll now hear from Jim Mastandrea, Chairman and CEO, who will provide an update on our Q2 results.\nMy comments will concentrate on our achievements.\nI'll discuss the demand factors related to these outcomes, offer insights into our operations and strategic direction, after which Dave will provide financial details for the quarter.\nI'm delighted to begin by stating that we have an excellent business with outstanding properties that we manage efficiently.\nWe experienced a record-breaking second quarter in 2021, maintaining our focus on leasing to drive growth and support our dividends, resulting in a core payout ratio of 41%.\nThis confirms the quality of our portfolio in generating cash flow, enhancing our balance sheet and mitigating risk.\nOur Q2 leasing efforts increased total occupancy to 89.9%, a 120 basis point improvement from Q1, showcasing increased demand from new businesses entering our markets, where typically 15 to 20 new tenants represent a 1% occupancy increase.\nWe attribute this growing interest to various factors, including our properties' location, quality, and maturity, as well as tenants expanding their businesses to multiple Whitestone locations.\nOur properties are also benefiting from population shifts and a strong recovery in Sunbelt markets, where we target properties in densely populated, high-income neighborhoods within the fastest-growing cities in Texas and Arizona.\nWe recorded a net income per share of $0.12, up from $0.03 in the previous quarter and $0.01 from the prior year.\nFFO core per share rose 13% to $0.26 from $0.23 in the previous quarter and increased 18% from $0.22 in the prior year.\nOur improved per-share earnings stem from adding new essential service-focused tenants to our existing base of grocery stores, restaurants, salons, pet care centers, drugstores, banks, financial advisories, medical outpatient centers, health and wellness facilities, and other services.\nWe expanded our asset base organically and through off-market acquisitions of properties we believed had significant potential and would benefit from applying our business model principles and processes, streamlining property management, reconfiguring and redeveloping our community centers, and adding features to attract more visits and extend consumer time at the properties.\nThis is evidenced by an almost 18% increase in foot traffic at our 59 centers during the first half of the year.\nAs an example of projects that increase traffic to our centers, we've installed outdoor misting systems in Arizona for customer comfort during the three hottest months when temperatures can average 100 degrees.\nWe currently manage five million square feet of space, generating $30.6 million in revenue for Q2.\nWe curate the tenant mix within each property.\nWith over 1400 tenants serving customers from surrounding neighborhoods, our properties remain active 18 hours a day, seven days a week.\nA proactive example driving increased visits is the rotation of coffee and cars events at our Market Street property in Scottsdale, Arizona, and our Starwood property in Plano, Texas.\nThese events showcase high-end sports cars and appeal to a wide range of car enthusiasts and families.\nOn a given Saturday each month, we accommodate up to 150 cars at each location, with owners and admirers returning as customers for our local tenants.\nIncreased foot traffic to our centers is a crucial driver of tenant sales and attracts potential new tenants to our properties.\nOur tenants typically occupy around 3,000 square feet of space and provide e-commerce resistant services.\nThey are entrepreneurial businesses that generate sales revenue while keeping the American dream alive, with a tenant profile centered on entrepreneurial risk and financial investment to grow their businesses.\nIn the REIT industry, these tenants are often referred to as small businesses.\nThey make up a large portion of our overall tenant base and recovered more quickly from COVID than some larger tenants.\nThey paid their rent and demonstrated resilience, as owners and founders of local and regional businesses prioritize their companies, which support their families, livelihoods, and futures, aligning with our high collection levels.\nAs they recover, Whitestone reported industry-leading collections, with our model tested and proven during COVID.\nOur culture emphasizes personalized service to tenants, with property managers and associates taking a hands-on approach.\nThis teamwork strengthening Whitestone-tenant relationships gives us a competitive edge over other retail centers in our local neighborhood markets.\nOur service-oriented culture resulted in leasing spreads of 6.8% on new and renewal leases in the second quarter, weighted average.\nWe anticipate this trend continuing, as we secure annual lease increases of 2% to 3% on new and renewal tenant leases and pass through triple net expenses, helping us hedge against inflation.\nAnother source of revenue growth is increasing our leasable square footage.\nExpanding existing properties without additional land costs or development expenses proves highly lucrative.\nOur portfolio contains roughly 230 million in potential development and redevelopment projects that we anticipate will significantly enhance value.\nThe variety of our tenant mix also considerably affects our financial standing.\nFor our company, individual tenants can influence our income by over 2.9%.\nAs our profits grew in the second quarter, we bolstered our financial position and reduced our debt-to-EBITDA ratio by 1.2 turns to 8.2 turns.\nWe've consistently focused on decreasing our debt service leverage.\nWe're also dedicated to reducing our G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue.\nWe're making progress as our asset portfolio grows and our income increases.\nG&A as a percentage of revenue was 14.6% in the second quarter, an improvement from 15.7% the previous year.\nWe resumed our acquisition strategy in July, purchasing Lakeside Market in Plano, an affluent Dallas suburb.\nIt's anchored by HEB, a renowned Texas grocery chain, with their first flagship store in the Dallas area.\nWe acquired Lakeside Market for 53.2 million, with significant potential from leasing the current 19% vacant space, increasing rental rates, and developing additional pad sites to expand leasable area.\nWe're currently negotiating with other property owners in our target markets of Dallas, Austin, Houston, and Phoenix.\nLong-time property owners in our markets recognize the benefits of diversifying risk across a large portfolio of quality properties, gaining liquidity through stock sales, and receiving tax-efficient transactions using our OP unit currency.\nIn return, Whitestone benefits from expanding our asset base, reducing capital costs, and improving economies of scale.\nDividends play a crucial role in the REIT structure.\nOur dividend is sustainable, with a payout ratio of 41% of FFO Core in the second quarter.\nI'd like to elaborate on our dividend and policy.\nWe've consistently paid 131 monthly dividends since our 2010 IPO, totaling over 300 billion in shareholder payouts during this period.\nWe raised our dividend by $0.01, or 2.4%, in March 2021, reflecting our strong recovery.\nOur policy involves regular dividend evaluations, considering factors such as profitable growth, cash flow, and progress towards long-term shareholder value creation.\nWe use excess cash flow to fund internal development projects, acquisitions, and debt reduction.\nI'd like to discuss our approach to achieving long-term value goals and increasing our valuation.\nOur primary focus on creating and driving long-term real estate value is central to all our activities.\nAs we increase occupancy, develop our land, and make strategic acquisitions, the inherent value in our assets will begin to reflect in our valuation.\nAlthough the market doesn't yet fully recognize the value we're creating, we trade at a significant discount to our true worth.\nWe're confident that as we continue to grow occupancy, revenue, and cash flow, the investment community will recognize our value.\nAchieving our long-term goals depends on our assets.\nOur portfolio of high-quality real estate across thriving markets, combined with high demand for our nearly full centers, is highly valuable.\nOur rental income generates stable, reliable cash flow.\nOur prime locations, property quality, and strong operational performance are evident in our ability to extract value from our properties and successfully acquire new assets from our extensive pipeline, keeping us at the forefront of our industry as we expand.\nTo recap, a decade ago, we developed a contrarian business model focusing on entrepreneurial, e-commerce-resistant tenants.\nStarting with a modest asset base of about 150 million, we've grown to 59 properties in eight major cities, over 1,400 tenants, and approximately 1.5 billion in real estate value today.\nWe remain committed to executing our plan and are pleased to present our second quarter results.\nI'll now hand over to Dave Holeman for a more detailed analysis of our financial performance.\nI'm grateful for the chance to share some excellent second quarter results.\nThroughout the quarter, our superior geographic focus and carefully planned tenant mix have led to robust revenue and profit growth, while our long-term strategy and daily operations have enabled us to make substantial progress towards our objectives of expanding our infrastructure and enhancing our debt position\nThe metropolitan areas where we operate continue to experience significant population influx and business relocations, generating employment opportunities from other regions of the nation\nThis is clearly demonstrated by the year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in top-line revenue, property net operating income, net income, and FFO core per share for both the second quarter and year-to-date periods\nThis expansion is fueled by our robust leasing activities, resulting in higher occupancy rates and strong positive leasing spreads\nThe growth is attributed to lowered debt levels and borrowing expenses, increased scale of our G&A infrastructure, and profitable asset sales\nSecond quarter total revenue reached $30.6 million, representing a 5% increase from the first quarter and an 11% rise from the second quarter of 2020\nThe revenue growth was attributed to a sequential 1.2% rise in occupancy and a 0.7% improvement compared to Q2 2020\nWe are also benefiting from a 1.2% sequential increase and a 1.9% year-over-year rise in our ABR per square foot, along with reduced uncollectibility reserves\nProperty net operating income for the quarter was $22 million, showing a 4% sequential increase and a 10% rise from the second quarter of 2020\nOur Q2 same-store net operating income grew by 8.4% compared to Q2 of 2020\nQuarterly net income was $0.12 per share, up from $0.03 per share in the first quarter and $0.01 per share in the same quarter of the previous year\nFunds from operations core reached $0.26 per share in the quarter, marking a 13% increase from the first quarter and an 18% rise from the second quarter of 2020\nOur quarterly leasing activity continued to build on our strong first quarter performance, with 35 new leases representing 75,000 square feet of newly occupied space\nOur new lease activity for the first half of the year is 100% higher on a square foot basis than 2020, and 40% higher than 2019\nLeasing spreads on a GAAP basis have been positive 8% over the past 12 months, with second quarter leasing spreads increasing by 3.1% on new leases and 7.9% on renewal leases signed\nOur annualized base rent per square foot on a GAAP basis at the end of the quarter grew 1.2% to $19.95 from $19.71 in the previous quarter, representing a 1.9% increase from a year ago\nTotal occupancy stood at 89.9%, with all our markets experiencing increased quarter-over-quarter occupancy, led by our Dallas market with a 3.6% increase\nAustin and Phoenix both grew 0.8% from the first quarter, while Houston grew 0.6% from the first quarter\nOur collections for the quarter were very strong, returning to normal pre-COVID levels\nReflecting the high collection levels, our reserve for uncollectible revenue for the quarter was $143,000, or approximately 1.5% of our revenue, down from $529,000 or 1.8% of revenue in the first quarter, and $2.3 million or 7.9% of revenue in the second quarter of 2020\nOur total tenant receivables improved 8.4% from the first quarter and 13.5% from a year ago\nOur interest expense was 5% lower than a year ago, reflecting our reduced debt levels\nAt quarter end, we had $21.3 million in accrued rents and accounts receivable\nThis amount includes $16.4 million of accrued straight line rents and $1.5 million of agreed upon deferrals\nOur agreed upon deferral balance has decreased by 34.4% since year-end, indicating that tenants are honoring their payment plans\nRegarding our balance sheet, we have implemented various measures to strengthen our liquidity since early last year\nOur total net debt is $601.3 million, down $48 million from a year ago, improving our debt to gross book real estate cost ratio to 52% from 56% a year ago\nOur debt-to-EBITDA ratio also improved by 1.2 times from the first quarter to 8.2 times\nConsidering our post-quarter acquisition and continued focus on deleveraging, we anticipate our debt-to-EBIT ratio to be approximately eight by year-end, indicating significant progress towards our long-term debt reduction goals\nAt quarter end, we have $160.5 million of undrawn capacity and $55.1 million of borrowing availability under our credit facility\nDuring the second quarter, we sold approximately three million common shares through our ATM program, generating $25.4 million in net proceeds for the company\nAfter the quarter, we acquired Lakeside Market in Plano, Texas for $53.2 million, financing the acquisition with approximately $30 million in equity, $10 million in debt from our corporate credit facility, and $13 million from cash flow and cash on hand\nThese results demonstrate the strength of Whitestone's strategic geographic focus and business models\nWe are optimistic about the acquisition of Lakeside Market and look forward to continuing to deliver value to all of Whitestone's stakeholders\nWe will now open the lines for questions\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:David Zalman will commence by summarizing the key points of the recent quarter's performance.\nFollowing him, Asylbek Osmonov will present an overview of our latest financial data, and Tim Timanus will discuss our lending operations, including the quality of our assets.\nInterested parties can participate in the live call by following the instructions provided by our moderator, Jamie.\nAllow me to provide the standard disclaimers before we begin.\nWe are satisfied with our second quarter 2020 results and the timely completion of Legacy's operational integration in early June.\nThe former Legacy employees, now part of Prosperity, have been exceptional, and their dedication and efforts were crucial for the smooth integration.\nWe remain optimistic about the merger and look forward to continuing to develop the finest bank possible.\nIn the second quarter of 2020, we demonstrated impressive annualized returns on average tangible common equity of 19.98% and on average assets of 1.61%.\nOur earnings for the second quarter of 2020 were $130.9 million, compared to $82 million for the same period in 2019, representing an increase of $48.6 million or 59.1%.\nOur diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2020 were $1.41, up from $1.18 for the same period in 2019, showing an increase of 19.5%.\nThe second quarter 2020 earnings per share of $1.41 includes a $0.22 income tax benefit, a $0.06 charge for merger-related expenses, and a $0.03 charge for the writedown of fixed assets related to the merger and some CRA funds.\nIn total, there was a $0.22 benefit to earnings and $0.09 in deductions, primarily related to the merger.\nAs of June 30, 2020, loans totaled $21.025 billion, an increase of $10.4 billion or 98.6% compared to $10.587 billion on June 30, 2019.\nOur quarter-over-quarter loans increased by $1.898 billion or 9.9% from $19.127 billion on March 31, 2020, with $1.392 billion of this increase attributed to SBA Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans.\nMortgage warehouse loans also saw an increase of $843 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter.\nOur core loans, excluding those held for sale, the warehouse purchase program, and PPP loans, decreased by $311 million.\nHowever, part of this decrease was due to the intentional removal of loans identified during our due diligence of Legacy.\nWe experienced strong loan growth early in the second quarter, but it slowed as businesses reduced operations or shut down in response to various government orders.\nAs of June 30, 2020, our deposits totaled $26.153 billion, an increase of $9.265 billion or 54.9% compared to $16.888 billion on June 30, 2019.\nOur quarter-over-quarter deposits increased by $2.326 billion or 9.8% from $23.826 billion on March 31, 2020.\nTypically, our deposits are lower in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, and then start to increase in the third and fourth quarters.\nHowever, this year, second quarter deposits are higher.\nA significant portion of this increase is due to PPP loans, as well as reduced customer spending and increased saving.\nAsset quality has always been and will continue to be one of our bank's primary areas of focus.\nI've consistently stated that you'll appreciate us during prosperous times but truly cherish us during hardships, which is proving accurate once again in this pandemic and oil market downturn.\nNon-performing assets amounted to $77.9 million, equivalent to 28 basis points of the quarterly average interest-earning assets as of June 30, 2020.\nWe're continuing to offer assistance to our borrowers through loan extensions and postponements when feasible.\nNet charge-offs for the second quarter of 2020 totaled $13 million.\nOf these write-offs, $12.4 million were associated with PCD loans that had specific reserves of $28.5 million, which we acquired during the merger.\nTo date, $16.1 million in specific reserves have been transferred to the general reserve, in addition to the $10 million provision for loan losses in the second quarter.\nMerger and acquisition activities have decreased during this pandemic.\nWhile some discussions are ongoing and a few deals may be in progress, we anticipate that M&A activity will increase as businesses resume operations and economic conditions improve.\nScale appears to be increasingly important now, particularly with reduced net interest margins, the need for enhanced technology, and the possibility of additional regulatory requirements if there's a change in government leadership.\nOne illustration is the increased volume at our customer service center, with many elderly clients seeking to set up online and mobile banking services that they previously showed no interest in.\nThe Blue Chip consensus forecast predicts that the fourth quarter 2020 GDP will conclude at -5.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.\nHowever, they project a positive 4.8% GDP for the fourth quarter of 2021 relative to the fourth quarter of 2020.\nThey also predict an unemployment rate of 9.4% for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to an unemployment rate of 6.9% for the fourth quarter of 2021.\nThese projections suggest a promising outlook for 2021.\nWe are optimistic about our company's future prospects.\nDespite frequent changes in our operating environment and economy, we remain committed to addressing any challenges that arise and prioritizing the needs of our customers and employees.\nProsperity continues to emphasize building core relationships, maintaining strong asset quality, and running the bank efficiently while investing in evolving technology and product distribution channels.\nWe plan to continue expanding the company both organically and through mergers and acquisitions.\nOur goals are to develop future leaders, ensure every customer interaction is smooth and enjoyable, and maintain safe and sound operations.\nI'll now hand over the discussion to Asylbek, our Chief Financial Officer, to elaborate on some of the specific financial results we've achieved.\nNet interest income before credit loss provisions for the three-month period ending June 30, 2020 was $259 million, up from $154.8 million in the same period of 2019, representing an increase of $104.1 million or 67.2%.\nThis increase was primarily attributed to the merger with LegacyTexas in November 2019 and loan discount accretion of $24.3 million in the second quarter of 2020.\nThe net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis was 3.69% for the three months ending June 30, 2020, compared to 3.16% for the same period in 2019 and 3.81% for the quarter ending March 31, 2020.\nExcluding purchase accounting adjustments, the core net interest margin for the quarter ending June 30, 2020 was 3.33%, compared to 3.14% for the same period in 2019 and 3.36% for the quarter ending March 31, 2020.\nFor the quarter ending June 30, 2020, non-interest income amounted to $25.7 million, a decrease from $30 million in the same period of 2019.\nThe non-interest income for the current quarter was impacted by a $3.9 million writedown of certain assets and overall effects of the COVID-19 crisis.\nNon-interest expenses rose to $134.4 million for the quarter ending June 30, 2020, compared to $80.8 million in the same period of 2019.\nThe merger with LegacyTexas and one-time expenses of $7.5 million related to the core system conversion in June were the main reasons for the increase.\nBesides the merger-related costs, the second quarter results also showed higher expenses due to increased mortgage activities.\nNow that the core system conversion and operational integration are complete, we don't expect any significant merger-related expenses in the future, and we anticipate realizing the remaining cost savings starting in the third quarter of 2020.\nWe project these additional savings to be approximately $7 million to $9 million per quarter.\nThis, combined with savings from the first and second quarters, will align with our previously announced 25% reduction in non-interest expenses.\nThe efficiency ratio increased to 46.56% for the quarter ending June 30, 2020, up from 43.74% in the same period of 2019 and 42.9% for the quarter ending March 31, 2020.\nWhen excluding the $7.5 million in merger-related expenses, the efficiency ratio for the quarter ending June 30, 2020 was 43.97%.\nAs of June 30, 2020, the bond portfolio had a weighted average life of 2.69 years and expected annual cash flows of about $2.3 billion.\nAt the end of the quarter on June 30, 2020, our nonperforming assets totaled $77,942,000, representing 37 basis points of loans and other real estate.\nThe nonperforming assets as of June 30, 2020 comprised $71,595,000 in loans, $187,000 in repossessed assets, and $6,160,000 in other real estate.\nOf the $77,942,000 in nonperforming assets, energy credits accounted for $12,173,000 or 16%, with $12,73,000 being service company credits and $100,000 being production company credits.\nSince June 30, 2020, $15,786,000 has been removed from the nonperforming assets list through the sale of collateral, representing 20% of the nonperforming assets.\nNet charge-offs for the quarter ending June 30, 2020 amounted to $13,01,000.\nDuring the quarter ending June 30, 2020, $10 million was added to the allowance for credit losses.\nThe average monthly new loan production for the quarter ending June 30, 2020 was $871 million, including $1.430 billion in PPP loans booked during the quarter.\nAs of June 30, 2020, outstanding loans totaled $21.025 billion.\nThe loan portfolio as of June 30, 2020 consisted of 39% fixed rate loans, 36% floating rate loans, and 25% loans with specific reset intervals.\nThe fixed rate percentage increased slightly due to the inclusion of PPP loans.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Joining me on this call are our new President and CEO Denise Paulonis, along with CFO Marlo Cormier.\nI'm excited to be here after about a month in my role, and I'm eager to connect with our analysts and shareholders soon.\nHaving been on Sally Beauty's board since 2018, I bring a valuable insider's perspective and thorough understanding of the business from day one.\nI see a great chance to apply my leadership abilities and retail/finance expertise to usher the company into a new phase of lucrative growth, building on the capabilities developed during the past four years of transformation.\nThe company has undergone a complete overhaul in every area, including technology, marketing, merchandising, supply chain, HR, finance, and talent, creating a strong foundation for future growth.\nI'm extremely proud of our outstanding team who tackled this challenge and helped us evolve into a contemporary, dynamic omnichannel beauty retailer poised for long-term success.\nBefore discussing our future plans, I'd like to highlight some key achievements from the past year.\nFor the full fiscal year 2021, net sales increased by 10%, gross margins surpassed 50%, and adjusted earnings per share rose by over 97%.\nWe also generated robust operating cash flow of $382 million.\nWe maintained consistent performance throughout the year and ended fiscal 2021 with fourth-quarter results surpassing expectations, demonstrating strong operational execution.\nWe're particularly pleased to observe ongoing momentum and consistency across the business despite the various impacts of the pandemic.\nAs we begin our new fiscal year, our goal to attract and retain color customers remains a key part of our strategy, supported by ongoing trends in self-expression through hair, product sustainability and innovation, and the growing number of independent stylists, all of which reinforce the strength of our color and care business.\nPrioritizing customers and improving their experience with us is crucial to our success.\nWe continue to focus on the customer through personalization, inspiration, education, and training.\nWe're also committed to creating the most convenient shopping experience for our customers through our comprehensive omnichannel platform and various fulfillment options, allowing customers to get products how and when they want them, faster than ever before.\nIn light of this, we'll concentrate on four strategic growth areas to drive top-line growth in fiscal 2022: maximizing our digital platform, enhancing loyalty and personalization, delivering product innovation, and improving our supply chain.\nLet's start with digital.\nAs we increasingly become the premier source for color inspiration, education, and training, we aim to create a user-friendly, reliable omnichannel platform for both DIY enthusiasts and stylists.\nAt BSG, we completed crucial strategic initiatives in fiscal 2021 that positioned us to become the go-to platform for stylists.\nWe revamped the CosmoProf website, introduced new value-added ordering services, and implemented same-day delivery.\nAdditionally, we'll be connecting our store network to the CosmoProf app this month to further enhance same-day delivery.\nIn essence, our BSG stylists can now access CosmoProf's entire inventory on their phones and receive products within two hours.\nCombining these initiatives truly positions BSG as a valuable resource for the stylist community, providing them with the tools they need to operate their businesses efficiently and profitably.\nAt Sally, we've observed a positive customer response to our expanded fulfillment model and continue to gain traction with BOPIS, ship from store, and rapid two-hour delivery.\nIn our most recent quarter, Sally U.S. and Canada stores fulfilled 34% of e-commerce sales, with BOPIS accounting for 22%, ship from store for 8%, and rapid two-hour delivery (launched mid-quarter) representing 4% of Sally U.S. and Canada e-commerce sales.\nThe adoption of these new fulfillment options demonstrates our ability to scale new tools and capabilities to meet our customers' strong desire for convenience.\nWe're also intensely focused on improving inventory availability across our store and distribution center network through our new JDA platform, enabling customers to access our inventory however they choose to shop and receive most products in just two to three hours.\nAs we continue to scale and optimize our full suite of omnichannel services for both Sally and BSG customers, we believe e-commerce can reach 15% or more of sales in the coming years.\nIn fiscal 2021, global e-commerce sales penetration was just over 7%.\nImportantly, we know that an omnichannel customer at Sally U.S. and Canada spends approximately 75% to 80% more with us annually than a brick-and-mortar customer, making this not just a sales channel shift but a significant growth opportunity.\nMoving on to our second growth pillar: loyalty and personalization, which is closely tied to our digital strategy.\nAs many of you know, the rise of personalization has changed the fundamental expectations in retail.\nWith our rapidly growing loyalty program and a new focus on personalization, we have a significant opportunity to drive increased customer engagement and sales.\nAt Sally U.S. and Canada, approximately 74% of our fourth quarter sales came from our loyalty program.\nAt BSG, because stylists must register to shop with us, we have data on 100% of our customers.\nRoughly 8% of our BSG's quarterly sales were generated by our Rewards Credit Card, which was introduced about a year ago.\nThese figures are impressive, and we've only begun to tap into the potential of this asset.\nIn the coming fiscal year, we plan to use data science to engage customers with inspiration, education, and tailored offers at every interaction point.\nFor Sally customers, this involves suggesting product usage, sending timely replenishment reminders, and incorporating DIY education at crucial stages of their journey.\nFor BSG customers, this means highlighting new product arrivals, prompting stylists to restock their backbar, and sending notifications to replenish essential style products.\nWe anticipate these strategies will increase customer lifetime value by reducing churn, increasing per-transaction spending, and boosting purchase frequency.\nWe will also increase our investment in digital marketing and social media campaigns to boost traffic and sales in the upcoming fiscal year.\nOur ongoing marketing initiative, YOU by Sally, continues to garner significant attention from customers and industry professionals.\nThe campaign, which celebrates hair color's transformative power, has received extensive coverage from beauty editors and garnered millions of views on social media platforms.\nOur third growth strategy focuses on product innovation.\nThe upcoming fiscal year will feature a significant influx of innovation across Sally and BSG, with much of it driven by our own efforts.\nWe have a robust pipeline of new products, including both our own and third-party brands across various categories.\nWe will maintain our focus on and support for sustainable and clean products, which are increasingly preferred by customers and command premium prices.\nWe believe our expertise in color and care provides a logical pathway and powerful platform for establishing new brands that extend beyond our current offerings.\nOur first initiative is a new exclusive line of vivid hair colors for Sally called Strawberry Leopard, which was launched to positive reception in October. This Gen Z-focused brand demonstrates our ability to attract younger consumers through self-expression.\nAlongside the launch, we created a dedicated digital platform for Strawberry Leopard that immerses consumers in the brand's essence and enables direct shopping.\nAs the brand gains momentum, we anticipate exploring opportunities for expansion into additional distribution channels, including mass retailers, beauty stores, and third-party e-commerce platforms.\nThe innovation pipeline at BSG is equally promising, beginning with Olaplex's new toning shampoo launched in September.\nOlaplex exemplifies a high-profile brand that consistently innovates and remains a key partner for us.\nLooking ahead, we're committed to staying at the forefront of innovation, with plans for new product and brand launches to excite consumers in 2022 and beyond.\nMoving to our fourth growth pillar, a crucial aspect of our customer-first approach is enhancing our supply chain to ensure consistent availability of color and care products.\nMuch of the groundwork has been completed, and we're now implementing the final phase of JDA integration.\nThe system is operational in all BSG locations and most Sally stores.\nWe're currently deploying JDA to our remaining locations and fully integrating it with our North Texas distribution center.\nUpon completion, we'll have a highly automated, integrated network with industry-leading capabilities in inventory forecasting, localized assortment, pricing and promotions, and stock management.\nWe believe our initiatives under these four growth pillars will enable us to achieve 3% to 4% top-line growth and generate strong operating cash flows this year.\nThis reflects our ability to maintain robust gross margins while mitigating inflationary pressures through careful cost control, pricing strategies, and store optimization.\nOur 90-store optimization pilot is ongoing.\nWe continue to gather and analyze data from the sample, and I'm pleased to report that we're significantly surpassing our sales transfer targets.\nIn fiscal 2022, we plan to launch a multi-year program designed to maximize the value of our extensive store portfolio while offsetting inflationary pressures.\nBy streamlining our fleet, we can enhance productivity and profitability while providing a convenient omnichannel experience that benefits our customers.\nWe're entering fiscal 2022 with a solid infrastructure, a well-defined growth strategy, and favorable industry dynamics that support the significant opportunities ahead of us.\nIn the coming months, I look forward to collaborating with the team to develop additional growth opportunities that will drive our business and create substantial shareholder value in 2023 and beyond.\nWe're pleased to end the year with strong fourth-quarter performance, exceeding the expectations we provided in our previous earnings call and reflecting robust consumer demand as we emerge from the pandemic.\nRevenue growth, solid gross margins, and careful cost management led to strong earnings and cash flow.\nNet sales grew by 3.4%, and same-store sales increased by 2.1%, demonstrating strong consumer demand with only minor impacts from pandemic-related restrictions in Europe.\nFourth-quarter traffic and conversion trends remained consistent with patterns observed throughout the pandemic.\nWhile traffic decreased, units per transaction, average unit retail, and average ticket all increased compared to the previous year.\nEssentially, customers are shopping less frequently but purchasing more during each transaction with us.\nGlobal e-commerce sales reached $71 million, accounting for 7.1% of total net sales, compared to $63 million in the prior year.\nThe annual growth demonstrates continued robust performance as we expand our digital capabilities and execute our strategic plans for fulfillment and customer engagement.\nRegarding gross profit, we attained a fourth quarter gross margin of 50.6%, demonstrating our capacity to sustain strong performance above our 50% goal.\nCompared to the previous year, gross margin decreased by 50 basis points, indicating a higher proportion of BSG sales, which had a lower margin profile during the quarter.\nRegarding operating expenses, fourth quarter SG&A amounted to $387 million, a 5% increase from the previous year, mainly due to higher labor costs and planned increases in marketing expenditure.\nFor the upcoming fiscal year, we expect SG&A dollars to rise and the rate to increase slightly compared to the previous year.\nOur forecast considers increased labor and freight costs, higher expenses planned in our international markets due to a full reopening in 2022, as well as investments across our growth areas that Denise mentioned earlier.\nWe believe our store optimization program will help offset wage inflation starting in the latter part of 2022 and more significantly in 2023.\nLet's now discuss earnings.\nWe achieved strong profitability in Q4.\nAdjusted operating margin was 11.7%, adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.5%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share rose to $0.64.\nExamining segment results.\nSally Beauty experienced strong consumer demand in the U.S. Same-store sales grew by 2.3% and e-commerce sales totaled $29 million for the quarter.\nFor Sally U.S. and Canada, the color category increased by 4%, while vivid colors grew by 5%, accounting for 28% of our total color sales as comparisons normalized to the previous year.\nOther categories also performed well.\nStyling tools sales increased by 31% and textured hair sales rose by 16%.\nSally's gross margin decreased slightly, reflecting strong product margins offset by higher distribution and freight costs.\nSegment operating margin increased to 18.1% compared to 18% in the previous year.\nIn the BSG segment, same-store sales grew by 1.7% as salons returned to more normal capacity levels in almost all of our U.S. markets.\nE-commerce sales amounted to $42 million for the quarter.\nThe color category grew by 9%, hair care increased by 5% driven by Olaplex, and styling tools sales rose by 9%.\nBSG's gross margin and profitability reflected the same dynamics we observed in Q3.\nSpecifically, we're seeing higher sales from our larger volume, full-service customers emerging from the pandemic, and these customers tend to have lower margins.\nSegment operating margin decreased slightly compared to the previous year, reaching 13.3%.\nRegarding the balance sheet and cash flow, we concluded fiscal 2021 in a strong financial position.\nFor the entire fiscal year, we generated $308 million in free cash flow and paid off approximately $420 million of debt.\nWe ended the quarter with $401 million in cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding balance on our asset-based revolving line of credit.\nInventories as of September 30th totaled $871 million, a 7% increase from the previous year as we reinvested in our inventory levels following pandemic-related disruptions.\nAdditionally, we were pleased that our strong performance throughout fiscal 2021 helped reduce our net debt leverage ratio to 1.69 times by the end of September.\nNow, let's discuss our full-year fiscal 2022 guidance.\nWe are optimistic about the business's position heading into 2022 and expect to achieve the following: net sales growth between 3% and 4%, a net store count decrease of approximately 1% to 2% primarily driven by Sally U.S. stores as we continue to optimize our portfolio.\nWe anticipate gross margin expansion of 40 to 60 basis points, GAAP operating margin growth of 90 to 110 basis points, and adjusted operating margin approximately equal to 2021.\nThe business has shown remarkable resilience over the past 18+ months, and our teams have done an excellent job navigating the dynamic macro environment.\nAs the business continues to strengthen and generate strong cash flows, you can expect us to prioritize strategic growth investments and return cash to shareholders through the restart of our share buyback program.\nAs a reminder, during the fourth quarter, our Board of Directors approved an extension of our share repurchase program through September 2025, which currently has over $700 million remaining under the authorization.\nWe are also exploring opportunities to further optimize our capital structure, which could result in additional interest expense savings.\nLastly, I want to mention a housekeeping item related to disclosure.\nStarting in fiscal 2022, we will replace our same-store sales metric with comparable sales, which will include sales from our full-service divisions and franchise operations, including any related e-commerce sales.\nIn 2022, for each quarter, we will disclose both current and prior-year comparable sales under the new definition.\nI'll now ask the operator to open the call for Q&A.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Today I'm accompanied by Tom Greco, our CEO and President, and Jeff Shepherd, our CFO and Executive Vice President.\nWe sincerely hope you and your loved ones are well and in good health.\nTheir unwavering commitment to delivering exceptional customer service enabled us to achieve another quarter of increased sales, improved adjusted margins, and a substantial rise in earnings per share.\nWe've been making investments in our team and operations over several years to transform and better utilize Advance's resources.\nDuring the third quarter, this allowed us to match our performance on top of our strongest quarterly comparable store sales growth from 2020.\nWe achieved a 3.1% increase in comparable store sales while maintaining an identical 13.3% two-year stack compared to the second quarter.\nAs anticipated, this was driven by the ongoing recovery of our professional segment and gradual improvements in major urban markets.\nBy prioritizing DIY consumers and Pro customers in every decision, we've been able to swiftly adapt to changing needs.\nThe third quarter was characterized by an overall shift back to Professional services and a return to in-store shopping for DIY customers.\nIn the Professional segment, we're observing increasing strength in certain areas, as the ongoing return to office of professional workers in large urban centers catches up with the rest of the country, similar to last year's trend.\nOur diverse digital and physical asset base has allowed us to quickly respond to these changing channel dynamics in the current climate.\nFurthermore, we also achieved significant improvements in our adjusted gross margin rate of 246 basis points, primarily due to our category management initiatives.\nOur adjusted SG&A costs as a percentage of net sales were 209 basis points higher as we compared to a unique quarter in Q3 2020.\nAs we've mentioned over the past year, our SG&A costs were unusually low in Q2 and Q3 of 2020.\nThis was due to an exceptionally high DIY sales mix and measures we implemented last year during the early stages of the pandemic, which were not repeated.\nOverall, we achieved an adjusted operating income margin expansion of 37 basis points to 10.4% compared to Q3 2020.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.21 increased by 21.6% compared to Q3 2020 and 31% compared to the same period in 2019.\nOur year-to-date adjusted earnings per share have increased by approximately 50% compared to 2020.\nYear-to-date, our balance sheet remains robust with a 19% increase in free cash flow to $734 million, while returning a record $953 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends.\nIn line with the first half of the year, several industry-related factors, combined with operational improvements, contributed to our sales growth and margin expansion in Q3.\nThe number of vehicles on the road continues to grow slightly.\nThe average age of vehicles is increasing, and perhaps most importantly, the number of miles driven continues to improve compared to both 2020 and 2019.\nMore broadly, the chip shortage continues to affect the availability of new vehicles and is contributing to a surge in used car sales.\nThis benefits our industry as consumers are keeping their vehicles longer and investing in repairs and maintenance.\nAs we all know, over the past 18 months, the pandemic altered consumer behavior across our industry, leading to a surge in DIY omnichannel growth in 2020, while the Professional business declined.\nHowever, as the economy continues to reopen and miles driven steadily increase, our Professional business is now consistently surpassing pre-pandemic levels, as discussed last quarter.\nRegional performance was led by the Southwest and West.\nCategory growth was led by brakes, motor oil, and filters as miles-driven reliant categories improved compared to the softer 2020.\nWe also saw continued strength in DieHard batteries, which led the way on a two-year stack basis.\nEach of these categories performed well due to diligent planning between our merchant and supply chain teams, enabling a strong competitive position despite global supply chain disruptions.\nAt the same time, we faced challenges in Q3 as we strategically transitioned tens of thousands of undercar and engine management SKUs to our own brand.\nImportantly, these in-stock positions have now significantly improved, and we're confident these initiatives will help drive future margin expansion.\nOverall, comp sales were positive in all three periods of Q3, led by Professional.\nDIY omnichannel delivered slightly positive comp growth in Q3, while comparing against high double-digit growth from the previous year.\nWithin Professional, we navigated a very challenging global supply chain environment to meet our customers' needs.\nThe investments we've made in our supply chain, inventory positioning, and dynamic assortment tool have put us in a favorable competitive position.\nWe've implemented the dynamic assortment tool in all company-owned US stores as well as over 800 independent locations.\nOur MyAdvance portal and embedded Advance Pro catalog continues to be a differentiator for us, while driving online traffic.\nOur online sales to Professional customers continue to grow as we enhance the speed and functionality of Advance Pro.\nWe remain committed to providing our industry-leading assortment of parts for all Professional customers.\nThis will help enable us to grow first call status and increase share of wallet in a very fragmented market.\nAdditionally, we expanded DieHard to our Professional customers.\nFollowing a recent independent consumer survey, DieHard secured its claim as America's most trusted auto battery.\nDuring Q3, we announced a multi-year agreement with our national customer Bridgestone to sell DieHard batteries in more than 2,200 tire and vehicle service centers across the United States.\nWith this systemwide rollout during Q3, we replaced their previous battery provider, making us the exclusive battery supplier across all Bridgestone locations.\nRegarding our independent business, we added 16 net new independent Carquest stores in the quarter, bringing our total to 44 net new this year.\nWe continue to grow our independent business through differentiated offerings for our Carquest partners, including our new Carquest by Advance banner program, which we announced earlier this month.\nAs we continue to build and strengthen the Advance brand and our DIY business, Carquest by Advance adds DIY relevance for our Carquest-branded independent partners, while providing incremental traffic and margin opportunities.\nWe've recently rolled out this new initiative to our independent partners and look forward to further expansion over time for both new and existing Carquest independents.\nTurning to DIY omnichannel, comparable store sales were slightly positive in Q3.\nOur DIY omnichannel business showed robust double-digit comparable sales growth during the third quarter of 2020.\nWe are continuously improving our offerings and implementing our long-term plan to set our DIY business apart and gain market share.\nIn the third quarter, we continued to utilize our Speed Perks loyalty program effectively, with VIP membership increasing by 13% and our ELITE members, who represent the highest spending customers, growing by 21%.\nThe previous year, the introduction of our Advance Same Day services facilitated a significant increase in e-commerce growth.\nThis year, as DIY customers returned to physical stores, in-store sales led our DIY sales growth.\nThis was partly anticipated due to a planned decrease in inefficient online discounts, which substantially improved gross margins.\nLet's discuss margin expansion.\nWe once again improved our adjusted operating income margin this quarter.\nSimilar to the second quarter, this was primarily due to category management actions within gross margin, where our key strategies played an important role.\nWe are now seeing benefits from our newly implemented strategic pricing tools and capabilities.\nLike other businesses, we're experiencing inflation that's higher than expected.\nNevertheless, our team has been able to adapt quickly in this dynamic environment, as industry pricing remains reasonable.\nThrough strategic sourcing, vendor income improved compared to the previous year, alongside continued strong sales growth.\nLastly, our own brand revenue grew by double digits, outpacing our overall growth this quarter as we expanded the Carquest brand into new categories.\nCarquest products have a lower unit price than comparable branded items, which as expected, reduced comp and net sales growth for the quarter.\nHowever, the profit margin for our own brands is significantly higher and contributed to the expansion of adjusted gross margin in Q3.\nMoving on to supply chain matters.\nWe continue to make advancements in our productivity initiatives.\nIn the third quarter, the benefits from these initiatives were outweighed by widely reported disruptions and inflationary pressures within the global supply chain.\nConsequently, we did not leverage our supply chain during the quarter.\nWe finished rolling out cross-banner replenishment (CBR) for the initially planned group of stores in the quarter.\nCompleting this milestone is generating cost savings by reducing stem miles from our distribution centers to stores.\nThroughout our implementation, our team identified additional stores that will be included over time.\nAdditionally, we're proceeding with the implementation of our new Warehouse Management System (WMS), which is helping to achieve further improvements in fill rate, on-hand accuracy, and productivity.\nWe've successfully transitioned to our new WMS in about 36% of our distribution center network, measured by unit volume.\nAs previously mentioned, we follow WMS with a new Labor Management System (LMS), which promotes standardization and productivity.\nWe're on track to complete the WMS and LMS implementations by the end of 2023, as discussed in April.\nMoreover, our efforts to consolidate and integrate WORLDPAC and Autopart International (AI) are also progressing as planned, with completion expected by early next year.\nThis is enabling accelerated growth, gross margin expansion, and SG&A savings.\nGross margin expansion in this area comes from the expanded distribution of AI's high-margin owned brand products, such as shocks and struts, to the larger WORLDPAC customer base.\nLastly, as we expand our store network, we're also enhancing our supply chain capabilities on the West Coast by adding a much larger and more modern distribution center in San Bernardino.\nThis facility will serve as the consolidation point for supplier shipments for the Western US and enable rapid e-commerce delivery.\nAdditionally, we've begun work to consolidate our distribution center network in the Greater Toronto area.\nTwo separate distribution centers, one Carquest and one WORLDPAC, will be moved into a single brand-new facility that will allow us to better serve the growing demand in the Ontario market.\nWe continue to implement our initiatives to improve both sales and profit per store while reducing corporate SG&A.\nAs mentioned in our Q2 call, we faced both planned and unplanned inflationary cost pressures compared to the previous year in Q3.\nSG&A challenges include higher than anticipated store labor costs per hour, increased incentive compensation, and higher delivery costs associated with the recovery of our Professional business.\nJeff will discuss these and other SG&A details shortly.\nWe remain on track with our sales and profit per store initiative, including our goal of achieving average sales of $1.8 million per store by 2023.\nRegarding new locations year-to-date, we've opened 19 stores, six new WORLDPAC branches, and added 44 net new locations to the Carquest independent family.\nThis brings our net new locations to 69, including stores, branches, and independents during the first three quarters.\nSeparately, we're actively working to convert the 109 locations in California that we announced in April.\nHowever, we're experiencing construction-related delays, primarily due to a much slower-than-normal permitting process.\nThis is attributable to stricter guidelines associated with COVID-19, which were exacerbated by the surge of the Delta variant.\nWe now expect the majority of store openings planned for 2021 to shift into 2022.\nAs a result, we're incurring start-up costs within SG&A for the remainder of the year, while realizing less than planned revenue and income.\nThe positive news is that we remain confident that once converted, these stores will contribute to our growth trajectory.\nThe final area of margin expansion is reducing our corporate and other SG&A costs.\nWe've begun to realize some cost benefits related to the restructuring of our corporate functions announced earlier this year, in addition to savings from our continued focus on team member safety.\nIn Q3, we saw a 22% reduction in our total recordable injury rate compared to the previous year.\nOur rate of injuries resulting in lost time decreased by 14% compared to the equivalent period in 2020.\nEmployee safety is just one aspect of our broader environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives at Advance.\nOur aim to propel a world in motion is exemplified by our goal, announced last April, to achieve top-tier total shareholder returns from 2021 to 2023.\nWhile striving for this target, we're also dedicating efforts to ESG matters.\nAs part of this pledge, we initiated our first materiality assessment earlier this year to help prioritize our ESG efforts.\nWe finished this assessment in the third quarter and are now working to conclude the findings.\nThe outcomes will be included in our 2021 Corporate Sustainability Report, which we plan to release in mid-2022.\nBefore handing over to Jeff, I'd like to acknowledge our team members and generous customers for their support in our recent American Heart Association fundraiser.\nThis year, we implemented a new in-store technology allowing customers to round up their purchases at checkout.\nThis simplified customer participation and helped us achieve a record-breaking campaign total of $1.7 million.\nThe goals of this organization resonate deeply with everyone in the Advance family.\nOur net sales grew by 3.1% to $2.6 billion in the third quarter.\nAdjusted gross profit margin increased by 246 basis points to 46.2%, mainly due to our ongoing category management strategies, including strategic pricing, sourcing, private label expansion, and favorable product mix.\nSimilar to the previous quarter, these gains were partially offset by inflation in product and supply chain costs, as well as an unfavorable channel mix.\nIn this quarter, inflation for the same products was about 3.6%, which was anticipated in our annual plan and was the most significant challenge we faced within gross profit.\nWe're collaborating with all our suppliers to minimize costs where possible.\nFor the year to date, adjusted gross margin improved by 184 basis points compared to the same period in 2020.\nAs anticipated, our third-quarter SG&A expenses increased due to several factors we discussed earlier in the year.\nAs a percentage of net sales, our adjusted SG&A increased by 209 basis points, primarily due to labor costs, which included a significant increase in hourly rates and higher incentive compensation compared to the previous year.\nWe also incurred higher delivery expenses for serving our Professional customers and about $10 million in startup costs related to the conversion of our California locations in the third quarter.\nYear-to-date, SG&A as a percentage of net sales remained relatively stable compared to the same period in 2020, increasing by only 9 basis points year-over-year.\nWhile we've reduced our COVID-19-related expenses by $13 million year-to-date, the health and safety of our team members and customers remains our top priority.\nOur adjusted operating income rose to $274 million in the third quarter, compared to $256 million a year ago.\nOn a rate basis, our adjusted operating income margin expanded by 37 basis points to 10.4%.\nOur adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 21.6% to $3.21, compared to $2.64 in the third quarter of 2020.\nCompared to 2019, adjusted diluted earnings per share was up 31% in the quarter.\nOur free cash flow for the first nine months of the year was $734 million, a 19% increase from last year.\nThis increase was primarily driven by improvements in our operating income and our continued focus on working capital metrics, including our accounts payable ratio, which expanded by 351 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2020.\nOur capital investments for the first three quarters of the year totaled $191 million.\nWe continue to prioritize maintaining adequate liquidity while returning excess cash to shareholders.\nIn the third quarter, we returned approximately $228 million to our shareholders by repurchasing 1.1 million shares at an average price of $205.65.\nYear-to-date, we've returned approximately $792 million to our shareholders by repurchasing nearly 4.2 million shares at an average price of $189.43.\nSince restarting our share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2018, we've returned over $2 billion through share repurchases at an average share price of about $164.\nAdditionally, we paid a cash dividend of $1 per share in the quarter, totaling $63 million.\nWe remain confident in our ability to generate substantial cash from our business and expect to return excess cash to our shareholders through a balanced approach of dividends and buybacks.\nAs disclosed in yesterday's SEC 8-K filing, we recently completed the refinancing of our new five-year revolving credit facility.\nThe previous facility was due to expire in January 2023, and with bank markets returning to pre-pandemic levels, we took the opportunity to secure our liquidity for another five years.\nThis included improved pricing and terms while also increasing the overall facility size to $1.2 billion.\nWe have strong relationships with our banks, and this commitment allows us to secure future financial flexibility.\nMore details about this facility can be found in our 8-K filings.\nRegarding our updated full-year outlook, we are raising our 2021 sales and profit guidance to reflect positive year-to-date results and our expectations for the rest of the year.\nIn the first four weeks of the fourth quarter, we continue to see sales strength in our two-year stack, remaining consistent with what we delivered in the last two quarters.\nThis guidance incorporates continued top-line strength, ongoing inflationary pressures, and up to an additional $10 million in startup costs in the fourth quarter related to our West Coast expansion.\nAs mentioned, the construction environment in California remains challenging, resulting in a reduction of our guidance for new store openings and capital expenditures.\nConsequently, we're updating our full-year 2021 guidance to net sales of $10.9 billion to $10.95 billion, comparable store sales of 9.5% to 10%, adjusted operating income margin rate of 9.4% to 9.5%, a minimum of 30 new stores this year, a minimum of $275 million in capital expenditures, and a minimum of $725 million in free cash flow.\nIn conclusion, we're very excited about our current momentum and remain focused on executing our long-term strategy while delivering top-quartile total shareholder return over the 2021 to 2023 period.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The presentation includes certain non-standard financial metrics.\nLet's now examine our financial performance for the third quarter of fiscal 2021.\nDespite ongoing operational challenges due to COVID-19, we are quite satisfied with our quarterly and full ski season results for 2020-2021 in North America.\nPerformance improved as the season advanced, mainly due to increased destination visits at our Colorado and Utah locations, including better lift ticket sales compared to the previous quarter.\nThe third quarter saw only a 3% decline in destination, mountain resort, and regional ski area visits compared to the same period in fiscal 2019.\nWhistler Blackcomb's performance suffered due to Canada's closed borders preventing international visitors, including Americans, and an unexpected early closure on March 30, 2021, following a health order from British Columbia's government.\nWhistler Blackcomb experienced nearly a 60% drop in total visits for the third quarter compared to the same period in fiscal 2019.\nAlthough visitation and revenue trends improved throughout the quarter, our additional business lines continued to be significantly affected by COVID-19-related restrictions, especially in food and beverage services and ski instruction.\nWe maintained strict cost control measures throughout the quarter and continued to operate our additional business lines at reduced capacity.\nAs previously mentioned, we are very pleased with our overall quarterly results and the full 2020-2021 North American ski season performance.\nIt's worth noting that in the previous year, we announced the premature closure of our 2019-2020 North American ski season for all ski areas, lodging facilities, and retail rental stores due to the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning March 15, 2020.\nThese actions significantly impacted our financial results for the third fiscal quarter of 2020.\nFurthermore, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and resulting operational restrictions continued to negatively affect our results for the third fiscal quarter of 2021.\nVail Resorts reported a net income of $274.6 million or $6.72 per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2021, compared to $152.5 million or $3.74 per diluted share in the same period last year.\nThe resort reported EBITDA of $462.2 million in the third fiscal quarter, compared to $304.4 million in the same period last year.\nThe current year's ski season saw particularly strong demand at our Colorado and Utah destination resorts.\nThe resort-reported EBITDA margin for the third quarter was 52%, surpassing both the previous year's 43.9% and the fiscal 2019 third quarter's 50.2%.\nThese results demonstrate our stringent approach to cost management and a higher proportion of lift revenue compared to other business lines relative to previous periods.\nLet's now consider our projections for fiscal 2021.\nVail Resorts, Inc. anticipates a fiscal 2021 net income between $93 million and $139 million.\nThe company projects a resort-reported EBITDA range of $530 million to $570 million for fiscal 2021, with an estimated margin of about 28.9% based on the midpoint of the guidance range.\nOur forecast assumes all operations are functioning in accordance with current health protocols and capacity limits.\nPresent demand patterns are expected to persist.\nWe anticipate normal weather conditions for Australia's East season and North America's summer season, without any impact from potential COVID-19-related closures.\nThe forecast specifically excludes any effects from possible demand or operational disruptions linked to the ongoing lockdowns in Victoria, Australia.\nWe maintain a robust liquidity position.\nAs of April 30, 2021, our total cash and available credit amounted to roughly $2 billion, comprising $1.3 billion in cash, $419 million in U.S. credit availability under the Vail Holdings agreement, and $203 million under the Whistler Credit Agreement.\nOur net debt stood at 2.8 times the trailing 12-month total reported EBITDA as of April 30, 2021.\nWe remain optimistic about our business model's strong cash flow generation and stability, and will continue to prudently manage our capital, prioritizing high-return projects, ongoing investment in our workforce, and strategic acquisition opportunities.\nAlthough we are not reinstating the dividend this quarter, we remain dedicated to returning capital to shareholders, and our board will regularly assess the economic and public health situation to determine the appropriate time for dividend reinstatement.\nWe are highly satisfied with our season pass sales to date, with customers showing great enthusiasm for our pass products' enhanced value proposition, partly driven by the 20% price reduction for all passes in the upcoming season.\nPass product sales for the 2021-2022 North American ski season through June 1, 2021, saw a significant increase compared to sales through June 2, 2020, for the 2020-2021 season, though this comparison is not indicative of performance trends due to the absence of spring sales deadlines in 2020 because of COVID-19.\nIn comparison to sales for the 2019-2020 North American ski season through June 4, 2019, pass product sales for the 2021-2022 season up to June 1, 2021, increased by about 50% in units and 33% in sales dollars.\nThe pass product sales figures are adjusted to include Peak Resorts' pass sales in both periods and eliminate currency fluctuations by applying a consistent exchange rate of $0.83 between the Canadian and U.S. dollars for Whistler Blackcomb in both periods.\nFor context, pass product sales for the entire selling season through December 6, 2020, compared to the full season through December 8, 2019, increased by approximately 20% in units and 19% in sales dollars.\nCompared to pass product sales for the 2019-2020 season through June 4, 2019, we observed robust unit growth among renewing passholders and even stronger growth among new passholders, including previous lift ticket or pass buyers who didn't purchase a pass last season and completely new customers.\nWe experienced our most significant unit growth in destination markets, particularly in the Northeast, and also saw strong growth across our local markets.\nRelative to the period ending June 4, 2019, the effective pass price decreased by 10%, compared to the 20% price reduction we implemented this year.\nOur reduced pricing strategy has encouraged passholders to allocate part of their savings towards purchasing more expensive pass options.\nWe anticipated that lowering prices would lead to higher renewal rates, upgrades to premium passes, and attract more visitors to our facilities.\nWe are optimistic about these emerging trends in pass sales, which we believe support our projections for the upcoming year and the anticipated long-term advantages of enhancing customer lifetime value.\nThe outcomes of pass sales surpassed our initial projections regarding the impact of the 20% price cut.\nNevertheless, the majority of our pass selling period is still ahead, and it remains uncertain whether these trends will persist through autumn.\nFurthermore, we are delighted that ongoing Epic Australia pass sales, concluding on June 15, 2021, have increased by approximately 43% in units through June 1, 2021, compared to the same period ending June 4, 2019, indicating significant growth following the acquisition of Falls Creek and Hotham in April 2019.\nIn light of the recent COVID-19-related restrictions in Victoria, Australia, we will be monitoring any potential effects on Epic Australia pass sales.\nInvesting in our resorts and enhancing guest experiences remains one of our top priorities.\nAs previously disclosed, we will be completing several key projects this summer and fall, subject to regulatory approvals.\nIn Colorado, we are proceeding with a 250-acre lift-served terrain expansion in Beaver Creek's signature McCoy Park area, further enhancing the resort's upscale family-oriented experience.\nWe also intend to install a new four-person high-speed lift at Breckenridge to serve the popular Peak 7, replace Keystone's Peru lift with a six-person high-speed chairlift, and upgrade Crested Butte's Peachtree lift to a new three-person fixed-grip lift.\nAt Okemo, we plan to complete a transportation improvement project, including upgrading the Quantum lift from a four-person to a six-person high-speed chairlift and relocating the existing four-person Quantum lift to replace the Green Ridge three-person fixed-grip chairlift.\nThese enhancements will significantly improve uplift capacity, further elevate the guest experience, and fulfill our $35 million capital plan for the season.\nWe continue to prioritize investments that will advance our company-wide technological improvements to support our data-driven approach, guest experience, and corporate infrastructure.\nAs part of these initiatives, we are investing in resources and technology to enhance our customer service, including significant increases in call center staffing and self-service technology that will enable our guests to better manage their own accounts.\nWe will also maintain our investment in ongoing maintenance capital to support infrastructure across our resorts.\nAs we approach the coming year, we recognize that talent and staffing will be crucial to our success, as always.\nWe have announced plans to increase our minimum entry wages in Colorado, Utah, Washington, and California to $15 per hour, while also implementing substantial increases in entry wages at our Eastern resorts, which will be determined based on local market conditions.\nThis represents our largest discretionary investment in operating expenses this year, which we believe will be partially offset by other savings we will carry forward from this year to the next.\nI am profoundly grateful for the dedication our teams continue to demonstrate throughout these unprecedented circumstances.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We released our Q4 and full-year 2020 financial results earlier today.\nYou can find the report on our company website at oshkoshcorp.com.\nOur speakers today are Wilson Jones, CEO; John Pfeifer, President and COO; and Mike Pack, EVP and CFO.\nI remain extremely impressed by the diligence and focused execution of Oshkosh employees as we navigate the ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 crisis.\nIt's worth emphasizing again that our employee-centric culture has been crucial in achieving strong results despite adversity.\nDedicated Oshkosh staff and their commitment to our robust culture enabled us to surmount major obstacles this year, including unpredictable customer demand, supply chain disruptions, workforce shortages, and numerous other issues.\nI want to express my sincere gratitude to all 15,000 of our employees and our loyal suppliers who have worked tirelessly and risen to the occasion during these difficult times to continue meeting our customers' expectations.\nAs a reminder, our Q4 call differs slightly from other quarterly calls as I'll discuss both quarterly highlights and full-year results before handing over to John and Mike.\nIn Q4, we achieved sales of nearly $1.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.30.\nSimilar to our Q3 performance, we've managed the factors within our control while swiftly addressing challenges beyond our influence.\nThis approach allowed us to increase adjusted operating income in our defense, fire & emergency, and commercial segments compared to last year, while achieving consolidated adjusted decremental margins of 19%.\nIn our largest segment, access equipment, we delivered 23% adjusted decremental margins during a quarter where revenues declined by nearly 40%.\nJohn will provide more details on individual segments, but the access equipment markets in North America and Europe remain weak, and the timing of recovery is uncertain.\nWe're encouraged by utilization data nearing pre-pandemic levels and believe the market is stabilizing.\nWe'll be closely monitoring rental industry metrics and engaging in annual purchase discussions with our customers in the coming months.\nWe're announcing a 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.33 per share.\nThis marks our seventh consecutive annual increase and reflects our confidence in our business model and long-term outlook.\nUndoubtedly, 2020 has been one of the most memorable years in recent history due to the global pandemic's significant disruptions, and I'm proud of our team's efforts and achievements.\nFor instance, our access equipment segment overcame a nearly $1.6 billion year-over-year sales decline to deliver an impressive 8.5% full-year adjusted operating margin.\nOur fire & emergency segment achieved two consecutive quarters of record adjusted operating margin percentages to end the year.\nOur commercial segment posted its highest full-year adjusted operating income margin in over a decade at 7.5%.\nDefense successfully ramped up the JLTV program despite numerous pandemic-related challenges.\nThese accomplishments amid the pandemic demonstrate our strengths as a diversified global industrial company.\nWe concluded the year strongly with solid Q4 performance.\nThroughout the year, we implemented both temporary and permanent cost-cutting measures across the company.\nMike will discuss how these actions will impact our 2021 cost structure in his section.\nI'd like to highlight some of our teams' excellent work in corporate responsibility, focusing on ESG.\nWhile we don't typically discuss ESG metrics on earnings calls, our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, along with our employee engagement and safety performance, are among many areas that we believe set Oshkosh apart from other companies.\nWe continue to receive recognition from agencies that track and evaluate company performance on these important non-financial measures, which we believe further underscores our commitment to excellence, long-term value, and sustainability.\nWilson mentioned the pandemic, and I'd like to provide an update since several of our facilities, including our headquarters, are in a Wisconsin region currently experiencing some of the nation's highest COVID-19 spread rates.\nAcross the company, we've focused on maintaining employee safety and preventing virus spread, with a good track record in doing so.\nHowever, the recent resurgence is creating some workforce availability and supplier delivery challenges.\nIt's crucial that we maintain robust safety procedures that meet or exceed CDC guidelines.\nThis is challenging as many of us are experiencing pandemic fatigue.\nBut like Wilson, I'm proud of our team members and our ability to stay focused and effective.\nLet's begin our segment discussions with access equipment.\nWe've been carefully managing our access equipment business during a period of significant double-digit sales declines while still delivering strong adjusted decremental margins and impressive overall adjusted operating margins.\nIn fact, we've set a new benchmark for financial performance during an industry downturn.\nWe appreciate our team members' efforts and performance during these times.\nOur positive Q4 results are significant, given the low demand for access equipment, primarily resulting from lower equipment utilization, leading to reduced capital expenditure by rental company customers in North America and Europe.\nQ4 sales were down nearly 40%, so we continue to operate our facilities on reduced schedules.\nWe've implemented both temporary and permanent cost reduction measures in the business as we weather this challenging period.\nThis approach is considered responsible in our view.\nWe continue to invest in JLG as the industry's innovation leader, and we remain optimistic about its long-term prospects, which is crucial to highlight.\nWe anticipate releasing innovative products in the future as a result of our ongoing investments.\nWe are striking a delicate balance between cost-cutting measures and the ability to increase production when market conditions improve.\nFor approximately half of the available production weeks in the first quarter, our U.S. facilities will operate at reduced capacity.\nAs circumstances change and our customers inform us of their plans, we will make decisions for the rest of 2021.\nTo meet demand when the market rebounds, we are keeping our workforce engaged.\nWe are maintaining close contact with our suppliers, as they are crucial to our ability to ramp up production when the market recovers.\nAccording to recent data, North American fleets are aging, with aerial equipment averaging around 55 months old, which we believe is a positive indicator for future demand.\nWhile we are confident in the recovery of the North American access equipment market, the exact timing remains unclear.\nWe anticipate lower sales in the first half of the year compared to the previous year.\nWe are in the early stages of discussions with our rental company customers and expect to have a clearer picture of the second half of the year before our next earnings call.\nAs mentioned last quarter, China's economy continues to recover, which we believe will lead to double-digit sales growth in the region for the foreseeable future.\nOur defense segment performed well this quarter but has been facing workforce availability challenges due to the pandemic's significant impact on our ability to schedule personnel and production.\nDespite these difficulties, which intensified late in the fourth quarter and continued into early this month, our operations teams have delivered strong results for our U.S. government customer and increased revenues by over 11% for the year.\nThe successful expansion of the JLTV program throughout the year has been a key factor and provides a solid foundation as part of our large backlog in the segment.\nIn October, our team was pleased to receive an expected order for 322 JLTVs from the Belgian Ministry of Defense.\nThe contract with our NATO ally, valued at more than €115 million, further demonstrates our success with the world's best light protected tactical wheeled vehicle.\nWe plan to begin shipping the vehicles in 2023 and anticipate announcing more international JLTV orders in 2021.\nWe won this order by competing against an established competitor, which we believe showcases the superior cost and performance characteristics of the JLTV product.\nI'd like to address the recently enacted Continuing Resolution, or CR.\nWhile CRs were once uncommon for government funding, they have become standard practice over the past 10 to 12 years.\nOur programs of record remain funded under the CR, so it does not pose an issue for 2021.\nFire & Emergency achieved a record-breaking quarterly adjusted operating income of 16.4% in the fourth quarter.\nOur F&E team has performed exceptionally well, navigating through supplier issues, customer travel restrictions, and other operational challenges, many of which were caused by COVID-19.\nThe simplification strategy adopted by F&E several years ago, combined with cutting-edge product innovation, provides the framework for the team to operate its business at such a high level.\nWe are ending the year with a strong backlog, supported by a record-breaking order year of nearly $1.3 billion, despite the negative impacts of COVID-19.\nAging fire truck fleets and the availability of new technologies support our positive long-term outlook for the F&E market.\nHowever, tight municipal budgets may limit demand in the near term.\nFire & Emergency is prepared to face this challenge with a market-leading lineup of high-quality custom and commercial fire trucks and RF units.\nWe continue to invest in new technologies, such as our Fotokite Situational Awareness System and alternative powertrain options, which you'll hear more about in the coming quarters.\nOur commercial segment has consistently improved throughout the year despite pandemic-related challenges.\nThe team delivered strong margins and higher year-over-year adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter, even with lower revenues.\nOur commercial team achieved its highest full-year adjusted operating income margin in over a decade.\nThis is particularly impressive given the market impacts from COVID-19, which halted construction in many areas of the country and temporarily reduced demand for waste collection at businesses earlier in the year.\nMuch of our recent success can be attributed to simplification efforts, disciplined cost management, and the introduction of our new S-Series 2.0 Front Discharge Concrete Mixer, which is generating excitement and helping us win new customers.\nDuring our last call, we announced restructuring plans to move rear discharge concrete mixer production from Minnesota to Ontario, Canada, as part of our strategy to simplify the business with a focused factory approach.\nI'm pleased to report that the transition is progressing as planned, and we expect a successful completion over the next few months.\nWe believe this will position us to drive sustained margin improvements.\nBefore concluding this segment, I want to mention our commitment to electrification as a means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide our customers with options for their future fleet plans.\nEarly in the fourth quarter, several companies announced plans for electric RCVs in the U.S. market.\nWe are proud to be working on electrification solutions across all of our businesses at Oshkosh.\nThis is especially applicable to RCVs, as we are collaborating with a chassis manufacturer to supply five electric RCV units for use in Boise, Idaho during the summer of 2021.\nI want to conclude by commenting on the positive attitude and culture we observe from the commercial team.\nTheir hard work in driving business and operational improvements, along with their commitment and dedication, is unparalleled and reflected in our results.\nThis concludes our discussion of our business segments.\nEffective execution enabled us to achieve 19% adjusted decremental margins overall and 23% adjusted decremental margins in access equipment during the fourth quarter.\nTotal net sales for the quarter were $1.8 billion, representing an 18.7% decrease compared to the same quarter last year.\nThe main factor contributing to the decline was a 39% reduction in access equipment segment sales.\nAccess equipment sales were adversely affected by reduced customer demand, primarily due to COVID-19.\nAs John noted, our customers remain wary about purchasing equipment due to uncertainties surrounding the pandemic and the associated weakness in nonresidential construction activity.\nThe consolidated adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $124.1 million or 7% of sales, compared to $203.1 million or 9.2% of sales in the same quarter of the previous year.\nAccess equipment segment adjusted operating income decreased due to lower sales and unfavorable manufacturing absorption resulting from planned shutdowns during the quarter, partially offset by the benefits of temporary cost reduction measures related to COVID-19.\nDefense segment adjusted operating income rose due to improved product mix and higher sales volume, partially counterbalanced by less favorable cumulative contract adjustments and increased engineering and proposal expenses in the current year quarter.\nFire & emergency segment operating income increased in the current year quarter due to improved price-cost dynamics and better absorption, partially offset by lower sales volume.\nCommercial segment fourth quarter adjusted operating income grew due to reduced spending in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and favorable material costs, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and lower sales volume.\nAdjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.30, compared to $2.17 in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nThe fourth quarter results were boosted by $0.02 per share from share repurchases completed in the previous 12 months.\nLastly, we generated robust free cash flow during the quarter, resulting in a full-year free cash flow of $238 million.\nThis is a commendable achievement in a year marked by rapid declines in customer demand, which put pressure on working capital.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to create uncertainty in the timing of customer demand in both our access equipment and commercial segments.\nOn the other hand, strong backlogs in our defense and fire & emergency segments provide good visibility well into 2021.\nHowever, as John mentioned earlier, recent increases in COVID-19 infection rates are causing workforce availability and supply chain issues, particularly in Wisconsin, where a significant portion of production for our defense and fire & emergency segments takes place.\nThis situation is creating production and labor efficiency risks for these two segments and is also likely to impact final truck inspections by customers in the fire & emergency segment.\nConsidering these factors, including the ongoing uncertainty of the pandemic, we are not in a position to provide quantitative expectations for 2021 at this time.\nWe are actively engaging in discussions with our key customers in the access equipment and commercial segments to understand their requirements for 2021, but we anticipate softer year-over-year demand in the first half of 2021 compared to 2020.\nThe demand for access equipment remains uncertain for the second half of the year, but we expect to have better clarity during the first quarter earnings call as we gain further insight into the trajectory of the pandemic and our customer requirements for 2021.\nAt access equipment, we are implementing two-week production shutdowns per month in the United States during the first quarter of 2021 to better align production with customer requirements.\nIn the second quarter of 2020, we implemented decisive actions that reduced our 2020 pre-tax costs by approximately $120 million.\nThe reductions were evenly distributed across three areas: salary reductions and furloughs, incentive compensation, and project travel and other discretionary spending.\nAs we previously discussed, these cost reductions were largely temporary, and we expect them to return to our expense run rate in 2021.\nAdditionally, we discussed permanent cost reduction actions during our last earnings call in the access equipment and commercial segments, totaling $30 million to $35 million once complete.\nWe anticipate these actions will benefit 2021 by approximately $20 million.\nRecently, we implemented additional permanent cost reductions totaling $15 million for 2021, which reduced corporate and segment operating expenses.\nTherefore, we expect to benefit from a total of $35 million in permanent cost reductions in 2021, growing to $45 million to $50 million by 2022.\nThe return of costs that drove the temporary cost reductions in 2020 will be a challenge to margins in 2021.\nHowever, we continue to manage our business in a disciplined manner and will respond to ongoing uncertainty with our established strategies.\nOur balance sheet remains strong with available liquidity of approximately $1.4 billion, consisting of cash of approximately $600 million and availability under our revolving line of credit of approximately $800

later in the year.\nWe have just completed a year in which we delivered nearly $5 of adjusted earnings per share amid a global pandemic, and we believe we are well-positioned moving into 2021 with our strong balance sheet and cash position.\nOur defense and fire & emergency backlogs provide visibility well into 2021, and we took aggressive actions early during the pandemic to lower our costs.\nOur culture at Oshkosh is strong, and we have an outstanding group of leaders and team members who have effectively managed production and supply chain disruptions and kept Oshkosh on a positive path since the pandemic began.\nWe can't let up as the threat is still present, but I'm reassured by the strength and resilience of our people and believe we will deliver solid sales and earnings

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:AMG began 2021 in a robust position, with our first-quarter results reflecting the ongoing momentum in our operations.\nThe company's economic earnings per share of $4.28 showed a 35% year-over-year increase, marking our strongest first quarter ever, primarily due to a 23% growth in EBITDA and continued share buybacks.\nWe anticipate accelerated growth in our business for the second quarter and throughout 2021, driven by exceptional affiliate investment performance, the impact of our strategic initiatives, and notably, increased activity and new investments.\nOur growing free cash flow and available capital, combined with a favorable environment for establishing new partnerships, present a significant opportunity to invest in high-quality firms in areas of secular growth, as demonstrated by our recent investments in OCP Asia and Boston Common.\nBy executing our strategy diligently, including returning excess capital to shareholders, we will further enhance our earnings and free cash flow generation, positioning us to create substantial long-term shareholder value.\nOver the past year, our affiliates have built upon their long-term performance records, showcasing their ability to excel during volatile periods.\nOutstanding investment performance during this time resulted in substantial first-quarter performance fees, increased asset levels, and improved organic growth.\nAs performance-driven improvements in organic growth trends continue across our business, we're observing investors reallocating portfolios as economies reopen globally.\nInvestors are allocating more funds to high-quality active managers, particularly independent firms, to navigate market volatility, safeguard capital, and achieve superior outcomes.\nAMG is benefiting from increased demand for fundamental equities and liquid alternatives, especially in our top-performing value-oriented affiliates and active ESG strategies, in addition to ongoing growth in private markets, specialty fixed income, and wealth management.\nWe expect our organic flow profile to continue improving as these trends persist and as we add new affiliates operating in areas of secular demand.\nAMG-led distribution efforts are contributing additional growth and momentum to our affiliates' new business activities, further supporting this improving profile.\nNearly two decades ago, we began developing AMG-led distribution resources to complement our affiliates' existing sales efforts.\nOver the past two years, we strategically evolved our platform to benefit our affiliate partners and their clients, focusing on the largest growth opportunities while better aligning our affiliates' in-demand products with the success of AMG distribution efforts.\nWe have repositioned our U.S. retail wealth distribution, aligning it with our institutional distribution strategy.\nThis change offers a more competitively priced, higher quality, and more differentiated set of strategies exclusively managed by AMG affiliates.\nWith this repositioning complete, our distribution platforms are now more strategically compelling to both existing and new affiliates, as well as our clients, due to increased focus, resources, and alignment.\nAs part of our strategy, we will continue to evolve our AMG-led distribution resources to reflect the changing composition and needs of our affiliates and their clients over time.\nAMG's enduring business model, which provides a permanent solution for independent firms, allows us to be a true strategic partner to our affiliates, distinct from any institutional competitor in the market today.\nOur partnership model is straightforward: we enhance our affiliates' ability to grow across generations while preserving their investment independence and operational autonomy.\nWe offer a uniquely broad set of partnership solutions to independent firms, having expanded our offerings over the years beyond succession planning to include minority investments, growth capital, and centralized distribution services on behalf of our affiliates.\nAs a result of this evolution and our strong competitive position, AMG's partnership approach is now even more attractive to a wider range of independent firms worldwide.\nOur new investment strategy is generating both growth and returns.\nOur partnership approach not only self-selects for growing firms, but our discipline in structuring new investments also generates meaningful returns for our shareholders across various business outcomes.\nOver the past two years, we have significantly increased our focus and resources devoted to identifying and executing new partnerships with independent firms.\nWe have concentrated our prospecting efforts on independent firms operating in areas of strong secular growth and client demand, including private markets, fixed income alternatives, the Asia Pacific region, ESG, and multi-asset solutions.\nWith this enhanced focus, we expect new investments to be a significant source of future earnings growth.\nAs we continue to execute on our growing opportunity set throughout 2021, each new affiliate will immediately contribute to our earnings.\nThe full impact of AMG's earnings power and growth profile will become fully apparent starting in 2022.\nDemonstrating the momentum in new investments, we recently announced our second partnership this year.\nOCP Asia, recognized as a leader in Asian private credit, has consistently delivered excellent returns for its clients.\nThere is strong cultural alignment between AMG and OCP Asia, and OCP's key principals were attracted to our partnership approach and the opportunity to expand their client reach through our global distribution capabilities.\nThis new partnership enhances and diversifies our exposure to both private markets and Asia, where we see increasing allocations.\nWe are excited to partner with Stu, Teall, Dan, and the broader team as they continue to provide differentiated investment returns and capitalize on their growth initiatives.\nThe strategic and growth investments made in the past two years are beginning to show results and will become more apparent in upcoming quarters.\nSince early 2019, we've added six new affiliates to our portfolio.\nWe have put resources into expanding our current affiliates.\nWe've expanded our range of partnership solutions.\nOur strategic capabilities have been improved.\nWe have restructured our distribution platform.\nWe've significantly strengthened our capital position and bought back nearly a fifth of our outstanding shares.\nWe've accomplished all this while revitalizing AMG's entrepreneurial spirit and re-establishing an ownership mentality throughout the organization.\nLooking forward, our business has considerable momentum, and we anticipate AMG's growth to accelerate.\nWith strong affiliate investment performance, improving organic growth outlook, and increasing opportunities to invest in excellent partner-owned firms, we're confident in our ability to capitalize on our substantial opportunities and continue to create value for shareholders.\nAs mentioned in our fourth-quarter discussion, focused execution of our strategy is yielding significant growth, as evidenced once again by our strong first quarter performance.\nOur earnings power and cash flow generation are increasing, and our unique ability to deploy capital across a wide range of opportunities to grow EBITDA and earnings per share sets us apart.\nLooking ahead, our value proposition for independent partner-owned firms, combined with an increasingly favorable environment for active managers, positions AMG well to compound earnings growth over time and generate substantial shareholder value.\nOur first-quarter results demonstrate the significant momentum we're experiencing across our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 23% year-over-year to $247 million, driven by strong affiliate investment performance and the impact of our growth investments.\nEconomic earnings per share increased by 35% year-over-year to $4.28, further boosted by share repurchase activity.\nNet client cash flows for the quarter showed significant improvement compared to previous periods, with flows representing the majority of our EBITDA turning positive, excluding certain quantitative strategies.\nContinued strength in private markets, specialty fixed income, and wealth management strategies continue to drive strong flows.\nIncreased demand for fundamental equity and liquid alternatives, particularly top-performing value and impact-oriented strategies, also contributed as clients adjust their portfolios for a post-pandemic world.\nExamining performance across our business, excluding certain quantitative strategies:\nIn alternatives, fundraising remains robust at Pantheon, Baring, EIG, and Comvest as clients steadily increase global private market allocations, resulting in net inflows of $2.8 billion in the first quarter.\nPerformance in this category is exceptional, with our affiliates deploying dry powder into attractive return opportunities, including Asia private equity, global secondaries, coinvestments, and credit.\nOur private markets segment continues to be a significant source of earnings growth, accounting for nearly 20% of management fee EBITDA with increasing future carried interest potential.\nWe continue to add high-quality partnerships in this sector, including our investment in OCP Asia, which I'll discuss further shortly.\nIn liquid alternatives, our affiliates are delivering strong performance across relative value fixed income amid ongoing bond market volatility, as well as in concentrated long-only strategies.\nWe're seeing increased client interest in this category as investors seek alternative sources of yield and return.\nCapula, Garda, and ValueAct continue to generate excellent investment performance, resulting in strong performance fees and demonstrating the attractiveness and resilience of these strategies.\nIn fundamental equities, we continue to see strong performance across various affiliates.\nU.S. equities reported net inflows of $300 million.\nThe outperformance of value strategies following a decade of headwinds is leading to increased client conversations, benefiting high-quality independent firms like River Road and Yacktman.\nGlobal equities experienced net outflows of $3.9 billion, driven by redemptions in regionally focused strategies.\nAffiliates continue to deliver strong investment performance across various strategies, including at Harding Loevner, Veritas, and Artemis.\nMulti-asset and fixed income strategies continue to generate steady long-duration inflows, and we expect ongoing client demand trends to support future growth.\nThese strategies produced $900 million in net client cash flows during the quarter, primarily driven by ongoing demand for municipal bond strategies at GW&K and stable growth across our wealth management affiliates.\nAffiliate investment performance and capital inflow trends are progressing positively as customers increasingly seek independent active managers for superior investment results.\nWe are shifting our business focus towards areas of long-term growth through investments in current and new affiliates, which will improve our organic growth outlook in the future.\nLet's now examine the financial details.\nIn the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA reached $247 million, showing a 23% increase compared to the previous year, primarily due to strong affiliate investment results.\nThe adjusted EBITDA included $42 million in performance fees, reflecting exceptional results in certain liquid alternative strategies.\nEconomic earnings per share grew by 35% year-over-year to $4.28, further enhanced by share buyback activities.\nNow let's discuss specific modeling elements for the upcoming quarter.\nWe anticipate adjusted EBITDA to range between $210 million and $220 million based on current AUM levels, reflecting our market blend, which saw a 3% increase as of last Friday.\nThis estimate includes performance fees up to $10 million and the impact of our latest investments in OCP Asia and Boston Common.\nIt's worth noting that the second and third quarters typically have lower performance fees due to the timing of performance fee crystallization.\nOur share of interest expense was $27 million in the first quarter, and we expect it to remain similar in the second quarter.\nControlling interest depreciation was $2 million in the first quarter, with a similar level expected for the second quarter.\nOur share of reported amortization and impairments totaled $41 million in the first quarter, with an expected decrease to $35 million in the second quarter.\nOur effective GAAP and cash tax rates were 24% and 20% respectively in the first quarter, with similar levels expected for the second quarter.\nIntangible-related deferred taxes amounted to $9 million in the first quarter, with an expected increase to $11 million in the second quarter.\nOther economic items were negative $15 million, including the mark-to-market impact on GP and seed capital investments.\nFor the second quarter, we anticipate other economic items, excluding any mark-to-market impact on GP and seed, to be $1 million for modeling purposes.\nOur adjusted weighted average share count for the first quarter was 43.2 million, with an expected decrease to approximately 42.4 million for the second quarter.\nRegarding our balance sheet and capital allocation, we are in an excellent position with substantial liquidity access and a flexible long-term debt profile.\nWe continue to seek ways to enhance our capital structure.\nOur strong and growing free cash flow allows us to invest capital through disciplined strategy execution, including new investment partnerships that create significant long-term value.\nWe prioritize investing in high-growth businesses in areas of sustained demand.\nNew investments generally grow faster than our existing business in terms of both cash flows and revenues, enhancing our organic growth profile and EBITDA growth.\nThese new investments not only contribute immediately to our EBITDA but also allow us to finance a portion of the purchase price with debt and often achieve additional tax benefits, improving returns for our shareholders.\nAs we implement our strategy, we maintain a disciplined approach to pricing and structure, aiming for risk-adjusted returns well above our cost of capital across various potential scenarios.\nOverall, new investments generate immediate earnings and organic growth while being strategically crucial for the long-term growth and sustainability of our business.\nOur recent investment in OCP Asia exemplifies the value of investing in new affiliates.\nWe acquired a minority stake in the company through a revenue-sharing agreement, with a structure designed to minimize earnings volatility.\nThe business is experiencing double-digit organic growth and is priced to deliver attractive returns across various scenarios.\nWe anticipate the investment will contribute an additional $0.20 to economic earnings per share in 2021 and $0.33 in 2022, including $16 million of EBITDA in 2022.\nOur renewed emphasis on disciplined capital allocation ensures that every dollar invested is evaluated using a common framework, allowing us to make growth investments that clearly meet our risk and return criteria while returning excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases.\nIn the first quarter, we bought back $210 million worth of shares, bringing our total share repurchases to nearly 20% of outstanding shares over the past two years.\nWe aim to continue reducing our share count through repurchases over time and remain on track to repurchase $500 million of shares this year, subject to market conditions and the timing of new investments.\nWe are well-positioned to compound earnings growth through new investments, investment performance, cash flows, and share repurchases.\nThe momentum in our business is accelerating, and the combination of our strategy, capital position, and favorable investment environment for growth highlight the numerous reasons to be optimistic about AMG's future.\nSummary: ",

as CFO Gary Millerchip.\nOur SEC filings provide an in-depth analysis of factors that could significantly impact our business operations.\nWe'll be hosting a business update with a tour of our new Kroger delivery fulfillment center in Florida on March 4, 2022.\nWe're hoping you can attend.\nThe holiday season is when we typically excel.\nAs we progress through the holidays, we're confident in our ability to deliver.\nWe're extremely pleased with our third quarter performance and the ongoing momentum in our operations.\nWe achieved positive identical sales excluding fuel for the quarter.\nOur digital sales grew by triple digits on a two-year stack, and we've revised our full year 2021 forecast upwards.\nOur adaptability and the dedication of our exceptional staff are enabling us to manage current labor and supply chain challenges while offering the freshest food at competitive prices across our integrated ecosystem.\nConsumers are showing more normal behaviors, while also eating more at home due to its affordability, convenience, health benefits, and family-oriented nature.\nCustomers engaged in larger gatherings with loved ones compared to the previous year.\nThey also continued to cook at home before and during the holiday, opting for premium products to enhance their culinary experience.\nThese factors support our belief that the shift towards eating at home is a lasting change rather than a temporary one.\nWith most people eating at home and grocery stores maintaining the majority of food consumption, it's crucial that we offer customers flexibility in how they shop with us.\nOur comprehensive seamless ecosystem is designed to meet our customers' changing needs.\nSimultaneously, 84% of consumers indicated they will continue to shop online at the same rate or more in the future.\nOur seamless ecosystem is specifically designed to accommodate these seemingly conflicting behaviors.\nWe're aware that inflation is affecting customers as well.\n82% of consumers surveyed nationwide are feeling the impact of inflation, and one in four are not confident about their financial situation.\nWe're using our data and personalization capabilities to help customers maximize their food budgets.\nWe provide value when customers need it most through personalized promotions, bulk offerings, and special holiday deals.\nWhile price remains a key concern, customers continue to prioritize fresh food options, and we're meeting this demand by emphasizing freshness.\nWe saw growth in Natural & Organic sales as customers continue to prefer healthier options.\nOur fresh departments outperformed the company's overall identical sales excluding fuel during the quarter.\nWe had a record-breaking quarter in alternative farming products, which include new produce growing methods like vertical and indoor farming.\nThese offerings increase customers' access to produce harvested at peak freshness.\nWe're proud to announce that Home Chef became a $1 billion brand on an annual basis in the third quarter, as convenient meal solutions and innovative products have clearly resonated with our customers.\nKroger is committed to delivering a customer-focused, seamless experience that requires no compromises, regardless of how customers choose to shop with us.\nWe introduced three new offerings this quarter that support our plan to double digital sales and profitability by 2023.\nFirst, Boost by Kroger enhances our industry-leading loyalty program by providing additional savings and personalized offers to members.\nInitial engagement in the program has exceeded our internal expectations.\nSecond, we launched Kroger Delivery Now in collaboration with Instacart.\nThis unique convenience and immediacy service positions us to win more shopping trips from existing customers and attract new customers to the Kroger ecosystem by offering the largest selection of quality fresh products at affordable prices in 30 minutes.\nWhat's remarkable about this offering is that it was profitable from day one, contributing to our goal of doubling digital profitability by 2023, as announced during our 2021 investor day.\nThird, we announced a strategic partnership with Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy Baby to expand our current marketplace offerings and provide Kroger shoppers easy access to essential home and baby products.\nThis exclusive offering will be available through Kroger.com and in a small-scale physical store pilot at select locations starting in 2022.\nWe continue to be satisfied with the performance of our customer fulfillment centers in Groveland, Florida and Monroe, Ohio, which are surpassing internal expectations.\nWe're particularly proud of our Net Promoter Scores, driven by our teams delivering an exceptional experience for our customers, and we're excited to host you in Groveland early next year.\nRegarding our supply chain, we're confident in our ability to meet customer needs during the holidays and beyond.\nThis is due to our teams' excellent planning well in advance to maintain a fully stocked, fresh, and welcoming customer experience.\nIn fact, our customers took action to prepare for today's supply chain constraints back in the spring.\nLeveraging lessons from pandemic operations, we maintained additional warehouses initially added for COVID support to ensure customer service throughout the holiday season.\nWe opted to invest heavily in our supply chain during 2021, enabling us to meet customer needs now and into 2022.\nWe're utilizing various strategies, including our own fleet, and collaborating closely with suppliers to reduce customer inconveniences.\nOur recent hybrid recruitment event resulted in over 64,000 new employees joining us this quarter.\nWe're enhancing our industry-leading employee benefits, including educational support, professional development, health programs, and ongoing wage improvements.\nOn the first anniversary of our initiative addressing racial injustice, we're pleased to share our progress.\nMore than 405,000 employees have completed diversity and inclusion training.\nWe've expanded our strategic partnerships with Historically Black Colleges & Universities and Hispanic-serving institutions from six to 17.\nOur foundation has granted over $3 million to organizations promoting equity and inclusion, and we increased our diverse supplier spending by 21% to $4.1 billion last year, progressing towards our $10 billion annual goal by 2030.\nWhile more work remains, we're enthusiastic about updating stakeholders on our ongoing progress.\nKroger excels at managing our business effectively in all operational environments.\nWe maintain our focus on customer satisfaction and operational excellence to benefit customers, employees, communities, and shareholders.\nOur execution focus, balanced approach to investments, cost management, and alternative profit growth are positioning us well for the future.\nOur model has proven resilient across economic scenarios, as demonstrated in the third quarter with top and bottom-line growth despite inflation, labor shortages, and supply chain issues.\nIdentical sales without fuel grew 3.1% as we delivered across our ecosystem, with customers indicating sustained higher food-at-home consumption.\nAdjusted FIFO operating profit and earnings per share increased year-over-year, growing at compound annual rates of 22% and 29% respectively compared to 2019.\nThird quarter earnings were affected by two unusual items excluded from adjusted earnings per share.\nWe conducted an annuity buyout and lump-sum distribution for our retirement plan, resulting in an $87 million pre-tax non-cash charge.\nThis fully-funded company pension plan is currently 100% funded due to previous actions to freeze the plan and protect benefits.\nKroger recorded a $47 million benefit, primarily due to favorable income tax audit outcomes covering multiple years.\nI'll now provide more details on our quarterly operating results.\nOur identical sales without fuel increased 14% on a two-year stack basis.\nDigital sales grew 103% on a two-year stack.\nWe've previously mentioned that digital growth won't be linear, especially as we cycle last year's sales spike and customers return to in-store shopping.\nNew digital offerings and customer fulfillment centers give us confidence in meeting our digital sales and profitability targets.\nWe'll share more about our digital strategy at the March business update.\nWe continued to improve digital profitability, achieving our best-ever cost to serve for pickup orders.\nThird quarter gross margin was 21.66% of sales.\nThe FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 41 basis points year-over-year, mainly due to higher supply chain costs and price investments, partially offset by sourcing benefits.\nOur investment met expectations and was fully funded by cost savings and OG&A improvement.\nGiven recent inflation trends and our outlook, we recorded a higher LIFO charge of $93 million, compared to $23 million last year, representing a $0.07 earnings per share headwind versus 2020.\nThe OG&A rate decreased 49 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items, despite continued associate investments and wage increases, reflecting our team's excellent cost-saving execution in a dynamic environment.\nWe're on track to deliver $1 billion in cost savings for 2021.\nOur alternative profit business had a record third quarter and is set to deliver the high end of our expected $100 million to $150 million incremental operating profit range in 2021.\nKroger Personal Finance showed increased strength, and Kroger Precision Marketing launched a new programmatic advertising marketplace, highlighting our advertising capabilities.\nFuel remains a crucial part of our value proposition, especially when prices are high.\nWe saw a significant increase in customers actively engaging with our fuel program this quarter.\nSales volume increased by 5% in the third quarter, surpassing market growth rates.\nFuel prices at retail averaged $3.24 this quarter, up from $2.15 in the same period last year.\nOur fuel margin per gallon was $0.42, an increase from $0.37 in the same quarter of 2020.\nI would like to offer some additional insights on how we are actively addressing inflation.\nWe are currently experiencing a more unstable inflationary environment.\nDuring the third quarter, Kroger observed higher product cost inflation across most categories.\nWe are carefully managing these price increases.\nOur teams are doing an outstanding job, striving to minimize the impact on our customers and our financial model by utilizing our data and collaborating closely with our suppliers.\nWe are transferring higher costs to customers when appropriate.\nIn certain key areas, we are opting not to pass on cost increases and continuing to invest in value for our customers.\nWe are investing strategically, using our proprietary data to be tactical in our pricing and personalization with the aim of securing long-term customer loyalty.\nWe also believe our brands are an even more crucial differentiator for Kroger in an inflationary environment, providing customers with an unparalleled combination of excellent value and quality.\nLet's now discuss our financial strategy.\nKroger is operating from a strong position and continues to generate robust free cash flow, as demonstrated by our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio reaching a record low of 1.68 in the third quarter.\nWhile we continue to identify attractive opportunities to invest in the business to expand our competitive advantage and drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth, our capital expenditures for 2021 are now expected to be lower than our initial guidance range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion.\nThis is due to delays in project implementations, primarily caused by COVID-19-related supply challenges.\nKroger continues to provide returns to shareholders.\nWe repurchased $297 million of shares during the quarter, and have repurchased $1 billion of shares year to date.\nSince 2000, we have now returned over $20 billion to shareholders through share repurchases at an average price of $16.45 per share.\nAs of the end of the third quarter, $511 million remains available under the current Board authorization announced on June 17, 2021.\nWe look forward to sharing more about our plans for future use of excess cash to drive sustainable growth and create value for our shareholders at our business update in March.\nAs Rodney mentioned, we continue to make significant investments in our associates.\nIn addition to the $350 million in hourly rate investments already planned for this year, we have committed to further investments in the fourth quarter, amounting to an additional $100 million on an annualized basis.\nDuring the third quarter, we finalized new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in our Columbus and Mid-Atlantic divisions, covering more than 4,500 associates.\nWe are still negotiating contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Houston, Lake Charles, Freeport, Dallas meat, Little Rock, Memphis, Portland, and Denver.\nOur financial results are impacted by inefficiencies in healthcare and pension costs, which most of our competitors do not face.\nWe continue to engage with our local and international unions, which represent many of our associates, about the importance of growing our business profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.\nNow I'll discuss our expectations for the remainder of 2021.\nDue to the momentum in our third quarter results and sustained trends in food at home, we are increasing our full year guidance.\nWe now anticipate identical sales without fuel for the full year to be between negative 0.4% and negative 0.2%, and a two-year identical sales stack of between 13.7% to 13.9%.\nThere are still some uncertainties as we look ahead, and our guidance of positive ID sales excluding fuel of between 1.5% to 2.5% in the fourth quarter reflects this.\nWe expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to range from $3.40 to $3.50.\nWe anticipate our adjusted FIFO operating profit to be between $4.1 billion and $4.2 billion, reflecting a two-year compounded annual growth rate of 17% to 18.4%.\nThe midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share range for 2021 now equates to full year results approximately in line with our 2020 results, despite cycling the unique COVID-19-related demand spike last year.\nOur guidance fully accounts for the investments in our customers and associates I mentioned earlier, as well as increased marketing to support the exciting new digital initiatives we launched in the third quarter.\nIt also reflects the latest projection for LIFO.\nSince we recorded a LIFO credit in the fourth quarter last year, LIFO is now expected to be a $0.13 headwind to earnings per share in the fourth quarter.\nOverall, we are very proud of our results, which are projected to be significantly better than our original guidance for the year.\nIn summary, Kroger is executing its key financial and operational initiatives and continues to invest in strategic priorities that will deliver attractive and sustainable total shareholder return of 8% to 11% over time.\nWe believe our business is emerging stronger through the pandemic and, through the investments we are making, is well-positioned to grow beyond 2021.\nKroger's strong year-to-date results are the product of our customer focus, our incredible associates who bring our vision and values to life, and our commitment to providing fresh, affordable food to everyone.\nThe strength of our teams has never been more evident.\nWith each new challenge, they rise to the occasion, whether by implementing solutions to minimize supply chain disruptions, delivering the freshest produce to our customers, or using our data to offer personalized promotions that surprise and delight.\nOur team is bringing our competitive advantages to life.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Scott Barbour, our President and CEO, and Scott Cottrill, our CFO, are present with me today.\nA copy of the document has been submitted to the SEC in an 8-K filing.\nWe experienced a robust second quarter in fiscal 2021, with revenue growing by 10% as market conditions and business activity remain positive.\nI'm grateful to our clients for collaborating with us in innovative ways to cater to the construction industry.\nWe achieved strong results in key growth regions, including Florida, the Carolinas, Tennessee, Georgia, and Utah, as well as across the southern and southeastern United States.\nOverall, we benefited from our nationwide presence, geographical diversity, and increased residential market exposure through Infiltrator and targeted homebuilder programs at ADS.\nInfiltrator surpassed revenue expectations once again, achieving 63% sales growth in the second quarter.\nInfiltrator continues to experience double-digit growth in tanks and leach field products, particularly in Florida, the Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama.\nRemember that Infiltrator's results cover only two months of the previous year's quarter, due to the acquisition's completion on July 31, 2019.\nIn the residential sector, legacy ADS sales grew by 15% this quarter.\nWe observe positive trends in new construction, repairs, renovations, and on-site septic systems.\nOrders, backlog, and sales remained strong throughout the period, with minimal impact from the earlier slowdown in residential construction starts.\nOverall, we are well-positioned for growth in the residential market.\nAt the beginning of the cycle, ADS products and marketing strategy are geared towards the land development phase, while Infiltrator products come into play near the end of the cycle as construction nears completion.\nFurthermore, both Infiltrator and ADS have a repair and renovation component that is thriving as home improvement activities and existing home sales continue to increase.\nApproximately one-third of Infiltrator's sales are related to repairs and renovations, while at ADS, this exposure is addressed through our retail and national accounts.\nThe company's exposure to the residential market has increased to 38% of domestic sales, compared to 28% at the same time last year.\nSales in our nonresidential sector showed modest growth, led by strong increases in HP Pipe and Storm Tech retention detaching chambers, as we continue to benefit from our involvement in horizontal construction.\nWe are closely monitoring the segments of the nonresidential market that continue to perform well, such as data centers and warehouses, as well as regions experiencing growth like the southeast and Atlantic Coast.\nImportantly, we believe ADS is well-positioned to continue outperforming the market due to our conversion strategy, national coverage, and comprehensive water management solutions.\nBased on current market conditions, we anticipate the second half of the year to be similar to what we experienced in the first six months.\nAgricultural sales decreased slightly this quarter, as we had anticipated due to a challenging comparison period.\nNevertheless, the agricultural sales team has had an excellent first half of fiscal 2021, with sales up 14% year-over-year.\nAdditionally, the fall selling season is off to a strong start as we continue to benefit from the programs we implemented, including organizational changes, new product introductions, and improved execution in the agriculture market.\nInternational sales grew by 3%, driven by double-digit growth in our Canadian business.\nThe construction and agriculture sectors in Canada are performing favorably.\nIn contrast, Mexico's performance is lagging, having been more heavily affected by the COVID-19 crisis.\nHigh demand is resulting in some constraints at regional and product-specific levels.\nAs we enter this part of the season, delivery times and stock levels are under pressure.\nGiven the robust demand and our aim to better exploit opportunities in our primary markets, we are increasing our capital expenditures, which we anticipate will reach between $80 million and $90 million this fiscal year.\nOur investment priorities will be enhancing safety, expanding capacity for future growth, and boosting productivity.\nWe plan to replenish finished goods inventory in the latter half of the year by maintaining steady production at our facilities during traditionally slow periods, preparing both ADS and Infiltrator for optimal customer service and regular lead times.\nThis replenishment will be contingent on second-half demand, the implementation of new capital, and managing COVID-19-related issues such as employee retention, absenteeism, and local conditions.\nThis situation aligns with the environment we've been navigating since the onset of the pandemic.\nWe're also investing in talent, including the recent hiring of a senior executive to boost new product launches, marketing, and innovation.\nI'm delighted to announce that Brian King joined our organization in September to spearhead this initiative as the Executive Vice President of Product Management and Marketing.\nBrian brings 25 years of successful product management experience, and we're thrilled to have him on our team.\nTurning to our financial performance.\nWe achieved another record-breaking quarter in terms of adjusted EBITDA.\nOverall adjusted EBITDA margin rose by 820 basis points, with a 640 basis point increase in the legacy ADS business.\nThis improvement was driven by favorable material costs, leverage from growth in Pipe and Allied Products, implementation of our operational initiatives, and contributions from proactive cost-saving measures we implemented earlier this year.\nInfiltrator also reached record profitability this quarter due to strong demand, favorable material costs, contributions from our synergy programs, and continued execution of their proven business model.\nThe synergy programs are on track to meet the run rate targets we previously announced.\nLooking ahead to the second half of the year, we are optimistic as our order book, project tracking, book-to-bill ratio, and backlog all remain positive.\nWe anticipate normal seasonal patterns to apply in the second half of our fiscal year, with installation activity slowing in colder regions.\nWe also face some profitability challenges in the third and fourth quarters, including rising costs for materials and labor.\nWe are working to counteract these challenges through pricing adjustments, operational efficiency initiatives, and our synergy programs.\nTo conclude, we performed exceptionally well this quarter.\nWe're prioritizing safety, navigating the COVID-19 environment, serving our customers, and driving new levels of profitable performance.\nDespite ongoing uncertainty in the broader market, we are well-positioned to capitalize on residential development and horizontal construction while continuing to achieve above-market growth through our material conversion and water management solution strategies.\nWe remain committed to executing our plans efficiently as we aim to build upon our strong performance in the first half of fiscal 2021.\nOur second quarter fiscal 2021 financial results are presented on slide six.\nRevenue grew by 10%, with our legacy ADS business increasing by 4% and our Infiltrator business expanding by 63%.\nThe residential market led the growth in our legacy ADS business, with a 15% increase in sales, continuing to show robust performance.\nAs Scott mentioned, our nonresidential market remains stable, with particular strength in horizontal construction, data centers, and warehouses.\nSales remained strong throughout the quarter, and this trend has persisted into October.\nInfiltrator experienced growth across its product range, particularly in leach field and tank product lines.\nInfiltrator continued to benefit from the strong repair and remodel market, as well as growth in single-family housing construction.\nTheir material conversion strategy further accelerated this growth.\nIn terms of profitability, adjusted EBITDA rose by $56 million or 47% compared to the previous year.\nThe legacy ADS business saw an increase of $33 million or 35% in adjusted EBITDA, with excellent performance from our sales, operations, procurement, and distribution teams.\nADS is well-positioned to take advantage of the current market stability due to our industry-leading position, national relationships, wide range of products and services, and diversity in geography and end markets.\nThese factors make us the preferred partner and industry leader, resulting in margin expansion and strong financial results for the quarter.\nInfiltrator's adjusted EBITDA grew by $21 million or 86%, benefiting from high demand, favorable pricing, reduced input costs, improved productivity, and our synergy programs.\nWe now turn to slide seven.\nOur free cash flow increased by $112 million to $257 million, compared to $135 million in the first half of fiscal 2020.\nThese impressive free cash flow results were driven by strong sales growth and profitability in the first half of fiscal 2021, as well as successful implementation of our working capital initiatives.\nOur working capital decreased to approximately 20% of sales, down from 22% at the same time last year.\nAdditionally, our trailing 12-month pro forma leverage ratio is now 1.5 times, slightly below our target range of 2 to 3 times leverage.\nWe concluded the quarter in a strong liquidity position, with $204 million in cash and $339 million available under our revolving credit facility, totaling $543 million in liquidity.\nThe positive changes to our capital structure have resulted in no significant debt maturities until 2026.\nWhile we are satisfied with our conversion of adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow in the first half of this year, we will need to make strategic investments in working capital and capex during the second half to position ourselves for expected growth and support productivity initiatives in both the legacy ADS and Infiltrator businesses.\nWe continue to evaluate potential bolt-on acquisitions through our disciplined acquisition process.\nLastly, on slide eight, we presented our guidance for fiscal 2021.\nBased on our performance to date, order activity, backlog, and current market trends, we anticipate net sales to range from $1,790,000,000 to $1,840,000,000, representing growth of 7% to 10% over last year; adjusted EBITDA to range from $495 million to $515 million, representing growth of 37% to 42% over last year, and we expect to convert our adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow at a rate of around 60% for the full year, driven by our strong results as well as the investments we just discussed.\nPlease open the line for questions, operator.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We will examine the results from the initial three months of 2021 today.\nJoining me on the call are our CEO Norman Schwartz, CFO Ilan Daskal, COO Andy Last, Life Science Group President Annette Tumolo, and Clinical Diagnostics Group President Dara Wright.\nOur actual outcomes may significantly differ from these projections and expectations, and we cannot predict the full impact or length of the COVID-19 crisis.\nWe are uncertain if Bio-Rad's pandemic response will be effective, if the demand for our COVID-19 products will remain stable, or if we can meet that demand.\nWe'll also mention non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted income per share, which are financial measures not defined by generally accepted accounting principles.\nBefore delving into the first quarter details, I'd like Andy Last, our COO, to update us on Bio-Rad's operations given the current global pandemic situation.\nAs anticipated, COVID continues to affect our operations, but as previously stated, we've adapted well to this environment, and our global workforce continues to perform excellently.\nWe maintain our focus on three key areas: ensuring employee safety, maintaining manufacturing to supply products and support customers, and advancing our core strategies.\nWe remain very satisfied with our employee safety measures despite rising COVID cases in some global regions.\nOur internal COVID transmission rates stay extremely low, and we're beginning to see benefits from vaccination programs.\nIn Q1, we've maintained our 2020 work-from-home policies and continue to closely monitor the pandemic as we consider the appropriate timing for a broader return to the workplace.\nEntering Q2, we expect the pandemic to continue impacting us for at least another quarter, but we're confident in our ability to meet customer demands while advancing our core strategies and new product development goals.\nAs the global economy moves towards recovery, we're closely monitoring our supply chain, as increased demand for raw materials could potentially cause constraints and extend higher-than-usual logistics costs.\nAssuming positive global progress in controlling COVID, we anticipate operations beginning to return to more normal practices in the year's second half.\nLet's now review the first quarter results.\nFirst quarter 2021 net sales were $726.8 million, a 27.1% increase from $571.6 million in Q1 2020.\nCurrency-neutral sales increased by 23.4%.\nThe first quarter's year-over-year revenue growth was affected by a challenging comparison due to about $10 million in revenue carried over to Q1 2020 related to the December 2019 cyber-attack.\nWe experienced currency-neutral growth across all three geographic regions.\nWe continued to see strong demand for COVID-19 testing and related research products.\nGenerally, most academic and diagnostic labs are now operating at about 90% capacity, an improvement from Q4.\nWe estimate COVID-19-related sales were approximately $94 million this quarter.\nFirst quarter 2021 Life Science Group sales were $366.5 million, compared to $227.2 million in Q1 2020, a 61.3% increase on a reported basis and a 56.9% increase on a currency-neutral basis.\nThe year-over-year growth in the first quarter was driven by continued strength in COVID-19-related qPCR products.\nWe also saw strong double-digit year-over-year sales growth in Droplet Digital PCR, Western Blot, and antibody products.\nProcess Media, which can fluctuate quarterly, experienced strong double-digit year-over-year growth this quarter compared to the same quarter last year.\nExcluding Process Media sales, the core Life Science business grew 56.2% on a currency-neutral basis compared to Q1 2020.\nThe Life Science segment experienced currency-neutral year-over-year sales growth across all geographic regions.\nBesides increased adoption of Droplet Digital PCR in BioPharma, strong demand was observed for the QX ONE in COVID wastewater testing, and we quickly launched well-received COVID variant assays.\nExperts continue to emphasize the superior sensitivity of Droplet Digital PCR.\nThe Clinical Diagnostics Group's sales reached $358.5 million in Q1, up from $340.3 million in the same period last year, representing a 5.4% increase in reported terms and a 2.2% rise on a currency-neutral basis.\nThe Diagnostics Group experienced robust growth in diabetes and quality control products during the first quarter.\nWe observed a resurgence in non-COVID related market demand, with diagnostic laboratories operating at approximately 90% of pre-pandemic levels.\nThe revival of routine testing and elective procedures is ongoing.\nGeographically, the Diagnostics group experienced growth in the Asian market.\nThe first quarter of 2021 saw a GAAP gross margin of 55.1%, compared to 55.5% in Q1 2020.\nThe decrease in the current quarter's gross margin percentage was primarily due to restructuring-related expenses announced earlier this year, partially offset by improved product mix, reduced service costs, and higher manufacturing efficiency.\nAcquisition-related amortization recorded in cost of goods sold amounted to $4.6 million, up from $3.9 million in Q1 2020.\nQ1 2021 SG&A expenses totaled $225.9 million, or 31.1% of sales, compared to $193.7 million, or 33.9% in Q1 2020.\nThe year-over-year increase in SG&A expenses was mainly attributed to restructuring costs and higher employee-related expenses, partially offset by a $5 million cybersecurity insurance settlement related to the 2019 cyber-attack and reduced discretionary spending.\nAcquisition-related amortization recorded in SG&A for the quarter reached $2.4 million, up from $2 million in Q1 2020.\nR&D expenses in Q1 amounted to $73.9 million, or 10.2% of sales, compared to $49.3 million, or 8.6% in Q1 2020.\nThe year-over-year increase in R&D expenses was due to restructuring costs and increased project spending.\nQ1 operating income was $100.9 million, or 13.9% of sales, compared to $74.4 million, or 13% in Q1 2020.\nExamining the non-operating section of the income statement.\nThe change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $1.179 billion of income to the reported results, primarily related to Sartorius AG share holdings.\nInterest and other income resulted in net other income of $16.9 million during the quarter, compared to $3.3 million of expense last year.\nQ1 2021 included $19 million of dividend income from Sartorius, which was declared in Q1 this year.\nIn 2020, the Sartorius dividend was announced in the second quarter.\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.7%, up from 23.7% in Q1 2020.\nThe tax rates for both periods were influenced by the substantial unrealized gain in equity securities.\nThe year-over-year increase in the effective tax rate was attributed to the restructuring initiative announced earlier this year.\nReported net income for the first quarter reached $977.4 million, with diluted earnings per share of $32.38.\nThis represents an increase from the previous year, largely due to changes in the valuation of Sartorius holdings.\nTransitioning to the non-GAAP results.\nWhen examining the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain unusual and unique items that impacted gross and operating margins, as well as other income.\nWe have removed $4.6 million for amortization of purchased intangibles, $24 million for restructuring-related costs, and a minor legal reserve benefit from the cost of goods sold calculation.\nThese adjustments increased the non-GAAP gross margin for Q1 2021 to 59%, compared to 55.9% in Q1 2020.\nNon-GAAP SG&A expenses in Q1 2021 were 25.4%, down from 33.3% in Q1 2020.\nFor non-GAAP SG&A, we've excluded $34.7 million in restructuring-related expenses, $4.4 million in legal-related costs, and $2.4 million for amortization of purchased intangibles.\nWe've taken out $16.9 million of restructuring-related expenses from R&D costs.\nAs a result, the non-GAAP R&D expense for Q1 was 7.9%.\nThese non-GAAP adjustments collectively raised the quarterly operating margin from 13.9% (GAAP) to 25.8% (non-GAAP).\nThis non-GAAP operating margin of 25.8% is higher than the 13.9% non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 2020.\nWe've also excluded some items below the operating line, including the $1.179 billion increase in Sartorius equity holdings value and $1.8 million loss from venture investments.\nOur Q1 non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.6%, lower than the 25.7% in Q1 2020.\nChanges in the geographical distribution of earnings affected the tax rate.\nThe non-GAAP net income for Q1 2021 reached $157.4 million, or $5.21 per diluted share, up from $57.6 million and $1.91 per share in Q1 2020.\nLet's examine the balance sheet.\nAt the end of Q1, total cash and short-term investments were $1.025 billion, an increase from $997 million at the end of 2020.\nIn Q1, we bought back 89,506 shares of our stock for $50 million, at an average price of about $559 per share.\nNet cash from operations in Q1 2021 was $114 million, compared to $63 million in Q1 2020.\nThe increase is primarily due to higher operating profits.\nQ4 2021 adjusted EBITDA was $232 million or 31.9% of sales, and 29.3% excluding the Sartorius dividend.\nQ1 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $107.4 million or 18.8% of sales, not including the 2020 Sartorius dividend.\nQ1 2021 net capital expenditures were $19.5 million, with depreciation and amortization at $32.7 million.\nNow, let's discuss the guidance.\nWe initially projected 4.5% to 5% non-GAAP sales growth and a non-GAAP operating margin between 16% and 16.5% for the year.\nDespite ongoing uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic's duration and impact, based on Q1 results and current outlook, we now expect currency-neutral revenue growth for 2021 to be between 5.5% and 6%.\nThis includes estimated COVID-related sales of $170 million to $180 million, up from our previous estimate of $150 million to $160 million.\nWe expect most 2021 COVID-19-related sales to occur in the first half of the year, and we still anticipate a gradual return to pre-pandemic activity and a more normal business mix.\nWe now project full-year non-GAAP gross margin to be between 56.5% and 57%, up from our previous guidance of 56.2% to 56.5%.\nWe also expect full-year non-GAAP operating margin to be about 17%, and full-year adjusted EBITDA margin to be around 22%, up from our previous guidance of 21%.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The SEC filings for our company are available in the Investors section of our website at unum.com\nThe third quarter 2021 net income included several after-tax items: a $9.6 million impairment loss on internal-use software, $15.5 million amortization of reinsurance costs, a $143.3 million reserve decrease from assumption updates, and a negligible $100,000 investment portfolio loss\nThird quarter 2020 net income included $18.6 million in after-tax costs for an organizational update and a $3.8 million after-tax investment portfolio gain\nExcluding these items, third quarter 2021 after-tax adjusted operating income was $210.5 million compared to $245.9 million in the same quarter last year\nOur business lines experienced growth in revenue with good returns\nWe acknowledge the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our short-term results\nWhile COVID-19 has negatively affected our core returns, we remain confident in the long-term profitability of our business\nI'll begin by discussing overall operations before addressing COVID-19 trends\nIt's worth noting that core premium growth has been consistent and in line with our previous projections\nIn the third quarter, Unum US saw a 1.2% year-over-year increase in premium income\nColonial Life achieved slightly positive results after three quarters of negative comparisons, while our International divisions also showed positive premium trends\nThis premium growth is gaining momentum as sales increase, customer retention remains strong, and employment growth and wage inflation benefit our business\nExcluding COVID-19 impacts, we are encouraged by the performance and income contributions from our other business segments\nOur supplemental and voluntary lines, Colonial Life, International businesses, and Closed Block segment all demonstrated generally stable results and made significant contributions to income this quarter\nWe are also satisfied with our overall investment performance this quarter\nWe saw another quarter of strong returns from alternative investments and higher than usual bond call premiums\nThe underlying credit quality of our portfolio is excellent, and our investment team remains vigilant in analyzing our credits amid changing market conditions\nDespite these strengths, we were significantly impacted by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic\nGiven our broad customer base across the U.S., we have been affected by the resurgence of infections, hospitalizations, and mortality caused by the Delta variant\nThroughout the pandemic, we've found that national mortality and infection rates are the best indicators of COVID-19's impact on our results\nThis quarter, we also need to consider how the demographics of incremental mortality specifically relate to our customer base\nFor context, U.S. COVID-19 mortality in the third quarter increased significantly to about 94,000 lives, nearly double the 52,000 in the second quarter\nThis dramatic increase occurred rapidly and consistently throughout the quarter\nJust 90 days ago, most experts estimated third quarter mortality at around 44,000 deaths, an estimate that more than doubled over the quarter\nThe increase in overall mortality has significantly impacted our industry, particularly our Unum US group life business, though we also saw effects in our voluntary benefits lines\nCDC data shows that working-aged individuals accounted for about 40% of COVID-19 mortality in the third quarter, double the proportion seen in Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 before widespread vaccination\nThis demographic shift affects us in three ways\nFirst, we see higher impacts in the working-age population, our primary customers covered by our group and voluntary products\nAdditionally, these younger working-age individuals tend to have higher benefit amounts than we've seen previously\nLastly, the Delta variant has led to a resurgence of infections and hospitalizations, resulting in more claims in our short-term disability business and pressure on our group disability benefit ratio\nWhile COVID-19 impacts are evident in our quarterly results, we believe that as the pandemic comes under better control through increased vaccinations and improved treatments, we will see strong growth and profitability in our business\nThe COVID-19 recovery has been delayed longer than anticipated due to the Delta variant, but we expect to see a recovery ahead\nGiven this outlook, we're excited to begin deploying a portion of the company's excess capital in ways we believe will create value for our shareholders\nOur capital position remains very strong, with $1.6 billion in holding company cash and a weighted average risk-based capital ratio of about 380% for our traditional U.S.-based life insurance companies\nThis allows us to deploy some capital to enhance shareholder value while maintaining a healthy position for future opportunities\nWe recently announced a $250 million share repurchase authorization approved by our Board, which we plan to initiate in the fourth quarter with a $50 million accelerated share repurchase\nWe expect to continue this program through the end of 2022\nIn addition to share buybacks, we plan to accelerate recognition of the premium deficiency reserve for the Long-Term Care Block by a similar amount over the same period\nWe see value in accelerating this recognition ahead of the original seven-year schedule and could potentially complete it by the end of 2024 under certain market conditions\nEven with these additional capital allocations, we will maintain a strong capital position and flexibility\nWhile we remain optimistic long-term, given the pandemic's volatility, we will postpone our traditional December Analyst Meeting to the first quarter of 2022 to discuss our full-year outlook\nKey areas to focus on include continued premium growth in our core business lines for 2022 and the impact of our capital deployment plans\nWe expect the pandemic's impact to decrease over the next year, but anticipate the fourth quarter of this year to be similarly affected as the third quarter\nWe are monitoring national numbers, and as the Delta wave subsides, we look forward to returning to the growth and profitability we believe we can deliver\nI'll now hand over to Steve to cover the details of the third quarter results\nI will also describe our adjusted operating income results by segment, excluding the impacts from our GAAP reserve assumption updates\nThe most significant component of the actuarial reserve review was the release of $215 million before tax in the Unum US long-term disability line\nClaim reserves should represent our best estimate of future liability, and since the last GAAP reserve review, investments in our operations have improved our claims management, resulting in better claim recoveries over recent years, which we now believe are sustainable\nAs a result, these reserves have been adjusted to better reflect expected claim costs\nThis reserve update will have minimal impact on our future earnings expectations from this line or the expected benefit ratio\nThe reserve review also determined that reserves should be increased in three lines within the Closed Block reporting segment\nFor the Closed Group Pension Block, policy reserves were increased by $25.1 million before tax\nBefore-tax claim reserves for the Closed Disability Block increased by $6.4 million.\nThe Long-Term Care claim reserves saw a pre-tax increase of $2.1 million.\nThese reserve adjustments, while not included in adjusted operating income, added $0.70 per share to the Company's book value.\nCOVID significantly affected the Unum US segment's results this quarter, causing higher mortality rates, increased average claim amounts in group life insurance, and more short-term disability claims in group disability coverage.\nThe Unum US segment's adjusted operating income fell to $88.5 million in the third quarter from $179.3 million in the second quarter.\nExcluding reserve assumption updates, the Unum US group disability line's adjusted operating income decreased to $39.5 million in the third quarter from $59.9 million in the previous quarter.\nThe main reason for the decline was a rise in the benefit ratio to 78.9% in the third quarter from 74.7% in the second quarter, primarily due to increased short-term disability claims related to the COVID Delta variant and current external conditions.\nSequential quarterly premium income slightly decreased, but we were encouraged by a 2.6% year-over-year growth.\nWhile short-term disability results faced challenges this quarter, our long-term disability line met expectations as increased new claim incidence, mostly from STD claims transitioning to LTD status, was offset by continued strong claim recoveries.\nWe anticipate the overall group disability benefit ratio will likely remain elevated as COVID and current external factors continue to impact our STD results.\nWe believe COVID is a key factor in the higher group disability line benefit ratio and expect improvement as direct COVID impacts diminish over the first part of next year.\nUnum US group life and AD&D adjusted operating income declined from $5.2 million in the second quarter to a loss of $67.1 million in the third quarter.\nThis quarter-to-quarter decrease of about $70 million was mainly due to the changing COVID impacts Rick mentioned in his comments.\nWe were affected by the worsening COVID-related mortality, with national deaths rising from 52,000 in the second quarter to approximately 94,000 in the third quarter, along with a shift in age demographics towards greater impacts on younger working-aged individuals.\nEstimated COVID-related excess mortality claims for our Group Life Block increased from about 800 claims in the second quarter to over 1,900 claims in the third quarter.\nConsequently, our results reflect mortality at a level representing approximately 2% of reported national figures, compared to a 1% rate experienced through 2020 when mortality was more pronounced in the elderly population.\nWith a higher percentage of working-age individuals affected, we also saw an increase in average benefit size from around $55,000 in the second quarter to over $60,000 this quarter.\nNon-COVID-related mortality did not significantly impact third-quarter results compared to second-quarter experience.\nFor the fourth quarter, we currently expect U.S. COVID-related mortality to worsen further to approximately 100,000 deaths.\nWith continued higher mortality among working-aged individuals, we believe group life results will remain under pressure, with the expected fourth-quarter loss similar to or potentially worse than the third-quarter experience.\nUnum US supplemental and voluntary lines' adjusted operating income increased slightly from $114.2 million in the second quarter to $116.1 million in the third quarter, both representing very good quarters that generated adjusted operating returns on equity exceeding 17%.\nExamining the three primary business lines:\nWe continue to be very satisfied with the performance of the individual disability recently issued block of business, which has produced strong results throughout the pandemic.\nWe continue to observe very favorable new claim incidence trends and recovery levels in this block.\nThe voluntary benefits line also reported a strong income level, though slightly lower quarter-to-quarter.\nThe increase in the third-quarter benefit ratio to 46.6% from 44.2% in the second quarter was due to increased COVID-related life insurance claims, which offset generally favorable results in other VB product lines.\nUtilization in the dental and vision line improved, leading to a decrease in the benefit ratio to 75% this quarter from 77.1% in the second quarter.\nRegarding premium trends and drivers, total new sales for Unum US increased by 7.7% in the third quarter year-over-year, compared to declines experienced in the first half of the year.\nFor employee benefit lines including LTD, STD, group life, AD&D, and stop-loss, total sales declined by 2.5% this quarter, mainly due to lower sales in the large case market and generally flat sales in the core market (under 2,000 lines).\nSales trends in our supplemental and voluntary lines rebounded strongly in the quarter, increasing 21.8% overall compared to the year-ago quarter.\nWe observed sharp year-over-year increases in the recently issued individual disability line (up 22.9%) and in the dental and vision line (up 48.2%).\nVoluntary benefit sales also recovered following lower year-over-year comparisons in recent quarters, growing 13.7% in the third quarter.\nWe also noticed overall favorable persistency trends for our major product lines in Unum US.\nOur group lines combined showed a slight increase to 89.4% for the first three quarters of 2021 compared to 89.1% last year.\nBoth the voluntary benefits and dental and vision lines also showed year-over-year improvements, while the individual disability line declined slightly.\nThe solid persistency numbers and improving sales trends provide a good tailwind for premium growth as we conclude this year and move into 2022.\nThe Unum International segment had a very good quarter with adjusted operating income increasing to $27.4 million in the third quarter from $24.8 million in the second quarter, continuing the improving trend in income over the past several quarters.\nThe main driver of these results is our Unum UK business, which generated adjusted operating income of £18.4 million in the third quarter compared to £16.8 million in the second quarter.\nThe reported benefit ratio for Unum UK improved to 79.2% in the third quarter from 82.5% in the second quarter.\nThe underlying benefits experience was favorable for our Group Income Protection Block, primarily due to lower new claim incidence, although claim recoveries continue to lag our expectations somewhat.\nThe Group Life Block experienced adverse mortality primarily from non-COVID-related claims incidence and higher average size.\nWe did not see much impact from COVID in our UK Life Block this quarter.\nBenefits experience in Unum Poland was also favorable this quarter, helping generate a slight improvement in adjusted operating income.\nPremium growth for our International businesses was also favorable this quarter compared to a year ago.\nLooking at the growth on a year-over-year basis and in local currency to neutralize the benefit we saw from the higher exchange rate, Unum UK generated growth of 2.9% with strong persistency and the continued successful placement of rate increases on our in-force block.\nAdditionally, sales in Unum UK rebounded in the third quarter, increasing 40.2% over last year.\nUnum Poland also generated growth of 12.5%, continuing the low double-digit premium growth this business has been producing.\nColonial Life's results are in line with our expectations for the third quarter, with adjusted operating income of $80.1 million compared to the record quarterly income of $95.8 million in the second quarter.\nAs with our other U.S.-based life insurance businesses, Colonial's life insurance block was negatively impacted by COVID-related mortality, which was the primary driver in pushing the benefit ratio to 55.9% in the third quarter compared to 51.7% in the second quarter.\nWe estimate that adverse COVID-related claims experience in the life block impacted results by approximately $16 million, the worst impact we have seen from COVID throughout the pandemic and a level that is likely to persist through the fourth quarter.\nExperience in the other lines, including accident, sickness and disability, and cancer and critical illness, remained in line with our expectations and continue to drive strong earnings for this segment.\nMoreover, net investment income saw a 25% sequential rise in Q3, primarily due to unusually high bond call activity during this period.\nWe anticipate that the advantage to net investment income from bond calls will not persist at this level in Q4.\nWe were delighted to observe the improving trend in Colonial Life's premium growth, which remained stable year-over-year this quarter after experiencing declines in the previous three quarters.\nThe improving premium trend is driven by a continued rebound in Colonial Life's sales activity, increasing 28.6% year-over-year this quarter and showing a 21.1% increase for the first three quarters of 2021 compared to last year.\nColonial Life's persistency continues to show a promising trend at 78.9% for the first three quarters of 2021, over a percentage point higher than the previous year.\nIn the Closed Block segment, adjusted operating income, excluding reserve assumption updates and amortization of reinsurance costs related to the recently closed Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction, was $109.8 million in Q3 and $111.2 million in Q2, both strong results driven by favorable overall benefits experience in Long-Term Care and Closed Disability Block, and high investment income due to higher than expected miscellaneous investment income, which will be detailed shortly.\nWithin the Closed Block, the LTC Block continues to yield results that are quite favorable compared to our long-term projections.\nThe interest-adjusted loss ratio in Q3 was 74.8% and averaged 71.8% over the past four quarters, both significantly below our long-term expectation of 85% to 90%.\nIn Q3, we continued to observe higher mortality rates in the claimant block, with accounts approximately 5% higher than anticipated, similar to our Q2 experience.\nLTC submitted claims activity increased in Q3, although much of the increase has not resulted in significant ongoing claim costs.\nLooking towards the end of 2021 and into 2022, we expect the interest-adjusted loss ratio for LTC to trend closer to, but slightly favorable to, our long-term assumption range as mortality and incidence trends normalize from COVID impacts.\nFor the Closed Disability Block, the interest-adjusted loss ratio was 58.2% in Q3 compared to 69.6% in Q2, both very favorable outcomes for this line.\nThe underlying experience on the retained block, which largely reflects the active life reserve cohort and certain other smaller claim blocks we kept, performed very favorably relative to our expectations, primarily due to lower submitted claims again this quarter.\nOverall, the Closed Block segment demonstrated very strong performance again this quarter.\nHigher miscellaneous investment income continues to contribute to the segment's strong adjusted operating income, driven by both higher than average bond call premiums and strong performance in our alternative asset portfolio.\nLooking ahead, we estimate the quarterly adjusted operating income for this segment will range between $45 million to $55 million over time, assuming more normal trends for investment income and claim results in the LTC and Closed Disability lines.\nFirstly, we observed a high level of bond calls again this quarter as many companies refinanced higher coupon debt and capitalized on today's favorable credit market conditions.\nWe recorded approximately $20 million in higher investment income from bond calls this quarter compared to our historical quarterly averages.\nThe Closed Block and Colonial Life segments were the primary beneficiaries of higher investment income this quarter.\nUnum US was in line with historical averages, but lower this quarter than what we received in Q2.\nWhile these calls enhance current period investment income, they fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nSecondly, we continue to see strong performance in our alternative investment portfolio, which earned $38.2 million in Q3, following earnings of $51.9 million recorded in Q2.\nBoth quarters significantly exceeded the expected quarterly income on the portfolio of $12 million to $14 million.\nThe higher returns this quarter were generated from all three of our main sectors: credit, real estate, and private equity, reflecting strong financial markets and robust economic growth.\nIt's challenging to predict quarterly returns for miscellaneous investment income, but for Q4, we believe they will moderate to our expected quarterly returns.\nTurning to capital, the company's financial position remains strong, providing significant financial flexibility.\nThe weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. insurance companies improved to approximately 380%, and holding company cash was $1.6 billion at the end of Q3, both well above our targeted levels.\nAdditionally, leverage has decreased with equity growth and is now 25.7%.\nAs Rick mentioned, we're pleased to clarify our capital deployment plans for the remainder of 2021 and for 2022.\nFor context, given the capital measures I just discussed, we are in a very strong capital position with substantial financial flexibility.\nOur deployment strategy remains unchanged and our priorities are consistent, including: first, funding growth in our core businesses; second, supporting our LTC Block; third, executing opportunistic acquisitions that support our long-term growth; and fourth, returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nWe began implementing our plans last week with the announcement of our Board of Directors' authorization to repurchase up to $250 million of our shares by the end of 2022.\nWe plan to initiate this program with an accelerated share repurchase of $50 million in Q4.\nWe also intend to allocate capital to accelerate the recognition of the premium deficiency reserve for the LTC Block by a similar amount by the end of 2022.\nWe believe this combination strikes a good balance between repurchasing our shares at what we consider very attractive prices, while also fully funding the PDR ahead of the original 2026 target to help reduce the valuation drag on our stock from the LTC exposure.\nWith this additional capital deployment, we continue to project a very solid capital position at the end of 2022, with holding company cash around $1 billion and an RBC ratio well above our target.\nChanging topics, I wanted to provide a brief update on our progress in adopting ASC 944 or Long Duration Targeted Improvements.\nAs a reminder, this accounting pronouncement applies only to GAAP basis financial statements and has no economic, statutory accounting, or cash flow impacts on the business.\nWe remain confident about our readiness to adopt the pronouncement as of January 1, 2023, and will be sharing some qualitative information in our Form 10-Q filing later today.\nAlthough we continue to evaluate the effects of complying with this update, we expect that the most significant impact at the transition date will be the requirement to update our liability discount rate with one that is generally equivalent to a single A interest rate.\nWe anticipate this will result in a substantial decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income, primarily driven by the difference between the expected interest rates from our investment strategy and interest rates indicative of a single A rated portfolio.\nAs we continue to progress our work, we plan to provide updates to you in 2022 as we approach adoption.\nLet me conclude with an update on our expectations for the remainder of 2021.\nWith COVID-related mortality expected to increase further in Q4 to approximately 100,000 nationwide deaths, we anticipate seeing similar, if not slightly worse, trends for mortality impacts on our life insurance businesses in Q4 compared to Q3.\nThe Unum US group disability benefit ratio is also likely to remain elevated due to continued high levels of STD claims.\nAdditionally, we do not expect miscellaneous investment income to be as strong in Q4 as it was this quarter.\nThese factors will likely put pressure on our Q4 results relative to what we experienced in Q3.\nAs Rick mentioned, we plan to update you on our 2022 outlook during Q1 2022 when we expect to have a more informed view of COVID mortality and infection trends.\nWe are confident that premium growth in our core business segments in 2022 can build upon the momentum that began to reemerge this year, and we will also see the benefits of executing our share buyback authorization.\nHowever, future COVID trends will be a crucial factor in our expected benefits experience.\nWe continue to be pleased with the company's operational performance through this extraordinary environment.\nWe believe we are well-positioned to benefit from today's strong business conditions, but we must remain vigilant as COVID-related mortality and infection rates persist.\nSummary: ",

latest Corporate Sustainability Report, showcasing our efforts in this area.\nThis report details our sustainability initiatives, the considerable progress we've made, and our commitments to building a better future.\nLet's now review our third-quarter results.\nThird-quarter sales reached a record $1.44 billion, representing a 28% increase compared to the same period in 2020 and exceeding our expectations.\nOrganic sales grew by 17%, acquisitions contributed 11 percentage points, and foreign currency had a slight positive impact during the quarter.\nOverall orders in the third quarter totaled $1.55 billion, marking a 37% increase over the previous year.\nOrganic orders showed an impressive 30% growth in the quarter.\nWe concluded the quarter with a record backlog of $2.62 billion, an increase of over $800 million since the beginning of the year.\nThird quarter operating income hit a record $338 million, a 25% increase compared to the third quarter of 2020, with operating margins at 23.4%.\nExcluding the dilutive effect of acquisitions, core operating margins were 24.7%, an improvement of 70 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2020.\nEBITDA for the third quarter reached a record $415 million, up 25% from the previous year, with EBITDA margins of 28.8%.\nThis exceptional performance resulted in record earnings of $1.26 per diluted share.\nThis represents a 25% increase over the third quarter of 2020 and surpasses our guidance range of $1.16 to $1.18.\nWe continue to generate robust cash flow, with third-quarter operating cash flow of $307 million and free cash flow conversion at 109% of net income.\nOverall, these are outstanding results in a challenging operational environment.\nNow, I'll provide more detailed information at the operating group level.\nStarting with the Electronic Instruments Group.\nAIG sales reached a record $982 million, a 31% increase compared to last year's third quarter.\nOrganic sales grew by 15%, acquisitions added 16%, and foreign currency had a slight negative impact.\nWhile growth was widespread, it was particularly strong in our Ultra Precision Technologies and Power and Industrial businesses.\nAIG's third-quarter operating income hit a record $245 million, up 20% compared to the same quarter last year, with operating margins at 25%.\nAIG's core margins, excluding acquisitions, were excellent at 27.2%, matching the previous year's performance.\nThe Electromechanical Group demonstrated remarkable sales growth and exceptional operational efficiency.\nSales in the third quarter rose by 21% compared to the same period last year, reaching $459 million.\nInternal sales grew by 20%, with currency exchange rates contributing an additional percentage point to overall growth.\nAll sectors of the MG continued to show strong performance, with our automation divisions particularly excelling during the quarter.\nEMG's quarterly operating income hit a new high of $115 million, showing a significant 36% increase from the previous year.\nEMG's operating margins improved dramatically, expanding by 270 basis points to reach a record 25%.\nLet's now discuss our acquisition strategy.\nAMETEK has had a remarkable year, deploying a record amount of capital to acquire five strategically important companies.\nSo far this year, AMETEK has invested approximately $1.85 billion in acquisitions, demonstrating the effectiveness of its acquisition strategy and its ability to identify and purchase highly strategic businesses.\nOur proven operational expertise enables us to implement significant improvements across our acquired companies, resulting in exceptional returns on invested capital.\nAchieving strong returns on deployed capital is crucial for long-term sustainable growth and is a key component of AMETEK's strategy.\nAMETEK's robust cash flow generation continues to support its capital deployment strategy, with a very active acquisition pipeline and the M&A team working diligently to identify attractive opportunities, expecting to remain busy in the coming quarters.\nWe also maintain our focus on reinvesting in our businesses to support their organic growth initiatives, including their new product development efforts.\nIn the third quarter, we allocated over $75 million to RD&E.\nFor the entire year of 2021, we now anticipate investing approximately $300 million, or about 5.5% of sales.\nThese investments enable our businesses to develop unique and highly differentiated solutions that address our customers' most complex challenges.\nA prime example is a new product introduction from AMETEK Gatan.\nGatan is a leading provider of direct detection technology for electron microscopy, supporting advanced research in materials and life sciences applications.\nGatan recently launched The Stela hybrid pixel camera, the only fully integrated hybrid pixel electron detector with the Gatan microscopy suite.\nThis new product reinforces Gatan's leadership position by offering the highest quality TEM diffraction camera, allowing users to perform 4D stem analysis with rapid speed and high dynamic range.\nGatan's new camera builds upon a long history of disruptive and award-winning technology.\nIn August, The Stela camera received the 2021 R&D 100 Innovation Award and was recognized as one of the ten game-changing products and methods.\nI'd like to congratulate the Gatan team for the recent launch of The Stela camera and their continued support of important research applications.\nNow, let's address the supply chain issues.\nThe global supply chain remains challenging, with extended lead times for a wide range of materials and components, as well as logistics issues and labor shortages adding to the complexity.\nDespite these difficulties, we surpassed our sales estimates for the quarter and are effectively navigating the challenging environment thanks to our agile operating approach.\nThe supply chain issues are contributing to higher inflation.\nHowever, due to our differentiation, we're able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing, resulting in a strong price-inflation spread.\nWhile we expect these challenges to persist into 2022, we remain well-positioned to address these issues, given the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK growth model.\nLet's move on to our updated outlook for the remainder of 2021.\nBased on our exceptional third-quarter results, ongoing strong order momentum, and record backlog, we have once again increased our 2021 sales and earnings projections.\nWe now anticipate overall sales for the year to increase in the low 20% range, compared to our previous estimate of approximately 20% growth.\nWe now project organic sales to grow by low double-digit percentages over 2020, up from our earlier forecast of about 10%.\nWe now expect diluted earnings per share for 2021 to range between $4.76 and $4.78, representing an increase of roughly 21% over 2020 on a comparable basis, surpassing our previous guidance of $4.62 to $4.86 per diluted share.\nWe expect overall sales in the fourth quarter to increase by approximately 20% compared to the same period last year.\nWe anticipate fourth-quarter earnings per diluted share to be between $1.28 and $1.30, representing a 19% to 20% increase over the previous year's fourth quarter.\nAMETEK delivered outstanding results in the third quarter.\nOur teams continue to perform well, and our businesses are thriving.\nOur ability to perform well in challenging conditions demonstrates the resilience and strength of AMETEK's growth strategy.\nOur asset-light business model, leading positions in attractive niche markets, and exceptional workforce will continue to drive long-term, sustainable success.\nThe effectiveness of AMETEK's growth model continues to yield long-term benefits for all of the company's stakeholders.\nAs mentioned earlier, AMETEK achieved excellent results in the third quarter, with continued robust sales and order growth, along with exceptional operational performance.\nI will now provide some additional financial details for the quarter.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the third quarter were $22.1 million, an increase of $4.8 million from the previous year, primarily due to higher compensation costs.\nG&A expenses as a percentage of total sales remained steady at 1.5% for the quarter, unchanged from the previous year.\nFor 2021, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase by approximately $18 million, primarily due to higher compensation costs, but remain at about 1.5% of sales, consistent with the previous year.\nOther income and expense in the third quarter improved by about $4 million compared to the same quarter last year, driven by a $6 million (or approximately $0.02 per share) gain from the sale of a small product line during the quarter.\nThis gain was more than offset by a higher effective tax rate of 19.5% in the quarter, up from 17.5% in the same period last year.\nFor 2021, we now anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19.5% and 20%, though actual quarterly tax rates can vary significantly, either positively or negatively, from this full-year estimate.\nWorking capital in the quarter was 14.9% of sales, a decrease of 210 basis points from the 17% reported in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting our businesses' excellent management of working capital.\nCapital expenditures in the third quarter were $26 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to total approximately $120 million for the full year.\nDepreciation and amortization expense in the third quarter was $75 million, and for the entire year of 2021, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $295 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of about $138 million or $0.60 per diluted share.\nWe continue to generate strong cash flows due to our asset-light business model and effective working capital management.\nIn the third quarter, operating cash flow was $307 million, and free cash flow was $281 million, with free cash flow conversion at 109% of net income.\nTotal debt at the end of the quarter was $2.65 billion, an increase of less than $250 million from the end of 2020, despite having spent approximately $1.85 billion on acquisitions so far in 2021.\nOffsetting this debt with cash and cash equivalents of $359 million, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.6 times, and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.4 times at the end of the quarter.\nWe maintain excellent financial capacity and flexibility with approximately $2.25 billion in cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.\nIn conclusion, our businesses delivered outstanding results in the third quarter and throughout the first nine months of 2021.\nOur strong balance sheet and exceptional cash flow generation have positioned the company for significant growth in the coming quarters and years.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Our combined profits for Q1 2021 were $0.98 per diluted share, an increase from $0.72 in Q1 2020.\nI will now hand over to Dennis for further discussion.\nWe understand that returning to offices or establishing a new routine may still take some time.\nIn the interim, we will continue offering support and understanding to those facing financial difficulties through energy aid programs, payment plans, and even COVID-19 financial assistance grants.\nI'm incredibly impressed by our staff who, despite these challenging circumstances, have shown great adaptability and continue to advance our company on all fronts.\nThe financial results we're presenting today showcase their commitment and resolve to accomplish our objectives.\nWe have recently initiated measures to progress towards an environmentally friendly energy future.\nA short while ago, we declared our ambitious target to decrease our carbon emissions from natural gas by aiming to become carbon-neutral by 2045, with an intermediate goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030.\nOur plan to achieve reduced emissions involves investing in innovative technologies such as renewable natural gas (RNG), hydrogen, or other sustainable biofuels.\nWe are assessing the best methods to incorporate RNG into our gas supply and investigating hydrogen as an alternative renewable fuel source.\nAdditionally, we will concentrate on decreasing consumption through conservation efforts and energy efficiency measures, as well as upgrading our infrastructure.\nWe acknowledge that this is a significant challenge.\nSeveral crucial elements need to align in the coming years for success.\nThe cost of technology must decrease, new innovations must emerge, and regulatory backing will be essential for us to reach these objectives.\nAs we develop our strategies, maintaining affordable costs will be a key consideration.\nWe are dedicated to pursuing this goal in ways that ensure affordability and reliability for our customers.\nOur natural gas objective demonstrates that our vision of a clean energy future encompasses both electricity and natural gas resources.\nWe are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the energy we provide to our customers.\nWe are also making progress towards our clean electricity goal of providing carbon-neutral electricity by the end of 2027 and carbon-free electricity by 2045.\nRecently, we entered into an agreement with the Chelan County Public Utility District to increase the amount of renewable hydropower in our electricity generation portfolio.\nThis contract aligns with the strategies outlined in our recently filed 2021 Electric Integrated Resource Plan and supports the objectives of Washington State's Clean Energy Transformation Act (CETA).\nWe've had a promising start to 2021 regarding our quarterly results, and we're on track to achieve our full-year earnings goals.\nAvista Utilities' earnings surpassed expectations, AEL&P's earnings were in line with projections for the first quarter, and our other ventures performed better than anticipated.\nThe recently enacted legislation will facilitate the shift in electric and natural gas company regulation towards multi-year rate plans and initiate the process of performance-based rate-making.\nThis significant legislation's passage offers advantages such as mandating multi-year rate plans spanning two to four years, with the rate plan's foundation established using methods the commission may employ to reduce regulatory lag.\nWhile current and future commissioners will need to implement these changes, we believe this is a crucial initial step in advancing the regulatory model in Washington State.\nNow, let me provide an update on our regulatory submissions from January.\nWe submitted two-year general rate cases in Idaho, one for electricity and another for gas.\nIn 2020, we filed general rate cases in Washington, again one each for electricity and gas.\nWe are continuing to navigate the regulatory process in these jurisdictions.\nWe plan to file a rate case in Oregon during the latter half of 2021.\nWe achieved a notable milestone in our electric transportation efforts when the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission approved three tariffs allowing us to proceed with various programs outlined in our transportation-electrification plan.\nThe UTC's approval enables us to establish optional general service and large commercial electric vehicle rates, which will help facilitate and accelerate fleet electrification for commercial clients like the Spokane Transit Authority.\nOur transportation electrification plan and newly approved tariffs will serve as a valuable model for others to follow.\nThis exemplifies our industry's role in electric transportation and our clean energy future.\nAvista continues to be at the forefront of these developments.\nMoving forward, we remain committed to operating an excellent utility and continuing to invest wisely in maintaining and upgrading our infrastructure to provide reliable energy services to our customers.\nWe are reaffirming our earnings guidance for 2021 through 2023.\nUnfortunately, my Blackhawks were eliminated from the playoffs last night.\nWe have five games remaining in the season, but we no longer have a chance for postseason play this year.\nIt's a disappointing day for me, but on a positive note, we had an excellent first quarter, with Avista Utilities contributing $0.92 per diluted share compared to $0.68 last year.\nRelative to the previous year, our earnings improved due to increased utility margins.\nWe experienced growth in our customer base and implemented general rate hikes.\nThe initial quarter of this year included an accrual, while the same period last year had negative accruals related to the Washington remand case from 2015, Colstrip disallowances, and an accrual for the Colstrip community fund.\nThese factors negatively impacted earnings in 2020.\nThe ERM in Washington provided a pre-tax benefit of $4.3 million in Q1 this year, compared to $5.2 million in Q1 2020.\nWe remain dedicated to investing necessary capital in our utility infrastructure, with Avista Utilities' capital expenditures expected to reach approximately $415 million in 2021.\nRegarding liquidity, we repaid the outstanding balance of our one-year credit agreement on April 5, 2021, which we had entered into in April 2020 to ensure sufficient liquidity at the pandemic's onset.\nAs of April 30, we had $182 million available under our $400 million credit line, which we plan to extend into a multi-year agreement in Q2.\nWe anticipate issuing about $120 million in long-term debt and $75 million in equity in 2021.\nWe are reaffirming our earnings guidance for 2021, 2022, and 2023 with consolidated ranges of $1.96 to $2.16, $2.18 to $2.38, and $2.42 to $2.62 per diluted share, respectively.\nThis projection puts us on track to achieve our allowed return by 2023.\nOur guidance assumes timely and appropriate rate relief across all jurisdictions.\nThe 2021 earnings guidance accounts for unrecovered structural costs, estimated to reduce our return on equity by about 70 basis points.\nAdditionally, our 2021 guidance factors in a regulatory timing lag, estimated to decrease our equity return by approximately 100 basis points.\nThis results in an expected return on equity of about 7.7% for Avista Utilities in 2021.\nWe project annual customer growth of roughly 1% for Avista Utilities.\nFor 2021, Avista Utilities is anticipated to contribute between $1.93 and $2.07 per diluted share at the midpoint of our guidance range, excluding any expense or benefit under the Energy Recovery Mechanism.\nWe currently expect to be in the 75% customer, 25% Company sharing band, which is projected to add about $0.06 per diluted share.\nIn 2021, we expect AEL&P to contribute between $0.08 and $0.11 per diluted share, with our outlook for both Avista Utilities and AEL&P assuming normal precipitation and slightly below normal (about 92%) hydroelectric generation for Avista Utilities.\nFor 2021, we anticipate our other businesses to range between a loss of $0.05 to $0.02 per diluted share.\nOur guidance generally assumes normal operating conditions and excludes unusual or non-recurring items until their effects are known and measurable.\nSummary: ",

CFO, Matt Garth.\nI'd like to draw attention to the Safe Harbor disclaimer displayed.\nForward-looking statements made by team members are subject to these restrictions, warnings, and stipulations.\nWe thank you for joining us today and hope you're all keeping well.\nAllow me to provide a brief outline of the call's agenda.\nI'll start by reviewing our third quarter highlights, including improving sales trends, enhanced operational and financial standing, and advancements in business development.\nI want to address the 8-K we filed this week regarding a recent ransomware attack that affected access to some of our company's IT systems.\nWe have established protocols for such incidents.\nUpon detecting the issue, we immediately implemented our comprehensive cybersecurity response plan, including steps to isolate and carefully restore our network to resume normal operations as quickly as possible.\nWe've informed law enforcement and are collaborating with leading cybersecurity experts to conduct a thorough investigation.\nThroughout this incident, we maintained safe facility operations and met our customer obligations.\nBefore delving into the third quarter review, I'd like to express my satisfaction with our global team and businesses' performance in this ongoing complex and challenging environment.\nWe continue to prioritize employee safety, efficient plant operations, and delivering value-added products to our customers.\nOur employees' dedication, engagement, and resilience have been exceptional during these times.\nLet me walk you through our third quarter performance.\nAs anticipated in July, demand conditions in our end markets improved following the second quarter's acute COVID-19 impacts, largely playing out as expected with our readiness to respond to volume recovery leading to sequential sales growth across nearly all product lines.\nOverall, we had a strong quarter operationally and commercially.\nThese results reflect our team's disciplined execution in cost control, pricing, and productivity, resulting in higher sequential and year-over-year operating margins.\nWe also demonstrated how our robust product portfolio and end market mix enabled us to capture opportunities with existing and new customers.\nFinancially, total quarterly sales were $388 million, a 9% sequential increase but still lower than last year.\nAs indicated in our previous call, July sales were trending upward and demand conditions in several markets continued to strengthen throughout the quarter.\nWe generated $52 million in operating income with earnings per share of $0.92.\nAdditionally, we delivered $54 million in cash from operations, maintaining our solid cash generation profile.\nAfter experiencing volatile conditions in our industrial-related end markets through the second quarter, we saw significant demand improvements in the third quarter, along with continued strength in our consumer-oriented product lines.\nLet me highlight some key points.\nOur Metalcasting business continued to rebound as North American foundry customers increased production to meet rising automotive sector demand.\nBy the end of the third quarter, our Metalcasting facilities were operating at about 95% of last year's levels, a notable improvement from earlier reduced levels.\nFurthermore, our pre-blended products' penetration maintains a strong growth trajectory in China, with sales increasing 20% over last year, a momentum expected to continue.\nSales in our consumer products portfolio, including Pet Care, Personal Care, and Edible Oil Purification, remained resilient, led by 11% year-over-year growth in Pet Care.\nWe continue to strengthen our robust private label Pet Care portfolio in North America and Europe, expanding our presence through partnerships with several new customers.\nOur global PCC business benefited from satellite restarts in India and North America, combined with an improved demand environment from the second quarter's low levels.\nAs indicated previously, July volumes were trending approximately 15% higher compared to June, and these dynamics continued through the third quarter.\nNotably, Paper PCC sales in China continue to deliver solid performance with 18% growth over last year.\nAdditionally, Specialty PCC sales increased sequentially as automotive and construction demand strengthened, while food and pharmaceutical applications remained strong.\nOther areas of strength included our Talc and GCC business, with improved demand for products used in residential and commercial construction, as well as automotive applications.\nIn our Refractories business, we saw U.S. steel utilization rates increase from a second-quarter low of 50% to 65% by the end of September.\nWhile many businesses returned to a positive trajectory, we faced challenges in project-oriented businesses like Environmental Products, Building Materials, and Energy Services, which still experience volatile order patterns and timing delays.\nEnergy Services was further impacted by several Gulf of Mexico hurricanes during the quarter.\nAs volumes trended upward through the quarter, we leveraged these sales into income, resulting in overall operating and EBITDA margin improvement both sequentially and year-over-year.\nWe've maintained our focus on operational efficiency, including variable cost adjustments and structural overhead savings, as well as continued pricing increases, capturing favorable raw material costs, and increasing sales of higher-value products.\nAs markets continue to recover, we are well-positioned to further expand margins on increased volumes.\nStrengthening our financial position remains a priority, emphasizing tight control of our cash generation cycle and creating more flexibility in our capital structure.\nWe delivered another quarter of strong cash flow generation, primarily used to pay down debt.\nWhile navigating the current environment, we've remained focused on advancing our growth initiatives, making further progress this quarter on several fronts.\nLet me provide more detailed highlights of these advancements.\nThe commissioning of two new PCC satellites scheduled for the fourth quarter continues to progress, with production ramping up at our 45,000-ton facility in India, and our 150,000-ton satellite in China expected to be operational by December.\nWe will also resume production in November at our previously closed satellite in Wickliffe, Kentucky, to support Phoenix Paper's mill restart.\nDuring the quarter, we made a small acquisition of a hauling and mining company to further strengthen our vertically integrated position at our Wyoming bentonite mines.\nThis transaction improves our cost position and enhances our mining and transportation flexibility in the region.\nIn our Refractories business, we signed two new five-year contracts to supply refractory and metallurgical wire products in the U.S., totaling approximately $50 million or about $10 million of incremental annual revenue.\nOur new product development efforts are progressing well as we aim to accelerate commercialization and drive new revenue opportunities.\nWe've commercialized 36 value-added products so far in 2020, with contributions from each business.\nTwelve of these products were introduced in the third quarter.\nWe've maintained a similar pace to last year while conducting many product development activities virtually.\nOverall, there are numerous positives about our quarterly performance, especially our execution as a company while navigating difficult conditions.\nChallenges remain ahead.\nWith strong momentum across many businesses and an enhanced cost profile, we expect to continue delivering improved profitability as volumes recover.\nI will now examine our results for the third quarter, the performance of our four divisions, and our cash flow and liquidity positions.\nLet's begin our analysis of the third quarter results.\nSales for the third quarter reached $388.3 million, representing a 9% increase from the previous quarter but a 14% decrease compared to last year.\nOur gross margin, EBITDA margin, and operating margin all showed improvement both sequentially and year-over-year, driven by our ongoing pricing strategies and productivity enhancements.\nSG&A expenses remained unchanged from the second quarter, also contributing to the expansion in margins.\nExcluding special items, earnings per share were $0.92, and we incurred special charges of $3.2 million after-tax in the third quarter, equivalent to $0.09 per share.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.8%, compared to 19.1% in the previous year and 16% in the preceding quarter.\nLooking ahead, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be around 20%.\nLet's now examine the changes in sales and operating income in greater detail.\nThis slide presents year-over-year comparisons of sales and operating income on the left, and sequential quarter comparisons on the right.\nThird quarter sales decreased by 13% compared to the previous year on a constant currency basis.\nThe economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic continued to affect our volumes year-over-year during the quarter.\nThe operating income bridge on the bottom left demonstrates our ability to significantly offset the impact of lower sales compared to the previous year through favorable pricing and cost performance driven by actions we've taken over the past year.\nThese measures resulted in a higher operating margin compared to the previous year despite lower volume.\nSequentially, we observed a significant improvement in demand, with sales increasing by 7% when adjusted for currency and 9% overall.\nConditions improved across most of our end markets, and we maintained pricing levels throughout the company.\nDuring our last call, we mentioned that July sales rates were trending approximately 5% higher than June, and this trend accelerated throughout the third quarter.\nDaily sales rates in August were 6% higher than July, and September was 7% higher than August.\nOperating income increased by 18% sequentially on a constant currency basis, primarily due to improvements in our end markets and continued cost control.\nThe operating margin for the quarter was 13.3%, compared to 13.2% in the previous year and 11.8% in the second quarter.\nLet's take a closer look at the operating margins and their improvement on the next slide.\nThis slide shows year-over-year and sequential operating margin bridges for the third quarter.\nComparing to the previous year, our pricing and cost actions contributed 190 basis points of improvement, more than offsetting the unfavorable volume impact.\nSequentially, we leveraged additional volume into 60 basis points of margin improvement, and our continued cost control contributed another 70 basis points of favorability.\nOur actions regarding pricing, productivity, cost control, and new product development have positioned us well to leverage incremental volumes into improved margins going forward.\nAnother notable margin highlight for the third quarter was the 70 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin compared to both the previous year and the previous quarter.\nLet's now move on to the segment review, starting with Performance Materials.\nPerformance Materials sales increased by 10% sequentially but were 8% lower than the previous year.\nMetalcasting sales grew 26% sequentially as foundry production improved in North America and demand remained strong in China.\nThe improvement in North America was primarily driven by the ramp-up of automotive production.\nChina Metalcasting sales grew 11% sequentially and 20% compared to the previous year due to continued strong demand from our customers and increased penetration of our specially formulated blended products.\nHousehold, Personal Care, and Specialty Product sales remained resilient, increasing 7% sequentially and remaining flat compared to the previous year due to continued strong demand for consumer-oriented products.\nEnvironmental Products and Building Materials continued to experience COVID-19-related project delays, with sales remaining below previous year levels.\nThe segment's operating income was $28.2 million, up 34% sequentially and 5% compared to the previous year.\nOperating margin was 14.8% of sales, an increase of 270 basis points from the second quarter and 180 basis points from the previous year.\nContinued pricing actions, strong cost control, and expense reductions more than offset the operating income impact of lower sales compared to the previous year.\nThe chart on the bottom right shows daily sales rates by month this year compared to the previous year.\nThis segment experienced a clear rebound in demand, with sales increasing steadily throughout the third quarter.\nWe would typically expect a seasonal decrease in sales for this segment between the third and fourth quarters, driven by our construction and environmental end markets.\nHowever, this year, we expect to offset the typical seasonality with continued positive momentum in our other markets.\nOverall, we anticipate fourth quarter sales to be similar to the third quarter, despite the usual seasonal effects.\nIt's worth noting that we experience higher mining and energy costs while operating in colder months, which will temporarily impact segment margins in the fourth quarter.\nNow let's move on to Specialty Minerals.\nSpecialty Minerals sales totaled $125.1 million in the third quarter, up 14% sequentially but 13% below the previous year.\nPCC sales increased 14% sequentially as paper mill capacity came back online in the U.S. and India following temporary COVID-19-related shutdowns.\nPaper PCC sales in China grew 11% sequentially and 18% compared to the previous year due to continued penetration and strong customer demand.\nSpecialty PCC sales increased 16% sequentially as automotive and construction demand improved throughout the quarter, while consumer-oriented products remained strong.\nProcessed Minerals sales increased 13% as end markets steadily improved throughout the quarter.\nOperating income, excluding special items, was $18 million, up 18% sequentially but 17% below the previous year, representing 14.4% of sales, compared to 13.9% in the second quarter and 15.2% in the previous year.\nThe impact of lower volume compared to the previous year was partially offset by continued pricing actions and cost control.\nDaily sales rates for this segment also show improving conditions throughout the third quarter, and we expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter as paper production in the U.S., Europe, and India continues to ramp up.\nAdditionally, we are bringing new capacity online in the coming months, with most of this capacity becoming operational late in the fourth quarter.\nThe sequential improvement in Paper PCC will offset the typical seasonality we experience in the residential construction markets served by the other product lines.\nOverall, for the segment, we expect fourth quarter sales to be similar to the third quarter.\nNow let's turn to Refractories.\nRefractories segment sales were $59.3 million in the third quarter, up 6% sequentially as steel mill utilization rates gradually improved from second quarter levels in both North America and Europe.\nSegment operating income was $7.3 million, up 24% from the previous quarter, representing 12.3% of sales.\nDaily sales rates showed improvement throughout the third quarter.\nWe anticipate further progress in Q4 as steel usage increases and laser equipment purchases rise.\nFor the segment overall, we predict a slight sequential uptick in Q4 sales compared to Q3.\nLet's now discuss Energy Services.\nThe Energy Services division faced major project postponements in Q3.\nThese delays stemmed from COVID-19 restrictions and several weather-related shutdowns in the Gulf of Mexico during an active hurricane season.\nConsequently, Q3 sales were $13.3 million with breakeven operating income.\nThe daily sales rates graph indicates a strong year start, followed by sales levels remaining low compared to the previous year.\nWe see a robust pipeline of activity and expect this business to improve sequentially in Q4.\nNow, let's examine our cash flow and liquidity highlights.\nAs Doug mentioned, Q3 cash from operations was $54 million and free cash flow reached $40 million.\nWe maintained a balanced approach to cash deployment, reducing debt by $30 million and resuming share buybacks, acquiring $3 million of shares in Q3.\nWe continued repurchasing shares in October, completing the expiring program with $50 million of shares under the $75 million authorization.\nAs stated earlier, the Board has approved a new one-year $75 million repurchase program.\nOur net leverage ratio stands at 2.1 times EBITDA with $682 million in liquidity, including over $375 million cash on hand.\nBefore handing back to Doug for the market outlook, I'll summarize our Q4 expectations for each segment.\nIn our Minerals businesses, we anticipate ongoing improvement in many markets to offset typical seasonality, with sales expected to match Q3 levels.\nMargins will remain strong year-over-year, though sequentially they'll be affected by seasonally higher mining and energy costs.\nIn our Services business, we expect gradual improvement in Refractories as utilization rates increase and sequential improvement in Energy Services as delayed projects resume and activity picks up.\nOverall, we anticipate MTI's Q4 sales to be comparable to Q3.\nBefore starting the Q&A session, I'd like to provide more insight into conditions across our businesses and growth opportunities we see.\nThe improving market trends seen in most of our businesses will likely continue through year-end, while project-oriented businesses may face ongoing challenges with unpredictable customer order patterns.\nAdditionally, as we build on Q3 momentum, we're executing various attractive growth projects that will contribute to 2021 revenue.\nLet me walk you through each business segment, beginning with Performance Materials, our largest and most diverse segment.\nOur Household and Personal Care product line will maintain its strong sales trajectory as demand remains high and we leverage expanded channels and new customer relationships.\nSpecifically, we're growing our premium Pet Care products portfolio in North America and Europe by expanding online retail channels with larger customers and introducing new products like our 100% carbon-neutral Eco Care product in Europe, satisfying customer preferences while contributing to sustainability efforts.\nAdditionally, sales of our Edible Oil Purification products have more than doubled since last year as we expand this business through a broader global customer base.\nIn Metalcasting, we expect to continue benefiting from the automotive demand rebound in North America.\nAs mentioned earlier, we expanded our customer base in China through increased penetration of higher-value blended products, leading to 20% sales growth over last year.\nThis solid growth trend will continue through year-end and into 2021.\nI'll discuss Environmental Products and Building Materials together as they face similar dynamics.\nWhile both maintain robust, active pipelines and continue introducing specialized products, these businesses have been impacted by timing delays in customers starting larger remediation and waterproofing projects.\nMoving to the Specialty Minerals segment, starting with Paper PCC.\nAs paper demand in North America and Europe gradually improves, we expect sequential volume growth across all regions in Q4.\nAsia, particularly China, will maintain its solid growth trajectory.\nWe'll also benefit from our satellite ramp-up in India, and our new Chinese satellite should be operational in December.\nLooking ahead, we have two new facilities coming online in the first half of 2021: one for packaging in Europe and another for standard PCC in India.\nOverall, we're bringing 285,000 tons of new PCC capacity online over the next three quarters.\nWe also maintain a very active business development pipeline across our PCC technologies portfolio, including high filler, packaging, and recycling.\nEach of these could increase our overall volume next year.\nIn Specialty PCC, GCC, and Talc, sales for pharmaceutical and consumer products, including food applications, will remain strong.\nDemand for high-performance sealant and plastic products used in automotive applications should strengthen as build rates continue improving in North America and Europe.\nSales for products used in residential and commercial construction applications should remain steady.\nFor Refractories, current steel utilization rates in North America and Europe are around 70% and 65% respectively, expected to gradually improve in coming quarters.\nOur laser measurement equipment order book remains strong for Q4.\nAs mentioned earlier, we've recently signed two five-year contracts totaling $50 million to supply refractory and metallurgical wire products, contributing to revenue growth in 2021.\nLastly, in Energy Services, we maintain an active offshore services pipeline.\nWhile COVID-19 and adverse weather have led to early demobilizations or postponements of larger offshore projects, some have been rescheduled for Q4.\nWe've also recently won new large projects in the Gulf of Mexico, expected to start over the next few quarters.\nWe're focused on navigating a highly dynamic environment, and our continuous improvement culture positions us well.\nOver the past six months, we've successfully implemented virtual tools to enhance productivity, efficiency, and connectivity with employees and customers.\nI'm impressed with how quickly we've adapted to the changing environment.\nThese tools have enabled smooth business operations, allowing seamless connections with operating facilities for meetings and site visits, conducting problem-solving Kaizen events, and efficiently collaborating and communicating with our global customer base.\nMany of these new daily operational methods will become permanent, balanced with in-person activities.\nLooking ahead to 2021, I'm confident in our direction, our solid foundation to leverage improved market conditions, and our growth projects.\nWhile COVID-related uncertainties persist, our end markets continue showing signs of improvement.\nOur operational actions position us well to drive improved profitability.\nAdditionally, our strong, flexible balance sheet provides solid resources to support both organic and inorganic growth opportunities.\nLet's now open the call for questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:As I examine the previous quarter and provide insights into our current quarter's operations, I want to emphasize that we will be making comparisons to both 2020 and 2019\nDue to the periods of quarantine and stimulus that affected the business in waves last year, we are using 2019 as a benchmark to illustrate underlying business trends\nI am satisfied with our second quarter results as we continue to show strong growth compared to 2019, validating our Operation North Star strategies, showing progress in our core product range, and highlighting the relationships we are building with existing and new customers, both online and in-store\nDuring the quarter, we observed strong double-digit, two-year comparative growth in Furniture, Soft Home, Hard Home, and Apparel, Electronics & Other\nConsumables also showed a positive two-year comparison, while Food decreased by mid-single digits, reduced on a square footage basis by our pantry reorganization last autumn\nConsequently, while down 13% compared to last year, comparable sales for the second quarter increased 14% compared to 2019\nFurthermore, we achieved diluted earnings per share of $1.09 within our projected range, despite ongoing supply chain and distribution challenges that were more significant than anticipated at the start of the quarter and cost us at least 1 point of comparative growth\nWhile the Big Lots team is always occupied, we were exceptionally busy over the past quarter engaging with customers, expanding our store count, enhancing our omnichannel offerings, streamlining our e-commerce channel, introducing a new warranty offering through Allstate, expanding additional Lot and Queue Line stores, preparing to launch two new forward distribution centers and Project Refresh at the beginning of the third quarter, further expanding our BIGionaire's brand activation campaign, and navigating a challenging supply chain market\nWhile addressing these initiatives and macro forces, our teams remained steadfastly focused on our customers' needs, continuing our mission to help them live big and save lots\nWe are currently dealing with and navigating the dynamic and ever-changing complexities of the supply chain\nHowever, we are simultaneously investing in our future and our promising long-term growth opportunities\nI speak on behalf of all Big Lots leadership when I express our gratitude to the over 30,000 Big Lots team members\nWe remain very enthusiastic about the vast growth opportunities ahead of us, and recognize that investing in our customers, our people, and our infrastructure will be crucial to realizing that growth potential\nFreight challenges impacted gross margin for the quarter, and additionally, our performance was affected by labor issues in two of our regional distribution centers\nThis situation is improving as we enter Q3, and pressure on our network will be further alleviated by the opening of our first two forward distribution centers\nTo address immediate supply chain pressures and maintain speed to market, we have established a flexible and adaptable temporary DC bypass program for the fourth quarter that will enhance the efficiency of our DCs and increase our network capacity\nMeanwhile, we remain enthusiastic about our merchandising opportunities, and we are focused on offering customer-centric deals every day\nWe continue to expand our ability to source closeout products in most areas of the store\nWe are working diligently to find great deals and big buys for our customers, whether we source them from closeouts, engineered closeouts, or just exceptional value products we find in the market\nWe anticipate the potential for closeout opportunities to grow in 2022\nAs we focus on item merchandising and key value messaging, our customers are responding positively\nFor instance, our increased investment in apparel is leading to the acquisition of customers who are exploring more of the Big Lots product range\nAdditionally, this is an excellent example of increasing merchandised productivity within the store, driving incremental sales with a strong initial markup and expanding our brand recognition with quality products\nRegarding our category performance, Food and Consumables both declined compared to Q2 2020 as we lap last year's COVID impact\nConsumables were positive on a two-year basis and both categories exceeded our expectations at the beginning of the quarter\nIn Food, we have continued to observe a shift away from grocery and baking categories and towards more snacks, beverages, energy drinks, and on-the-go food\nIn consumables, we saw a rebound in the household chemicals category as well as cosmetics, while paper sales, demand for bath tissue and paper towels continue to be somewhat challenged, driven by previous COVID-related stockpiling\nA year ago, we reset Food and Consumables across the store, and this is performing well\nAs we approach the anniversary of this reset, we continue to see opportunities to improve overall productivity and enhance values with big deals, own brands, and everyday low prices on brand names\nOur Seasonal assortment, which includes patio, lawn and garden, and summer categories like coles, and 4th of July themed goods, was challenged for the quarter due to shipping delays and inventory availability\nThe overall category experienced a 15% decrease in comparable sales compared to last year, but a 4% increase compared to Q2 2019\nMoving into Q3, our inventory situation has improved, and we have seen a resurgence in sales with early strength from our Halloween and Harvest assortment\nAlthough supply chain pressures related to Asian port and manufacturing disruption will continue to create challenges, we are much better prepared for the crucial holiday season\nSoft Home comparable sales were up 14% compared to 2019\nWhile we saw softness in fashion bedding, all other categories met expectations\nBath rugs and towels, patio rugs, and floor mats were particularly strong this quarter\nAlso noteworthy were the candle collection categories within home decor, with strong double-digit growth compared to 2019\nHard Home comparable sales were up 13% compared to 2019, exceeding our expectations with appliances and home organization delivering double-digit increases compared to 2019\nKey classifications such as floor care, kitchen appliances, storage, dinnerware, and cookware continued to trend strongly, partially offset by lower, but positive comparable sales to 2019 in tabletop, food prep, and home maintenance\nCloseouts in Hard Home were up even more compared to 2020, with appliances, cookware, and home organization all performing very well\nToys, now included in our Hard Home category following our merchandising reorganization, also performed quite well and ahead of expectations\nFurniture delivered another very strong quarter, with comparable sales down 10% compared to last year, but up 30% compared to 2019\nThe furniture team did an outstanding job of mitigating inventory challenges, primarily resulting from chemical shortages affecting foam production, and we achieved our strategic goal of winning Memorial Day weekend with positive comparable sales to both last year and two years ago\nUpholstery was particularly strong in Q2, delivering flat comparable sales to 2020 and up almost 40% compared to 2019, driven by high demand for sofas and sectionals\nAnchored by the Broyhill brand, which continues to gain market share, it now accounts for over 40% of total upholstery sales\nApparel, Electronics & Other also performed very strongly, up 15% compared to 2020\nApparel delivered a 90% comparable sales increase for the quarter, with casual and athletic lifestyle dressing dominating the women's business\nAlthough tops remain strong, we saw high sell-through rates in capris and shorts as well\nMen's active tops and shorts performed well\nCloseouts continued to expand within the assortment, offering value, breadth, and new classifications\nAccessories saw nice increases in hair and jewelry\nAdditionally, luggage was introduced as a new category in July with strong sales results that will provide additional growth as we look toward the latter half of the year and into 2022\nThe Lot continues to strengthen, delighting our customers with fun, innovative treasures perfect for life's occasions while contributing nearly 2% of the Company's sales in the quarter\nWe executed a camping theme set and a nostalgia set during the quarter, both of which resonated well with big hits from national brand camping suppliers, novelty small appliances, and unexpected finds such as popcorn-themed items, a TV projector, large video game units, and novelty pet styles\nI would now like to discuss our longer-term growth strategy\nWe remain excited about the tremendous progress we are making under Operation North Star, where our growth drivers are expanding our customer base, improving our e-commerce conversion, enhancing merchandise productivity, and increasing our store count\nRegarding customer growth, we are thrilled with the continued rollout of our \"Be A BIGionaire\" brand campaign that we previewed last quarter\nThis program is based on extensive consumer insights into why customers love to shop with us\nOur customers see us as the destination for hunting exceptional bargains and surprising treasures\nI'm delighted to share that this campaign is driving a 2% increase in transactions in the markets where we have introduced it\nNew BIGionaires visiting Big Lots for the first time are driving 60% of these incremental transactions\nThe campaign has also increased brand awareness, consideration, and purchase rates, demonstrating that we are gaining relevance\nOur first campaign featured Retta, who successfully transferred her relatability and humor from Good Girls and Parks and Recreation into our BIGionaire campaign\nAs we prepare for the holiday season, you can expect to see additional stars hunting for bargains and treasures at their neighborhood Big Lots\nIn the near future, viewers will see Eric Stonestreet, renowned for his part in the popular sitcom Modern Family, and Molly Shannon, famed for her memorable characters on Saturday Night Live.\nEric and Molly fully embodied the Big Lots spirit.\nWe're excited to provide more information in the coming days.\nWe're delighted that the campaign is striking a chord with younger consumers.\nOur customer age distribution has shifted, with a 6% increase in new customers aged 25-39, moving away from those 55 and above.\nDiscerning shoppers across all age groups are discovering Big Lots and appreciating our comprehensive home offerings that combine exceptional value and superior style.\nOur rewards program continues to drive business growth, with active membership up 8% compared to Q2 2020, adding 1.8 million new members last quarter, bringing total membership to 21.5 million.\nMoreover, rewards customers spent 16% more overall than last year and 7% more per individual.\nOver 72% of our Q2 sales were linked to our rewards program.\nThis sales penetration is up 4% compared to the same quarter last year.\nWe're also seeing great success in reactivating lapsed members through targeted win-back campaigns.\nDemand rose 10% compared to Q2 2020, representing over 400% growth from Q2 2019.\nWhile in-store traffic decreased compared to Q2 2020, as we move past the peak of 2020's pandemic response, this was more than offset by increases in conversion rates and average purchase amounts.\nDemand for our seasonal lawn and garden products and furniture continued the strong momentum from Q1.\nE-commerce growth is supported by our investments in improving search, purchase, and fulfillment capabilities, including buy online pickup in store, curbside pickup, ship from store, and same-day delivery via Instacart and Pickup.\nThese services have been very successful, accounting for over 60% of our demand fulfillment.\nTo support the holiday season, we're increasing the number of stores offering ship-from-store fulfillment to 65.\nWe're further streamlining transactions by introducing PayPal as our third mobile wallet payment option for the holidays, joining Apple and Google Pay, and we plan to launch a new buy now, pay later option later this quarter.\nWe've also updated our website's appearance to align with and enhance our brand's upbeat image and the BIGionaire campaign.\nOur Broyhill product line continued to show strong momentum, generating $194 million in Q2 sales.\nThis represents a $77 million increase from Q2 2020, when we had just launched the brand.\nWe're thrilled with Broyhill's trajectory and anticipate continued strong growth, with over $400 million in year-to-date sales, surpassing last year's full-year performance and on track to become a $1 billion brand.\nIt's worth noting that Broyhill is just one aspect, albeit a major focus, of our own brand strategy.\nWe're also heavily investing in Real Living, a private label in our furniture and home goods department with a lower price point than Broyhill.\nWe're seeing early growth in this brand by consolidating our unbranded goods and transitioning from other private labels currently in the store.\nWe're also introducing new products to ensure a complete offering under the Real Living brand.\nReal Living has quickly ramped up, generating over $400 million in year-to-date sales, and we're confident it will also become a $1 billion own brand for Big Lots.\nOur Lot and Queue Line front-end strategies are now implemented in approximately 1,225 stores.\nThese initiatives serve as innovation labs, introducing new products that enhance the rest of the store's assortment and strengthen customer engagement.\nThe Lot and Queue Line continue to drive a combined 3% incremental lift in store performance.\nBoth have become established aspects of the Big Lots shopping experience, with transactions containing items from the Lot tending to be of higher value, include more items, and connect to more of the store's assortment, while the queue lines are driving strong incremental impulse purchases at checkout.\nIn previous calls, we introduced our next-generation furniture sales team test, which places dedicated furniture-focused associates on the sales floor to educate customers about our home furnishings range and quality.\nI'm excited to announce that this test, now in over 80 stores, continues to perform well, delivering around a 15% increase in furniture sales.\nWe plan to roll out this next-generation model to several hundred stores in 2022, expected to deliver at least a 1% comp increase to the total company on an annualized basis.\nRegarding store count, our growth is accelerating this year and will further accelerate in 2022 and beyond.\nBased on recent work, we're confident there's potential to increase our store count by hundreds of stores in the coming years, with two to three times the net store growth in 2022 compared to the net increase of around 20 stores we expect this year.\nSimultaneously, we expect to continue slowing our closure rate due to our store intervention program, which will only affect around 15 stores this year.\nAll these growth drivers are supported by key enabling investments.\nEarlier this year, we announced plans to open two forward bulk and furniture distribution centers mid-year to support our growth and relieve pressure on our current regional distribution centers.\nWe're pleased to announce that our first FDC opened in early August, and our second will begin receiving inventory next week.\nWe're also pleased with the performance of our new transportation management system, which has been crucial in mitigating pressures within our distribution network.\nDuring Q2, we initiated a multi-year program called Project Refresh to upgrade approximately 800 stores not included in our 2017 to early 2020 Store of the Future program.\nThese stores will receive new exterior signage, interior repainting and floor repair, a new vestibule experience, remodeled bathrooms, and interior wall graphics, all at a much lower cost than our previous Store of the Future conversions.\nThis will create a consistent brand experience across our stores and enhance our brand for the long term.\nThe average cost per store will be around $100,000, significantly lower than the previous Store of the Future program.\nAs I hope I've conveyed, both in this quarter's discussion and in previous calls, we have a strong belief in our growth potential and in the continued opportunities that Operation North Star presents.\nThe underlying progress we're making is increasingly evident.\nBefore handing over to Jonathan, I want to revisit the supply chain and distribution challenges we've discussed, which we expect will continue to impact our business in Q3 and Q4.\nBefore the recent global COVID resurgence, we were seeing increased import costs driven by a global increase in demand for ocean freight.\nOver the past few months, this situation has been exacerbated by the temporary shutdown of the port at Yantian, China, and temporary factory and port closures elsewhere in Asia.\nVietnam, where segments of our furniture and seasonal categories are sourced, is currently under COVID restrictions that impact our suppliers' ability to produce at scale.\nThe Vietnamese government is targeting September 15th as the date to ease restrictions.\nAdditionally, the port of Ningbo, China experienced a terminal closure in mid-August, although it has now reopened.\nThese developments highlight the fluidity of the situation and the ongoing uncertainties caused by COVID-19.\nWhile these pressures are expected to be temporary, they are resulting in both cost increases due to an imbalance of container supply and demand, as well as sales impacts due to delayed inflow of products, particularly from Vietnam.\nThe guidance that Jonathan will cover shortly incorporates our current estimates of these impacts.\nIn summary, we face some near-term challenges, but our underlying business remains strong, as evidenced by our strong two-year comps in the second quarter, which have continued into Q3.\nWe remain confident that our Operation North Star strategies will drive significant growth in the coming years, supported by key investments we are making.\nAs Bruce mentioned, we accomplished a great deal this quarter as our teams remained focused on providing an excellent experience, assortment, and value to our customers.\nNet sales for the second quarter were $1.457 billion, an 11.4% decrease compared to $1.644 billion a year ago.\nThe decline was driven by a 13.2% decrease in comparable sales as we lap stimulus impacts in 2020 and the peak of last year's nesting activities, partially offset by a 180 basis point impact from net store openings and relocations.\nOur comp result was slightly below our negative low-double digit guidance, due to labor challenges at two of our regional distribution centers, which adversely impacted store inventories.\nTotal sales were up 16% compared to 2019's $1.252 billion, with a two-year comp of 14% driven by basket size.\nNote that when we reference two-year comps going forward, we will be using a multiplied rather than an additive basis.\nThe company's net income in Q2 was $37.7 million, compared to $110.1 million in Q2 2020 and $20.6 million in 2019\nQuarterly diluted earnings per share reached $1.09, falling within the anticipated range\nLast year, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.75, excluding the profit from selling our four distribution centers\nThis year's Q2 earnings per share reflected effective expense management, offsetting a slight sales shortfall\nShare repurchases during the quarter provided an additional benefit of approximately $0.03\nThe Q2 gross margin rate was 39.6%, a decrease of 200 basis points from last year and 20 basis points below 2019, aligning with our projections\nOur margin rate was impacted by freight challenges, partially offset by cost benefits, price increases, and strategic markdown management\nFreight expenses were higher than initially projected, causing nearly 200 basis points of gross margin reduction year-over-year\nTotal quarterly expenses, including depreciation, were $524 million, down from $534 million last year and slightly below initial expectations, despite distribution and transportation cost pressures\nThe quarter's operating margin was 3.7%, compared to 9.1% last year and 2.6% in 2019\nExcluding freight challenges, our operating margin would have been around 5.7%, a 300 basis point improvement over 2019\nQuarterly interest expense was $2.3 million, down from $2.5 million in Q2 last year\nOn June 7th, we paid off the remaining $44.3 million principal balance on our 2019 term note secured by Apple Valley distribution center equipment\nWe incurred a $0.4 million prepayment fee and recognized a $0.5 million loss on debt extinguishment in Q2 due to this prepayment\nThe Q2 income tax rate was 26.7%, up from 25.8% last year, primarily due to the impact of Section 162(m) executive compensation add back\nTotal inventory increased by 32% to $943.8 million, slightly exceeding our initial guidance\nThe inventory increase was due to comparing against unusually low levels at the end of Q2 2020\nInventories were up 8% compared to Q2 2019, maintaining strong two-year turn improvement while supporting Q3 performance\nWe opened 12 new stores and closed seven during Q2\nAt the end of Q2, we had 1,418 stores with a total selling area of 32.3 million square feet\nQ2 capital expenditures were $45 million, compared to $41 million last year\nDepreciation expense for the quarter was $35.3 million, about $1.3 million lower than the same period last year\nWe ended Q2 with $293 million in cash and cash equivalents and no long-term debt\nAt the end of Q2 2020, we had $899 million in cash and cash equivalents and $43 million in long-term debt\nThe year-over-year reduction in cash reflects our use of proceeds from the sale and leaseback of distribution centers for share repurchases and tax payments on the sale and leaseback gain\nWe repurchased 2.4 million shares for $153 million during the quarter, at an average cost of $63.57 per share, under our $500 million authorization\nApproximately $97 million remained in the repurchase program at the end of Q2 2021\nTo date, we have repurchased 7.3 million shares at an average cost of $55.18, including commission\nOur Board of Directors has declared a Q3 2021 quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per common share\nThe dividend will be paid on September 24, 2021, to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 10th, 2021\nWe are facing significant sales and margin challenges due to Asian manufacturing and supply chain disruptions caused by recent COVID issues\nWe will incur additional expenses in the latter half of the year to ensure competitiveness in hiring and retaining labor in our stores and distribution centers\nFor Q3, we expect a diluted loss per share between $0.10 and $0.20, compared to $0.76 earnings per diluted share in Q3 2020\nWe anticipate full-year earnings per share between $5.90 and $6.05\nWhile this is a decline from last year's adjusted diluted earnings per share of $7.35, it represents over 60% growth compared to 2019 earnings\nOur guidance does not include any potential share repurchases in Q3 or Q4\nWe expect comps to be up low double digits on a two-year basis\nQ3 has started well, with two-year comps ahead of Q2, but we anticipate some moderation as the quarter progresses due to receipt delays\nFor the full year, we expect a negative low-single digit comp versus 2020, equating to double-digit comps on a two-year basis\nOur full-year sales outlook includes approximately $60 million of adverse impact in Q3 and Q4 related to COVID-related manufacturing shutdowns in Vietnam\nWe expect the Q3 gross margin rate to be down about 175 basis points from last year, primarily due to freight challenges\nCompared to 2019, the Q3 rate is expected to be down approximately 100 basis points, almost entirely due to freight-related issues\nRecent shutdowns at the port of Yantian in China have significantly increased container rates, impacting our cost of goods in Q3 and Q4\nFor the full year, we now expect a gross margin rate impact from freight of about 150 basis points, resulting in a gross margin rate decline of approximately 50 basis points versus 2019 and about 100 basis points versus 2020\nWe expect freight pressures to decrease moving forward, and we continue to see other areas of gross margin opportunity, including promotional and pricing optimization and shrink reduction\nFor SG&A, we expect Q3 and the full year to deleverage versus 2020 but show healthy leverage versus 2019 at our projected sales levels\nQ3 expense dollars will be slightly higher than last year, driven by incremental investments in labor and forward distribution centers\nFull-year SG&A expense dollars will increase compared to 2020 due to various factors, including the full-year impact of distribution center sale and leaseback, additional supply chain expenses, strategic investments, and higher equity compensation expense\nThese increases will be partially offset by over $30 million in structural expense savings, which remain a focus area\nWe still expect 2021 capital expenditures to be around $200 million to $210 million, including about 55 store openings, with around 20 being relocations\nOur capex outlook includes the first wave of store upgrades under our new Project Refresh program\nWe expect a net increase of about 20 stores in 2021\nWe plan to accelerate store count growth in 2022 and beyond\nOur research increasingly supports the opportunity for significant store count growth in coming years, and we are making necessary investments to support this\nWe continue to expect inventory to increase significantly versus 2020, reflecting very low levels a year ago\nWe are seeing strong early sales for our late fall and early holiday assortment, supported by higher inventory levels\nWe expect Q3 ending inventory to be up around 10% versus 2019, continuing to reflect healthy turn improvement\nWe anticipate a similar two-year inventory increase at the end of Q4, including some accelerated lawn and garden receipts to support Q1 sales and minimize further supply chain disruption risks\nWe aim to recapture seasonal sales lost over the past 12-18 months\nEarly Q4 receipts will drive around $6 million of additional supply chain expense\nQ3 will be challenging due to supply chain issues, resulting sales impacts, and cost increases\nHowever, we expect our underlying business, measured by our two-year comp trend, to remain strong, with healthy margins after adjusting for freight effects, supported by continued strong expense management\nWe are working hard to be well-positioned for the crucial holiday season\nWe look forward to continuing to demonstrate strong underlying performance in 2022 and beyond\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The Company has no obligation to provide updates on new information.\nWhitestone's Q1 earnings report and supplementary operational and financial data have been submitted to the SEC and can be accessed in the Investor Relations area of our website, www.whitestonereit.com.\nI will provide a concise summary of Whitestone and an update on our operations and recent events in Q1.\nAfter my presentation, Dave Holeman will take over to give a financial update on our Q1 performance, followed by a Q&A session.\nThis quarter's results were enhanced by our strategic decision to position our portfolio in rapidly expanding Sunbelt markets, where we're at the forefront of the nation's economic reopening.\nThis strategic positioning contributed to our strong leasing performance, demonstrating the robustness of our business model and corporate culture.\nOur operations team continues to exhibit flexibility and adaptability, supported by our robust financial infrastructure.\nAt the close of Q1 this year, our operating portfolio occupancy stood at 89.1%, up 0.5% from the previous quarter and only 0.6% lower than the same period last year.\nOur rent collection rates continue to place us among the top performers in our industry peer group.\nIn Q1, we maintained strong collections, receiving approximately 95% of our rents for the quarter and for April.\nWe signed 46 new leases in Q1, a significant increase from 28 in the previous quarter, with a total lease count of 94, 12% higher than the preceding quarter.\nOur blended leasing spread was 7.8%, a full percentage point higher than last quarter's 6.8%.\nOur same-store net operating decrease of 4.3% remained unchanged from last quarter, yet still ranked among the best in the industry.\nFurthermore, in Q1 we raised our quarterly dividend by 2.4% and have consistently paid monthly dividends to shareholders for 120 consecutive months.\nOur staff have safely returned to work at our properties, and tenant businesses are ramping up with increased customer foot traffic as consumers resume their daily routines and visit our properties, while migration to our markets continues.\nOur strategically located portfolio consists of high-quality, open-air real estate properties that generate predictable cash flow.\nOur properties are situated near affluent communities and house tenants including grocery stores, pharmacies, and restaurants.\nOur centers feature e-commerce-resistant tenants providing essential goods and services.\nThese tenants generate consistent foot traffic 18 hours a day, 7 days a week at our properties.\nConsequently, our centers have remained operational throughout the past year, with most tenants continuing to operate, some even surpassing their pre-pandemic sales levels.\nWe remind shareholders that Whitestone was established during the 2008-2010 recession, and we've incorporated many lessons from that period into the company's core structure.\nOur company has grown by acquiring properties in business-friendly states, rapidly expanding and densely populated cities, and high-income communities.\nWe've developed an internet-resistant business model focusing on consumer services and essential needs.\nWe've created a diverse portfolio of entrepreneurial tenants and structured leases with tenant owner recourse and minimal co-tenancy approval rights.\nBy offering yearly rent hikes of 2% to 3%, passing through triple net expenses, and concentrating on training and developing our staff for continuity, we aim to achieve our goals.\nOur quick action to COVID-19 a year ago bolstered our balance sheet, liquidity, and financial flexibility to effectively manage the economic consequences of the pandemic.\nLooking ahead to the initial quarter of 2021.\nWe are implementing our strategic expansion plan.\nWe are preparing for upcoming redevelopment and development initiatives.\nWe have lowered our overall debt, increased our dividend, and are continuing to expand our infrastructure.\nOur past practice has been to expand our portfolio through individual off-market, value-added acquisitions in four specific markets.\nAustin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, and Phoenix-Scottsdale.\nWe plan to maintain this approach to accumulate valuable properties in areas where tenants desire to lease and consumers want to visit.\nBy expanding in this manner, we have built a substantial portfolio of value-added properties.\nIn fact, we are in the process of acquiring a property in one of our target markets, our first purchase since the pandemic began, and we anticipate closing the deal this summer.\nThis acquisition will add nearly 200,000 square feet and is expected to immediately boost Whitestone's FFO per share and positively contribute to Whitestone's long-term objectives related to debt, leverage, and G&A coverage.\nMoreover, our regional management team is in place, providing us with operational efficiencies as we expand our infrastructure.\nWe look forward to sharing more details as we progress throughout the year.\nMoving ahead, Whitestone is well-positioned with an improving balance sheet, enhanced liquidity, a strong focus on increasing occupancy and revenue growth through leasing, leveraging our deep understanding of our markets, properties, and opportunities, along with our business model to provide and curate a tenant mix that appeals to credit-worthy entrepreneurial businesses.\nThis is how we generate long-term value for our shareholders.\nFirst, I'd like to offer some additional context on the strength of our markets.\nOur targeted focus on top MSAs in the Sunbelt continues to yield excellent results.\nTexas and Arizona continue to experience significant population growth and corporate relocations, creating jobs from other parts of the country.\nThis is best demonstrated by our first quarter leasing activity, occupancy levels, leasing spreads, and our average base rent per leased square foot.\nOur leasing activity in the quarter was robust, with 46 new leases representing 117,000 square feet of newly occupied space.\nThis volume of new lease square footage was 90% higher than our average quarterly lease volume for the previous three-year period.\nIt was also 21% higher than the highest quarter over the past three years.\nIn terms of total lease value, this quarter was more than double our average quarterly lease volume for the previous three-year period and 38% higher than the highest quarter over the past three years.\nRegarding occupancy, our operating portfolio occupancy stood at 89.1%, up 1.5% from the fourth quarter and down only 0.6% from a year ago, with our Austin market leading the way with almost 4% increase in occupancy from Q4.\nLeasing spreads on a GAAP basis have been positive 9% over the last 12 months, and first quarter leasing spreads increased 5.3% on new leases and 9.6% on renewal leases signed.\nAt the quarter's end, our yearly base rent per square foot on a GAAP basis increased by 1% to $19.71 from $19.58 in the previous quarter, aligning with our pre-COVID ABR from the prior year.\nCore funds from operations were $0.23 per share in Q1, compared to $0.24 per share last year.\nAs mentioned, our collections approached normal pre-COVID levels, with 95% of contractual rents collected in Q1.\nOur largest tenant category, restaurants and food service, comprising 23% of our ABR and 17% of leased square footage, performed exceptionally well, maintaining 95% rent collection in the quarter. We also observed positive trends in some affected customer types, with entertainment, representing only 2% of our ABR and leased square footage, paying 73% of their rents in Q1, up from 48% in Q4.\nWe had minimal rent deferrals during the quarter, accounting for 45% of our total contractual billings.\nOur same-store net operating income decreased by 4.3% compared to the same quarter last year, but we anticipate same-store growth to resume throughout the rest of the year and into 2022.\nOur reserve for uncollectible revenue was $529,000 or 1.8% of revenue, down from 4% in Q4, reflecting continued portfolio improvement. For perspective, our Q1 reserve is only 9% of the full-year 2020 reserves.\nInterest expense was 8% lower than last year, due to $15 million less average debt and a decrease in overall interest rate from 3.9% to 3.6%.\nThe first quarter provides an encouraging start to 2021, highlighting the resilience of our forward-thinking business model and the strength of our strategically chosen high-growth markets.\nLet me provide more details on our collections and related receivable balances.\nPage 27 of our soft data breaks down our tenants by type. All credit categories had over 89% collection in Q1, except for entertainment, which I mentioned earlier. Our three largest categories - restaurants, grocery, and financial services - collected 95%, 100%, and 99% respectively.\nAt quarter's end, we had $23.3 million in accrued rents and accounts receivable, including $16.9 million of accrued straight-line rents and $1.8 million of agreed-upon deferrals. Our agreed-upon deferral balance decreased 18% from year-end, reflecting tenants honoring their payment plans.\nSince early last year, we've implemented various measures to strengthen our liquidity and navigate economic pressures caused by the pandemic. Our total net debt is $632 million, down $17 million from a year ago, and our liquidity, representing cash and credit facility availability, stands at $39 million at quarter-end.\nWe continue progressing towards our publicly stated goal of reducing leverage. In April, we paid down an additional $10 million of our corporate credit facility. Currently, we have $140.5 million of undrawn capacity and $25.9 million of borrowing availability under our credit facility. We are in full compliance with all debt covenants and expect to remain so.\nAs mentioned earlier, 2021 has started promisingly. These results demonstrate the resilience of Whitestone's business model. We are encouraged by the recovery and look forward to resuming our growth strategy and continuing to deliver value to all Whitestone stakeholders.\nWe will now take questions. Operator, please open the lines.\nSummary: ",

respectively compared to the same period last year, mainly due to ongoing improvements in solid waste pricing, volume expansion, and robust recovered commodity values\nThese patterns led to a year-to-date adjusted EBITDA margin increase of 110 basis points and adjusted free cash flow exceeding $585 million, up 18.5% from last year, enabling us to revise our full-year projections upward for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, and adjusted free cash flow due to anticipated continued momentum and margin growth\nThe year 2021 may also see an exceptionally high level of

Nevada, and Oregon expected to be completed later this year\nWe are witnessing unprecedented levels of seller interest, leading to increased acquisition discussions, and as we've indicated throughout

2022\nDuring the call, we will examine non-GAAP metrics such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income attributable to Waste Connections in both dollar amounts and per diluted share, and adjusted free cash flow\nThe management team employs certain non-GAAP measures to assess and monitor the ongoing financial performance of our operations\nDifferent companies may calculate these non-GAAP measures using different methods\nIn Q2, solid waste price plus volume growth of 11.4% surpassed our projections by nearly 150 basis points, primarily due to higher-than-anticipated volumes as the recovery trends that started in Q1 persisted throughout the quarter, with landfill tons and roll-off pulls returning to levels comparable to or exceeding pre-pandemic figures\nOverall pricing of 4.9%, a 70 basis point increase from the previous quarter, exceeded our forecast due to higher core pricing of 4.7%, once again demonstrating the robust pricing retention we observed in Q1, plus approximately 20 basis points in fuel and material surcharges\nOur second quarter pricing varied from 2.6% in our predominantly exclusive Western region to between 4.5% and 7% in our more competitive regions\nLooking forward, we are set for higher sequential pricing growth in the second half of the year due to additional price increases we have already implemented to counteract certain cost pressures\nReported volume growth of 6.5% in Q2 showed a sequential improvement of about 1,000 basis points from Q1 and was spearheaded by regions where markets were most severely impacted during the pandemic, including the Northeast U.S. and Canada\nEvery region displayed sequential improvement from Q1, and all reported positive volumes in Q2\nVolumes ranged from approximately 4% in our Central region, where comparisons to the previous year were more challenging as many markets were relatively less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, to almost 10.5% in Canada, one of our most impacted regions where the volume recovery has been remarkably strong, arguably outpacing the reopening activity, especially considering that many restrictions in Canada extended through Q2 of this year\nAlso noteworthy is our Western region, where volumes led our other regions going into the pandemic and continue to be the strongest in the U.S. at about 8.5% in Q2\nExamining year-over-year results for the second quarter on a same-store basis, all lines of business increased by double digits Commercial collection revenue rose by 16% compared to the previous year\nRoll-off pulls grew by over 11% year-over-year, led by Canada with an increase of almost 20%, returning to above pre-COVID-19 levels\nIn the United States, pulls increased by about 10%, and all regions showed year-over-year improvement, most notably in our more impacted markets, including the Northeast\nLandfill tons increased by 17% year-over-year, with MSW tons up 11%, C&D tons up 20%, and special waste tons up 33%\nConsequently, landfill tons have returned to above pre-pandemic levels in all of our regions, except the Eastern region, which was slightly below prior levels due to delayed reopening activity in Northeast markets\nTaking a closer look at the results, as mentioned, all waste types experienced double-digit percentage increases year-over-year\nHowever, the exceptionally high amount of special waste activity was particularly notable, as Q2 activity pushed tons back to 13% above pre-pandemic levels, with all regions showing year-over-year growth, possibly due to some activity being pulled forward from Q3\nExamining Q2 revenues from recovery commodities, which include recycled commodities, landfill gas, and renewable energy credits (RINs), excluding acquisitions, they collectively increased by about 95% year-over-year, resulting in a combined margin boost of approximately 130 basis points, with 90 basis points from recycling and 40 basis points from landfill gas and RINs\nIncreases in recycling revenue were propelled by higher commodity prices, with old corrugated containers rising 25% and both plastics and metals more than doubling.\nYear-over-year volume increases also contributed, reflecting the impact of the pandemic.\nIn Q2, OCC prices averaged approximately $135 per ton, while RIN pricing averaged about $2.72.\nLet's now discuss E&P waste activity.\nE&P waste revenue in the second quarter was $31.2 million, showing a 26% sequential increase from Q1 due to increased activity across multiple basins.\nTurning to acquisition activity.\nWe have already signed or completed 14 acquisitions with annual revenue of about $115 million, nearing what we consider an average amount of activity for a full year.\nThese deals include several West Coast franchise markets, which align with our core strategy and offer unique opportunities to expand our exclusive contract portfolio.\nFurthermore, our pipeline indicates record levels of seller interest, potentially leading to above-average activity in 2021, primarily due to tax-related considerations.\nNevertheless, we remain selective and disciplined in our acquisition approach, recognizing the importance of creating value for shareholders, as well as market selection and asset positioning.\nI'll now hand over to Mary Anne to provide a more detailed review of the second quarter's financial highlights, our increased outlook for the year, and a detailed forecast for Q3.\nI will then conclude before moving to the Q&A session.\nSecond quarter revenue totaled $1.534 billion, exceeding our projection by about $44 million, mainly due to higher-than-expected solid waste growth and recovered commodity values.\nYear-over-year revenue increased by $228 million or 17.5% on a reported basis, including acquisitions completed since the previous year, which contributed approximately $47.6 million in revenue for the quarter, or about $44.1 million net of divestitures.\nCommodity-driven impacts accounted for roughly 100 basis points of margin expansion, after accounting for a 30 basis point impact from higher fuel costs, with diesel rates up almost 20% year-over-year.\nExcluding fuel, solid waste collection, transfer, and disposal margins expanded by 50 basis points, offsetting a 60 basis point increase in incentive compensation costs, 50 basis points from higher medical expenses, and 50 basis points from increased discretionary expenses.\nAcquisitions completed since the previous year accounted for about 10 basis points of margin dilution.\nRegarding discretionary expenses, we have begun returning to a more normalized operating environment, including in-person training, meetings, and other activities we consider crucial for maintaining our culture and expanding our talent pool for future growth.\nGiven the challenging labor market, we have proactively implemented supplemental wage adjustments in many areas to anticipate or combat labor constraints.\nThese intentional wage and discretionary cost additions, along with higher incentives, medical, and other expenses resulting from more typical activity levels, largely replaced last year's COVID-19-related frontline support costs, most of which did not recur this year.\nAs mentioned earlier, we have already implemented additional price increases to address these higher costs, resulting in a full-year 2021 price increase of approximately 5%, up from 4% in our original outlook.\nWe achieved adjusted free cash flow of $585 million through Q2, up 18.5% year-over-year, representing 20% of revenue and putting us on track to meet our revised adjusted free cash flow outlook of approximately $1 billion.\nI will now discuss our outlook for the third quarter of 2021 and our updated full-year forecast.\nBefore proceeding, we'd like to remind everyone once again that actual results may vary significantly based on risks and uncertainties outlined in our safe harbor statement and filings with the SEC and similar regulatory authorities in Canada.\nWe encourage investors to carefully review these factors.\nOur outlook assumes no significant changes in underlying economic trends, including those resulting from or related to the COVID-19 pandemic or the delta variant of the coronavirus.\nThe forecast excludes potential effects from future acquisitions and transaction-related expenses for the rest of the year.\nLet's begin with the third quarter.\nQ3 revenue is projected to be around $1.56 billion.\nWe anticipate solid waste price and volume growth of roughly 7% in Q3, with pricing at about 5%.\nRecovered commodity values and E&P waste income are expected to remain stable, with RINs similar to Q2 and OCC slightly increasing.\nQ3 adjusted EBITDA is estimated at about $495 million, or 31.7% of revenue, showing a 60 basis point increase year-over-year and a sequential rise from Q2.\nThird quarter depreciation and amortization expense is projected to be approximately 13.3% of revenue, including intangibles amortization of about $33.8 million or $0.10 per diluted share after taxes.\nNet interest expense is estimated at around $40 million.\nThe projected Q3 effective tax rate is about 21.5%, subject to some fluctuation.\nThe 2021 revenue forecast has been raised to approximately $5.975 billion, $175 million above our initial projection, mainly due to an additional 150 basis points of solid waste price and volume growth, higher recovered commodity values, and $25 million from acquisitions completed this year.\nThe full-year adjusted EBITDA is now estimated at about $1.875 billion, or 31.4% of revenue, $75 million above our initial forecast.\nThe full-year adjusted EBITDA margin guidance is 40 basis points higher than our initial outlook, showing a 90 basis point increase year-over-year.\nOur 31.4% adjusted EBITDA margin outlook indicates continued year-over-year margin expansion in the latter half of 2021, despite wage and inflationary pressures and tougher year-over-year comparisons.\nThe 2021 adjusted free cash flow is now expected to reach about $1 billion, over 53% of EBITDA and $15 million above our initial projection, despite a $50 million increase in capex from our original forecast.\nWe recently secured a new $2.5 billion credit facility, increasing our borrowing capacity by nearly $300 million, lowering borrowing costs, and providing more flexibility for continued growth.\nOur strong financial position and increased capacity set us up for potentially above-average acquisition activity and increased returns to shareholders.\nWe've already returned over $400 million to shareholders this year through share repurchases and dividends.\nWe're in the process of renewing our normal course issuer bid, allowing us to repurchase up to 5% of our outstanding shares annually.\nWe'll continue to approach share repurchases opportunistically and plan to announce another double-digit percentage increase in our cash dividend per share in October.\nOur broad-based strength continues to drive results ahead of expectations as we benefit from reopening activities in a supportive economic environment, including tailwinds from recovered commodity values.\nWe've again demonstrated the importance of being selective about markets and intentional about driving results.\nThe quality of revenue and comparative price retention across markets are crucial factors.\nWe're very pleased to be able to raise our full-year outlook.\nWe're positioned for continued margin expansion through the second half of 2021 as proactive, unbudgeted price increases offset wage and inflationary pressures.\nWe're on track to achieve adjusted free cash flow of about $1 billion and adjusted EBITDA margins exceeding pre-COVID-19 levels.\nWe expect to announce another double-digit percentage increase in our regular quarterly cash dividend in October and are well-positioned for a potential significant increase in acquisition spending to drive further growth in 2021 and beyond.\nThank you for your time today.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Tim Gokey, our CEO, and Edmund Reese, our CFO, are participating in today's call.\nThe second and third pages of the slides contain a summary of risks, with a more detailed description available in our annual report on Form 10-K.\nWe'll be discussing several non-GAAP measures that we believe offer investors a more comprehensive understanding of Broadridge's core operating performance.\nI'll start by highlighting our key messages and providing an update on our third quarter results, including our progress towards our strategic goals.\nBroadridge is in an exciting phase, and we have plenty to discuss, so let's begin.\nI'm happy to report that Broadridge had a strong third quarter performance.\nBoth recurring revenues and adjusted operating income increased by 8%.\nLong-term trends such as increasing digitization, mutualization, and the democratization of investing are driving our results in both ICS and GTO.\nThese trends are leading to robust new business growth, record increases in shareholder numbers, and higher trading volumes.\nWe're also making good progress on our strategic growth plan across governance, capital markets, and wealth and investment management.\nI'll discuss some of these initiatives shortly.\nOur strong results and continued execution of our growth plans are giving us confidence to keep investing in our business.\nWe've maintained funding for attractive investments in our products, platforms, and people, including the upcoming acquisition of Itiviti.\nWe're significantly raising our guidance for fiscal year 2021 in terms of both revenue and earnings.\nWe now anticipate recurring revenue growth of 8% to 10% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% to 13%.\nWhile the new guidance includes the impact of Itiviti, most of this increase is organic, as Edmund will explain.\nThe overall outcome of our strong third quarter results, ongoing internal and M&A investment, and outlook for fiscal 2021 is that Broadridge is performing well and is on track to achieve the higher end of our 3-year financial goals, including 8% to 12% adjusted earnings per share growth.\nWe remain committed to delivering long-term growth driven by secular trends and consistent investment across our governance, wealth, and capital markets businesses, ultimately generating consistent, sustainable top-quartile shareholder returns.\nBroadridge's ability to generate these attractive returns stems from executing our clear long-term growth strategy.\nLet me update you on some recent progress highlights on Slide five.\nStarting with ICS, recurring revenues grew 11% to $586 million, driven by new sales revenue and very strong equity record growth.\nNew sales revenue was the primary driver of ICS's strong growth, and I'm pleased to see our recent investments impacting our results.\nLet me provide two examples of how our focus on product investment and strong execution is directly translating into increased revenue growth.\nThe first is the Shareholder Rights Directive II. Over the past two years, we've established a shareholder communications hub connecting millions of EU investors with hundreds of wealth managers, acquiring almost 300 new clients in the process. As we enter proxy season, we're beginning to see these efforts generate new revenues, contributing to over 80% growth in our international proxy business.\nVirtual shareholder meetings continue to exemplify how product investment leads to new revenues. Over the past year, we've enhanced our VSM capabilities with state-of-the-art video and audio technology, improved Q&A functionality, one-click shareholder authentication, and seamless proxy voting. These upgrades have helped retain existing clients and driven additional growth. We're now on track to serve nearly 1,900 virtual shareholder meetings this proxy season, up from 1,400 last spring.\nThe second factor driving ICS was exceptionally strong equity record growth, which reached 20% for the quarter.\nIt's evident that the move to reduce trading commissions has sparked a significant expansion in market participants, contributing to the increase in equity record growth.\nThis strong growth has been widespread across our broker clients but most pronounced among online brokers.\nIt has also been broad-based across issuers, with 20% growth in both widely held stocks and those with medium-sized shareholder bases.\nWe observed large increases in a few names, including so-called meme stocks like GameStop, but these increases only contributed one percentage point to the overall growth.\nCommission-free trading is the latest step in a long-term trend that includes the rise of ETFs, lower trading costs across all participants, and changes in investor interfaces. This trend has driven high single-digit equity and fund record growth over the past decade.\nBroadridge has invested in scaling its capabilities to meet this rising demand, increase the digitization of critical regulatory communications, and ensure both new and existing investors receive the information needed to understand risks and participate in the governance of their investments.\nLooking ahead, we expect strong record growth to continue into the fourth quarter, with our testing indicating 25% stock record growth for Q4.\nTo conclude the governance section, let me briefly touch on regulatory matters.\nI'd like to congratulate Commissioner Gensler on his confirmation as SEC Chairman.\nAs we have with every chair and administration from both parties over the past 40 years, we look forward to assisting by investing in next-generation technology to help the SEC fulfill its mandate of better informing and protecting investors, while reducing costs for registrants and creating a fair return for our shareholders.\nLet's now turn to our capital markets franchise.\nCapital markets' recurring revenues decreased by 1% as steady international growth was offset, as expected, by lower license revenues.\nWe anticipate this period of flat revenue to continue through the fourth quarter before picking up again in fiscal '22 as we onboard our very healthy backlog.\nStrategically, our planned acquisition of Itiviti represents a significant enhancement of our ability to deliver value to our clients.\nFor those who may have missed our call a few weeks ago, let me reiterate why we believe this transaction is such an exciting step forward for our global capital markets franchise.\nAs a leading provider of order management and trade execution technology and connectivity solutions for financial institutions, Itiviti presents Broadridge with a compelling opportunity to expand our capital market service offering.\nCombining Itiviti's front-office trading solutions with Broadridge's leading post-trade back-office capabilities will allow us to serve our clients' entire trade lifecycle from order to settlement.\nWith the increasing prevalence of high-frequency and algorithmic trading, it's becoming more crucial to serve clients across traditional boundaries.\nThis combination will bring critical data from the back to the front office to improve trading decisions, and it will enable our clients to simplify and enhance their front-to-back technology stack and operating model.\nThe merger also strengthens our joint capabilities across equities, exchange-traded derivatives, and fixed income, while substantially extending our global reach, creating significant cross-selling opportunities and enhancing our relationships with blue-chip clients.\nThe acquisition nearly doubles our business in APAC and further expands our presence in Europe.\nThis expanded footprint and scale positions us to capitalize on growing mutualization trends in both EMEA and Asia.\nItiviti adds over $6 billion to Broadridge's total addressable market and will drive stronger growth, margins, and earnings, as Edmund will discuss in his remarks.\nInitial feedback from our clients has been overwhelmingly positive, reinforcing our confidence in our front-to-back thesis and our near-term to medium growth outlook.\nAnother noteworthy development in our capital markets franchise is the continued progress of our LTX fixed income trading platform.\nLTX recently completed the first-ever multi-buyer digital block trade.\nEnabling a single seller to simultaneously access the aggregated liquidity from multiple buyers is a milestone for the fixed income market, and hopefully one of many steps toward creating a more liquid corporate bond market.\nTo date, 10 dealers and over 40 asset managers have joined the LTX platform.\nAdditional 14 institutions are in the process of joining, including a major fixed income manager.\nOur wealth and investment management division saw a 7% revenue increase, attributed to new clients and higher stock trading volumes.\nExpanding sales of component solutions is a crucial aspect of our growth plan.\nWe're pleased to see new clients adopting a wide range of our wealth and investment management offerings.\nProgress continues on our top-tier wealth management platform, aiding clients in digitally transforming their wealth operations.\nWe've successfully launched our average daily balance billing solution, marking an industry milestone.\nSelect advisors are currently testing our phone office workstation, paving the way for extensive platform testing before full implementation.\nWe're making good progress in our sales and marketing efforts to bring new clients onto this platform.\nClients recognize that utilizing the Broadridge wealth platform for digitization will boost their top and bottom lines by enhancing advisor and client capabilities while streamlining operations.\nDeveloping a strong partner network is another key element of our wealth strategy to integrate cutting-edge capabilities.\nWe've recently partnered with Fligoo for predictive analytics, Anchor Bank for securities-based lending, and established a wealth management fintech accelerator.\nThese partnerships are steps towards building a network enabling our clients to swiftly adopt new technologies.\nA year ago, when I addressed you at the end of our fiscal third quarter, the economic outlook was uncertain and much of the world was in lockdown.\nMy focus then was on safeguarding our associates and meeting client needs during unprecedented times.\nNow, after a challenging year, significant hurdles remain, especially for our 3,000+ associates in India and their loved ones.\nHowever, the global outlook has improved, with economic growth aligning with increasing vaccination rates.\nThe pandemic has accelerated trends like digitization, mutualization, and next-generation resiliency.\nReduced costs and barriers to investing are attracting millions of new investors.\nThese shifts are significantly impacting wealth management, governance, and capital markets.\nFinancial services leaders are rapidly adopting next-generation technologies as a result.\nBroadridge is developing capabilities to help them navigate and succeed in this changing landscape.\nWe're in a strong position to do so.\nWe began the fiscal year expecting 2-6% recurring revenue growth and 4-10% adjusted earnings per share growth.\nOur initial focus was on cutting expenses to fund crucial growth investments.\nNine months later, we're set to achieve 8-10% recurring revenue growth, driven by strong sales and healthy financial markets.\nHaving met our expense targets, we're now heavily investing in new product capabilities, enhancing our global post-trade platform, and developing next-generation solutions across various areas.\nWe're also expanding our talent pool and investing in our people to make Broadridge the top workplace for industry talent.\nWe're close to finalizing our $2.5 billion acquisition of Itiviti, expanding our capital markets presence and strengthening our global footprint.\nDespite these investments and short-term dilution from Itiviti, we're on track to deliver 11-13% adjusted earnings per share growth.\nBroadridge is proactively pursuing opportunities we see ahead.\nIt's been an exceptional year.\nLooking forward, we're on course to achieve the upper end of our 3-year growth objectives, driving strong recurring revenue and double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.\nWe anticipate long-term trends will continue to drive demand for our services.\nOur investments are creating new growth opportunities beyond our current 2-year objectives.\nBroadridge's future is brighter than ever.\nOur team has risen to the challenges of the past 12 months and delivered.\nThey've remained client-focused, helping to improve financial lives for millions.\nBroadridge delivered another strong quarter, as shown in the Q3 financial summary on Slide seven.\nRecurring revenue grew 8% to $900 million.\nAdjusted operating income also increased by 8% to $284 million.\nMargins decreased by 60 basis points to 20.4% as we invested in our technology platforms, products, and people as discussed last quarter.\nA higher tax rate in Q3 '21 partially offset our operating income growth.\nAdjusted earnings per share grew to $1.76, up 5% from Q3 '20.\nLet's examine the quarter's details, starting with recurring revenue growth.\nRecurring revenue grew 8%, driven by 7% organic growth, within our typical mid- to high single-digit growth range.\nWe're raising our full-year recurring revenue growth guidance to 8-10%, up from our previous projection of growth at the higher end of 3-6%.\nLooking at recurring revenue growth by business on Slide nine, our ICS segment grew 11% to $586 million.\nRegulatory revenues increased 20% to $290 million, driven by 20% equity record growth, higher mutual fund and ETF communications volumes, and new sales.\nWe expect strong regulatory revenue growth to continue in Q4, with current testing indicating 25% equity record growth.\nIssuer revenue growth is expected to slow as we begin to lap the increased VSM activity that started in Q4 '20.\nFund solutions revenue was flat, with data and analytics growth offset by lower interest income from custodied accounts.\nCustomer communications revenues were also flat, with digital product growth offset by lower print volumes.\nWe anticipate growth in data-driven solutions and customer communications to improve in Q4 as these headwinds ease.\nWealth and investment management revenues grew 7%, driven by new component sales and higher retail trading.\nCapital markets revenues decreased 1% as international sales growth was offset by lower license revenues.\nWe expect flat revenue growth to continue in Q4 '21 before improving in fiscal year '22.\nPage 10 shows more detail on volume trends.\nBroadridge's recurring revenue growth benefits from underlying volume growth, including stock record growth.\nOver the past decade, record growth across equity, mutual funds, and ETFs has grown 6-8%.\nRecently, equity record growth has accelerated, reaching 20% in Q3 '21, surpassing our January estimates.\nWe expect this growth trend to continue, reaching 25% in Q4 '21.\nThe expansion of mutual fund and ETF records accelerated to 7%, aligning more closely with our historical growth trends.\nWe anticipate a return to more moderate mid-single-digit growth across both equity and mutual fund/ETF records for fiscal year 2022, with stronger growth in the first half and more modest growth in the second half.\nBriefly addressing trade volumes, which are shown at the bottom of this slide.\nThis marks the fifth consecutive quarter of overall double-digit volume increase.\nThis increase reflects the heightened volatility and retail investor engagement over the past year, which remained robust well into the third quarter.\nMore recently, trading volatility decreased during the latter half of March, and we anticipate more challenging trading volume comparisons in Q4.\nLet's examine Slide 11 for a detailed look at the factors driving our recurring revenue.\nOrganic growth, at a robust 7%, continues to be the primary component of our recurring revenue growth, with new sales being the main driver, showing strong growth contributions from both ICS and GTO.\nWe have maintained our long-standing record of revenue retention above 97%.\nInternal growth contributed an additional three points as growth in ICS regulatory volumes outweighed the decline in GTO license revenue.\nWe have now fully incorporated all of our fiscal year 2020 acquisitions.\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect Itiviti to contribute three points to recurring revenue growth.\nOverall revenue growth this quarter was exceptionally strong at 11%, with distribution revenue contributing three points due to increased mailings corresponding with high record growth and increased event-driven activity.\nGoing forward, we anticipate the low to no-margin distribution revenue to decline over time as we focus on increasing higher-margin digital revenue across our governance business.\nEvent-driven communications remain a crucial part of our client offering.\nEvent-driven revenues have increased over the past four quarters to align more closely with our historical average of about $50 million per quarter, reaching $74 million in the third quarter, significantly higher than last year's unusually low $39 million.\nBroadridge benefited from an increase in mutual fund proxy activity as well as a rebound in proxy contest volumes and capital markets transactions.\nWe expect fiscal 2021 event-driven revenue to be more in line with the average we've seen over the past seven years.\nFor modeling purposes, we're assuming $50 million to $60 million of event-driven revenues in the fourth quarter.\nMoving to Slide 13.\nAdjusted operating income grew by 8%.\nOur adjusted operating income margin decreased by 60 basis points, reflecting ongoing investments in our technology platforms and product capabilities as highlighted in our previous quarterly call.\nThese investments, which support our long-term growth, have a short-term impact on margin expansion, but we remain on track to deliver approximately 50 basis points of margin expansion for the full year, aligning with our fiscal year 2021 guidance and 3-year growth objectives.\nThis approach of foregoing near-term margin expansion and consistently investing in our technology platforms and products to drive long-term sustainable recurring revenue growth will continue to be a key aspect of our business management strategy.\nAs a Chief Financial Officer focused on long-term growth, it's encouraging to see these types of investments across all our product lines, building momentum for future growth.\nOur $124 million in closed sales year-to-date are comparable to our performance over the same period last year.\nWe continue to see strong demand for our ICS solutions, including regulatory and issuer communications and data solutions.\nWe remain on track to achieve our full year guidance of $190 million to $235 million for closed sales, which implies a fourth quarter range of $66 million to $111 million.\nHistorically, closed sales performance in the last quarter of the year has been influenced by the timing of larger deals.\nA few larger signings could propel us to the top end of our guidance range, while delays could put us at the lower end.\nWe continue to feel positive about our recurring revenue backlog, which was 12% of our fiscal 2020 recurring revenues as of Q4 2020, providing excellent visibility into our top-line growth.\nTurning to capital allocation on the next slide.\nWe generated $136 million of free cash flow year-to-date, an increase of $54 million over the first nine months of fiscal year 2020, driven by higher earnings and strong working capital management.\nDuring the first nine months of the fiscal year, we invested $205 million in developing our industry platforms and an additional $71 million in capex and software spending.\nOur M&A investment through the first nine months of the year was zero, but that will change with our announced $2.5 billion acquisition of Itiviti, which I'll discuss shortly.\nEven after completing the Itiviti acquisition, Broadridge will maintain a balanced capital allocation policy, prioritizing internal investment, growing our dividend, M&A, and returning excess capital to shareholders.\nImportantly, we are committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating, which means we'll prioritize debt reduction over share repurchases and expect to limit ourselves to smaller tuck-in M&A opportunities over the next several quarters.\nGiven our strong free cash flow, we believe we can comfortably achieve our new 2.5 times leverage target by the end of fiscal year 2023.\nRegarding capital returns on the right side of the slide, our dividend has grown and remains in line with our historical 45% payout ratio.\nOn Slide 16, we are on track to close the Itiviti acquisition in the coming weeks.\nLet me provide some additional clarity about the expected impact Itiviti will have on our financial performance.\nStarting with fiscal year 2021, we expect Itiviti to add $25 billion to $30 billion or one point to our full-year recurring revenue growth, which equates to three points to our fourth quarter growth.\nThe acquisition is expected to be slightly dilutive to our adjusted earnings per share growth.\nIn fiscal year 2022, we expect Itiviti to add approximately $250 million or about eight points to our recurring revenue growth.\nWe anticipate the acquisition to be accretive by approximately two to three points or roughly $0.10 to $0.15 to adjusted earnings per share growth.\nPlease note that Itiviti's results in both fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2022 will be negatively impacted by the accounting treatment of acquired revenue, which will reduce revenue recognition by approximately $30 million in total, with two-thirds of that impact in fiscal 2022.\nThis revenue adjustment is incorporated in the figures I just shared.\nFinally, I want to reiterate the commentary I provided when we announced the deal, regarding the impact on our 3-year growth objectives.\nWe expect Itiviti to add 2.5 to three points to our 3-year recurring revenue growth CAGR and, after interest, more than two points to our 3-year adjusted earnings per share CAGR.\nTurning to guidance on Slide 17.\nWe are raising our outlook for fiscal 2021 recurring revenue growth to 8% to 10% from the higher end of 3% to 6%, including one point of growth from Itiviti.\nWe are raising our guidance for total revenue growth to 8% to 10% from the higher end of 1% to 4%.\nWe continue to expect our adjusted operating income margin to expand to approximately 18%, up from 17.5% in fiscal year 2020, as we balance near-term returns with continued investments to sustain long-term growth.\nWe expect adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% to 13%, up from the higher end of 6% to 10%, including a 1-point drag from Itiviti.\nLastly, as mentioned earlier, we continue to expect closed sales in the range of $190 million to $235 million.\nThe Broadridge Financial model is proving effective.\nWe are on track to deliver strong 8% to 10% recurring revenue growth.\nThis growth is enabling us to both invest and expand margins.\nSimultaneously, our robust free cash flow business model allows us to pursue balanced capital allocation, commit to a rising dividend, fund investments in our platform and products, and make a significant M&A investment to grow our capital markets franchise.\nThe result is that we're on track to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year financial objectives of 7% to 9% recurring revenue growth and 8% to 12% adjusted earnings per share growth.\nThis exemplifies how we manage our business to drive sustainable revenue growth, steady and consistent adjusted earnings per share growth, and historically top-quartile TSR.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm delighted to announce that we began the year on a high note, delivering another robust quarter.\nBoth divisions had a promising beginning.\nAs an organization, we generated $222 million in revenue and exceptional bottom-line results, with GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share or $0.87 per share on an adjusted basis.\nOur first-quarter cash flow generation was particularly impressive.\nWe continue to reduce our debt and maintain a strong balance sheet, allowing us to invest in future expansion.\nI'm especially impressed by our employees' continued performance throughout the pandemic.\nWhile adhering to our COVID-19 protocols and safety measures, our operational teams are implementing process improvements using Lean Kaizen.\nOur research and development teams are working on next-generation materials and products, and we continue to provide excellent delivery, quality, and service to our customers.\nOur Machine Clothing segment had its best quarterly top-line performance since 2015, with revenues increasing by nearly $12 million year-over-year and strong order activity in Q1, which is promising for this year.\nIn fact, apart from the secular decline in publication grades, Machine Clothing end-market demand in packaging, tissue, pulp, and engineered fabrics was all positive in Q1.\nIn addition to a solid backlog, our engineering teams are diligently developing new technology belts for our customers, which is crucial to our success and value proposition.\nWe have encountered some instances of isolated supply constraints affecting raw material pricing and delivery timing in this segment, and we continue to actively manage our supply chain, securing the materials necessary to meet our customers' demands.\nIn conclusion, our Machine Clothing segment continues to perform admirably.\nWe serve customers worldwide as the recognized global leader in supplying these critical consumable components to the paper industry.\nThis accomplishment is the result of disciplined execution of our long-term strategy.\nIn Aerospace, as we reported last quarter, our Engineered Composites segment will be working through a year of destocking excess inventory in the channels for LEAP, Boeing 787, and F-35 products.\nNevertheless, Engineered Composites is on track with their plan and prepared for the upturn as commercial air transport improves, inventory in the channels is consumed, and our production aligns with aircraft OEM production.\nWe're involved with promising platforms that we anticipate will recover, and we continue to view this as an opportunity to further enhance our operations.\nWe're prepared and eagerly anticipating the upturn.\nWe're collaborating closely with Safran to coordinate our operations as LEAP engine production ramps up, supporting the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX.\nWith domestic air travel recovering first and driving demand for narrow-body aircraft, the A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX are ideally positioned for the air transport recovery.\nIn Engineered Composites, looking beyond our current portfolio of programs, our opportunity pipeline is more robust than ever.\nWe're developing a wide range of capabilities to become the next-generation supplier of advanced composite materials.\nThis spans from our proprietary 3D woven composites currently used on LEAP engine fan blades and hand cases to automated fiber placement composite wing skins for Lockheed Martin's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to complex components on the Sikorsky CH-53K helicopter.\nWe continue to develop applications for the Wing of Tomorrow program with Airbus Industries, and we're increasing our investment this year in R&D projects with new customers and new platforms using advanced materials such as our 3D woven composites for a variety of exciting applications, including unmanned hypersonic and electric aircraft.\nThe combination of these efforts advances our goal to diversify and expand our customer base and enhance our material science capabilities.\nAs I mentioned, we have a robust balance sheet and strong free cash flow generation.\nThese allow us to maintain our investment in technology and customer programs that expand and strengthen our competitive position in both segments.\nOur primary focus for capital allocation is to invest in organic growth programs across both business segments and then to pursue acquisitions that align with our long-term strategy.\nOur reputation for reliability, service, and technical excellence is well-established in the Machine Clothing segment, and our brand is growing in aerospace as a dependable supplier and engineered materials partner, and we're optimistic about the long-term prospects in both segments.\nI will begin by discussing the quarterly results and then comment on the business outlook for the remainder of the year.\nThe company's total net sales for the first quarter decreased by 5.7% to $222.4 million compared to $235.8 million in the same period last year.\nWhen accounting for currency translation effects, net sales saw an 8.2% year-over-year decline in the quarter.\nIn the Machine Clothing segment, after adjusting for currency translation effects, net sales increased by 4.9% year-over-year, achieving the highest first-quarter revenue for the segment since 2015, as previously mentioned by Bill.\nGrowth was observed in all major product categories except for publication grades.\nPublication-related revenue decreased by 10% in the quarter, comprising only 16% of Machine Clothing's revenue for this period.\nRevenue in packaging and tissue grades, when adjusted for currency, showed high single-digit growth in the quarter, driven by strong orders received in the previous quarter.\nEngineered Composites net sales, after currency adjustments, decreased by $26.2 million, mainly due to significant reductions in LEAP and Boeing 787 program revenue, partially offset by growth in F-35 and CH-53K platforms.\nThe ASC LEAP program generated slightly under $27 million in revenue during the quarter, a small increase from the approximately $24 million in Q4 2020, but significantly lower than the roughly $39 million in Q1 of the previous year.\nThe company's first-quarter gross profit decreased by 1% to $88.5 million compared to the same period last year.\nOverall gross margin increased by 190 basis points from 37.9% to 39.8% of net sales.\nIn the Machine Clothing segment, gross margin decreased from 53.2% to 51.5% of net sales, mainly due to higher fixed costs and lower absorption.\nThe Engineered Composites segment's gross margin declined from 17% to 16.4% of net sales, primarily due to changes in estimated profitability of long-term contracts.\nIn the first quarter of the previous year, the company recognized a net favorable change in estimated profitability of long-term contracts of nearly $1 million.\nThis year, the net change in estimated profitability of long-term contracts for the first quarter was negligible.\nFirst-quarter selling, technical, general, and research expenses decreased from $49.2 million to $46.7 million compared to the same period last year, remaining relatively stable as a percentage of net sales at about 21%.\nThe reduction in expenses was attributed to the absence of severance costs from the previous year, lower additional accounts receivable reserves, and reduced travel expenses, partially offset by lower foreign exchange gains.\nAs anticipated and in line with full-year plans, R&D expenditures increased in both segments this quarter.\nThe company's total operating income rose to $41.8 million from $39.6 million in the same quarter of the previous year.\nMachine Clothing operating income increased by $3.2 million due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher STG&R expenses, while Engineered Composites operating income decreased by $4.7 million due to lower gross profit.\nOther income and expense in the quarter resulted in a net expense of $600,000, compared to an expense of $15.6 million in the same period last year.\nThe previous year's results included a significant charge related to a foreign currency revaluation loss.\nThe income tax rate for this quarter was 26.7%, compared to an unusually high 62.1% rate recorded last year.\nThe primary reason for the lower tax rate was the non-deductibility of the previous year's foreign currency revaluation loss.\nAdditionally, favorable income tax adjustments reduced income tax expense by $1.3 million this quarter, compared to an increase of $5.1 million from similar adjustments in the same quarter last year.\nThe company's net income for the quarter increased by $18.5 million to $27.6 million, up from $9.1 million last year.\nThe increase was mainly due to the absence of the previous year's foreign currency revaluation loss and higher operating income.\nEarnings per share rose to $0.85 this quarter from $0.28 last year.\nAfter adjusting for foreign currency revaluation gains and losses, restructuring expenses, CirComp acquisition and integration costs, and severance expenses in the prior year period, adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.87 this quarter from $0.78 last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew by 2.6% to $60.7 million for the most recent quarter compared to the same period last year.\nMachine Clothing adjusted EBITDA increased to $54.9 million or 37.1% of net sales, up from $49.2 million or 36% of net sales in the prior year quarter.\nEngineered Composites adjusted EBITDA decreased to $16.7 million or 22.6% of net sales, down from $22.1 million or 22.3% of net sales in the previous year.\nLet's examine our debt situation.\nOur overall debt, comprising long-term debt and its current maturities on our balance sheet, decreased from $398 million at the conclusion of Q4 2020 to $384 million by the end of Q1 2021.\nCash reduced by slightly more than $3 million in the quarter, leading to a net debt reduction exceeding $10 million.\nThe first quarter typically sees our lowest cash flow generation due to seasonal working capital fluctuations and quarterly incentive compensation payouts.\nThis year, we exceeded our usual expectations, generating $21.1 million in free cash flow (defined as operational cash flow minus capital expenditures), compared to a $19 million deficit in the same period last year, primarily due to AEC working capital improvements.\nWe were satisfied with the AEC segment's cash flow performance this quarter, which shifted from a significant deficit to substantial cash generation compared to the same period last year.\nQ1 capital expenditures in both years were around $13 million.\nOur current absolute net leverage ratio is 0.65, providing us with a robust balance sheet that allows us to pursue organic and acquisition-based growth opportunities.\nLooking ahead to the remainder of 2021, the Machine Clothing segment's outlook remains positive.\nMC orders decreased by 2% compared to the same quarter last year.\nHowever, it's worth noting that near the end of Q1 2020, orders surged from customers concerned about supply availability due to the emerging pandemic.\nAdditionally, our backlog position entering Q1 2021 was stronger than in 2020.\nOverall, we're confident about our previously stated revenue guidance for the segment, ranging between $570 million and $590 million.\nThe Machine Clothing segment delivered another strong quarter in terms of profitability, with adjusted EBITDA margins exceeding 37%.\nIt's important to note that some of the anticipated challenges for this year, particularly the return to normal travel levels and the absence of foreign exchange benefits we experienced mid-last year, have not yet affected our comparative results.\nNevertheless, we're pleased with our quarterly performance.\nWhile maintaining our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $195 million to $205 million for the segment, we're currently trending towards the higher end of that range.\nShifting focus to Engineered Composites.\nWe're observing the anticipated impact of 787 frames channel destocking in our top-line results.\nThis quarter, we generated less than $1 million in revenue from the 787 frames program, compared to over $12 million in the same quarter last year.\nAs mentioned earlier, the ASC LEAP program also declined by about $12 million during the quarter.\nThese two programs account for nearly all of the year-over-year decrease in AEC revenue we experienced this quarter.\nDue to these declines, the proportion of AEC revenue from defense programs increased to over 48% during the quarter.\nHowever, we'll still see the previously disclosed revenue impact from F-35 channel destocking in the second and third quarters.\nConsequently, I expect the defense program share of AEC revenues to decrease somewhat over the next couple of quarters.\nThis will also make the second and third quarters particularly challenging for the segment overall.\nThe year is unfolding as expected for the segment, and we're maintaining our guidance range of $275 million to $295 million for segment revenues.\nIn terms of profitability, our performance to date largely aligns with our expectations, and we're maintaining our AEC adjusted EBITDA guidance of $55 million to $65 million.\nWe're also maintaining all of our previously issued guidance ranges for company-level performance, except for GAAP earnings per share guidance, which has been updated to reflect non-GAAP adjustments recorded in Q1.\nCurrent guidance is as follows: revenue between $850 million and $890 million; effective income tax rate of 28% to 30%; depreciation and amortization between $70 million and $75 million; capital expenditures ranging from $50 million to $60 million; GAAP earnings per share between $2.38 and $2.78, slightly down from prior guidance of $2.40 to $2.80; adjusted earnings per share between $2.40 and $2.80; and adjusted EBITDA between $195 million and $220 million.\nOverall, we're very satisfied with how the year is progressing and hope to see continued movement towards normalcy in the remaining months.\nGreg, I'll hand it over to you.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:In this instance, core refers to specific financial metrics that don't include the effects of the recent S::can and ATI acquisitions.\nWe consider this benchmark crucial for comparing year-over-year performance.\nTo sum up, I'm satisfied with our quarterly performance, showing growth in sales and earnings per share, improved margins, and strong cash flow.\nThe most encouraging aspect was the record-breaking orders for our intelligent water solutions across both business segments, as customers embrace the underlying growth drivers of our digital offerings.\nThe widely reported and pervasive shortages in electronic components restricted our ability to convert these record orders into sales during the quarter.\nThis limited core sales growth but resulted in a record-high order backlog at the start of the second quarter, which is promising for the rest of the year.\nOur newly acquired businesses achieved strong top-line results, with expected lower net profitability due to purchase accounting factors.\nOverall, the integration of our acquisitions is progressing as anticipated.\nI'll discuss the current market conditions and our outlook later in the call.\nAs shown on Slide 4, total sales for the first quarter reached $117.8 million, up 9% from $108.5 million in the same period last year.\nIn the utility water segment, overall sales grew by 12%, reflecting the addition of the s::can and ATi acquisitions, which contributed about $10 million in sales for the quarter.\nExcluding acquisitions, core revenues in the utility water product line remained relatively unchanged year-over-year despite record orders, due to Internet and electronic component shortages and logistical challenges that constrained manufacturing output.\nThe scarcity of electronic components is a widespread market issue affecting numerous industries and is not unique to Badger Meter.\nWe saw growth in overall meter sales and BEACON software as a service revenue, and we benefited from strategic value-based pricing initiatives.\nAs Ken mentioned, we concluded the quarter with strong order momentum and a record backlog, giving us confidence in our future sales outlook.\nAs anticipated, the flow instrumentation sales rate of change improved sequentially from a 10% decline last quarter to a 3% year-over-year decrease, with most served end markets experiencing recovering demand trends.\nWe expect to return to overall growth moving forward due to improving demand conditions and easier comparisons.\nWe are pleased with the improvement in operating profit, achieving a 30 basis point increase in margins to 15.1% from 14.8% in the previous year.\nThe quarter's gross margin was 41.9%, a substantial 200 basis point increase year-over-year.\nThe core business delivered higher gross margins due to a favorable sales mix, particularly higher SaaS revenues, along with advantageous pricing, which continued to offset the impact of increased brass costs in the quarter.\nMargins also benefited from a favorable acquisition mix.\nFrom our previous discussion last quarter, we mentioned that the s::can and ATi water quality acquisitions had higher gross margins than average, along with higher SEA as a percentage of sales, resulting in a mid-teens net EBITDA range for the combined businesses.\nThe positive impact on gross margins from the acquisitions was lessened by the amortization of inventory fair value step-up in the quarter, but this issue is mostly resolved going forward.\nSince our last earnings call in late January, copper prices have continued to rise from an average of $3.60 per pound to nearly $4.20 per pound.\nThis increase potentially raises the estimated cost headwind for the year from $4-5 million to $7-8 million year-over-year if prices remain around $4.20 per pound.\nOur first quarter results demonstrate our successful implementation of appropriate pricing strategies to counter inflation, and we will continue to be flexible and proactive in addressing inflationary pressures.\nSEA expenses for the first quarter totaled $31.6 million, an increase of $4.3 million compared to the previous year.\nThis increase includes a full quarter of SEA spending for both s:can and ATi, as well as higher amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nExcluding the impact of acquisitions, the increase in personnel costs was more than offset by reductions in travel, trade show, and other pandemic-affected expenses, which we will begin to anniversary starting next quarter.\nThe income tax provision for the first quarter of 2021 was 22.2%, slightly lower than the previous year's rate of 25.6%.\nOverall, earnings per share for the first quarter of 2021 were $0.47, representing a 15% increase from the prior year's earnings per share of $0.41.\nWorking capital as a percentage of sales decreased to 24.3% from 25.5% at the end of the calendar year, despite the addition of ATi, primarily due to working capital initiatives implemented during the quarter.\nOur free cash flow of $28.8 million remained consistent with the previous year.\nWe allocated $44 million, net of acquired cash, for ATi in early January and currently have approximately $51 million in cash on our balance sheet.\nCombined with our untapped revolver, we have significant financial flexibility to execute our growth strategies.\nRegarding Slide 5, while we don't provide guidance, we believe it's important to highlight the increased unevenness we expect to see in our top line as the year progresses.\nI'd like to briefly discuss comparative sales data to provide a clear picture of the various factors influencing quarterly sales growth trends and share our optimism for our results for the remainder of the year and beyond.\nThis chart shows the quarterly sales growth rate of our core business in 2020 and the first quarter of 2021.\nAs indicated by the various call-out boxes, we experienced specific dynamics in 2020 due to COVID and now in the first quarter of 2021 that we need to consider when looking at the rest of the year's comparisons.\nSpecifically, we anticipate an easier comparison for our upcoming Q2 versus the 2020 COVID lockdowns, combined with a portion of the record backlog converting to sales given the expectation of modest improvement in electronic supply.\nAs we enter Q3, we'll face a challenging comparison based on the post-COVID lockdown order rate and manufacturing recovery from last year.\nWe maintain strong momentum and robust bid activity, order rates, and backlog, aligning with our long-term projection for mid-single-digit growth.\nAcquisitions are performing as expected, matching their historical growth patterns, and our teams are implementing processes to achieve future growth synergies.\nLet's discuss our future outlook.\nThe fundamental market drivers for smart water solutions remain strong, with COVID highlighting the advantages of AMi for addressing common utility challenges like remote work efficiency and automated consumer engagement.\nIncreasing concerns about water quality and security are driving greater interest in our real-time digital solutions.\nRecent climate events in Texas and other Southern U.S. states demonstrated the benefits of our cellular AMi solution, which remained operational due to the critical nature of cellular networks, allowing utilities to obtain real-time data crucial for identifying potential issues and maintaining safe water supply.\nInvestors frequently inquire about the potential impact of the Biden administration's infrastructure proposal, particularly the $56 billion allocated for upgrading water systems and an additional $10 billion for rural small water systems.\nThe underlying trends driving demand for our digital water solutions are already evident and growing, with potential stimulus investments possibly accelerating these drivers but not necessary for achieving our long-term growth plans.\nAs we've mentioned recently, the widespread availability of vaccinations is most relevant to near-term demand patterns.\nIt's uncertain whether utilities might pause spending to consider the implications of stimulus proposals, but if such a pause occurs, it would likely be temporary and not affect our long-term structural growth.\nWe will continue to focus on the aspects of our business within our control.\nOur teams have effectively managed value-based pricing initiatives to mitigate increased brass costs, while our sourcing and supply chain teams are actively addressing the challenges of electronics shortages and logistics bottlenecks.\nAlthough these challenges are not unique to Badger Meter, we are confident in our ability to support customers despite these obstacles.\nWe will maintain our focus on managing working capital and generating cash flow to support investments in both organic and acquisition-driven growth.\nOur primary goal remains enhancing our product and software offerings for water-related markets and applications globally.\nWe have established our first greenhouse gas intensity reduction target as part of our ongoing ESG efforts.\nThis 15% intensity reduction goal by 2030 was developed through a strategic initiative to capture baseline greenhouse gas data globally and identify opportunities to reduce energy consumption and other emissions.\nWe will set annual goals to monitor progress and report on our efforts in our biennial sustainability report.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We value your participation today.\nThis is our internal method for evaluating and overseeing these divisions, and it will now be our external reporting approach as well.\nThe total revenue from intersegment transactions between divisions and Protiviti is also individually reported.\nWe are delighted that the results from the third quarter and early October show steady weekly and monthly progressive improvements across our divisions.\nProtiviti achieved another remarkable quarter, marking its 12th successive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth, capitalizing on a robust pipeline of varied service offerings, with particularly strong growth in combined solutions with our staffing operations.\nWe are also content with the quarter-to-quarter growth in our staffing divisions, particularly in our permanent placement and OfficeTeam sectors.\nThis year continues to be unlike any other.\nI'm incredibly impressed by the ingenuity and dedication shown by all our employees as we continue to provide high-quality service to our clients and candidates.\nOverall company revenues for the third quarter of 2020 were $1.19 billion, representing a 23% decrease from the same quarter last year on a reported basis and a 24% decrease on an adjusted basis.\nThe earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.67, compared to $1.01 in the same quarter of the previous year.\nOperating activities generated $139 million in cash flow during the quarter, while capital expenditures amounted to $7 million.\nIn September, we paid a cash dividend of $0.34 per share to our shareholders of record, totaling $38 million in cash disbursement.\nWe also bought back approximately 450,000 shares during the quarter for $24 million.\nWe have authorization to repurchase 1 million shares under our Board-approved stock buyback program.\nThe company's return on invested capital was 25.8% in the third quarter.\nLet's begin by discussing revenue.\nAs Keith mentioned, global revenues for the third quarter totaled $1.190 billion.\nThis represents a 23% decrease from the same quarter of the previous year on a reported basis and a 24% decrease on an adjusted basis.\nAdditionally, on an adjusted basis, third quarter staffing revenues declined by 31% compared to the previous year.\nU.S. Staffing revenues amounted to $666 million, down 32% from the previous year.\nNon-U.S. Staffing revenues were $203 million, showing a 29% decrease year-over-year on an adjusted basis.\nWe operate 326 staffing locations worldwide, including 88 locations across 17 countries outside the United States.\nThe third quarter had 64.3 billing days, compared to 64.1 billing days in the same quarter of the previous year.\nThe current fourth quarter has 61.7 billing days, which is the same as the fourth quarter of last year.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations during the third quarter resulted in a $4 million increase in reported year-over-year staffing revenues.\nThis boosted our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 0.3 percentage points.\nNow, let's examine Protiviti's results more closely.\nGlobal revenues for Protiviti in the third quarter were $321 million.\nOf this total, $260 million came from U.S. operations, while $61 million was generated from operations outside the United States.\nOn an adjusted basis, Protiviti's global third quarter revenues increased by 6% compared to the same period last year, with U.S. Protiviti revenues growing by 10%.\nNon-U.S. revenues decreased by 8% on an adjusted basis.\nExchange rates caused Protiviti's year-over-year revenues to increase by $2 million and raised its year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.7 percentage points.\nProtiviti and its independently owned member firms provide services to clients through a network of 86 locations across 28 countries.\nEmployees manage their account balances' investments under these strategies, with the company making cash contributions to an investment trust in line with their directions.\nThe company's deferred compensation obligation to employees fluctuates in tandem with realized and unrealized investment gains and losses.\nNevertheless, the value of the associated investment trust assets also changes by an equal and opposite amount, resulting in no net expense for the company.\nIn the future, changes in the company's deferred compensation obligations mentioned earlier will still be included in SG&A or direct cost for Protiviti.\nHowever, the corresponding changes in investment trust assets will be shown separately, below SG&A and outside of operating income.\nThis adjustment does not alter the previously reported pre-tax or after-tax income or cash flows.\nMoving forward, we will substitute the discussion of consolidated operating income with the non-GAAP metric of combined segment income.\nThis will be determined by adjusting consolidated income before income taxes for interest income and amortization of intangible assets.\nLet's now examine gross margin.\nThe third quarter gross margin in our temporary and consultant staffing operations was 37.5% of relevant revenues, compared to 37.9% in the same quarter of the previous year.\nThe year-over-year decrease in gross margin percentage is mainly attributed to reduced conversion revenues.\nPermanent placement revenues accounted for 10% of consolidated staffing revenues in the third quarter, down from 10.7% in the same quarter of the previous year.\nWhen combined with temporary and consultant gross margin, overall staffing gross margin fell by 80 basis points to 43.8% compared to the third quarter of the previous year.\nProtiviti's gross margin in the third quarter was $87 million, or 27.1% of Protiviti revenues.\nThis includes $3.4 million, or 1.1% of Protiviti revenues, in deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment accounts.\nIn the same quarter of the previous year, Protiviti's gross margin was $88 million, or 29.4% of Protiviti revenues, including $200,000 of deferred compensation expense related to investment trust activities.\nCompany-wide SG&A costs represented 32.8% of global revenues in the third quarter, up from 31.2% in the same quarter of the previous year.\nDeferred compensation expenses related to increases in underlying trust investments raised SG&A as a percentage of revenue by 1.9% in the current third quarter, compared to 0.1% in the same quarter of the previous year.\nStaffing SG&A costs were 40.2% of staffing revenues in the third quarter, up from 34.8% in the third quarter of 2019.\nStaffing SG&A costs included deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets of 2.6% and 0.1% respectively.\nThe rise in staffing SG&A as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to continued negative leverage resulting from declining revenues.\nProtiviti's third quarter SG&A costs were 13% of Protiviti revenues, down from 16.2% in the same period of the previous year.\nThe quarter's operating income was $77 million, including $26 million of deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying investment trust assets.\nConsequently, combined segment income for the third quarter was $103 million.\nCombined segment margin was 8.6%.\nOur staffing divisions generated third quarter segment income of $54 million, with a segment margin of 6.2%.\nProtiviti's segment income for the third quarter was $49 million, with a segment margin of 15.2%.\nOur third quarter tax rate was 26%, down from 28% a year ago.\nThe lower third quarter tax rate is mainly due to annual adjustments made to reconcile our tax accounts with the previous year's tax returns as filed.\nOur nine-month year-over-year tax rate of 28% aligns with our full-year expectations.\nRegarding accounts receivable, at the end of the third quarter, accounts receivable stood at $690 million, with implied days sales outstanding (DSO) at 52.3 days.\nBefore we discuss fourth quarter guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends observed in the third quarter and thus far in October, all adjusted for currency and billing days.\nDuring the third quarter, our temporary and consultant staffing divisions experienced a 29.3% decrease in September revenues compared to the previous year, slightly better than the 30.7% decline for the entire quarter.\nThe initial two weeks of October saw a 27% reduction in revenues compared to the same timeframe in the previous year.\nSeptember's permanent placement revenues declined by 30.1% compared to September 2019.\nThis is an improvement from the 35.7% decrease observed for the full quarter.\nPermanent placement revenues for the first three weeks of October were down 31% compared to the corresponding period in 2019.\nWe are sharing this information to give you an understanding of the trends we observed during the third quarter and into October.\nHowever, these are very short periods of time.\nWe advise against drawing extensive conclusions from this data.\nWith this in mind, we present the following projections for the fourth quarter.\nWe anticipate revenues between $1.155 billion and $1.255 billion, with earnings per share ranging from $0.55 to $0.75.\nThe middle point of our forecast suggests a 22% year-over-year revenue decline on an adjusted basis, including Protiviti.\nThe key financial assumptions for these estimates' midpoint are as follows.\nYear-on-year revenue growth: staffing down 27% to 30%, Protiviti up 5% to 7%, overall down 21% to 23%.\nGross margin percentages: Temporary and Consultant Staffing 37% to 38%, Protiviti 27% to 29%, overall 39% to 40%.\nSG&A as a percentage of revenues, excluding deferred compensation investment impacts: staffing 36% to 38%, Protiviti 14% to 16%, overall 30% to 32%.\nSegment income: Staffing 6% to 8%, Protiviti 12% to 15%, overall 8% to 10%.\nWe anticipate our tax rate to be between 27% and 29%, with 113 million shares.\nOur guidance is restricted to a single quarter.\nAs demonstrated by the growth in our newly reported inter-segment revenues.\nThe collaboration between Protiviti and our staffing operations continues to be an expanding source of growth for our company.\nWe have observed particular strength in our services to government and financial services clients.\nFurthermore, we've seen increased demand for services and solutions in cloud technology, cybersecurity, data privacy, and digital transformation as enterprise clients continue to invest strategically in these areas.\nThe significant cost reductions implemented in the second quarter have positively impacted the third quarter and will continue to benefit future periods.\nRemote and hybrid work models will persist long after the pandemic no longer necessitates them.\nTalent acquisition is no longer restricted by time zones or geographical locations.\nOur global talent network and cutting-edge technology tools enable us to provide ideal matches for clients and candidates, regardless of their location.\nWhile economic uncertainty persists due to the ongoing pandemic, there are reasons for optimism.\nAs the fourth quarter progresses, we should have clarity on the nature, timing, and amount of any additional fiscal stimulus.\nMedical solutions for the COVID-19 virus are getting closer to reality, and the NFIB continues to report improving trends in the small business sector.\nA recent study revealed that over half of small businesses are actively hiring or attempting to hire, with the vast majority reporting few or no qualified applicants.\nWe remain confident in our positioning for future growth, backed by the unique strengths of our brands, people, technology, and professional business model.\nWe request that you ask only one question and a single follow-up if necessary.\nIf time permits, we'll return to you for additional questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:blackhillscorp.com, in the Investor Relations section.\nLinn Evans, President and CEO, and Rich Kinzley, Senior VP and CFO, will be leading our quarterly earnings call.\nWhile we believe our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, actual outcomes may vary significantly.\nI'll start with Slide 4, which outlines our main accomplishments in the first quarter.\nSafety is the top concern for Black Hills Corporation, which is closely tied to reliability in our predominantly cold climate service areas.\nI'm pleased with our team's outstanding and adaptable performance.\nThe Black Hills team, along with our electrical and gas systems and our power plants, performed admirably during the unprecedented Winter Storm Uri.\nWe successfully met extraordinary demand, ensuring our customers' safety during life-threatening cold conditions across our service area.\nOur diverse mix of power generation resources, including dependable and flexible generation capacity, allowed us to avoid the rolling blackouts experienced elsewhere in the country, even as our South Dakota electric utility met a new winter peak demand.\nOur success in serving customers during Winter Storm Uri wasn't accidental, but rather the result of our constant focus on customer needs and ongoing investments in safe, reliable, and resilient infrastructure.\nWinter Storm Uri demonstrated the critical importance of energy in our daily lives.\nThe storm emphasized the need for safe, reliable natural gas utilities and dependable generation capacity when our customers faced temperatures as low as 27 degrees below zero, breaking numerous all-time low temperature records across our communities.\nFor instance, Lincoln, Nebraska experienced 11 consecutive days of below-zero temperatures in February, with lows in the negative 20s.\nRecognizing the vital importance of natural gas during these weather events, we're pleased that four of our six gas states - Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, and Wyoming - recently passed legislation protecting our customers' freedom to choose their preferred energy type.\nLast week, we announced our membership in the ONE Future Coalition of gas utility companies voluntarily working to reduce emissions.\nThis is in addition to our previously announced participation in the EPA's Methane Challenge as we strengthen our commitment to modernize and improve the resilience of our pipelines.\nMoving on with Slide 4.\nWe continue to be encouraged by the steady growth in new customer connections driven by population migration into our service areas.\nOur team also demonstrated our adaptability and the strength of our financing strategy during the first quarter.\nGiven the unprecedented and unforeseen market pricing for natural gas in February, we promptly bolstered our liquidity with additional short-term financing by securing an $800 million term loan on favorable terms.\nThis term loan and other ongoing cash conservation measures ensure our ability to continue funding our robust capital investment program.\nSlide 5 presents our financial outlook.\nExcluding these storm costs, our financial results were otherwise strong.\nDuring the February storm, we immediately implemented expense and cash management initiatives and are pursuing other opportunities to mitigate the storm's impact.\nRich will provide details in his financial update.\nGiven these ongoing initiatives and the opportunities we see for the rest of this year, our 2021 earnings guidance remains unchanged.\nWe also reaffirmed our 2022 earnings guidance and remain confident in our long-term growth targets, including 5% to 7% earnings growth for 2023 through 2025 and at least 5% annual dividend growth.\nSlide 6 illustrates our disciplined growth plan with potential for upside.\nWe plan to invest more than $3 billion in capital through 2025 and expect to identify and develop additional projects.\nWe're also developing other growth opportunities, including less capital-intensive projects such as data center load additions and innovative customer solutions, including renewables and other technologies.\nAs mentioned earlier, we're observing accelerated population migration into our service territories and are increasingly confident this trend will continue.\nThe final item on this slide focuses on cost discipline and continuous improvement.\nThese are long-term initiatives aimed at creating leaner, more efficient processes and utilizing new technologies to improve daily operations.\nAdvancing to Slide 7.\nWe've achieved advancements in our regulatory endeavors.\nOur group is completing three rate review applications for submission in Q2.\nWe intend to submit a fresh rate review for Colorado Gas, and we recently concluded a hearing with the commission about our ongoing safety and integrity investment rider.\nIn Kansas, we're submitting our first rate review in seven years, which renews our five-year system safety and integrity investment rider.\nIn Iowa, we plan to submit our first rate review in over ten years, including a request for a new system safety and integrity investment rider.\nBesides our regular regulatory activities, we're discussing with regulators about recovering costs related to Storm Uri.\nProceeding to Slide 8.\nFor our electric utilities, resource planning is a crucial focus as we determine the best way to reliably and cost-effectively meet growing customer demand and reach our greenhouse gas emission targets.\nWe aim to submit our integrated resource plan for our jointly operated South Dakota and Wyoming electric systems in early July.\nWe're analyzing various scenarios to meet our increasing customer demand.\nInitial modeling, which is subject to change, suggests a need for additional renewable energy, dispatchable natural gas generation, battery storage, more transmission, and upgraded pipeline capacity.\nThese scenarios consider customer impacts while achieving our greenhouse gas emission goals.\nWe're also modeling a scenario that takes into account the Biden Administration's economy-wide greenhouse gas emission goals and its cost to customers.\nI'm enthusiastic about this process as we seek to provide more clarity on these future opportunities in the coming months.\nLastly, on Slide 9, we're well-positioned as an integrated utility with strong long-term growth prospects.\nWe're implementing our customer-focused strategy and are confident about our future.\nSlide 11 provides a summary of earnings per share for the first quarter.\nWe achieved earnings per share of $1.54 compared to $1.59 as adjusted in Q1 2020.\nThe effects of Winter Storm Uri overshadowed what were otherwise robust financial results.\nThe net storm impacts were $0.15 per share, which more than offset weather favorability and the benefit of new rates.\nWe estimate that weather improved earnings by $0.07 per share compared to normal.\nFor the quarter, heating degree days were 4% above normal at our electric utilities and 3% above normal at our gas utilities, mainly due to extreme cold in February, counterbalancing warmer than normal weather in January and March.\nCompared to Q1 2020, the weather impact was favorable by $0.11 per share, given a warmer than normal first quarter heating season last year.\nSlide 12 outlines our approach to addressing Winter Storm Uri impacts.\nIn the first quarter, we incurred roughly $571 million in additional costs to serve our customers.\nThis includes $559 million of deferred utility fuel costs recorded as a regulatory asset.\nWe've had productive discussions with regulators and have filed or expect to file our remaining storm-related regulatory recovery requests in the second quarter.\nWe've already submitted requests for our gas utilities in Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska and Wyoming and for South Dakota Electric.\nRecovery plans differ by state, with proposed recovery in some states within one year while other states may take up to five years or longer.\nIn the first quarter, we recorded storm-related net expenses of $12.55 million pre-tax or $0.15 per share after tax.\nThe largest contributor was $8.2 million of non-recoverable incremental gas purchase costs at Black Hills Energy Services, which serves 52,000 of our regulated utility customers in Nebraska and Wyoming through the Choice Gas program.\nThis program allows customers to select their gas provider and is supported by a hedging and procurement plan based on historical demand and forecasts.\nDelivering Choice Gas services to our customers is a minor, low-risk, and lucrative segment of our operations.\nNevertheless, it was affected by the exceptional market rates and heightened demand resulting from storm Uri.\nIn our electricity operations, the $3.2 million impact on our wholesale power margin sharing was partly counterbalanced by $1.7 million in power generation advantages.\nWe also faced $2.1 million in fuel expenses that fall outside our regulatory cost recovery systems, mainly in Montana, where we provide services to two industrial clients under contractual agreements.\nThis minor segment of our utilities typically carries very little risk but was exposed to the same extraordinary market pricing and increased demand.\nIn February, we promptly implemented tactics to counteract the $0.15 per share earnings impact from Uri throughout the rest of the year through expense control, ongoing wholesale power marketing possibilities, and identified regulatory proceedings.\nSlide 13 depicts the factors influencing the year-over-year change in net income for the first quarter.\nAll figures presented are post-tax.\nThe primary factors compared to the previous year were gross margin improvements in our gas utilities, offset by Storm Uri impacts.\nNatural gas margin increases were attributed to favorable weather conditions and new base rates and rider recovery on investments for customers.\nElectric utility margins were lower than the prior year, mainly due to tax reform benefits that we passed on to our Colorado Electric customers.\nWe credited over $9 million of tax reform benefits, which reduced revenue and had a corresponding income tax benefit, resulting in minimal overall impact on first quarter results.\nThe additional quarter-over-quarter tax benefits shown on the far right were primarily related to additional production tax credits from the Corriedale Wind Project that began operations in late 2020.\nO&M was affected by higher employee costs and outside services.\nOutside services increased over the prior year due to higher Director fees linked to our stock price performance, which was much stronger in Q1 this year compared to last year.\nThe change in other income expense over the prior year was influenced by market impacts on non-qualified deferred compensation expense.\nAdditional first quarter details on segment earnings can be found in the Appendix.\nSlide 14 illustrates our financial position in terms of capital structure, credit ratings, and financial flexibility.\nWe have a manageable debt maturity profile and are devoted to maintaining our solid investment grade credit ratings.\nAt the end of April, we had approximately $530 million of available liquidity on our revolving credit facility.\nIn February, we secured an $800 million, nine-month term loan to strengthen our liquidity in response to the increased fuel costs related to Storm Uri.\nWe repaid $200 million of that term loan at quarter-end and are developing the appropriate refinancing strategy for the remaining $600 million as we finalize Storm Uri recovery mechanisms.\nI anticipate we will issue debt with a three to five year term in the second or third quarter to align with the recovery period of the majority of the deferred Storm Uri fuel costs.\nNew debt and deferred recovery of fuel costs temporarily increased our debt to total capitalization ratio to 62% at the end of March.\nAs we recover storm costs, repay debt, and implement our equity program, we expect to reduce the debt to total capitalization ratio and continue to aim for a debt to total cap ratio in the mid 50s.\nOur equity issuance expectations remain unchanged.\nWe plan to issue $100 million to $120 million in 2021 and $60 million to $80 million in 2022 through our at-the-market equity offering program.\nWe will continue to assess financing needs as we finalize our storm cost recovery proposals.\nTurning to our dividend on Slide 15.\nIn 2020, we proudly celebrated 50 consecutive years of annual dividend increases, one of the longest records in our industry.\nSince 2016, we have increased our dividend at an average annual rate of 6.6%.\nLooking ahead, we anticipate raising our dividend by more than 5% annually through 2025 while maintaining our 50% to 60% payout target.\nWe are uniquely positioned as an integrated utility in favorable jurisdictions with a complementary business mix across stable and growing territories.\nWe remain well-positioned both operationally and financially to serve all our stakeholders effectively.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We will also examine specific non-GAAP financial metrics and provide comparisons between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.\nToday's participants include our CEO Steve Strah, Vice Chairperson John Somerhalder, and CFO Jon Taylor, along with other executives available for questions later.\nOur operating earnings of $0.59 per share exceeded the upper limit of our projected earnings range.\nThese impressive operational outcomes reflect our customer-focused investment approach in regulated distribution and transmission, strong financial management, and increased weather-adjusted demand from residential customers.\nWe're satisfied with our performance and the significant advancements we've made in transforming FirstEnergy and positioning our company for the future.\nWe've implemented crucial measures to establish a top-tier compliance program while identifying and pursuing initiatives to create long-term value for all stakeholders.\nOur leadership is dedicated to exemplifying the behavior and humility needed to rebuild trust with our stakeholders.\nWe're eager to continue this work and achieve milestones that will demonstrate our progress.\nI'll begin our call with an update on the DOJ and other investigations related to House Bill 6, followed by John Somerhalder's brief discussion on board activities and our compliance program's progress.\nWe announced yesterday that we've reached an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Ohio to resolve the DOJ investigation into FirstEnergy.\nThis deferred prosecution agreement was submitted to federal court.\nUnder the three-year deferred prosecution agreement, we've committed to pay $230 million from our available cash.\nHalf of this amount will go to the U.S. Treasury, while the other half will benefit utility customers through the Ohio Development Service Agency.\nNone of the payment will be recovered from customers.\nWe also accepted the government's single charge of honest services wire fraud, which will be dismissed if we comply with all agreement terms.\nAs per the agreement, we will provide regular updates to the government about our compliance program, internal controls, policies, and ongoing efforts to build on the comprehensive compliance initiatives implemented this year.\nThe behavior that occurred at our company was inappropriate and unacceptable.\nOur Board, management team, and entire organization have worked extensively and are committed to making necessary changes to move forward.\nOur progress on these efforts, along with the DPA, shows we're making significant strides in navigating this period and are positioned to move forward as a stronger, integrity-focused organization.\nWe will maintain full cooperation with ongoing investigations, audits, and related matters as we work to resolve these issues and rebuild trust with our employees, customers, regulators, and investors.\nWe are deeply focused on cultivating a strong culture of compliance and ethics and ensuring robust processes are in place to prevent similar incidents in the future.\nIn May, we conducted our first compliance town hall with employees to discuss the importance of compliance, ethics, and integrity at FirstEnergy and the significance of fostering a culture where everyone feels comfortable speaking up about potential issues.\nFollowing the town hall, our management team has addressed employee questions and concerns, and we're committed to continuing this dialogue and engagement.\nNext week, we plan to hold another town hall meeting to introduce our updated mission statement, emphasizing the role of uncompromising integrity as the foundation of FirstEnergy's identity and business strategies.\nWe will also update our core values to better reflect the importance of integrity alongside safety, diversity, equity and inclusion, performance excellence, and stewardship.\nThese values will be integrated into our practices and processes, becoming an integral part of our work culture.\nAdditionally, we've revised our code of business conduct, which John Somerhalder will discuss shortly.\nWe continue to strengthen our leadership team with two new hires: Michael Montaque as Vice President of Internal Audit and Soubhagya Parija as Vice President and Chief Risk Officer, effective August 16.\nThese experienced professionals represent another crucial step in enhancing our key internal functions, and I'm confident they'll help develop best-in-class audit and enterprise risk programs.\nJohn Somerhalder will now provide an update on board matters and other aspects of our compliance program.\nAfterward, I'll return to discuss FE Forward and review some regulatory updates.\nOur progress with the DOJ builds upon the significant measures we've taken to enhance our Board, strengthen our leadership team, establish a top-tier compliance program, and substantially modify our approach to political engagement as we work to regain stakeholder trust.\nI'll begin by reviewing recent Board changes.\nJesse Lynn and Andrew Teno became Board members from Icahn Capital in March, but await regulatory approval for voting rights.\nFERC recently approved our request for voting rights.\nWe have informed the Maryland Commission about FERC's recent decision, and the process there is ongoing.\nAt our Annual Meeting in May, Melvin Williams joined the Board, and we recently added two more independent directors, Lisa Winston Hicks and Paul Kaleta.\nThe Special Litigation Committee consists of Jesse, Melvin, Lisa, and Paul.\nThis committee has complete and binding power to decide the company's actions regarding the ongoing shareholder derivative litigation.\nThe Board has disbanded the Independent Review Committee following the formation of the Special Litigation Committee.\nThe company's internal investigation has shifted from proactive to responsive, and given the extensive review and actions taken by the independent review committee, the Board has also dissolved that committee.\nThe Board and management's proactive measures over the past year have enhanced our governance and positioned us well to address the material weakness in our tone at the top by the time we release our fourth quarter results.\nWe've been discussing our efforts to improve our ethics and compliance program and reinforce our values with all employees over the past few quarters.\nWe continue to make steady progress in this area, with our new, more centralized compliance organization taking shape under Antonio Fernandez, who joined as our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer in April.\nWe released our updated internal Code of Business Conduct, \"The Power of Integrity,\" yesterday, which will be supported by ongoing education on behaviors and the importance of reporting ethical violations, and we have continued to strengthen our policies, processes, and internal controls, including those related to 501(c)(4)s, other corporate engagement and advocacy, and business disbursements.\nWhile transforming our culture and rebuilding trust with all stakeholders will be long-term efforts, this team has begun building a stronger company founded on ethics, honesty, and accountability.\nThe comprehensive evaluation and adjustment of our ethics and compliance program has been running alongside FE Forward.\nOur transformational effort to increase value for all stakeholders by investing in modern and distinctive experiences will improve our business practices, and we have integrated our efforts to mature our ethics and compliance program into the FE Forward work.\nThis approach allows us to use FE Forward's rigor to implement changes quickly and efficiently, embed ethics and compliance into our operational culture, and ensure a sustainable, comprehensive transformation well into the future.\nFE Forward has entered its third phase, which involves full-scale execution of our implementation plans.\nThe program is expected to generate value and resilience, including cumulative free cash flow improvements of about $800 million from 2021 through 2023 and annual run rate capex efficiencies of approximately $300 million in 2024 and beyond.\nWe also expect the program to build on our strong operations and business fundamentals as we reinvest some of our efficiencies into strategic opportunities to better serve our customers and support a smarter and cleaner electric grid.\nTo ensure our organizational structure supports these improvements long-term, we reorganized our business units last month around five pillars: Finance and Strategy, Human Resources and Corporate Services, Legal, Operations, and Customer Experience.\nThis new structure reflects a best-in-class model and promotes operational excellence, clear decision-making, accountability, and reduced complexity.\nAs part of this new organizational structure, we've established a customer experience function to truly understand our customers' evolving expectations and develop solutions that benefit them.\nWe've also created a new position, Vice President of Transformation, to guide the FE Forward initiatives across our company while developing customer-focused emerging technology opportunities.\nThe development of executable plans, a best-in-class compliance program, and crucial organizational changes will position the company to move forward in a positive, sustainable direction.\nI'll now briefly review recent regulatory matters, starting with Ohio.\nIn July, the PUCO approved our filing to return about $27 million to our Ohio utility customers, representing all revenues previously collected through the decoupling mechanism plus interest.\nOur Ohio utilities have submitted supplemental testimony in the quadrennial review of our ESP IV.\nWe are dedicated to collaborating with various parties in Ohio to resolve the outstanding issues.\nWe held our first comprehensive collaborative meeting on March 31 and have since received additional feedback from participants.\nWe are preparing for another collaborative meeting in the coming weeks.\nWe are also proceeding with regulatory audits in Ohio, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and at the FERC.\nIn April, the New Jersey BPU approved JCP&L's three-year $203 million energy efficiency and conservation plan, which includes a return on certain costs and the ability to recover lost distribution revenues.\nRegarding our financial results, we are pleased with our strong performance in the first half of the year.\nWe are reaffirming our 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share and expect to be in the top half of that range.\nWe are providing guidance for the third quarter, projecting earnings between $0.70 and $0.80 per share.\nOur priority remains implementing our strategies, controlling our expenses, and capitalizing on our current success.\nWe are making significant strides in transforming FirstEnergy to align with our principles and create enduring value for all our stakeholders.\nOn the previous day, we reported GAAP earnings of $0.11 per share and operating earnings of $0.59 per share for the second quarter of 2021.\nAs Steve pointed out, this surpassed the upper limit of our projected range.\nThe second quarter of 2021 included exceptional items such as investigation-related expenses, including the impact of the deferred prosecution agreement, along with regulatory fees and changes in state tax legislation.\nComparing our distribution business results for the second quarter of 2021 to 2020, we saw growth from our investment programs, rate increases, and reduced expenses, mainly due to the absence of pandemic-related costs from last year's second quarter, partially counterbalanced by the discontinuation of Ohio decoupling and lost distribution revenues from the second quarter of 2020, which we ceased collecting earlier this year.\nDistribution deliveries increased both in actual terms and when adjusted for weather, compared to the second quarter of 2020 when many pandemic-related restrictions were fully in effect.\nHowever, the changes in customer usage patterns resulted in no significant year-over-year impact on earnings.\nWeather-adjusted residential sales in the second quarter of 2021 were 6% lower than the same period last year when many of our customers were under strict lockdown orders.\nNevertheless, when examining trends, weather-adjusted residential usage over recent quarters has averaged about 4% higher than pre-pandemic levels, with the second quarter of this year being nearly 8% higher than the weather-adjusted usage observed in the second quarter of 2019.\nWe believe that more permanent work-from-home arrangements could influence our long-term load forecast, and we will closely monitor whether this structural shift in our residential customer class persists.\nWeather-adjusted deliveries to commercial customers rose by 8% and industrial load increased by 11% compared to the second quarter of 2020.\nDespite the increase in commercial activity this spring, weather-adjusted demand in this customer class still lags behind pre-pandemic levels by an average of about 6%.\nRegarding the industrial class, we are encouraged by the steady recovery in demand over the past year.\nIn fact, this quarter's industrial load was only slightly below that of the second quarter of 2019.\nWe continue to observe higher load from the shale gas industry, but this was offset by lower load in other industrial sectors such as steel, automotive, and mining, which have not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels.\nIn our Regulated Transmission segment, the impact of higher transmission investment at MAIT and ATSI related to our Energizing the Future program more than offset the higher net financing costs in the second quarter of 2021, primarily related to our revolving credit facility borrowings.\nOur transmission investments led to a year-over-year rate base growth of 7%.\nThe Corporate segment results reflect the absence of discrete tax benefits recognized in the second quarter of 2020, as well as increased interest expense.\nFor the first half of 2021, operating earnings were $1.28 per share, compared to $1.23 per share in the first half of 2020.\nThis increase resulted from continued investments in our transmission and distribution systems, weather-related sales, and lower expenses, and consistent with our second quarter results, the positive drivers for the first half of this year more than offset the absence of $0.13 of decoupling and lost distribution revenues that were recognized in the first half of 2020 but are no longer in place this year.\nAdditionally, our continued focus on financial discipline combined with strong financial results helped drive a $196 million increase in adjusted cash from operations compared to our internal plan and a $264 million increase above the first six months of last year, building on the improvements we noted in our first quarter earnings call.\nRegarding capital markets activity, we continue to make good progress on this year's debt financing plan with five of our six debt transactions complete, all with pricing similar to investment grade companies.\nIn May, we issued $150 million in senior notes at Toledo Edison and MAIT with pricing at 2.65% and 2.55% respectively.\nIn June, we issued $500 million in senior notes at JCP&L that priced at 2.75%.\nFurthermore, we made progress on our commitment to reduce short-term debt during the second quarter by repaying $950 million under our revolving credit facilities, bringing our borrowings down to $500 million as of June 30.\nEarlier this week, we repaid the remaining $500 million under these facilities.\nAlthough we obtained a waiver for our credit facilities related to the DPA, this repayment was voluntary and not required by the bank group.\nWe plan to operate normally going forward and will utilize the revolving credit facilities as needed, as we have done historically.\nAs you are aware, we have two revolving credit facilities, one for FE Corp, which is shared with our utility companies, and one for FET, both expiring in December 2022.\nIn the coming months, we plan to collaborate with our bank group to evaluate and refinance these bank facilities, aiming to complete this initiative before the year's end.\nLastly, we continue to explore alternatives for our equity needs.\nWe are considering options that include a minority sale of distribution and/or transmission assets, which would generate substantial proceeds and eliminate all of our expected non-SIP equity needs, ensure the execution of our balance sheet improvement plans, and provide funding for strategic capital expenditures in customer-focused emerging technologies that support the transition to a cleaner electric grid.\nBased on our current timeline, we anticipate providing you with an update in the fourth quarter.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These convictions are vulnerable to recognized and unrecognized hazards and uncertainties, many of which may be outside our influence, including those outlined in our regular SEC submissions.\nIt's important to recognize that the company's actual outcomes may significantly deviate from those projected, and we are not obligated to revise these declarations.\nQuestions from the audience will be welcomed at the conclusion of the presentation.\nI'm delighted with our achievements in the initial quarter of fiscal year 2022.\nOur staff achieved a 17% increase in sales, enhanced our operating profit margin by 160 basis points, and boosted diluted earnings per share by 57%, despite worldwide supply chain difficulties and volatile market circumstances.\nOur results show that by focusing on customers, we're driving revenue growth and converting it into operating income, while simultaneously investing in the company's long-term expansion and transformation.\nI'd like to begin today's discussion by thoroughly examining the present market conditions.\nAs you're aware, this is a fluid market with its fair share of contradictions.\nThe demand across our target markets continues to be robust.\nSimultaneously, the accessibility and expense of crucial resources remain problematic.\nIn essence, it's the best of times and the most demanding of times.\nBusiness is thriving in both ABL and spaces.\nWithin ABL, demand is strong across all our market channels, with the exception of retail, which we anticipate will improve this calendar year.\nIn this fluctuating pricing environment, we've been cautious and successful in passing on price increases, while simultaneously providing as much stability as possible to our customers so they can efficiently plan and execute their projects.\nConcurrently, input costs and availability remain unpredictable, and we expect this trend to persist.\nEvidently, everyone is grappling with this situation.\nOur approach to navigating through this has been consistent: prioritize meeting customer demand and ensuring the health and well-being of our employees.\nNow, allow me to elaborate on what we mean by satisfying our customer demand.\nFirstly, we've decided to honor pricing on all our placed orders.\nAs I've mentioned before, it's crucial to me that we're known in the industry for keeping our word.\nThere's typically a time gap between when we receive orders and when we fulfill them, and that gap is even longer now.\nTherefore, we believe this stance will benefit us in the long run with specific customers and within the industry.\nFurthermore, we're also doing everything in our power to fulfill these orders as swiftly as possible.\nWhile we don't disclose backlog figures, I can say that it's significantly higher than during normal periods.\nThis is due to increased demand, coupled with fluctuating component availability and general supply chain and transportation challenges.\nAgain, these issues aren't unique to Acuity.\nTo combat these challenges, we've prioritized three key activities.\nFirstly, we've concentrated on and invested in our strategic relationships with manufacturers and suppliers to secure as much of the available component supply as possible.\nWe benefit from being the largest and most consistent player in the industry.\nSecondly, we've authorized our teams to source components in the spot market, prioritizing speed and access over cost.\nThis allows us to maintain higher production levels at the expense of some increased costs.\nThirdly, our product, engineering, and manufacturing teams have been continuously redesigning and reengineering existing products based on available components.\nTo give you an idea of the scale of this effort, our Distech engineers dedicated over half their time in the last quarter to this type of redesign.\nOur ABL team made the same commitment in addition to changes and improvements in our manufacturing processes to ensure consistent production.\nThese efforts also extend beyond our company into our broader ecosystem.\nWe've been collaborating with suppliers to help them locate necessary components and make engineering changes in the products they supply to us.\nThe overall effort has been monumental, and our teams continue to remain adaptable and adjust to an ever-changing environment.\nThe modifications we've implemented over the past two years have enhanced our ability to oversee our business, work across our stakeholders, and improve our service levels.\nSo, where do we stand on our transformation?\nOne point I emphasize to our team is that transformation is an ongoing process, not a final destination.\nIn challenging times, the initial reaction is sometimes to revert to what's familiar.\nWe are utilizing this period to intensify our transformation initiatives.\nLet's begin with discussing the ABL division.\nTrevor and his colleagues are concentrating on sustaining high product innovation, enhancing industry service standards, and leveraging technology to set us apart.\nIn the initial quarter, we introduced several intriguing products to expand our portfolio, such as the STACK PACK and STACK Switch items.\nThese products represent the latest generation of central LED recessed lighting for commercial indoor environments.\nThe STACK features a slimmer design and more efficient packaging, resulting in reduced transportation expenses.\nIt also offers adjustable brightness that can be modified at any time using the STACK Switch.\nThis eliminates wasted time on-site if configuration changes are necessary.\nIn the controls sector, we unveiled the CLAIRITY link.\nThis component of our nLight lighting control system provides remote connectivity capabilities.\nThe remote features decrease the need for on-site visits, offering swift troubleshooting solutions and lowered maintenance costs.\nThis product fundamentally alters our approach to project servicing and marks a significant advancement for our clients.\nShifting focus to the Intelligent Spaces Group.\nISG's objective is to employ technology to address spatial issues, making them more intelligent, secure, and environmentally friendly.\nWe accomplish this through two methods.\nWe gather data via hardware, such as the Distech controller, then analyze and act upon this data through Atrius-powered software applications.\nOur ISG division had a noteworthy quarter.\nAs mentioned, despite Distech's engineering team dedicating over half their time to redesigning products for available components.\nWe continued to launch several significant products and product improvements.\nThe Distech ECLYPSE APEX was released in the first quarter and represents our most advanced controller for HVAC and building automation.\nThe APEX incorporates artificial intelligence at the edge and enhances computing capacity in buildings, assisting customers in managing energy consumption more efficiently.\nWe also expanded the availability of our Atrius Building Insights service by enabling it for additional languages and local privacy requirements.\nAtrius Building Insights is now accessible in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Spain, and Norway.\nWe are currently, and anticipate continuing to, operate in unpredictable circumstances.\nInput prices and availability can sometimes resemble a game of whack-a-mole, and we are contending with omicron, which emerged only a few months ago.\nAs we confront these and new challenges, we will maintain our focus on meeting customer demands and ensuring the health and well-being of our employees.\nI remain optimistic about 2022 and our ability to effectively manage in this environment.\nWe have an excellent team executing current tasks while remaining focused on the company's long-term growth and transformation.\nI will return for the Q&A session and some concluding remarks.\nI continue to be impressed by our team's commitment to our transformational priorities while navigating the day-to-day business operations.\nWe achieved strong first quarter results.\nNet sales reached $926 million, a 17% increase compared to the previous year.\nThis performance was driven by improved service levels, ongoing recovery in both business segments' end markets, and the benefits of recent price increases.\nGross profit totaled $386 million, an increase of $53 million or 16% over the previous year.\nThis improvement resulted from revenue growth and offsetting significant increases in material and freight costs through price increases and product and productivity enhancements.\nGross profit as a percentage of sales was 41.7%, a 30 basis point decrease from 42% in the previous year, a notable achievement given the cost environment.\nReported operating profit margin was 12.4% of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, a 160 basis point increase over the previous year.\nAdjusted operating profit margin was 14.4% of net sales, a 120 basis point increase over the previous year.\nThis was primarily due to improved operating leverage as we continued to balance cost management and growth investments.\nThe effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was 19.6%.\nIn the same period of 2021, the rate was 24.7%.\nThe decrease in the effective income tax rate was mainly attributed to favorable discrete items recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 related to excess tax benefits on share-based payments.\nWe anticipate our tax rate for the entirety of 2022 to return to approximately 23%, excluding these specific items.\nWe observed a notable increase in diluted earnings per share for the initial quarter of the 2022 fiscal year.\nThe diluted earnings per share of $2.46 showed a rise of $0.89 or 57% compared to the previous year.\nThe adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.85 demonstrated an increase of $0.82 or 40% in comparison to the prior year.\nOur share buyback program positively affected adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.07, while the tax impact was roughly $0.16.\nLet's discuss our divisions.\nIn the quarter, our Lighting and Lighting Control division experienced a 17% increase in sales, reaching $884 million compared to the previous year.\nThis growth was propelled by improvements in our independent sales network, which grew by 14%, and the direct sales network, which expanded by about 12%.\nThese gains were a direct consequence of our robust go-to-market strategies, an improved demand landscape, and the positive effect of price hikes.\nOur corporate accounts channel witnessed a sales increase of roughly 62% compared to the previous year, as major clients resumed previously delayed maintenance and renovation projects.\nThe performance in this channel fluctuates quarterly and depends on our customers' renovation schedules.\nSales in the retail channel decreased by approximately 16% in the current quarter.\nABL's operating profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 rose by 30% to $128 million compared to the previous year, with the operating margin improving by 160 basis points to 12.4%.\nThe adjusted operating profit of $138 million showed a 28% improvement compared to the previous year, with the adjusted operating margin increasing by 140 basis points to 15.6%.\nNow let's examine the results for our Intelligent Spaces Group.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, sales in spaces grew by approximately 14% to $46 million compared to the previous year, reflecting sustained demand primarily across our building and HVAC controls.\nSpaces' operating profit in the first quarter of 2022 increased by about $2 million to $2 million compared to the previous year.\nThe adjusted operating profit of $6 million rose by approximately $2 million compared to the previous year due to robust sales growth.\nLet's now discuss cash flow.\nWe continue to generate substantial cash flows.\nThe net cash from operating activities for the initial three months of fiscal 2022 amounted to $84 million.\nThis represents a decrease of $40 million or 32% compared to the previous year and reflects an increased investment in inventory to drive growth.\nAdditionally, cash flow was affected by the timing of income tax payments and the previous year's deferral of withholding taxes resulting from the CARES Act.\nWe invested $9 million, or 1% of net sales, in capital expenditures during the first three months of fiscal 2022.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to implement our capital allocation strategy and bought back approximately 300,000 shares of common stock for around $53 million at an average price of $176 per share.\nWe have roughly 3.5 million shares remaining under our current board authorization.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain unchanged.\nWe will continue to prioritize investments for growth in our existing businesses, invest in acquisitions, maintain our dividend, and allocate capital to share repurchases when there's an opportunity to create lasting value for our shareholders.\nI'd like to briefly address some current topics of interest.\nFirstly, regarding the pricing environment.\nAs Neil mentioned, we are actively managing prices while maintaining balanced relationships with our customers.\nWe announced another price increase this week, effective for orders placed in February.\nWe will continue to be strategic and deliberate in our approach to pricing.\nNext, I'd like to provide an update on the OSRAM integration.\nWe've made significant progress in integrating OSRAM.\nWe acquired the OSRAM North American DS business to ensure control over the technology, expand our OEM channel, and benefit from its integration into our supply chain.\nThe addition of OSRAM contributed over 300 basis points to our sales growth this quarter.\nThere was a relatively small dilutive impact on gross profit margin, but OSRAM overall positively contributed to operating profit.\nThe acquisition is meeting our expectations, and we're thrilled that the OSRAM team is now part of Acuity.\nWe've included EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA in our reconciliation tables to facilitate easier comparisons and improve consistency around reported adjustments.\nAs we progress through 2022, we will continue to prioritize our customers to drive sales growth and operating income.\nWe will also continue to allocate capital in ways that promote long-term growth and create lasting value for our shareholders.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:You can find information on pb.com by visiting the Investor Relations section.\nWe have prepared slides summarizing key points for this call, which are available on our Investor Relations website.\nI'm thrilled to welcome Ana as our new Chief Financial Officer.\nAna has held executive roles at GE Capital, most recently serving as President and CEO of Global Legacy Solutions and previously as COO and CFO.\nAna's strong financial and operational background makes her an excellent fit for PB's culture.\nThe events of 2020 were unprecedented, but I'm proud of how our team prepared for and handled the challenges.\nOur business made significant progress throughout the year due to our team's efforts and dedication.\nIf I had to describe our employees in 2020 with one word, it would be determined.\nThis quality truly embodies our team's spirit.\nWe ended an extraordinary year with a remarkable fourth quarter.\nRevenue grew by 23% at constant currency.\nTo our knowledge, this is Pitney Bowes' highest modern-day organic growth rate on record.\nShipping-related revenues accounted for 54% of our total revenue.\nGlobal Ecommerce grew by 60% in the quarter, with improved profitability resulting in positive EBITDA.\nPresort's flat revenue performance was a significant improvement from previous quarters and exceeded market trends.\nSendTech performed strongly, with growth in both revenue and profit compared to the previous year.\nThis was driven by strong equipment sales, double-digit growth in SaaS-based shipping offerings, and solid performance in our services business.\nSendTech, once considered a declining business, has been revitalized through investments in digital channels, products, and expanded shipping offerings.\nThese achievements would have been hard to imagine a few years ago, but they demonstrate what a determined and focused team can accomplish.\nWhen the pandemic hit, we had two main objectives: prioritize employee health and well-being while maintaining financial strength, and emerge from the crisis as a stronger company.\nEconomic disruptions often create opportunities, and our team was determined to capitalize on our recent investments.\nWe adjusted our work protocols and practices, provided necessary PPE to employees, refinanced our debt, and ensured a solid liquidity position.\nOnce we confirmed the company's financial stability, we focused on emerging stronger from the pandemic, which we are well on our way to achieving.\nGlobal Ecommerce generated $1.6 billion in revenue for the year, growing at a record rate of over 40%.\nThe business acquired new customers and achieved scale earlier than anticipated, while accelerating our planned network expansion by several years.\nAlthough not always smooth, the business is in a much better position than it was a year ago.\nWhile e-commerce's growth is noteworthy, SendTech's transformation is equally impressive.\nThe business performed well relative to the mail market and expanded into shipping, a new growth area that leverages our core strengths.\nSendTech's transformation is exemplified by the growth in shipping revenue, which now significantly offsets the decline in mail business.\nU.S. shipments of low-end and middle-market devices grew 13% for the year, providing new value to clients compared to previous single-purpose mailing machines.\nOur strong cash performance in the fourth quarter and throughout the year is particularly impressive.\nIncreasing operating cash flow significantly during a pandemic and major economic disruption is a remarkable achievement.\nTransformations are inherently messy and nonlinear, especially during a pandemic.\nThe unprecedented surge in e-commerce demand led to cost inflation, particularly in labor and transportation, which negatively impacted our e-commerce profit in the fourth quarter.\nThis quarter tested capacity throughout the industry.\nTo meet demand, we more than doubled our labor force and established three new facilities, which handled over a quarter of our total domestic parcels in 2020.\nWe faced challenges with third-party transportation costs and service, in line with broader industry trends.\nTo maintain service levels, we proactively upgraded packages at additional cost.\nMoving forward, we aim to balance our use of third-party transportation and our own PB fleet assets, which performed well during peak season.\nWe will continue investing to improve efficiency across all areas.\nAs I've mentioned before, we now have the ability to manage our cost structure and generate efficiencies internally.\nTransformations typically follow a pattern: initial quick wins, ongoing investments, revenue expansion, and ultimately, profitable growth.\nThe strongest indicators of successful transformations are increased revenue and higher employee engagement.\nWe've seen consistent revenue growth in recent years, and our employee engagement reached record levels during the pandemic.\nDespite ongoing economic uncertainties and pandemic-related challenges, we're well-positioned to enter the final phase of successful transformations: profitable revenue growth.\nI'm impressed by the team's achievements.\nWe all acknowledge there's still work to be done.\nI'm enthusiastic about the next phase of our transformation journey.\nWe're on the verge of achieving something few companies have managed to accomplish.\nI'll begin by summarizing our annual results, then provide details on our fourth quarter performance.\nOur full-year revenue reached $3.6 billion, representing an 11% increase from the previous year and marking our fourth consecutive year of revenue growth at constant currency.\nThe Global Ecommerce division grew by 41%, Presort Services saw a slight decline of less than 2%, and SendTech decreased by 7%.\nAdjusted earnings per share were $0.30, while GAAP earnings per share showed a loss of $1.06.\nIt's worth noting that the GAAP earnings per share includes a non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the first quarter.\nGAAP cash from operations totaled $298 million, and free cash flow amounted to $279 million.\nFree cash flow increased by $91 million compared to the previous year.\nThroughout the year, several significant factors contributed to the improvement in free cash flow.\nOur emphasis on collections led to a significant improvement in our Days Sales Outstanding (DSO).\nWe also observed higher levels of customer deposits in Presort and PB Bank, partly due to initiatives supporting our clients.\nAdditionally, finance receivables declined more rapidly, particularly in the second quarter, due to reduced placements of SendTech equipment during the pandemic.\nThis trend began to improve as our SendTech business gained momentum in the latter half of 2020 when businesses started reopening.\nWhen the pandemic first emerged, we made a prudent decision to reassess our investment priorities and reduce spending, given the market uncertainty at that time.\nWhile there were various fluctuations throughout the year, as is typical, these areas are crucial for understanding the strong free cash flow we generated for the year.\nExamining our balance sheet and capital allocation, we concluded the year with $940 million in cash and short-term investments.\nDuring the year, we utilized free cash flow to return $34 million to shareholders through dividends.\nOur capital expenditures totaled $105 million, reflecting investments in new and existing facilities, technology, and products throughout the year.\nAs part of our ongoing transformation, we also made $20 million in restructuring payments.\nWithin Pitney Bowes Bank, customer deposits grew to $617 million, and Wheeler Financial funded $16 million in new deals for the year.\nRegarding our debt position, we ended the year with $102.6 billion in total debt, a reduction of $175 million from the previous year.\nIn terms of net debt, when accounting for our cash, short-term investments, and finance receivables, our implied net debt position on an operating company basis was approximately $550 million at year-end.\nMoving on to the fourth quarter details.\nWe achieved $1 billion in revenue, representing a 23% growth.\nGlobal Ecommerce grew by 60%, while both Presort and SendTech remained stable compared to the previous year.\nFor the quarter, adjusted earnings per share were $0.13, and GAAP earnings per share were $0.11.\nThe quarter's EPS includes a $0.03 tax benefit, mainly related to deferred tax balances in certain international tax jurisdictions.\nGAAP cash from operations for the quarter was $111 million, and free cash flow was $97 million.\nFree cash flow increased by $16 million compared to the previous year, primarily due to the timing of working capital.\nDuring the quarter, we used free cash flow to reduce debt by $31 million, invest $24 million in capital expenditures, and pay $9 million in dividends.\nAnalyzing the P&L, starting with revenue performance compared to the previous year.\nBusiness services grew by 43% and equipment sales increased by 15%.\nSupport services declined by 4% and rentals by 8%, while financing and supplies both decreased by approximately 10%.\nGross profit was $311 million, with a gross margin of 30%.\nThis represents a decline of about nine points from the previous year, largely reflecting the changing mix of our portfolio and higher service costs driven by increased parcel demand in Global Ecommerce.\nSG&A expenses were $242 million, or just under 24% of revenue, a six-point improvement from the previous year.\nWithin SG&A, unallocated corporate expenses were $54 million, $2.5 million higher than the previous year.\nIt's important to note that full-year unallocated corporate expenses were $200 million, $11 million lower than the previous year, primarily due to reduced employee-related expenses.\nR&D expenses were $9.5 million, or about 1% of revenue, representing a half-point improvement from the previous year.\nEBIT was $62 million, with an EBIT margin of 6%.\nCompared to the previous year, EBIT declined by $3 million and EBIT margin decreased by about 2%, largely due to lower gross profit.\nInterest expense, including financing interest expense, was $38 million, relatively unchanged from the previous year.\nThe provision for taxes on adjusted earnings was less than $1 million, and our tax rate for the quarter was 1%, bringing our annual tax rate to 13%.\nAverage diluted weighted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter were approximately 177 million.\nLet me now discuss the performance of each of our business segments this quarter.\nIn Global Ecommerce, revenue reached $518 million, representing 60% growth over the previous year and marking the first time we achieved over $500 million in quarterly revenue.\nCompared to the previous year, volumes grew by 50% or more across all our lines of business.\nDomestic parcel volumes increased by 76% to just under 65 million parcels.\nDigital volumes grew by 50%, and cross-border volumes increased by 76%.\nExamining EBIT, we experienced a deficit of $15 million.\nThis represented a $3 million betterment from the previous year and a $5 million improvement from the preceding quarter.\nThe EBIT margin also saw an enhancement of three percentage points compared to last year and two percentage points from the previous quarter.\nEBITDA reached $3 million, showing progress from both the prior year and earlier quarters.\nThe year-over-year revenue growth was boosted by considerable demand.\nThis was counterbalanced by increased expenses, partially due to market conditions, including notably higher transportation spot market rates and labor costs.\nThe surge in peak demand also negatively impacted our productivity.\nWe plan to keep investing in our network to enhance efficiency, decrease expenses, and upgrade client services, partly through network-wide automation.\nWe're restructuring our workforce by transitioning from temporary to permanent employees, which should result in a more efficient labor force.\nWe're also evaluating our transportation network and exploring opportunities to reduce our reliance on the spot market where feasible, while improving our ability to secure deeper postal discounts.\nFurthermore, like others in the market, we'll implement a surcharge in 2021, along with our yearly general rate increase.\nIn the Presort Services division, revenue remained steady at $135 million compared to the previous year.\nOverall daily volume average decreased by 2%.\nFirst Class Mail volumes dropped by 3%, while Marketing Mail volumes increased by 2%.\nMarketing Mail Flats and Bound Printed Matter volumes saw a 26% increase.\nAs previously mentioned, this remains a relatively small part of our portfolio but represents a new source of revenue and profit for us.\nEBIT amounted to $13 million with a margin of 10%.\nEBITDA reached $21 million with a margin of 16%.\nEBIT and EBITDA margins were similar to previous quarters but declined from the prior year, mainly due to higher medical claims, increased labor costs, and COVID-related expenses for worker health and safety.\nMoving on to our SendTech segment.\nRevenue was $376 million, unchanged from last year when excluding currency effects, and showing a 1% growth on a reported basis.\nMarc discussed our investments in SendTech's digital capabilities, including our channel and products.\nWe're delivering new value to clients through multi-purpose devices and using our digital channel to attract new customers to our offerings.\nIn Q4, SendTech's shipping-related revenues grew by nearly 30% to $35 million, and our SaaS-based SendPro online offering saw a 70% increase in paid subscriptions.\nShipping, which currently contributes about 10% to SendTech's overall revenue, is a high-margin stream with significant future growth potential.\nThe impact of shipping is also evident in our financing portfolio, with clients increasing their shipping volumes by 65% compared to last year.\nEquipment sales rose by 15% year-over-year, driven by strong placements of our SendPro C and MailStation multipurpose products.\nOur value proposition continues to resonate with our clients.\nThe SendPro MailStation serves as a replacement option for lower-volume mailers and is ideal for remote setups or branch offices of larger organizations.\nSince its April launch, we've shipped about 20,000 MailStation units.\nThe growth in equipment sales marks a significant improvement from previous quarters, especially compared to the 32% decline we experienced in Q2 during the peak of COVID lockdowns.\nSupplies declined by 10%, which is an improvement from earlier quarters due to increased usage and demand.\nIn the U.S., 70% of our supplies transactions were conducted online in Q4, up nine percentage points from the same period last year.\nSupport services decreased by 4%, also an improvement from recent quarters.\nCombined rentals and financing revenues fell by 9% in the quarter.\nWe achieved strong EBIT performance of $118 million, representing a $5 million increase over the previous year.\nEBIT margin was 31%, improving by one percentage point year-over-year and falling within our long-term model's projected range.\nEBITDA reached $126 million with a margin of 34%, both showing improvement over the prior year.\nOur financing portfolio remains healthy, with delinquency rates decreasing from the initial small uptick we observed earlier in the year due to the pandemic.\nWe continuously monitor delinquency rates and take a disciplined approach to managing credit risk.\nLet me conclude with an update on 2021.\nDue to ongoing market uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and unpredictable macroeconomic conditions, we'll provide a broader outlook for 2021.\nWe anticipate annual revenue growth in the low-to-mid single-digit range compared to the previous year, making 2021 the fifth consecutive year of constant currency growth.\nWe also expect adjusted earnings per share to increase year-over-year.\nWithin our segments, we project Global Ecommerce revenue to grow in the low double-digit range and anticipate significant profit improvement in this business.\nWe expect the momentum observed in SendTech during the second half of 2020, particularly in shipping capabilities and new multipurpose devices, to continue through 2021, helping to partially offset the decline in recurring related revenues.\nWe also anticipate the improvement in volume trends seen in Presort during the second half of 2020 to persist through 2021.\nThere are some year-over-year headwinds to be aware of that will partially offset overall business unit improvements.\nIn 2020, we recorded RIV insurance proceeds.\nFor 2021, we expect higher employee-related costs concerning variable compensation.\nAdditionally, we anticipate our annual tax rate on adjusted earnings to be in the 23% to 27% range, which is higher than our 2020 end rate.\nWe expect lower free cash flow in 2021, primarily due to specific items I discussed earlier that benefited 2020 but are not expected to continue at the same level in 2021.\nRegarding timing throughout the year, our portfolio continues to shift towards growing markets, particularly in shipping.\nConsequently, the fourth quarter will remain our largest quarter of the year.\nSpecifically for the first quarter, we expect revenue to grow in the high single-digit to low double-digit range compared to the previous year, with earnings per share relatively in line with the prior year.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We examine alternative financial metrics, such as core funds from operations (core FFO), adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), and net debt to recurring EBITDA.\nWe're delighted to announce that our strong performance continued, with a record-breaking investment volume exceeding $750 million in the initial half of 2021.\nSubstantial and superior investment activity further enhanced our investment grade concentration and increased our ground lease exposure to an unprecedented level of nearly 13%.\nOur investment endeavors this quarter were bolstered by over $1 billion in strategic capital market transactions, which strengthened our industry-leading balance sheet and positioned us for future growth.\nIn the second quarter, we allocated approximately $366 million to 59 premium retail net lease properties across our three external growth strategies.\nWe sourced 54 of these properties through our acquisition platform, representing a purchase volume of over $345 million.\nThe 54 properties acquired in the second quarter are leased to 32 tenants operating across 18 different retail sectors, including top-tier companies in off-price, home improvement, auto parts, general merchandise, dollar stores, convenience stores, craft and novelties, grocery, and tire and auto service industries.\nThe newly acquired properties had an average capitalization rate of 6.2% and an average lease duration of 11.8 years.\nIn the first half of this year, we've invested a record $756 million in 146 retail net lease properties across 35 states and 24 retail sectors.\nOur acquisition platform generated approximately $732 million of our investment activity.\nAbout 75% of the annualized base rents acquired in the year's first half come from leading investment-grade retailers, while nearly one-third of annualized base rent is generated from ground-leased assets.\nThese figures highlight our ongoing focus on premium opportunities with leading omnichannel retailers, while still achieving record results.\nGiven our unprecedented acquisition activity to date and our pipeline visibility, we are raising our full-year 2021 acquisition forecast to between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion.\nThis past quarter, we executed several unique and notable deals, including a new small-format Target on the University of Georgia campus in Athens.\nWe are thrilled to expand our relationship with Target and add another distinctive street retail asset to our growing portfolio.\nWe maintained our investment in dominant grocery chains during the quarter.\nThe most significant was a five-store sale-leaseback transaction with Kroger for approximately $68 million.\nThe stores are situated in Texas, Michigan, Ohio, and Mississippi, with each location subject to a new 15-year net lease.\nWith this transaction, Kroger has become one of our top 10 tenants, representing 3.2% of annualized base rents.\nKroger is undoubtedly a leader in the grocery industry.\nTheir robust balance sheet, strategic omnichannel initiatives, and substantial investment in e-commerce fulfillment align perfectly with our investment strategy.\nFurthermore, we finalized the purchase of a ShopRite, owned and operated by Wakefern, in New Rochelle, New York.\nShopRite is an exceptional operator, and the property's location at a strategic interchange of I-95 exemplifies the thorough bottom-up analysis we conduct for every asset we acquire.\nLastly, you may recall we acquired our first Wegmans Ground Lease in Chapel Hill, North Carolina during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nWe've built on that momentum this quarter by acquiring our second property ground-leased to Wegmans.\nThe store, located in Parsippany, New Jersey, spans over 100,000 square feet and was constructed at Wegmans' expense.\nIn the first six months of the year, we've acquired 45 ground leases, totaling an investment of over $240 million.\nThe second quarter contributed 14 ground leases to this total, representing an investment volume exceeding $113 million.\nOther notable ground lease acquisitions during the quarter included our first Capital Grille in Whippany, New Jersey.\nWe also acquired a Walmart Supercenter and Lowe's in Hooksett, New Hampshire, our first Cabela's in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and three additional Wawa assets, increasing our Wawa portfolio to 25 properties, including their flagship store in downtown Philadelphia.\nAs mentioned earlier, our overall ground lease exposure reached a company record of 12.7% of annualized base rents at quarter-end, including unique assets leased to the country's top retailers.\nIncluding our second quarter acquisitions, the ground lease portfolio now generates nearly 90% of rents from investment-grade tenants and has an average lease term of 12.5 years.\nMost of the portfolio includes rent escalators resulting in average annual growth of close to 1%, while the average rent per square foot is only $9 and $0.65.\nThis expanding portfolio continues to offer exceptional risk-adjusted returns when considering the lease term, credit quality, underlying real estate attributes, and the free building and improvements if a tenant were to vacate.\nWe anticipate continuing to utilize our industry connections and proven execution capabilities to identify potential additions to this growing and diverse sub-portfolio.\nAs of June 30, our portfolio's total investment grade exposure reached nearly 68%, marking a substantial year-over-year increase of about 670 basis points.\nOver a two-year period, our investment grade exposure has shown improvement by more than 1,300 basis points.\nThe ongoing expansion of our ground lease portfolio and investment grade exposure showcases our disciplined approach to building the nation's premier retail portfolio.\nRegarding our Development and Partner Capital Solutions platforms, we continue to discover promising opportunities with our retail partners.\nDuring the first half of the year, we had six development and PCS projects either finished or in progress, representing a total capital commitment exceeding $36 million.\nIn the second quarter, we completed three projects: a grocery outlet in Port Angeles, Washington, a Gerber Collision in Buford, Georgia, and a Floor & Decor in Naples, Florida.\nI'm happy to report that we also began construction on our second development with Gerber Collision in Pooler, Georgia, during the quarter.\nUpon completion, Gerber will enter a new 15-year net lease, with rent expected to commence in the first quarter of 2022.\nWe are working on additional opportunities with Gerber Collision that we expect to announce later this year and into next year.\nConstruction progressed during the quarter on our first development with 7-Eleven in Saginaw, Michigan.\nWe expect delivery to occur in the first quarter of next year, at which point 7-Eleven will enter a new 15-year net lease.\nWe remain committed to leveraging our full capabilities to expand our relationships with these leading omnichannel retailers.\nI look forward to updating you on our ongoing progress in future quarters.\nWhile enhancing our top-tier retail portfolio through record investment activity, we were also quite active in property dispositions during the quarter.\nWe continued reducing our Walgreens exposure and franchise restaurants, selling seven properties for gross proceeds of about $28 million at a weighted average cap rate of 6.7%.\nIn the first six months of the year, we sold a total of 10 properties for gross proceeds exceeding $36 million at a weighted average cap rate of approximately 6.7%.\nBased on our disposition activities in the first half of the year, we are increasing the lower end of our disposition guidance to $50 million for the year, while the upper end remains at about $75 million.\nOur asset management team has been proactively addressing upcoming lease expirations.\nTheir efforts have reduced the remaining 2021 maturities to just three leases, representing 20 basis points of annualized base rents.\nIn the second quarter, we executed new leases, extensions, or options on roughly 209,000 square feet of gross leasable area.\nWe are particularly pleased to have signed a new 15-year net lease with Gardner White to occupy our only former Loves Furniture store in Canton, Michigan.\nThis was the Art Van flagship we developed before the company's acquisition by TH Lee.\nWe handed over the space to Gardner White in June, and rent began in July, allowing us to recover nearly 100% of previous rents with just over a month of downtime.\nIt's worth noting that this is the second time we've released this asset with essentially full recovery since the Art Van bankruptcy.\nGardner White is a Michigan-based, family-owned and operated business that has been one of the state's leading furniture retailers for over a century.\nThe company is led by Rachel Tronstein, one of the furniture retail industry's brightest minds and a former high school classmate of mine.\nWe are thrilled to have Rachel and her team as partners in this flagship asset.\nI'm also excited to announce the addition of Burlington to Central Michigan Commons in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, one of only two remaining legacy shopping centers we decided to keep during our portfolio transformation.\nSo far, we have redeveloped the former Kmart space for Hobby Lobby and Alta, and added Texas Roadhouse on an outlot via ground lease.\nThese transactions demonstrate our ability to unlock hidden value within the portfolio and support our decision to retain this well-located legacy shopping center across from Central Michigan University's main campus.\nIn the first six months of the year, we executed new leases, extensions, or options on approximately 275,000 square feet of gross leasable area.\nAs of June 30, our expanding retail portfolio comprised 1,262 properties across 46 states, including 134 ground leases, and remains nearly fully occupied at 99.5%.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Simon, and then we can open it up for questions.\nRegarding earnings, core funds from operations for the second quarter were $0.89 per share, representing a record 17.3% year-over-year increase.\nThe quarterly adjusted funds from operations per share reached $0.88, showing a 15.9% year-on-year growth.\nOur diluted share count includes treasury stock before settlement when ADCs stock price exceeds the deal price of our outstanding forward equity offerings.\nThese offerings had a minimal dilutive impact of less than $0.005 in Q2.\nAccording to FactSet, analysts project full-year AFFO per share between $3.40 and $3.53, suggesting 6% to 10% annual growth.\nWe believe this growth rate is attainable and expect to finish the year near the upper end of this range, considering our current investment pipeline and overall operating conditions.\nThis projection, combined with our 6% AFFO per share growth in 2020, indicates a two-year cumulative growth in the mid-teens.\nQ2 general and administrative expenses amounted to $6.2 million.\nG&A costs represented 7.6% of total revenue, or 7.1% excluding non-cash amortization of above and below-market lease intangibles.\nDespite ongoing investments in personnel and systems to support our expanding business, we expect G&A as a percentage of total revenue to be in the lower 7% range for the full year 2021, excluding lease intangible amortization impact on total revenues.\nAs previously noted, our acquisitions team's G&A expenses vary based on yearly acquisition volume, and our current G&A expense forecast reflects an acquisition volume within our updated guidance range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion.\nThe second quarter's total income tax expense for 2021 was approximately $485,000.\nWe continue to anticipate total income tax expense to be around $2.5 million.\nIn May, we issued a $650 million dual-tranche public bond, consisting of $350 million in 2% senior unsecured notes due in 2028 and $300 million in 2.6% senior unsecured notes due in 2033.\nWe terminated related swap agreements of $300 million that hedged the 2033 Notes, receiving about $17 million upon termination.\nTaking into account the terminated swap agreements, the effective rates for the 2028 and 2033 Notes are 2.11% and 2.13% respectively.\nWe used part of the net proceeds to repay all $240 million of our unsecured term loans, incurring termination costs of approximately $15 million.\nThese one-time termination costs have been excluded from our core FFO and AFFO calculations.\nThis bond issuance and term loan repayment extended our weighted average debt maturity to about nine years and lowered our effective weighted average interest rate to roughly 3.2%.\nIn June, we completed a follow-on public offering of 4.6 million common stock shares, generating net proceeds of approximately $327 million.\nDuring Q2, we entered into forward sale agreements through our ATM program to sell about 1.2 million common stock shares, expecting net proceeds of approximately $81 million.\nIn May, we settled around 164,000 shares, receiving net proceeds of about $10 million.\nAt quarter-end, we had roughly 3.9 million shares remaining to be settled under existing forward sale agreements, expected to raise net proceeds of approximately $259 million upon settlement.\nIncluding anticipated net proceeds from outstanding forward offerings, cash on hand, and credit facility availability, we had nearly $950 million in liquidity at quarter-end.\nOur balance sheet remains a significant strength.\nAs of June 30, our pro forma net debt to recurring EBITDA was about 3.6 times, including outstanding forward equity offerings.\nExcluding unsettled forward equity, our net debt to recurring EBITDA was approximately 4.5 times.\nTotal debt to enterprise value at quarter-end was around 25%, while fixed charge coverage remained at a record five times.\nIn Q2, we declared monthly cash dividends of $0.217 per share for April, May, and June.\nThis monthly dividend reflected an annualized amount of $2.60 per share, an 8.5% increase over the $2.40 per share annualized dividend for Q2 of last year.\nOur Q2 payout ratios were a conservative 73% of Core FFO per share and 74% of AFFO per share.\nAfter the quarter ended, we declared a monthly cash dividend of $0.217 per share for July.\nThis monthly dividend reflects an annualized amount of $2.60 per share, an 8.5% increase over the $2.40 per share annualized dividend from Q3 2020.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:After our comments, we will allow analysts to ask questions.\nPlease ask only one question with a single follow-up.\nWe outline these risks and uncertainties in our risk factor disclosures and other sections of our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.\nOur presentation will also include non-GAAP financial measures.\nI wish everyone good health and safety.\nWe had an exceptional second quarter performance with strong product demand.\nThis led to our fourth straight quarter of double-digit sales growth and sixth consecutive quarter of margin improvement and double-digit EPS growth.\nI'm very proud of our team's ability to overcome numerous supply chain obstacles to achieve this growth.\nSales grew by 24% for the quarter.\nSales increased by 18% when excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and currency effects.\nOperating profit rose by 27% and margins expanded by 60 basis points to 20.1%, mainly due to strong volume leverage.\nEarnings per share showed an impressive increase of 34%.\nOur overall performance showcases the strength of our diverse portfolio of lower-cost repair and remodel products, which are spread across different regions and channels, catering to both consumers and professionals.\nIn our plumbing segment, sales grew by 48% excluding currency effects, driven by outstanding growth in our North American and international faucet and shower businesses, as well as our spa business.\nInternational plumbing sales increased by 50% in the quarter, excluding currency effects, with Hansgrohe experiencing a sharp rebound in nearly all markets.\nStrong operational execution and new products like Hansgrohe's Rainfinity shower systems led to market share gains in many areas.\nNew product launches will continue with the introduction of the award-winning AXOR One collection in the second half of the year.\nThis collection was created by Barber Osgerby, an internationally renowned London-based industrial design studio.\nThis furthers Hansgrohe's tradition of combining cutting-edge contemporary design with innovative functionality.\nNorth American plumbing reported strong growth of 47%, excluding currency effects, in the second quarter, led by approximately 75% growth at Watkins Wellness and robust double-digit growth at Delta.\nDelta faucet achieved another record quarter with growth across all channels, particularly in the professionally-oriented trade channel.\nWe continue to invest in new products for North American plumbing as well.\nTwo days ago, we launched a Frank Lloyd Wright collection by Brizo, furthering the brand's commitment to distinctive design and innovative products.\nLastly, in plumbing, we acquired Steamist at the beginning of July, another bolt-on acquisition for Delta.\nSteamist is a leading manufacturer of residential steam bath products that will complement our strong trade and e-commerce product offering and aligns with our bolt-on acquisition strategy.\nIn our decorative architectural segment, sales decreased by 5% compared to a healthy 8% growth in the second quarter of 2020.\nWhile bath and cabinet hardware, lighting, and propane grew in the quarter, demand for DIY paint moderated.\nMaterial availability and other supply chain issues also affected our overall coatings business, as nearly all of our resin suppliers were operating under force majeure declarations during the second quarter.\nDue to these issues, sell-through of our coatings products exceeded sell-in, and inventories in the channel decreased during the quarter.\nBecause of lower than expected second quarter sales and our anticipation that material availability issues will persist but gradually improve, we are reducing our DIY sales forecast from flat to a low-single digit decline for the full year.\nHowever, with the acceleration we observed in our propane business during the quarter, we are more optimistic and are raising our expectations to low-double digit growth from high-single digit for the full year for our propane business.\nFor the decorative segment as a whole, we now project growth to be in the range of 2% to 5% for the full year.\nRegarding innovation in the decorative segment, we continue to invest in new products and are excited to introduce a new high-end paint line called Behr Dynasty at Home Depot in the third quarter, targeting both DIY and professional painters.\nDynasty is our most durable, stain-resistant, scuff-resistant, one-coat hide paint ever.\nIt's low VOC, Greenguard and LEED certified, fast-drying, and features an anti-microbial mildew-resistant paint finish.\nThis exemplifies how our innovation teams continue to focus on customer needs to deliver leading innovation and value for both consumers and professionals.\nRegarding capital allocation, we continued our aggressive share buyback program during the quarter, repurchasing 6.6 million shares for $447 million.\nAs part of the accelerated share repurchase agreement executed during the quarter, we will receive approximately 900,000 additional shares in July to complete that agreement, bringing our total shares repurchased year-to-date to 13.1 million shares for $750 million.\nThis represents about 5% of our outstanding share count at the start of the year.\nHighlighting our strong financial position and confidence in the future, we now plan to deploy an additional $250 million in the second half of the year for share repurchases and acquisitions, totaling approximately $1 billion for the full year.\nLet me provide an update on our experience with inflation and supply chain constraints, similar to last quarter's report.\nWe're witnessing rising inflation across most of our cost categories, including transportation, plastics, titanium dioxide, and packaging materials.\nThe cost of shipping containers incoming to our facilities nearly tripled during this period.\nWe anticipate our overall cost inflation to reach high single-digit percentages for the entire year in both our plumbing and decorative divisions, with low double-digit inflation expected in the latter half of the year.\nThe coatings sector is likely to see inflation rates in the mid-teens towards the end of the fourth quarter.\nTo counter this inflation, we've implemented price increases across both segments and are planning further price adjustments throughout our operations to address these ongoing cost increases.\nWe're also collaborating with our suppliers, customers, and internal teams to implement additional efficiency measures to help offset these expenses.\nDespite the increased inflation, we still anticipate achieving a balance between price and cost by the end of the year.\nWhile cost inflation has certainly been a challenge, the availability of materials has also impacted our operations.\nOur teams have excelled at finding new suppliers, creating material alternatives, and adjusting production to adapt to this changing environment and meet customer needs.\nHowever, these raw material shortages have restricted our ability to build inventory for many of our products and the markets we serve.\nWe expect material availability to gradually improve in the second half of the year, allowing us to replenish inventory to appropriate levels over time.\nThe market demand for our products remains robust.\nGiven the improved outlook for plumbing due to continued strong performance in both our North American and international operations, we are raising our full-year earnings per share projection to between $3.65 and $3.75, up from our previous estimate of $3.50 to $3.70.\nAs mentioned by Dave, my remarks today will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of restructuring and other one-time items.\nMoving to Slide 7.\nWe delivered another outstanding quarter by capitalizing on strong consumer demand, resulting in continued growth and increased order backlogs.\nConsequently, sales grew by 24%, with currency and net acquisitions each contributing 3% to this growth.\nIn local currency, North American sales increased by 15%, or 12% excluding acquisitions.\nStrong volume growth in North American faucets, showers, and spas led this exceptional performance.\nIn local currency, international sales saw a robust increase of 50%, or 49% excluding acquisitions and divestitures.\nGross margin for the quarter was 36.3%, an increase of 50 basis points as we leveraged the strong volume growth.\nOur SG&A as a percentage of sales improved by 10 basis points to 16.2% due to our operating leverage.\nDuring the quarter, certain expenses such as headcount, marketing, and travel and entertainment increased as planned.\nWe anticipate SG&A as a percent of sales to increase in the third and fourth quarters as these costs normalize.\nWe achieved strong second quarter operating profit of $438 million, an increase of $94 million or 27% from last year, with operating margins expanding by 60 basis points to 20.1%.\nOur earnings per share for the quarter was $1.14, a 34% increase compared to the second quarter of 2020, due to volume leverage, reduced interest expense, and lower share count.\nTurning to Slide 8.\nPlumbing growth accelerated in the quarter with sales up 53%.\nCurrency contributed 5% to this growth and acquisitions, net of divestitures, added another 4%.\nNorth American sales increased by 47% in local currency, or 41% excluding acquisitions.\nDelta led this outstanding performance, delivering another quarter of robust double-digit growth.\nWith strong brand recognition and market leadership, Delta continues to drive strong consumer demand across all its product categories and channels.\nWatkins Wellness also significantly contributed to growth in the quarter with both demand and our backlog remaining strong.\nInternational plumbing sales increased by 50% in local currency, or 49% excluding acquisitions and divestitures.\nHansgrohe delivered robust growth as demand continues to improve across Europe and numerous other countries.\nHansgrohe's key markets of Germany, China, UK, and France all grew strong double digits in the quarter.\nSegment operating margins expanded by 230 basis points to 20.6% in the quarter, with operating profit of $274 million, up $115 million or 72%.\nThe strong performance was driven by incremental volume, favorable mix, and cost productivity initiatives, partially offset by an unfavorable price/cost relationship and higher spend on items such as travel and entertainment, marketing, and growth initiatives.\nDuring the quarter, we also completed the divestiture of HUPPE, a small shower enclosure business based in Germany.\nHUPPE's sales were approximately €70 million in 2020.\nThe transaction concluded on May 31 with negligible net proceeds.\nIn light of our Q2 results and current demand patterns, we now project the plumbing segment's 2021 sales growth to range between 22% and 24%, an increase from our previous forecast of 15% to 18%.\nDue to our improved sales outlook, we are raising our full-year margin expectations to approximately 18.5%, up from our earlier estimate of around 18%.\nLet's move to Slide 9.\nDecorative architectural saw a 5% decline in the second quarter, or 6% when excluding acquisition benefits.\nThe DIY paint business experienced a double-digit decline this quarter compared to a strong high-teens performance last year, due to slowing demand and raw material supply issues caused by ongoing production challenges at resin plants affected by storms in the Texas Gulf Coast region in Q1.\nWe anticipate these raw material challenges to continue in Q3 and now expect our DIY paint business to show a low-single digit decline for the full year.\nTo address these issues, we're collaborating with existing suppliers and qualifying new material sources to meet our customers' persistent strong demand.\nOur PRO paint business achieved strong double-digit growth this quarter as consumers become more comfortable allowing professional paint contractors into their homes.\nWe expect demand in this channel to remain robust and now anticipate low-double digit growth for the PRO paint business for the full year, up from our previous projection of high-single digits, as PRO paint contractors' order books continue to expand.\nOur builders' hardware and lighting businesses both grew this quarter, capitalizing on increased consumer demand.\nSegment operating margins were 22.1% and quarterly operating profit was $188 million, affected by lower volume but partially offset by cost productivity initiatives.\nFor the full year 2021, we now project decorative architectural segment's sales growth to be between 2% and 5%, down from 4% to 9%, due to lower than expected Q2 sales and ongoing raw material constraints.\nWe still anticipate segment operating margins of about 19% as productivity initiatives and pricing help counterbalance higher input costs.\nLet's move to Slide 10.\nOur balance sheet is robust with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.3x.\nWe concluded the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in balance sheet liquidity, including full availability of our $1 billion revolver.\nWorking capital as a percentage of sales, including our recent acquisitions, was 16.9%, an improvement of 120 basis points over the previous year.\nAs mentioned last quarter, we terminated and annuitized our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans in Q2, making a final cash contribution of about $100 million to complete this process.\nThis removes roughly $140 million of pension liabilities from our balance sheet and will improve our free cash flow by approximately $50 million through reduced cash contributions, starting in 2022.\nAdditionally, we received about $166 million from redeeming our preferred stock related to the recent sale of our former cabinet business.\nAs Keith mentioned earlier, we've repurchased 13.1 million shares in 2021 for $750 million as of today.\nWe plan to deploy an additional $250 million for share repurchases or acquisitions for the remainder of this year.\nThese actions collectively demonstrate our confidence in our business and our commitment and ability to further strengthen our balance sheet while aggressively returning capital to shareholders.\nRegarding our full year guidance, we've summarized our updated 2021 expectations on Slide 11.\nBased on our Q2 performance and continued strong demand, we now expect overall sales growth of 14% to 16%, up from 10% to 14%, with operating margins of approximately 17.5%, up from 17%.\nLastly, as Keith mentioned earlier, our

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The third quarter demonstrated our ongoing strategy to invest in North American assets, aiming for reduced costs, sustainable cash flow, and improved returns over extended mine lifespans.\nThe quarter was marked by numerous important developments and choices.\nOur performance aligned with internal projections, positioning us to end the year strongly and meet our initial production targets.\nWhile Mick will provide a detailed operational overview soon, I'll briefly mention a few key points.\nWharf excelled, achieving near-record operating and free cash flow since its acquisition 6.5 years ago.\nPalmarejo and Kensington performed as expected and are set for robust fourth quarters, while Rochester made steady progress despite dedicating 45% of the quarter to preparing the new Stage VI leach pad.\nIt's notable that Rochester's year-to-date results reflect limited stacking on the legacy Stage IV pad due to prioritizing the POA 11 expansion.\nExploration results continue to justify our increased investment in this area.\nWe invested $20 million in exploration during the quarter.\nOur drilling commitment has resulted in significant reserve and resource growth in recent years, and we hope to report further increases by year-end.\nWe plan to invest $70 million in exploration in 2021, nearly 40% more than last year's record, making it one of the largest programs in our industry.\nWe're on track to meet our annual drilling targets while spending slightly less than anticipated, reflecting efficiencies from these expanded programs.\nWe'll provide another exploration update before year-end, focusing on new findings in Nevada, including Rochester and the Crown district in Southern Nevada.\nRegarding our expansion projects, let's start with an update on the Rochester POA 11 expansion.\nThis project remains our top priority and will significantly boost our production and cash flow.\nProgress is steady, with 42% completion at the end of the third quarter.\nBesides finishing the over-liner for the new Stage VI leach pad, we began foundation work for the Merrill Crowe plant and crusher corridor.\nLike many companies, we're experiencing inflationary pressures on remaining unawarded work.\nWe've secured most contracts before the recent cost increases and supply chain disruptions.\nWe're trying to mitigate some impacts by reassessing and rebidding unawarded contracts, but we expect a 10% to 15% overall increase in POA 11 construction costs.\nWe've begun detailed engineering and are considering implementing process improvements, which could extend the crusher completion and commissioning timeline by three to six months.\nWe plan to install pre-screens on the existing crusher in the first half of next year to gain experience for potential incorporation into the new crusher design.\nRegarding Silvertip, the current inflationary environment and pandemic-related disruptions make it challenging to start a new capital project quickly, despite high zinc and lead prices.\nFortunately, the Silvertip expansion and restart is in its early stages, giving us flexibility.\nDespite higher-than-expected capital estimates for an accelerated expansion, we're confident in the Silvertip deposit's quality and potential.\nExploration results and new discoveries have led us to consider a larger Silvertip expansion on a potentially longer timeline.\nGiven the high-grade and significant resource, a 1,750 ton per day facility may not be sufficient to maximize Silvertip's value.\nWe'll take more time to evaluate a larger design's economics and flexibility.\nThis approach allows for continued drilling and resource growth, gives time for macroeconomic factors to stabilize, and lets us focus on delivering POA 11 without straining our finances.\nWe are excited to announce our agreement with Avino Silver & Gold for the sale of the La Preciosa project in Durango, Mexico.\nThis deal has the potential to create valuable synergies with their nearby Avino mine.\nThe transaction aligns with our strategic goals of improving our geopolitical risk profile, diversifying our metal mix, and optimizing our development timeline.\nWe can allocate some of the guaranteed cash payment towards expanding Rochester and funding our promising exploration initiatives.\nThe deal offers significant growth potential through our equity stake, conditional payments, and two retained royalties.\nLet me draw your attention to a series of slides beginning on Slide 17 that showcase our outstanding corporate culture and diversity initiatives at Coeur.\nA successful organization requires alignment between its culture, strategy, and capabilities, which I believe we have achieved in recent years.\nI'd like to commend our HR Director, Emilie Schouten, for her work on diversity, equity, and inclusion, and for her recent S&P Global Platts Rising Star Award in the industry.\nWe are continuously incorporating our ESG efforts into our strategic planning and decision-making processes.\nBefore Mick provides an operational update, I'd like Hans to expand on my Silvertip remarks by presenting a brief overview of the exploration results and explaining our optimism about its future.\nWe acquired Silvertip in late 2017, recognizing its significant growth potential.\nWe've now identified 3.5 kilometers of potential growth based on step-out drilling, more than tripling our knowledge since 2017, as shown on Slide 8.\nThis year, we're conducting the most extensive exploration program in the project's history.\nNotably, Silvertip accounts for about 25% of our total $70 million budget at Coeur.\nThe on-site team, led by Ross Easterbrook, has done an exceptional job managing the 1,000-meter drilling program.\nUnderground drilling has allowed us to explore year-round and examine various parts of the ore body from different angles, which has been crucial to Silvertip's growth narrative.\nEarly 2021 underground drilling led to the discovery of Southern Silver Zone vertical feeder structures and thick manto ore zones, and more recently, vertical feeder structures beneath the Discovery South Zone.\nThese structures indicate significant resource tonnage potential and demonstrate excellent upside.\nWe currently have two active underground rigs and plan to add a third early next year.\nWe also intend to continue using three surface rigs to explore resource growth southward in the 1.5-kilometer gap between Southern Silver and Tour Ridge zones.\nWith this year's larger drilling budget, we anticipate continued significant growth at Silvertip, giving our development team confidence to appropriately scale future operations to match the potentially increased ore body size.\nThe team recently reported drilling the best hole to date, containing 11 mineralized manto horizons.\nThis hole is located beneath Silvertip Mountain, approximately 500 meters or 1,500 feet south of the Southern Silver and Camp Creek zones, in an area currently without defined resources.\nThis new step-out hole is a significant indicator of the growth potential we expect for 2022 and beyond.\nI'll now hand over to Mick.\nBefore delving into operational results, I want to acknowledge the team's continued prioritization of health and safety and their drive for continuous improvement in this area.\nReferring to Slide 24, I'm proud to announce that we recently received the NIOSH Mine Safety and Health Technology Innovation Award for our cross-functional COVID-19 response efforts.\nI'm truly honored to be part of such an exceptional team that is unwavering in its commitment to collaboration and ensuring the well-being of our people.\nNow, turning to Slide 5 to discuss operations, starting with Palmarejo.\nThe team excelled at maintaining high throughput levels and maximizing recoveries to compensate for the lower grades we've encountered with our revised mine plan.\nWe've also continued advancing development while focusing on increasing rehabilitation rates across the mine, which helps ensure we've appropriately prioritized workforce health and safety.\nQuarterly operating costs remained within guidance, helping to offset lower realized prices and generate $15 million in free cash flow.\nWe anticipate a strong conclusion to the year at Palmarejo and are eager to see how much production growth we can achieve in this fourth quarter.\nTransitioning to discuss Rochester.\nWe processed slightly under 1.3 million tons of over-liner for the new Stage VI leach pad in the quarter, fulfilling the necessary requirements for POA 11.\nIt's worth mentioning that while producing over-liner, we weren't crushing materials placed on the existing Stage IV leach pad, which affected production in the third quarter.\nAlthough there was a short-term impact on production, the time and resources used to finish crushing overlay now was a crucial step towards completing this highly anticipated expansion project.\nNow moving on to Kensington.\nOutput increased slightly during the quarter as improved grades helped compensate for reduced mill throughput caused by stope sequencing and drill parts availability issues.\nWe expect more high-grade Jualin material in the coming months and have already received the needed spare parts for stope drills, positioning us well for strong production growth in the fourth quarter.\nThe Kensington team excellently managed multiple priorities and maintained good cost controls throughout the quarter, helping generate nearly $15 million in free cash flow.\nConcluding with Wharf, I'd like to acknowledge a significant achievement.\nOn October 3, the Wharf team celebrated a full year without a recordable safety incident, which is a remarkable accomplishment.\nRegarding results, Wharf delivered another excellent quarter, marking consecutive periods of strong performance.\nGold production increased by 17% and cash flow was the second highest since Coeur's acquisition in 2015.\nI'll now hand over to Tom.\nI wanted to provide some context on the non-cash adjustments that affected our third quarter earnings.\nWe wrote off $26 million of Mexican VAT refunds, which we strongly believe we're entitled to, but like many other multinational companies operating in Mexico, we've faced significant challenges from SAT and the Mexican courts in obtaining these payments.\nWe also had a mark-to-market adjustment on our equity investments, mainly related to Victoria Gold.\nHowever, the investment's carrying value remains above our initial cost.\nMoving to Slide 4, I'll briefly review our quarterly consolidated financial results.\nRevenue of $208 million was driven by relatively stable metal sales and a lower average realized silver price compared to the second quarter.\nOperating cash flow totaled $22 million, which was lower than last quarter but also negatively impacted by changes in working capital.\nExcluding working capital, operating cash flow improved by over 10% quarter-over-quarter.\nLike most companies, we've experienced cost pressures related to consumables and labor across all our operations.\nWith stronger expected Q4 production, we anticipate operating cash flow levels to continue rising as we end the year.\nTurning to Slide 12 and examining the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with approximately $330 million of liquidity, including $85 million in cash and $245 million available under our revolving credit facility.\nIt's worth noting that these figures don't include the $140 million of equity investments on our balance sheet.\nWe made a modest drawdown on the revolver.\nWe ended the period with a net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.4 times.\nWe'll continue adhering to our disciplined capital allocation framework and remain focused on keeping net leverage below 2 times and maintaining liquidity of at least $100 million throughout the entire Rochester construction period.\nHowever, we expect the revised timeline for Silvertip, along with the current strong metals price environment, will leave us well positioned to maintain a robust and flexible balance sheet.\nI'll now return the call to Mitch.\nBefore moving to the Q&A, I want to quickly highlight Slide 13 that outlines our short-term priorities as we approach year-end.\nWith production guidance reaffirmed and a strong expected fourth quarter underway, we're confident about our 2021 results and our ability to carry this momentum into next year.\nWe'll continue striving for a higher standard and execute at a high level to deliver consistent results and industry-leading organic growth from our balanced portfolio of North American-based precious metals assets.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I am Rebecca Gardy, serving as the Vice President of Investor Relations.\nWithin 24 hours, a written record of this financial results conference call will be accessible to investors.\nLet's move on to the third slide.\nThese claims are based on projections and calculations that may be imprecise and involve potential risks.\nThe fourth slide displays our meeting agenda.\nJoining us for today's discussion are Mark Clouse, who holds the positions of President and CEO at Campbell's, along with our CFO, Mick Beekhuizen.\nMark will provide his insights on our overall performance and market presence for each division in the first quarter.\nMick will provide a more detailed analysis of the quarter's financial results and review our projections for the second quarter.\nWe will conclude the call by answering questions from analysts.\nI feel particularly appreciative this year for everyone at Campbell, especially our factory workers and distribution teams who have been producing and delivering to meet the increased demand caused by the pandemic, while prioritizing employee safety and adhering to our enhanced plant protocols.\nOur impressive revenue growth, combined with improved gross margins and cost-saving synergies, led to better-than-anticipated adjusted EBIT growth of 18% and a 31% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $1.02, despite ongoing COVID-19 related expenses.\nWe also executed well this quarter, improving our supply levels to help retailers boost their inventory in preparation for the critical soup and holiday season.\nFurthermore, our Board approved a 6% increase in our quarterly dividend, reflecting our strong financial performance, cash flow, and growing confidence in our long-term growth prospects, as well as our ongoing commitment to providing returns to shareholders.\nOrganic sales in the first quarter grew by 8%, led by a 12% organic sales increase in Meals & Beverages, reflecting our continued investment in our brands to attract and retain new households as retailers also replenished their inventory.\nOur Snacks Division performed well, with organic sales increasing by 4%, showing sales growth across most of our nine power brands.\nOur diverse and unique snack portfolio remained highly sought after as at-home consumption rapidly increased.\nWe strategically chose to postpone some promotions from the first quarter to later in the year to alleviate supply constraints, particularly in the Meals & Beverages division.\nWhile these decisions led to mixed share results as anticipated, we ended the first quarter in a much better position regarding retailer inventories and are witnessing accelerating market performance as promotional activities ramp up for the key holiday season.\nWe anticipate that the pressure of high demand on supply will persist in the short term, but we are expanding our supply chain capacity and capabilities to help us better manage this pressure and maximize availability while protecting and growing market share.\nFor the sixth consecutive quarter, our total Company in-market dollar performance grew in measured channels, increasing by 7%, with growth across nearly the entire portfolio.\nContinuing the momentum from the latter half of fiscal 2020, October marked the ninth consecutive month of year-over-year growth in household penetration.\nIn our first quarter, we attracted millions of new households, with the most significant increase coming from younger consumers.\nWe also continued to see high repeat purchase rates, with over 70% of households gained since the start of the pandemic buying our products again.\nAs we've mentioned in previous calls, we believe this represents a lasting change in behavior, and given the strengthening consumer trends like quick-scratch cooking and at-home eating and snacking, we remain confident that we will retain a significant number of these households beyond the pandemic.\nIn the Meals & Beverages division, soup net sales increased by 21% with growth across all segments.\nThis reflects retailer inventory recovery, market gains, and reduced promotional activity.\nWe increased our household penetration in overall soup by 1.3 percentage points.\nIn addition to gaining new customers, we are retaining these new buyers as evidenced by higher repeat purchase rates.\nAmong millennials, we grew our share of the total US soup market by nearly 1 percentage point, including significant growth of 2.7 points in condensed soups and over 1 point in ready-to-serve varieties, demonstrating the continued relevance of our core products with younger consumers.\nOur condensed soups were the standout performer of the quarter, with double-digit net sales growth, market share gains led by cooking products, and 4 million new households purchasing this quarter compared to the previous year.\nWe continued to introduce new ideas and recipes to consumers who are cooking more frequently at home.\nAs these novice cooks gain confidence, we believe they will likely continue to use these skills to prepare more meals at home, even after the pandemic.\nOur recipe solutions continue to resonate with consumers, as we saw a 20% increase in overall recipe-related page views in the first quarter compared to the previous year.\nIn the ready-to-serve category, we saw solid consumption growth, but supply pressure and our decision to reduce promotions as previously mentioned resulted in some short-term market share loss.\nHowever, as supply has improved, we are seeing positive trends, supported by our Chunky NFL sponsorship activation, our Slow Kettle Crunch innovation, and our Well Yes! brand.\nWe expect all these factors to have a very positive impact in the second quarter.\nOur Pacific Foods growth engine performed well as we continued to expand, with nearly 22% dollar consumption growth in soup and broth during the quarter.\nPacific soup and broth increased market share for the fourth consecutive quarter, including strong gains among millennials.\nPacific has also increased its distribution points and grew household penetration as we launched our first-ever national advertising campaign.\nOverall, we continue to feel very positive about the progress we've made in our Win in Soup strategy, as evidenced by our success in expanding into millions of new households, attracting younger consumers, and growing all of our core brands.\nRegarding the performance of our Snacks power brands, they grew dollar consumption by 6% in the quarter.\nThe most notable was Late July, which grew consumption sales by 26% and increased market share by nearly 2 percentage points.\nThroughout the quarter, we maintained the company's inaugural nationwide advertising campaign.\nLate July exemplifies how our leading brands are enhancing consumers' snacking experiences.\nWe elevate a common category like tortilla chips by offering superior quality products with organic credentials, relevant innovations, and top-notch marketing to engage customers better, enabling them to upgrade their snacking experience.\nThis strategy has been effectively applied to other products, such as Kettle Brand chips and Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps, both of which experienced double-digit growth in dollar consumption during the quarter.\nWe made considerable progress with Goldfish in the quarter, improving both supply and service levels.\nWe've also shifted our marketing focus towards at-home snacking options and resumed promotional spending near the end of the quarter.\nThese actions have resulted in improved consumption and market share in recent periods.\nWe're pleased with our Snacks division's performance and the consistent growth it delivers, supported by a robust core business.\nFurthermore, we remain on track to achieve the synergy-related cost savings we initially outlined following our acquisition of Snyder's-Lance.\nOur investment in expanding capacity for both Goldfish and our chips demonstrates our confidence in the long-term growth potential of our brands.\nWe're still addressing some supply constraints, including a challenge in cookies where demand and COVID-19-related labor issues have negatively impacted supply.\nDespite these isolated challenges, we're confident in our ability to meet long-term demand driven by the expected sustained growth in consumer snacking behavior.\nGiven the rapid growth of e-commerce in the food sector, I'd like to discuss our overall performance in this channel during the quarter.\nOur e-commerce in-market dollar consumption results were once again impressive, growing 85% compared to the previous year.\nConsumers' use of e-commerce, particularly click-and-collect for groceries, has increased significantly in recent months, and we believe this trend will continue.\nConsequently, we're investing to enhance our capabilities and support key partnerships to serve the millions of consumers shopping online.\nConsidering our overall financial results and the actions we've taken at the start of the year, we're well-positioned across our entire portfolio heading into Q2 and the key soup and holiday season.\nAs Mark just mentioned, we had a strong start to fiscal 2021 with another quarter of robust sales growth, driven by increased consumer demand, gross margin expansion despite COVID-19 cost challenges, and substantial adjusted EBIT and adjusted earnings per share growth exceeding expectations.\nI'll now provide a more detailed review of our first quarter results and offer guidance for the second quarter.\nIn the first quarter, reported net sales increased 7% to $2.3 billion.\nOrganic net sales grew 8% in the quarter, excluding the impact of the European chips business sale.\nAdjusted EBIT rose 18% to $463 million, as higher sales volumes, improved adjusted gross margin performance, and lower selling expenses were partially offset by increased marketing and slightly higher adjusted administrative expenses.\nAdjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 31%, or $0.24, to $1.02 per share, reflecting an increase in adjusted EBIT and lower net interest expense.\nAnalyzing our net sales performance for the quarter, organic net sales increased 8% from the previous year.\nThis performance was driven by a 6-point gain in volume across most of our retail brands, partially offset by declines in foodservice.\nReduced promotional spending in both segments contributed a 2-point gain.\nThe divestiture of the European chips business negatively impacted net sales by 1 point, while currency translation had a neutral impact.\nOverall, our reported net sales increased by 7% compared to the previous year.\nOur adjusted gross margin improved by 100 basis points in the quarter to 34.8%.\nFavorable product mix, primarily due to increased contribution from soup products in our Meals & Beverages segment, drove a 30 basis point improvement in our adjusted gross margin.\nWe estimate a 60 basis point gross margin improvement from better operating leverage within our supply chain network, as we significantly increased overall production, mainly in Meals & Beverages.\nNet pricing led to a 120 basis point improvement, due to reduced promotional spending in the quarter.\nInflation and other factors negatively impacted the margin by 270 basis points, driven by cost inflation, as overall input prices increased by approximately 2%, as well as other operational costs and ongoing COVID-19 related expenses.\nThis was partially offset by our continuing supply chain productivity program, which contributed a 150 basis point improvement, including initiatives in procurement and logistics optimization.\nOur cost savings program, which is separate from our ongoing supply chain productivity program, added 10 basis points to our gross margin expansion.\nRegarding other operating items, marketing and selling expenses increased 1% in the quarter to $208 million.\nThis increase was primarily due to our planned increase in advertising and consumer promotion expenses, which rose 17% compared to last year.\nThese investments mainly reflect increased support for soup to drive usage, inspire meal solutions, build brand awareness among younger households, and support innovation.\nThese investments were partially offset by the benefits of our cost savings initiatives, lower marketing overhead, and reduced selling expenses.\nAdjusted administrative expenses increased by $11 million or 9% to $137 million, driven by higher benefit costs and general administrative expenses, including additional consulting charges related to supply chain optimization, as well as inflation, partially offset by the benefits from our cost savings initiatives.\nWe have continued to successfully deliver on our multi-year enterprise cost savings initiatives.\nIn the first quarter, we realized $15 million in additional year-over-year cost savings, including synergies from Snyder's-Lance.\nOur total savings for the program have reached $740 million so far.\nWe anticipate an extra $60-70 million in savings for the remainder of fiscal 2021 and are on schedule to meet our cumulative savings goal of $850 million by the end of fiscal 2022.\nWe're providing an adjusted EBIT comparison to showcase the main factors influencing this quarter's performance.\nAs mentioned, adjusted EBIT increased by 18%.\nThis growth was primarily due to higher demand for our products, with sales increases contributing $53 million to EBIT growth.\nThe overall adjusted gross margin improvement of 100 basis points added $23 million to EBIT growth, which surpassed the $2 million increase in marketing and selling expenses resulting from our A&C investments, partially offset by reduced selling costs.\nThe combined effect of other factors, including adjusted administrative expenses, R&D, and adjusted other income, was insignificant.\nOur adjusted EBIT margin grew by 180 basis points year-over-year, reaching 19.8%.\nThe following diagram illustrates the breakdown of our adjusted earnings per share growth between operational performance and below-the-line items.\nAdjusted earnings per share rose by $0.24, from $0.78 in the previous year's quarter to $1.02 per share.\nAdjusted EBIT contributed a positive $0.18 impact on adjusted EPS.\nNet interest expense decreased by $25 million year-over-year, providing a $0.06 positive impact on adjusted EPS, as we used proceeds from completed divestitures and our strong cash flow to reduce debt.\nThe impact of the adjusted tax rate was minimal, completing the explanation for the $1.02 per share figure.\nIn the Meals & Beverages segment, organic net sales grew by 12% to $1.3 billion, reflecting double-digit increases across most U.S. retail products, including gains in U.S. soups (including Pacific Foods soups and broth), Prego pasta sauces, V8 beverages, Campbell's pasta, and Pace Mexican sauces, as well as growth in Canada, partially offset by declines in foodservice.\nVolume increased in U.S. retail and Canada, driven by higher demand for at-home food consumption, partially offset by the negative impact on foodservice due to changes in consumer behavior and ongoing COVID-19 related restrictions.\nU.S. soup sales, including Pacific, increased by 21% compared to the previous year due to retailers restocking inventory for the upcoming soup season, in-market gains in condensed soups and broth, and reduced promotional spending.\nOperating earnings for Meals & Beverages increased by 18% to $333 million.\nThe increase was mainly driven by sales volume growth and improved gross margin, partially offset by increased marketing investment.\nGross margin performance was affected by lower promotional spending and favorable mix, as productivity improvements and improved operating leverage were offset by other operational costs, cost inflation, and COVID-19 related expenses.\nIn the Snacks segment, organic sales grew by 4%, primarily due to reduced promotional spending and healthy velocity across most of the base business.\nWe observed volume gains in fresh bakery products, Late July snacks, Pop Secret popcorn, Pepperidge Farm cookies, Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps, and Kettle Brand potato chips, which partially offset declines in Lance sandwich crackers.\nGoldfish cracker sales remained relatively stable during the quarter, as increased demand for family-size products was offset by reduced away-from-home consumption.\nOperating earnings for Snacks increased by 11%, driven by lower selling expenses, reduced marketing overhead, and sales volume gains, partially offset by higher administrative expenses.\nGross margin performance was consistent with the previous year, as lower promotional spending was offset by higher net supply chain costs, with productivity improvements, cost-saving initiatives, and improved operating leverage being outweighed by cost inflation and COVID-19 related expenses.\nNow, I'll discuss our cash flow and liquidity.\nOperating cash flow was $180 million, comparable to the previous year, as changes in working capital were largely offset by higher cash earnings and lower other cash payments.\nCash from investing activities decreased by $341 million, mainly due to the absence of net proceeds from divested businesses in the prior year.\nCapital expenditures totaled $74 million, $24 million lower than the previous year due to discontinued operations, and in line with our previously communicated full-year expectation.\nCash outflows for financing activities were $245 million, compared to $453 million a year ago.\nThe reduced cash outflow reflects lower debt repayments.\nDividend payments of $108 million were comparable to the previous year, reflecting our current quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share.\nWe ended the quarter with $722 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nNow, I'll discuss our guidance.\nAs reviewed, the Company's strong first quarter fiscal 2021 results were influenced by increased demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe ongoing impact of the pandemic on the Company's fiscal 2021 results is uncertain, making it challenging to provide a full-year outlook at this time.\nBased on our expectation of continued elevated demand and increased investment in our brands, we are providing the following guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2021.\nWe anticipate year-over-year net sales growth of 5% to 7%, as growth aligns more closely with consumption, reflecting improved inventory, strong programming, and improving market share positions.\nWe expect adjusted EBIT growth to be in line with year-over-year sales growth for the quarter as we invest to succeed in the season and continue fueling the retention of new households behind key consumer trends.\nWe anticipate the combination of healthy EBIT growth and the benefit of significantly reduced interest expense year-over-year to result in adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% to 15%, or $0.81 to $0.83 per share.\nWhile it remains challenging to provide more guidance for the rest of the year, our outlook continues to strengthen as time progresses.\nIn conclusion, our first-quarter results marked a strong start to the year.\nI am proud of the continued strong execution by our teams throughout the organization.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We eagerly anticipate sharing our Q3 2021 results with you today.\nAlan Colberg (CEO), Keith Demmings (President), and Richard Dziadzio (CFO) are participating in Assurant's conference call.\nWe released a statement announcing our Q3 2021 results after the market closed yesterday.\nYou can find the press release and accompanying financial supplement on our website, assurant.com.\nThe call will begin with comments from Alan, Keith, and Richard, followed by a question-and-answer session.\nWe will reference non-GAAP financial measures during today's call, which we consider important for assessing the company's performance.\nOur Q3 results were impressive, with Global Lifestyle experiencing double-digit growth in operating earnings.\nThe performance of our Global Automotive and Connected Living offerings continues to support our long-term strategy of concentrating on our higher-growth, fee-based, and capital-light businesses.\nWe are making strides in creating a more sustainable company for all stakeholders.\nSeveral key achievements were made during the quarter.\nAssurant received its first Bronze accreditation from EcoVadis, a major sustainability ratings firm, placing us among the top 50% of 75,000 participating companies.\nWe also increased transparency regarding our progress towards a more diverse and inclusive workplace by disclosing our EEO-1, which provides gender, race, and ethnicity data by job category for our U.S.-based employees.\nWe believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce is essential for fostering innovation, which is crucial for maintaining our long-term outperformance.\nExamining our financial performance for the year so far, net operating income per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, was $8.75, a 12% increase compared to the same period last year.\nNet operating income and adjusted EBITDA, both excluding catastrophes, increased by 10% to $528 million and $862 million, respectively.\nThese results support our full-year forecast of 10% to 14% growth in net operating income per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, marking our fifth consecutive year of strong profitable growth.\nBased on year-to-date results and our expectations for Q4, we anticipate finishing the year closer to the upper half of this range.\nWe have also completed our three-year $1.35 billion capital return objective from our 2019 Investor Day, one quarter ahead of schedule.\nFollowing the sale of Global Preneed in August, we have made significant progress in returning an additional $900 million to shareholders.\nOur 2021 earnings per share outlook is based on at least high single-digit net operating income growth, excluding catastrophes, as well as share repurchases.\nRegarding our business performance, Global Lifestyle is on track to achieve double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in 2021 from $637 million in 2020, driven by Global Automotive and Connected Living.\nWe have benefited from the stable recurring revenue stream of our installed base of mobile subscribers and our success in launching additional offerings and capabilities for mobile carrier, cable operator, OEM, and retail clients globally.\nOur mobile trade-in upgrade business and expanded service delivery options are increasingly important to our profitability and providing a differentiated and superior customer experience.\nIn Global Automotive, we have benefited from increased scale, growing the number of vehicles we protect by 20%, to over 52 million since The Warranty Group acquisition in 2018.\nWe believe Auto will continue to be one of our key growth businesses in the future.\nGlobal Housing is on track for another year of better than market returns, with an annualized operating ROE of nearly 15% for the first nine months of this year.\nThis includes $113 million of catastrophe losses, demonstrating the superior returns of this differentiated business.\nOur counter-cyclical lender-placed insurance business remains an integral part of the U.S. mortgage industry framework.\nAs we renew existing clients and add new partners in lender-placed insurance, we will continue to enhance the experience through the ongoing rollout of our single-source processing platform.\nOur Multifamily Housing business now supports over 2.5 million renters across the U.S. and has more than doubled earnings since 2015 through our strong partnerships with affinity and property management company clients.\nOur investments in digital capabilities, such as our Cover 360 property management solution, continue to drive more value for our partners and enhance the customer experience.\nWe believe our portfolio of high-growth, fee-based, capital-light offerings and high-return Specialty P&C businesses sets us apart as a long-term outperformer and sustained value creator for our shareholders.\nI am humbled by our 15,000 employees, whose dedication to serving our clients and 300 million customers worldwide has successfully transformed Assurant.\nTogether, we have significantly strengthened our Fortune 300 company, which should continue to deliver above-market growth and superior cash flow.\nWith our President, Keith Demmings, succeeding me as CEO in January, I am confident Assurant will accelerate our strategy and continue to differentiate our superior customer experience, further deepening client relationships.\nI have been fortunate to have had a front-row seat and a role in supporting Alan's vision and the transformation of Assurant.\nAlan has continued to evolve the purpose of our company to drive value for all stakeholders: customers, employees, communities, and shareholders.\nHis impact on our people and the overall culture of our company has been exemplary.\nI appreciate Alan's personal mentorship and partnership and wish him the best in his retirement.\nAs we build on Assurant's momentum over the long-term, I believe our talent and innovation will be critical factors in achieving success and growth, especially as we focus more on the convergence around the connected consumer.\nAssurant has developed a deep and diverse bench of internal leaders.\nI recently announced our refreshed Management Committee effective in January, including two new leadership appointments demonstrating our strong bench.\nKeith Meier, our current President of International, will succeed Gene Mergelmeyer as Chief Operating Officer, as Gene will be retiring at year-end.\nGene's significant contributions to Assurant over the last 30+ years, including as COO for the past five years, have been instrumental in creating market-leading positions, producing profitable growth, and transforming the organization.\nKeith Meier brings nearly 25 years of experience at Assurant to the COO role.\nSince 2016, as President of Assurant International, he has driven growth across our global markets, most recently with strong success in Asia Pacific.\nIn his new role, Keith will focus on advancing Assurant's business strategy and market leadership positions, as well as identifying additional opportunities to deliver a superior customer experience.\nMartin Jenns will become President of Global Automotive.\nWith over 30 years of experience, he currently leads the transformation and growth strategy for Auto and has been instrumental in introducing innovative new products like EB-1, our electric vehicle warranty protection.\nIn addition to emerging opportunities and innovation, Martin will focus on driving growth and improving the customer experience, including working with our partners to deliver best-in-class dealer training.\nThese two new appointments, along with recent appointments of Biju Nair as President of Connected Living and Manny Becerra as our Chief Innovation Officer, as well as the other management committee members, represent a strong team to help lead us into the future.\nInnovation, alongside talent, is a crucial asset for the organization's strength.\nThe company's growth and expansion are facilitated not just by creating new digital products for clients, but also through novel approaches.\nThis quarter, innovation played a significant role in Connected Living, particularly through ongoing improvements to mobile service delivery options.\nAs part of a recently extended multi-year agreement with T-Mobile, Assurant is broadening its services to enhance the experience for millions of T-Mobile customers.\nStarting November 1st, Assurant is collaborating with T-Mobile to launch nationwide in-store device repair services at about 500 locations, provided by Assurant's certified repair specialists.\nWe have also moved all former Sprint protection subscribers to the new T-Mobile Device protection plan.\nConsequently, our mobile device count has significantly increased, reaching approximately 63 million as of November 1st.\nThe expansion of our service delivery options is vital for maintaining our competitive edge.\nWe recently renewed a multi-year contract with Spectrum Mobile, continuing to offer a comprehensive mobile solution and Pocket Geek on-device diagnostic tool.\nThe renewal also includes expanding the offering to include Pocket Geek privacy, allowing consumers to better safeguard and control their personal information online through various features.\nThis exemplifies how we can grow by enhancing services and capabilities for existing clients.\nFurthermore, the mobile business continues to see high attachment rates due to increased reliance on mobile devices and rising device prices.\nOur fee-based trade-in and upgrade business, including the recent acquisitions of Hyla and Alegre, has performed exceptionally well this year as we enter the early stages of the 5G upgrade cycle.\nNearly a year after the Hyla acquisition, I'm pleased to report that it has exceeded expectations, performing better than the low-teens forward EBITDA it was valued on.\nWith the increasing availability and popularity of 5G-enabled smartphones, we anticipate continued growth in our 30-plus trade-in and upgrade programs.\nOur progress is evident in our ability to manage large-scale programs with superior technology.\nThis is further bolstered by improving our attach rates for trade-in programs as our clients' promotional efforts encourage consumers to upgrade.\nOverall, we have processed nearly 18 million devices so far this year, reducing electronic waste and increasing digital access with high-quality, affordable phones.\nThe scale and capabilities of our trade-in and upgrade programs provide an additional source of profits and improve client economics and customer retention.\nThis quarter, we are delighted to announce a multi-year contract extension with AT&T to manage their device trade-in program.\nThis includes providing analytics as well as device collection and processing for all of AT&T's sales channels, including retail, B2B, dealer, and direct-to-consumer.\nAT&T was a key client acquired through the Hyla acquisition, and we look forward to continuing our partnership, especially as we support the growing adoption of 5G-enabled devices.\nIn Global Automotive, policies increased by 4 million or 8% year-over-year, with production well above pre-pandemic levels as we leverage our scale and talent.\nSo far this year, the business has also benefited from strong used car growth, which tends to generate earnings faster than new car sales.\nThis, combined with the fact that earnings from the business are recognized over multiple years, provides good visibility into the future performance of the business.\nAs we drive innovation within Auto, we continued the global rollout of EV-1, an electric vehicle and hybrid protection product, to North America.\nEV-1 has now been launched in seven countries.\nAlthough the electric vehicle market is still in its early stages, our EV-1 product will allow Assurant to better assess customer demand and use our insights to position us well for the expected increase in electric vehicle adoption in the future.\nOur Multifamily Housing business grew policies by 7% year-over-year, driven by growth in our affinity partners and PMC relationships, where we continue to roll out our innovative Cover 360 product.\nAdditionally, we have seen other digital investments create opportunities for future growth.\nOur newly designed digital sales portal, which simplifies and accelerates the process for residents to sign up for a policy, is driving significantly higher product attachment rates.\nOur new portal has seen an increase in conversion rates compared to our legacy website since its introduction last year.\nIn conclusion, our ability to strengthen insurance talent and innovation, supported by critical investments, has and should continue to drive momentum for the future.\nAs Alan mentioned, we are pleased with our third quarter performance, which reflects strong growth across Global Lifestyle and solid earnings in Global Housing.\nFor the quarter, we reported net operating income per share excluding reportable catastrophes of $2.73, a 5% increase from the prior year period.\nExcluding catastrophes, net operating income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter each increased 4% to $162 million and $262 million, respectively.\nLet's now discuss segment results, starting with Global Lifestyle.\nThis segment reported net operating income of $124 million in the third quarter, with continued earnings expansion within Connected Living's mobile business.\nIn Global Automotive, earnings increased $8 million or 21% due to continued global growth in our U.S. national dealer and third-party administrator channels, including contributions from our AFAS and international OEM channels.\nBetter loss experience in select ancillary products and higher investment income also contributed to earnings growth in the quarter.\nConnected Living earnings increased by $6 million or 9% year-over-year.\nThe increase was primarily driven by continued mobile subscriber growth in North America and improved performance in Asia Pacific, as well as higher trading volumes, led by contributions from our Hyla acquisition and carrier promotions.\nThis quarter, Global Automotive and Connected Living results also included a modest one-time tax benefit that improved earnings.\nFor the quarter, Lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA increased 17% to $177 million.\nThis reflects the segment's increased amortization resulting from higher deal-related intangibles from more recent transactions in mobile and Global Automotive.\nIT depreciation expense also increased, stemming from higher investments.\nRegarding revenues, Lifestyle revenues increased by $158 million or 9%.\nThis was primarily driven by continued growth in Connected Living and Global Automotive.\nWithin Connected Living, revenue increased 10%, boosted by mobile fee income driven by strong trade-in volumes, including contributions from Hyla.\nTrade-in volumes were supported by new phone introductions and carrier promotions related to the introduction of new 5G devices.\nHigher revenue from growth in domestic mobile subscribers was offset by declines in run-off mobile programs.\nThe number of mobile subscribers increased slightly compared to the previous year but remained stable year-to-date, as moderate growth in North America was counterbalanced by declines elsewhere due to three main reasons.\nThe first factor was the loss of 750,000 subscribers from a discontinued European banking program, which is not expected to significantly impact profitability.\nSecondly, existing programs in Asia Pacific experienced slower subscriber growth.\nThirdly, Latin America's recovery from the pandemic has been slower than anticipated.\nIn the Global Automotive sector, revenue grew by 8%, reflecting robust sales of vehicle service contracts in previous periods.\nThe automotive industry maintained high sales levels in the third quarter, benefiting our business as evidenced by a 12% increase in our net written premium compared to last year.\nHowever, we have observed this trend beginning to normalize as we enter the fourth quarter.\nFor the entire year, Lifestyle revenues are projected to show modest growth compared to last year's $7.3 billion, primarily driven by expansion in Global Auto and Connected Living.\nWe continue to anticipate Global Lifestyle's net operating income for 2021 to grow by high single digits compared to 2020.\nThe segment's adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase by double digits year-over-year, outpacing the growth of segment net operating income.\nAs previously disclosed, we initiated our investment in [Technical Issues] capability this quarter.\nNevertheless, due to the timing of the implementation, the majority of the associated start-up costs will be incurred in the third quarter.\nThese expenses are primarily related to hiring technicians and sourcing parts.\nWe anticipate these costs will have a significant impact on Connected Living's profitability as we conclude the year.\nFurthermore, we expect our effective tax rate to return to a more typical level of approximately 23%.\nLooking forward to 2022, we anticipate continued earnings growth, albeit at a more moderate pace as we continue to invest in expansion, including additional implementation and start-up costs for in-store service and repair.\nIn the Global Housing segment, net operating income excluding catastrophe losses was $81 million for the third quarter, while including the $78 million of pre-announced catastrophe losses mainly from Hurricane Ida, net operating income totaled $3 million.\nExcluding catastrophe losses, earnings decreased by $19 million due to expected higher non-catastrophe losses, which returned to levels more consistent with historical averages.\nIt's important to note that the favorable non-catastrophe losses in 2020 were not representative of historical trends, and the third quarter of 2020 marked the lowest point of that year, primarily driven by loss experience within lender-placed and specialty products.\nThe year-over-year earnings decline was almost entirely due to unfavorable non-catastrophe loss experience resulting from several factors.\nThe primary driver, accounting for nearly half of the increase, was the anticipated normalization of the non-catastrophe loss ratio.\nThe remainder of the decline was evenly split between increased reserves related to our Specialty P&C offerings, mainly in our on-demand sharing economy business, and higher claims severity.\nClaims severity included moderate impacts from inflationary factors such as increased labor and material costs.\nWhile there is typically a delay, if this trend persists, we expect higher loss costs to be offset by increased rates over time.\nIn Multifamily Housing, underlying growth was counterbalanced by increased investments to enhance our customer experience, including our digital-first capability.\nGlobal Housing revenue decreased slightly year-over-year due to lower Specialty P&C revenues, a catastrophe reinstatement premium resulting from Hurricane Ida, and lower REO volumes in lender-placed insurance.\nThis decline was partially offset by higher average insured values and premium rates in lender-placed insurance, as well as growth in Multifamily Housing.\nWe maintain our expectation that Global Housing's net operating income, excluding catastrophes, will remain flat for the full year compared to 2020.\nFor the fourth quarter and into 2022, we anticipate non-catastrophe losses to continue exceeding 2020 levels but aligning with year-to-date 2021 experience, which is consistent with long-term trends.\nWe continue to monitor REO foreclosure moratoriums and any potential additional extensions that may be announced.\nAt the Corporate level, the net operating loss was $21 million, an improvement of $4 million compared to the third quarter of 2020.\nThis improvement was driven by two factors.\nFirst, there were lower employee-related expenses and third-party fees.\nSecond, we realized expense savings associated with reducing our real estate footprint.\nIn the fourth quarter, we anticipate a higher loss due to the timing of expenditures.\nFor the full year 2021, we now project the Corporate net operating loss to be approximately $80 million, driven by favorable year-to-date results, mainly from one-time tax and real estate joint venture benefits in the second quarter.\nThis is an improvement from our previous estimate of $85 million.\nLooking ahead to 2022, we expect our net operating loss in Corporate to be closer to $90 million, more in line with historical trends.\nRegarding holding company liquidity, including the net proceeds from the sale of Preneed in August, we concluded the third quarter with over $1.3 billion, significantly above our current minimum target level.\nIn the third quarter, dividends from operating segments totaled $127 million.\nIn addition to our regular corporate and interest expenses, we had outflows from three main items: $323 million in share repurchases, $39 million in common stock dividends, and $11 million primarily related to Assurant Ventures investments.\nWe have not only completed our 2019 Investor Day objective of returning $1.35 billion to shareholders from 2019 through 2021 but have also completed approximately one-quarter of our goal to return $900 million in Global Preneed sale proceeds through share repurchases.\nFor the year overall, we continue to expect dividends to approximate segment earnings, subject to business growth, rating agency and regulatory capital requirements, and investment portfolio performance.\nI'd like to provide a brief update on Assurant Ventures, our venture capital arm.\nIn the third quarter, three investments in our portfolio went public via SPACs.\nWe are pleased with the results, as the three investments exceeded a 7 times multiple on investment capital under their respective SPAC transaction terms.\nThese transactions, combined with strong performance in the broader ventures portfolio, resulted in a $75 million after-tax gain flowing through net income in the quarter.\nBeyond strong returns, these investments also provide valuable insights into emerging technologies and capabilities within our Connected Consumer businesses.\nIn addition to positioning Assurant for long-term success and growth, he has fostered an environment of inclusion and community, truly representative of our core values of common sense and common decency.\nAlan, we wish you all the best in your well-deserved retirement.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I would like to provide some high-level observations about our company's performance over the past year.\nWe began 2020 with strong momentum, achieving 5.6% organic growth in Q1, but the COVID-19 pandemic then significantly impacted the US economy.\nDespite uncertainty, we were confident in our team's resilience and ability to innovate solutions for our customers.\nWe successfully transitioned over 10,000 employees to remote work within a week, allowing them to continue serving clients effectively.\nOur growth slowed in Q2 due to pandemic effects on new business and revenue adjustments for liability policies, though margins still expanded.\nWe delivered excellent results in Q3 with robust organic growth and margin improvements.\nQ4 performance was similar to Q3, ending the year on a strong note with good momentum for 2021.\nGiven the circumstances in April, I would have considered it unlikely but possible that we'd achieve full-year organic growth and significant margin expansion.\nWe are very satisfied with our 2020 results.\nOur employees' hard work and customer dedication enabled us to achieve these outcomes.\n2020 demonstrated our commitment to providing innovative risk solutions.\nWe anticipated M&A activity would decrease for several quarters until economic stability returned.\nThe slowdown lasted only about one quarter, with industry-wide activity now back to pre-pandemic levels.\nDespite uncertainty, we completed 25 acquisitions totaling $197 million in annual acquired revenue.\nI'd like to highlight two key acquisitions: CoverHound in Q4 and O'Leary Insurances announced in Q4 and finalized on January 14th.\nThe CoverHound acquisition will benefit us in several ways.\nIt will enhance our technology investments, drive innovation, and improve carrier connectivity.\nIt will allow us to more efficiently provide quotes and coverage for our National Programs segment.\nIt will help us better serve smaller retail segment customers.\nThese improvements aim to enhance customer experience by offering tailored quotes that best meet their needs.\nWe believe these new capabilities are unmatched in the market.\nWe began 2020 by acquiring Special Risk in British Columbia and concluded with O'Leary Insurances in Ireland.\nO'Leary was Ireland's largest independently-owned retail broker.\nThis acquisition bolsters our European operations, which we plan to expand in coming years.\nOur new team members and capabilities will create many future opportunities.\nWe're very proud of our 2020 results and delivering over 20% total shareholder returns.\nSteve Boyd will become our Wholesale President.\nSteve's experience in National Programs operations and technology brings valuable skills to the Wholesale leadership as we continue growing through innovative solutions.\nI'm eager for Tony and Steve to collaborate on driving future growth.\nLet's now review our quarterly and annual results.\nReferring to Slide 3, we achieved strong results this quarter with total revenue of $642 million, growing 10.9% overall and 4.7% organically.\nI'll provide more details on segment performance shortly.\nOur EBITDAC margin was 27.1%, up 10 basis points from Q4 2019.\nNote that Q4 2019 included a business sale gain that improved the prior year margin by about 100 basis points.\nQ4 net income per share was $0.34, a 25% increase as reported.\nAdjusted net income per share, excluding changes in estimated acquisition earn-out payables, was $0.32, up 14.3% year-over-year.\nOur team excellently managed profitable revenue growth and expenses in response to COVID-19 challenges.\nWe completed nine more acquisitions this quarter with approximately $80 million in annual revenues.\nFor the full year, total revenues grew 9.2% with 3.8% organic growth.\nThis is an exceptional performance given the economic challenges throughout most of the year.\nWe improved our EBITDAC margin by 110 basis points to 31.1% compared to 2019, leveraging organic revenue growth and managing expenses during the pandemic.\nFull-year 2020 net income per share increased 20.7% to $1.69 from $1.40 in 2019.\nAdjusted net income per share, excluding acquisition earn-out changes, rose 19.3%.\nLastly, we had another strong M&A year, closing 25 acquisitions with about $197 million in annual revenue, adding many excellent businesses and team members.\nMoving to Slide 5, we've previously discussed factors affecting economic recovery, including elections, vaccine approval and distribution, and additional stimulus measures.\nVaccine rollout timing and further stimulus approval will most impact economic recovery and influence business leaders' confidence in rehiring and investment.\nIn Q4, we continued to see some companies thriving while others struggled significantly.\nWe've observed improving new business, and our retention remains good.\nHowever, we anticipate a choppy recovery through at least late 2021, possibly into early 2022.\nRegarding rates, Q4 was very similar to Q3, with most standard rates up 3-7% and E&S rates up 10-25% year-over-year.\nAs mentioned before, loss experience remains the primary driver of rate increases.\nCommercial auto rates are still up 10% or more, while workers' compensation rates are declining less rapidly than before but remain negative.\nThere's been considerable discussion about workers' compensation rates turning positive in recent quarters.\nNevertheless, we haven't observed this trend universally yet.\nFrom an E&S standpoint, coastal properties, including both wind and earthquake coverage, have seen increases of 15% to 25%.\nProfessional liability coverage has generally risen by 10% to 25%, varying based on the specific industry and coverage type.\nWe still notice exceptions to the desired coverage.\nPersonal insurance in California, Florida, and Gulf Coast states remains under significant pressure as insurers aim to reduce their exposure due to fires and tropical events in 2020.\nWe anticipate the decrease in personal lines capacity will persist throughout 2021.\nSecuring coverage for many lines, certain industries, or clients with substantial losses continues to be difficult.\nThis includes excess or umbrella coverage, where insurers may seek a combination of lower limits and higher premium rates.\nWe don't foresee this trend changing significantly in 2021.\nLet's examine the performance of our four segments.\nOur Retail segment experienced organic revenue growth of 1.5% in the fourth quarter.\nAs mentioned in our third quarter earnings call, timing factors benefited growth by about 100 basis points in the third quarter but negatively affected growth in the fourth quarter.\nOur fourth quarter results were driven by new business, improved customer retention, and premium rate increases, but were impacted by reduced exposure units due to the pandemic.\nWe consider the fourth quarter performance good, given our 7% organic growth in the same quarter last year and considering the timing headwind mentioned earlier.\nFull-year organic revenue growth was 2.4%, which we view as a good result given the challenging economic environment.\nOur National Programs segment achieved 14.1% organic growth, delivering another exceptional quarter.\nOur growth was fueled by strong new business, retention, and rate increases.\nSome top-performing programs included lender-placed insurance, commercial and residential earthquake, wind, and personal property coverage.\nFor the full year, our National Programs segment achieved impressive organic growth of 12.3%.\nOur Wholesale Brokerage segment saw 5.8% organic growth for the quarter.\nWe experienced strong new business and continued rate increases across most coverage lines.\nBrokerage was again the fastest-growing area, while our binding authority and personal lines businesses faced ongoing challenges due to economic conditions and carrier appetites mentioned earlier.\nFor the full year, our Wholesale Brokerage segment achieved 5.5% organic growth, marking another successful year.\nOrganic revenue for our Services segment decreased by 50 basis points in the fourth quarter, showing significant improvement from recent quarters.\nThe main factors suppressing growth continue to be lower claims volume in our Social Security and Medicare Set-aside advocacy businesses.\nThis decline was largely offset by revenue generated from processing claims related to weather events in the third and fourth quarters.\nFor the full year, organic revenue decreased by 10.9%, primarily due to fewer claims in our Social Security Advocacy business, certain terminated customer contracts, and the pandemic's impact.\nWhile not yet positive, we believe the fourth quarter marked a turning point, and we expect modest organic growth in 2021.\nOur profit margin before taxes expanded by 1.3 percentage points and increased more rapidly than EBITDAC, primarily due to adjustments in projected acquisition payouts.\nLet's proceed to Slide 11.\nThe National Programs division boosted overall revenue by $25.3 million or 18.9%, with organic revenue growth of 14.1%.\nThe rise in total revenue was attributed to recent acquisitions and robust organic growth across numerous programs.\nThe 19% growth rate aligned with the increase in total revenue.\nThe benefits of strong organic revenue growth and efficient variable cost management were counterbalanced by higher internal IT charges and reduced contingent commissions.\nPre-tax income rose by $20.3 million or 54%, outpacing EBITDAC growth due to decreased acquisition earn-out liabilities, partially offset by increased internal interest expenses.\nMoving to Slide 12.\nThe Wholesale Brokerage division achieved total revenue growth of 19.2% and organic revenue growth of 5.8%.\nTotal revenue increased faster than organic revenue due to recent acquisitions, while contingent commissions remained largely unchanged year-over-year.\nEBITDAC grew by 17.1% with a slight margin decrease of 0.4 percentage points compared to the previous year, despite good organic growth and reduced variable expenses in response to COVID-19.\nThese gains were more than offset by changes in foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, higher internal IT charges.\nOur pre-tax income increased by 6.2%, which was lower than total revenue growth, mainly due to higher internal interest expenses.\nProceeding to Slide 13.\nBoth total and organic revenues for the Services segment declined by approximately 0.5%, driven by the factors Powell mentioned earlier.\nQuarterly EBITDAC rose by 9.7% due to increased weather-related claims, partially offset by higher internal IT expenses.\nPre-tax income decreased by 23.6% due to a $2.5 million credit in the fourth quarter of 2019 for changes in estimated acquisition earn-out payables that did not recur in 2020.\nMoving on to Slide 14.\nThis slide presents our GAAP results for the full years of 2020 and 2019.\nIn 2020, we generated revenues of $2.6 billion, a 9.2% increase, and earnings per share of $1.69, a 20.7% increase.\nOur EBITDAC grew by 13.5% and our EBITDAC margin expanded by 1.1 percentage points.\nFor the year, our share count increased slightly compared to the previous year, and our dividends paid in 2020 rose by 7.1% compared to 2019.\nProceeding to Slide 15.\nThis slide shows our results excluding changes in estimated acquisition earn-out payables for both years.\nFor the full year 2020, on an adjusted basis, our pre-tax income grew by 18.1%, outpacing EBITDAC growth due to lower interest expenses, and our adjusted net income per share increased by 19.3%.\nIn addition to strong income performance metrics, we also had another robust year for cash conversion due to the strength of our operating model and the diversity of our businesses.\nWe generated $721.6 million in operating cash flow, representing a continued strong conversion rate of 27.6% of revenue.\nWe concluded the year with a strong liquidity position, holding $817 million in cash and cash equivalents, as well as $800 million in accessible capital on our credit facility.\nWith this capital and the cash we expect to generate in 2021, we are well-positioned to fund continued investment in our company.\nWe have a few additional comments regarding our outlook for 2021.\nDuring the third quarter, we were asked about potential margins for 2021 in relation to the COVID-19 savings we experienced in 2020.\nNow, with the year completed and improved visibility into 2021, we anticipate EBITDAC margins could remain stable or increase slightly, considering our variable costs will likely rise as we resume travel and face-to-face customer interactions.\nAs in the past, our leaders will focus on growing profitability.\nRegarding contingent commissions, we expect them to remain relatively flat or decrease slightly in 2021.\nFor taxes, we project our effective tax rate for 2021 to be between 23% and 24%.\nThis estimate does not account for potential changes in federal tax rates being discussed by the new administration.\nWe anticipate interest expenses to increase by $7 million to $9 million compared to 2020, driven by the new bonds issued in September 2020.\nRegarding capital expenditures, we expect a decrease in 2021 to approximately $40 million to $45 million, as we have largely completed the development of our new Daytona Beach campus.\nIn my opening remarks, I mentioned there are still some unresolved issues for the coming quarters.\nWe will closely monitor the successful vaccine rollout and additional stimulus measures to assist those in need.\nBoth factors will influence the pace of economic recovery in the coming quarters.\nRegarding insurance rates, we expect increases in the first half of 2021 to be similar to those seen in 2020.\nUltimately, the rate of increases will be driven by losses sustained in 2020 from the record-setting number of tropical storms and millions of acres burned.\nThe question remains how long and at what pace rates need to increase to achieve targeted returns.\nWe believe the market is approaching an inflection point for certain lines over the coming year, which will lead to some rate moderation.\nThe pace of acquisitions appears to be as active as ever, with competition between private equity and long-term strategic buyers remaining strong.\nWe expect aggressive pricing for deals by private equity firms to continue in the near future.\nHowever, we are well-positioned with our low leverage, capital on our balance sheet, and access to additional funding to support our M&A activities.\nOur pipeline remains strong, and we will maintain our disciplined approach to M&A, which has proven highly successful.\nHowever, as you know, we don't count on anything until it's finalized.\nLastly, technological innovation continues to be at the forefront of creating new products and enhancing customer experiences.\nWe will continue to digitize our data, automate processes, and prioritize technology investments in the following areas: optimizing and enhancing our data and analytics programs; expanding our digital delivery capabilities for products and services; and engaging in initiatives designed to improve efficiency and speed in our underlying processes.\nAs we achieve these goals, we anticipate new growth opportunities that will allow us to better serve our customers.\nWe had an excellent 2020 on many fronts and have strong momentum heading into 2021.\nI am extremely proud of how our team has served our customers through extremely challenging times.\nWe have a great team and a highly diversified business, both of which have performed well in the past and are expected to continue doing so in the future.\nUltimately, our financial performance is only possible through the combined efforts of our nearly 11,000 team members and our commitment to serving our customers.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These declarations may be revised based on new information or future occurrences.\nAssured Guaranty has reached a significant milestone, with its adjusted book value exceeding $100 per share for the first time, alongside record-breaking shareholders' equity per share and adjusted operating shareholders' equity per share.\nWe accomplished this while also achieving our highest direct new business insurance production for a second quarter since acquiring AGM in July 2009.\nOur financial guaranty PVP of $96 million was 71% greater than the same quarter last year.\nOur achievement is a result of years of preparation for unforeseen circumstances.\nOur team performed exceptionally well, working entirely remotely under unprecedented economic and market conditions.\nWe had the necessary technology, procedures, and training in place to thrive during this pandemic, demonstrating not only our employees' competence and dedication but also the resilience of our business model and the advantages of our value proposition.\nThe virus created market and economic uncertainty, causing bond yields to increase and credit spreads to widen at the beginning of the quarter.\nInvestors became more focused on credit quality, for which our financial guaranty insurance provides a solution, as well as ratings stability, trading value consistency, and market liquidity, all of which our product tends to enhance.\nThis resulted in increased demand for bond insurance.\nConsequently, we experienced the strongest second quarter and first half direct U.S. public finance production in over ten years, generating direct PVP of $60 million and $89 million, respectively.\nI can confirm that the surge in demand for our guaranty has continued, with our July municipal insured par volume surpassing $2 billion.\nAt the industry level, more than $9.1 billion of U.S. public finance primary market par was sold with bond insurance in the second quarter, the highest for any quarter since mid-2009, and industry insurance penetration reached 8.7% of total new issue par sold, the highest quarterly level since 2009.\nThe six-month industry insured volume is 43% higher than in the first half of 2019.\nIn this improved municipal bond insurance market, Assured Guaranty was chosen to insure 63% of the insured new issue par sold in the second quarter.\nCompared to the second quarter of last year, Assured Guaranty's primary market production increased by 58% to $5.8 billion in insured par sold and by 22% to 318 new issue transactions.\nThe increased par volume was partially driven by large transactions, but we remain the preferred insurer.\nWe insured substantial tax-exempt and taxable deals across various sectors and underlying rating categories, including A-rated healthcare issues and AA-rated general obligations.\nWe guaranteed 11 transactions exceeding $100 million in insured par during the quarter, with the largest being a $385 million school district transaction with the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York, rated Aa3 by Moody's and AA- by Fitch.\nThe high value investors place on our guaranty was evident among credits with underlying S&P or Moody's ratings in the AA category, where we insured over $1 billion of primary market par in the second quarter.\nWe are also observing increased demand for our secondary market insurance.\nIn the second quarter, we insured $533 million of secondary market par, compared to $233 million in the first quarter and $327 million in the second quarter of 2019.\nIn total for the primary and secondary markets, Assured Guaranty provided insurance on $6.3 billion of municipal bonds, 58% more than in the second quarter of last year.\nAlthough municipal yields had approached the historic lows seen in March by quarter-end, credit spreads generally remained wider than pre-pandemic levels, which is one reason, along with very strong issuance volume, for our successful performance.\nWe also had an excellent second quarter in our international infrastructure business, generating $28 million of direct PVP, more than triple last year's second quarter PVP and the second-highest quarterly direct PVP in the sector since before the Great Recession.\nNotable transactions included our third solar bond wrap in Spain, modifying terms of an existing investment-grade insured transaction to provide additional flexibility to the issuer, and a secondary market guarantee to a European financial institution for a public sector credit.\nThe impact of COVID-19 has been mixed for the international business.\nOn one hand, fewer transactions are coming to market, especially in transport and social infrastructure.\nSome transactions in our pipeline have been delayed, though none have been canceled.\nOn the other hand, credit spreads widened significantly and have not fully returned to previous tighter levels, which increases the value of our guarantees.\nAdditionally, we continue to see an increased variety of incoming new transaction inquiries, some of which are directly related to COVID-related investor concerns.\nOur global structured finance business also performed well in the second quarter, contributing $8 million of PVP from various transactions, including an insurance securitization and two whole business securitizations.\nThe pandemic has slowed both asset-backed issuance and progress in some of our transactions under development, but it has also widened credit spreads and created new opportunities.\nWe are seeing an increased number of investor-led opportunities related to portfolios of corporate credit exposure.\nIn our last call, I explained in detail how our insured portfolio is well-positioned to weather this economic disruption.\nWe have continued our due diligence and reached out to almost all the obligors we identified in the vulnerable section to learn how they plan to manage their resources.\nBased on our research and the additional information provided by obligors, we continue to expect no material pandemic-related liquidity claims.\nTo date, we have not received any financial guarantee claims that we attribute to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFor below investment grade insured obligations, which we have identified as already under stress, we have updated assumptions to account for the added stress of the pandemic.\nWe continue to believe that for the remainder of the portfolio, which is 96% of par exposure that is investment grade, there should be no material losses caused by the pandemic.\nIn any case, as I mentioned before, we have demonstrated the resilience of our business model.\nFor example, from 2008 through the second quarter of 2020, we paid $11 billion in gross claims, $5 billion net, and returned more than $4.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nYet our claim-paying resources were virtually the same at the end of the period compared to the beginning.\nMeanwhile, we have significantly reduced our total par exposure and cut our insured leverage by more than half, measured by various ratios.\nWe are in a better position today than before the Great Recession.\nI encourage you to review two reports S&P published since the pandemic began.\nI mentioned one in our last call, S&P's April 3rd report on the bond insurance industry.\nThe second was S&P's annual review of Assured Guaranty, released on July 16th.\nThe common theme of these reports was that, despite the current macroeconomic environment.\nS&P considers the risk profile to be minimal for both the bond insurance industry and Assured Guaranty specifically, which is a highly favorable assessment\nS&P reaffirmed the AA ratings with a stable outlook for all of our insurance divisions in June\nIn the subsequent annual review, S&P reiterated that our robust capital position, exceptional liquidity, and proven business model support our financial strength rating\nS&P also noted the growing demand for Assured Guaranty's products since the COVID-19 outbreak began\nThey stated that investors' preference for quality and wider credit spreads should continue to provide us with opportunities for primary and secondary market underwriting\nS&P attributed the strong secondary market demand we've experienced in U.S. public finance to institutional investors finding bond insurance economically appealing as a risk mitigation tool\nIn the same report, S&P mentioned running a COVID-19 sensitivity stress test, concluding that even under increased loss assumptions, our capital adequacy assessment would remain excellent, and described our financial risk profile as very strong, noting that our insured exposures outperform relative to the market segments we underwrite during periods of economic stress due to our underwriting and risk management guidelines\nS&P does not release a figure for our excess capital under their AAA depression stress model\nWe estimate having $2.6 billion in capital exceeding S&P's AAA requirement as of the end of 2019, accounting for our capital management program, BlueMountain acquisition, elimination of an excess of loss credit facility, and continued payment of Puerto Rico debt service claims\nAnother report I read was issued by Kroll Bond Rating Agency on July 30th\nThey provided an in-depth analysis of the recent increase in activity and demand for bond insurance\nKBRA also made a positive observation in the report, stating their belief that the pandemic should remain largely a liquidity event for bond insurers, with Puerto Rico being the exception\nRegarding Puerto Rico, we continue to seek a consensual resolution while defending our rights in the Title III bankruptcies\nCOVID-19 and the upcoming gubernatorial election may be slightly slowing progress\nRecently, PREPA hired a private U.S.-Canadian consortium to manage its electricity transmission and distribution system\nThis appears to be a positive step, but the crucial action to restore and improve the power system is to finalize the restructuring support agreement that all relevant parties have agreed to\nWe concur with the Oversight Board's statement that PREPA will not have effective access to capital markets to fund critical grid modernization and improvement plans as long as it remains in Title III\nThe Title III Court denied our request to lift the stay on asserting our property rights regarding Highways and Transportation Authority Revenue bonds\nWe plan to appeal this decision\nAt least two Oversight Board members have announced their imminent resignations, and all members are subject to replacement or renomination\nWe hope congressional leadership and the President select Board members who are more familiar with municipal government and finance\nSupply chain management has become a major issue in Congress, creating an opportunity for legislation that could allow the country to fully utilize Puerto Rico's extensive history and well-established capabilities in producing pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and medical devices\nThis could address the current public health crisis, enhance national security and preparedness, and simultaneously revitalize a key part of the island's manufacturing sector, stimulating its economic recovery\nAssured Investment Management, our asset management division, benefited from a strong rally in credit markets during the second quarter and profitably sold CLO debt tranches\nAs CLO issuance gained momentum, we purchased newly issued investment-grade CLOs, and in June, Assured Investment Management priced its first CLO issuance since the market disruption\nWhile the current market environment has delayed the realization of this business line's potential in the short term, we remain confident in its diversification strategy\nWe announced an important leadership change in our Asset Management business yesterday\nAndrew Feldstein, Chief Investment Officer and Head of Asset Management, has decided to leave the company\nDavid Buzen, BlueMountain's Deputy Chief Investment Officer, will take over Andrew's responsibilities as CEO and CIO of BlueMountain and Head of Asset Management and CIO at Assured Guaranty\nAndrew will continue to serve on the boards of BlueMountain funds and support a smooth transition\nHe will remain with the company as Senior Advisor to David through the end of October 2020\nWe are confident in the long-term prospects of our Asset Management business under David Buzen's leadership and the talented senior management team\nI want to emphasize that this leadership transition does not indicate any change in Assured Guaranty's strategy regarding Assured Investment Management\nWe continue to support the business's growth and have allocated $1 billion of our investment portfolio to investments it manages, aiming to generate even greater value for our investors and policyholders\nI look forward to seeing our Asset Management business make a significant contribution to Assured Guaranty's value, and I am certain Dave is the right person to lead this effort\nHe was the lead executive in our acquisition of BlueMountain and has been involved in every aspect of our Asset Management strategy and operations\nDavid is a consummate financial professional who has served in top executive roles at several financial companies\nWe have worked with David for a long time, and his over 30 years of experience includes senior positions at ACE Financial Solutions, which acquired Capital Re when David was its CFO, a company now known as Assured Guaranty Corp\nWe are in the midst of an unprecedented year, where a previously unknown disease has affected millions of people, caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, and disrupted economies worldwide\nCongress, the administration, and the Fed have taken action to provide financial support to people in need, inject monetary liquidity to help businesses survive, and support capital markets\nState and local governments are addressing the challenges of providing essential services, administering social programs, and meeting financial obligations amid sharp revenue reductions\nThey deserve additional direct federal assistance to prevent large-scale layoffs of government employees and a potential cascade of economic hardships\nWe have been impressed by the determination of our insured issuers and public officials to maintain essential services while recognizing the imperative to meet debt obligations and preserve their access to capital markets\nAs a company, Assured Guaranty is better positioned than most to thrive in this environment\nBy definition, our main product is designed to instill confidence in investors when the future is uncertain\nCredit-conscious investors have driven increased demand for our guaranty, providing issuers a way to reduce financing costs when they most need to do so\nWe have abundant capital and liquidity, supporting a 96% investment-grade insured portfolio consisting of transactions carefully selected to perform better under economic stress than others in their respective sectors\nOur capacity as a guarantor enables us to assist issuers experiencing temporary cash flow issues or seeking reasonable modifications, helping them through severe financial difficulties while maintaining productivity and ensuring employee and client safety.\nI'm delighted with our quarterly performance and progress on our strategic initiatives.\nOur business model demonstrated resilience amid ongoing market volatility, and we achieved substantial advancements in all three areas of our strategic focus.\nIn the Insurance division, we saw robust new business growth, which is replenishing our unearned premium reserve and balancing out the scheduled amortization of existing business.\nThe Asset Management division introduced a new liquid asset strategy and resumed CLO issuance near the end of the second quarter.\nWe're ahead of schedule in our capital management plan regarding share repurchases, which helped boost our adjusted book value per share to a record high exceeding $100.\nSecond quarter 2020 adjusted operating income was robust at $190 million or $1.36 per share.\nThis includes $154 million from Insurance, a $9 million loss from Asset Management, and a $26 million loss from Corporate, which accounts for holding company interest and other corporate expenses.\nInsurance segment adjusted operating income was $154 million, compared to $161 million in the same quarter last year.\nNet earned premiums and credit derivative revenues in Q2 2020 were $125 million, slightly down from $127 million in Q2 2019.\nStructured finance net earned premiums and credit-driven revenues decreased to $13 million due to portfolio decline.\nPublic finance net earned premiums increased in Q2 2020 compared to Q2 2019, driven by higher accelerations and a slight rise in scheduled net earned premiums from increased premium writings in recent quarters.\nTotal accelerations from refundings and terminations were $32 million in Q2 2020, up from $29 million in Q2 2019.\nThe reassumption of a previously ceded book of business from our largest reinsurer also contributed to our growing unearned premiums reserve.\nThis reassumption resulted in a $38 million commutation gain.\nInsurance segment net investment income was $82 million in Q2 2020, down from $110 million in Q2 2019.\nThe decrease mainly stemmed from a significant non-recurring benefit in 2019 from the favorable settlement of a troubled insurance transaction, which reduced the loss mitigation portfolio size.\nSettlement proceeds were reinvested in lower-yielding assets.\nThe externally managed portfolio's average balance also declined, partly due to a shift into alternative investments, including Assured Investment Management funds, which are recorded at fair value in a separate line item rather than net investment income.\nQ2 2020 Insurance segment adjusted operating income includes a $21 million after-tax mark-to-market gain on investments in Assured Investment Management funds.\nThese investments are marked-to-market each reporting period, with fair value changes recorded as part of adjusted operating income under equity in earnings of investees.\nThe Q2 2020 fair value gains on Assured Investment Management fund investments were driven by the overall market recovery.\nAs of June 30, 2020, insurance companies were authorized to invest up to $500 million in Assured Investment Management-managed funds, with $354 million invested by that date.\nWe anticipate future adjusted operating income will be more volatile as we shift investments from fixed income securities.\nOur long-term outlook on enhanced returns from Assured Investment Management funds remains positive.\nInsurance segment loss expense was $39 million in Q2 2020, primarily related to economic loss development on certain Puerto Rico exposures.\nIn Q2 2019, we recorded a $50 million benefit, mainly due to higher projected recoveries for previously charged-off loans for second lien U.S. RMBS.\nIncreased excess spread, improved performance, and loss mitigation efforts partially offset economic loss development on certain Puerto Rico exposures.\nQ2 2020 net economic development was $34 million, primarily consisting of $30 million loss development in the U.S. public finance sector, mainly attributable to Puerto Rico exposures.\nU.S. RMBS net economic loss development of $1 million mainly comprised increased delinquencies, offset by higher projected excess spread across both third and second lien transactions.\nThe Asset Management segment reported an adjusted operating loss of $9 million.\nWe had previously announced our strategy to shift the investment focus and business model of our Assured Investment Management platform to core strategies, including the orderly wind-down of certain hedge funds and legacy opportunity funds.\nBefore the current market disruptions, we had made significant progress in winding down legacy funds, with $541 million in outflows during Q2.\nWe expect restructuring to continue throughout 2020, but the pandemic's duration and market impact may extend the execution timeline.\nWe launched a new liquid asset strategy focused on municipal securities investments near the end of Q2 2020.\nAdditionally, in Q2 2020, AGM, AGC, and MAC entered into investment management agreements with Assured Investment Management to oversee a portfolio of their general account municipal obligations and CLOs.\nAs of June 30, 2020, insurance subsidiaries have allocated $250 million to municipal obligation strategies and $100 million to CLO strategies, with authorization for an additional $200 million in CLO strategies.\nWe believe the pandemic's effect on market conditions and increased volatility may present attractive opportunities for the alternative asset management industry that Assured Investment Management could capitalize on.\nOur long-term outlook for the asset management platform remains positive.\nIn the Corporate division, holding companies currently have approximately $70 million in cash and investments available for liquidity needs and capital management activities, with $80 million in AGL.\nThe Corporate division's adjusted operating loss was $26 million in both Q2 2020 and Q2 2019.\nThis mainly comprises interest expense on U.S. holding companies' public long-term debt and intercompany loans to insurance companies, primarily used to fund the BlueMountain acquisition.\nIt also includes Board of Directors and other corporate expenses.\nOn a consolidated basis, the effective tax rate may vary between periods based on the proportion of income in different tax jurisdictions.\nIn Q2 2020, the effective tax rate was 14.2%, compared to 21% in Q2 2019.\nRegarding our capital management strategy, we repurchased 6 million shares for $164 million in Q2 2020, at an average price of $27.49 per share.\nSince the quarter's end, we've purchased an additional 800,000 shares for $90 million, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to over 10 million shares.\nSince January 2013, our successful capital management program has returned $3.5 billion to shareholders, resulting in a 60% reduction in total shares outstanding.\nFuture share repurchases depend on available free cash, our capital position, and market conditions.\nThese repurchases have benefited adjusted operating shareholders' equity by approximately $23.56 per share and adjusted book value per share by about $42.76.\nThis has driven these important metrics to new record highs of $71.34 in adjusted operating shareholders' equity per share and $104.63 in adjusted book value per share.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Joining me on the call are our CEO Dr. Jeffrey Graves, CFO Jagtar Narula, and Chief Legal Officer Andrew Johnson.\nOutcomes may vary significantly from expectations.\nThis time last year, we were just starting to see signs of what we hoped would be a lasting recovery from the worst of the COVID pandemic.\nSimultaneously, 3D Systems was in the process of implementing our four-stage transformation plan.\nWe divided our company into two divisions: Healthcare and Industrial Solutions.\nWe have streamlined our organization to improve efficiency.\nWe had also begun divesting non-essential assets.\nAs we speak to you today, one year later, these initial three phases have been completed.\nWe are now a company exclusively focused on additive manufacturing, with a streamlined operating structure, global presence, and an unmatched range of metal, polymer, and biological technologies in the industry.\nThese characteristics, combined with an intense focus on our customers' most challenging applications, have proven to be a powerful driver of value creation, as evidenced by our organic growth rates, profitability, and operating cash performance, all of which we will summarize for you shortly.\nWhile we're satisfied with this performance, we're even more excited about entering the fourth and final stage of our transformation: investing for growth.\nSince our last update, we've completed our final divestments, paid off our debt, and accumulated over $500 million in cash reserves.\nWe subsequently announced two acquisitions that exemplify our strategic focus on growth, which aims to invest in businesses that promote the adoption of additive manufacturing, address customers' most complex application needs, and generate high-margin recurring revenue streams crucial for sustained value creation.\nThe first of these acquisitions was Oqton, a unique software company that has emerged as a recognized leader in developing a new type of intelligent, cloud-based manufacturing operating system.\nThe motivation for this acquisition is straightforward; customers across our Industrial and Healthcare segments are now eager to accelerate their adoption of additive manufacturing in full-scale production environments.\nHowever, in doing so, they face significant challenges in integrating these technologies into their existing enterprise systems.\nUntil now, they have relied heavily on spreadsheets and highly skilled engineers to manage production applications.\nThis approach is clearly too slow, inefficient, and expensive to scale as production volumes increase.\nWhile we and others have made progress in optimizing and somewhat automating the performance of single printers or even groups of similar printers working in parallel, our customers' challenges extend beyond this.\nThey require a manufacturing system that can easily and intelligently incorporate a diverse fleet of printers, often from various manufacturers, as well as integrate all surrounding digital production systems on the shop floor, such as post-print thermal and mechanical processing, robotic motion systems, and automated inspection systems.\nOqton not only provides this integration but goes further by applying cloud-based AI to optimize the entire workflow and then connects this workflow to customers' existing enterprise software like those provided by Salesforce, Oracle, Microsoft, or SAP.\nThe result is that Oqton not only links, optimizes, and tracks the customers' unique operational workflow at an individual component level from raw material to finished and inspected parts, but also builds in future flexibility to incorporate new printing, finishing, and automation technologies that will inevitably be introduced in the coming years.\nThese features, unique to the Oqton platform, will remove a significant barrier to the large-scale adoption of additive manufacturing in production environments.\nFor this reason, we've opened the system to the entire industry, which we hope will accelerate market growth for everyone.\nAdditionally, for the first time in our history, we will now make our full range of market-leading metal and polymer printing software platforms available to others in the industry, which we hope will speed up the introduction of new printing technologies to customers worldwide.\nImportantly, as with all software platforms that span an entire industry, we are committed to Oqton continuing to operate independently, with a supreme commitment to customer data protection and confidentiality.\nI'm pleased to inform you that we finalized the Oqton acquisition on November 1, and the response from our customers and partners has been very positive.\nBefore I discuss our most recent and incredibly exciting acquisition, let me explain how we view our company holistically, which I believe is quite different from others in this industry.\nIn the decade since 3D printing was invented, we and our competitors have typically defined ourselves as hardware and material developers, with our products sold widely to customers around the world.\nWhile this is natural when an industry is young and the product is mainly used in small quantities by labs or prototype facilities, as the industry matures and targets production environments, successful companies will need to adapt their entire operating model to reflect their deeper integration with specific markets and customers.\nIf you don't, you will remain simply a vendor and not a true partner to your customers, which will ultimately be reflected in your organic growth rate and profit margins.\nWith this in mind, at 3D Systems, starting a year ago, we changed how we define ourselves by reorganizing our entire company around key markets, and within those markets, key vertical segments that we believe will derive the most value from adopting additive manufacturing.\nWe began by creating two business segments, Healthcare and Industrial Solutions.\nUsing a strong application focus, these two businesses each integrate our printer, material, and software technologies in unique combinations to solve customers' product needs.\nOnce complete, our customers can then ask us to scale the process for them to a certain production level.\nAs demand increases, they can choose to have us enable a manufacturer of their choice to continue scaling to high volumes.\nThis transfer of the workflow involves providing printing systems, materials, and software along with the process definition.\nIt results in a seamless transfer of capability to the chosen manufacturer, whether it's the OEM themselves or a contract manufacturer of their choosing.\nFast-forwarding to this year, with the acquisition of Oqton, we expanded our software capabilities into what we broadly call digital manufacturing software, which, as we described earlier, enables rapid and efficient adoption of additive manufacturing in high-volume production environments.\nThis operating model has been very well received by our customer base, and we expect it to fuel exciting organic growth in the years ahead.\nMost recently, we've added a strong biotech organizational focus and invested significantly to bring our emerging biological technologies to laboratory and human applications, details of which we'll cover shortly.\nIn summary, these are our five core market segments that you'll hear us discuss moving forward.\nWhile each of the five will adapt to the needs of their customers, each will also leverage our core technologies of hardware, software, and materials in the unique manner needed to fulfill their customer application needs.\nLet me illustrate this approach using our Healthcare business as an example.\nIn the mid-1990s, 3D Systems pioneered Medical Modeling, which involves printing highly detailed anatomical models from digital images.\nThese models have proven instrumental in supporting complex surgical procedures.\nIn a highly publicized application of our modeling technology, beautifully documented by CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, we created several medical models to assist in separating conjoined twins, Jadon and Anias McDonald, who were born with the extremely rare craniopagus condition, where twins are joined at the head, sharing not only the skull and vasculature but portions of the brain itself.\nThe modeling used for surgical planning was vital to the success of Dr. James Goodrich and his team in separating the twins, both of whom are alive and living independently today, many years later.\nTo date, our medical modeling technology has supported dozens of similarly complex operations worldwide, along with hundreds of others, and continues to expand each year.\nBuilding upon this foundation and investing in point-of-care infrastructure to support this growth, we deepened our surgical support over the next decade.\nBy 2005, we were working with surgeons to design and manufacture customized patient-specific surgical guides and instruments using 3D printing.\nAs this portion of the business grew, we expanded our scope once again, this time to include actual patient-specific implants, which offered an even larger market opportunity.\nToday, we offer the broadest range of FDA-cleared capabilities for modeling surgical planning and patient-specific medical implants, which inspires our customers to continue expanding their partnership with us year after year.\nWhile we're very proud of our progress, by now redefining ourselves as a healthcare business in this example and leveraging both our critical infrastructure and channel partner relationships, we can broaden our scope more aggressively to now include other parts of the human skeletal structure, and importantly, to advance these applications in parallel instead of in series as we have in the past.\nThis allows us to extend benefits to a much broader group of patients at an accelerated pace compared to before.\nRedefining ourselves as a healthcare company rather than just a printing technology supplier for healthcare clients demonstrates the potential of this shift.\nNotably, our Healthcare division experienced growth exceeding 28% in the latest quarter, and over 44% organically when excluding divested businesses.\nThis exceptional growth rate demonstrates our increasing traction in this promising market.\nBuilding on our discussion of the Healthcare business, I'd like to conclude my remarks today by addressing the emerging field of bioprinting and our recent acquisition of Volumetric Biotechnologies.\nUnder Dr. Jordan Miller's visionary leadership, this company brings specialized expertise in biomaterials and regenerative medicine, combining synthetic chemistry, 3D printing, microfabrication and molecular imaging to guide human cells in forming more organized, complex structures of living vessels and tissues.\nSince 2017, 3D Systems has been at the forefront of our industry by dedicating resources to regenerative medicine.\nWe initiated a collaborative development program with United Therapeutics Corporation to create the ability to print scaffolds for human lungs using a process we call printer profusion.\nOnce developed, this bioprinting technology can be applied to other major organs in the human body as well as various human and laboratory applications.\nWe've made considerable progress with this novel technology.\nConsequently, we recently announced an expansion of our development program with United Therapeutics, which includes increased funding and extension to two additional organs.\nThis program expansion reflects the advancements our joint team has achieved in this groundbreaking endeavor.\nBy acquiring Volumetric, we're enhancing our 3D Systems team with crucial skills that perfectly complement our own, bringing strong biological expertise and cellular engineering capabilities along with highly innovative bioprinting systems to our development group.\nAs this is a completely new area for many who have followed our company, let me briefly summarize our regenerative medicine strategy and the market opportunities we're pursuing through our unique bioprinting technology.\nThe initial opportunity involves printing human organs, starting with the lung and expanding to two additional organs.\nWe're pursuing this as a joint program with our partner United Therapeutics.\nThe ambitious goals we've set for this program are driving significant advances in our technology and establishing the foundation for our other regenerative medicine efforts.\nIn our second regenerative medicine market opportunity, we're applying the core disruptive technologies developed for human organ bioprinting to other parts of the human body.\nThere are numerous applications ranging from printing human skin for burn victims to soft tissue for breast reconstruction and repair, critical blood vessel and bone replacements, and many more.\nWe're now forming partnerships focused on each application area where we can combine our bioprinting expertise with relevant application experts to provide unique and highly impactful solutions for those in need.\nWe refer to this second market vertical within regenerative medicine as human non-organ bioprinting.\nOur final market opportunity involves extending our bioprinting technologies to research labs, providing advanced printing systems and unique biological materials to those studying regenerative medicine fundamentals and pharmaceutical laboratories where the ability to print precise, three-dimensional vascularized cell structures can be used to develop new, more effective drug therapies.\nAcquiring Volumetric and their unique capabilities, combined with our own, will allow us to accelerate our efforts in all three of our regenerative medicine markets.\nIt's astounding to consider these revolutionary applications enabled by our 3D printing technologies; applications that we are uniquely positioned to deliver given our extensive history in advanced 3D printing technologies, materials expertise, application development experience, deep understanding of FDA and other regulatory processes, and now our biological and cellular engineering capabilities.\nWe anticipate that in the coming years, bioprinting will become a significant business for our company, providing crucial relief to patients requiring life-saving procedures and delivering substantial value to our employees and shareholders.\nShifting from our strategic growth investments to our most recent quarterly performance, I'm pleased to report that we've continued to execute well in our core business.\nWith sustained strong demand, our operational challenges have primarily revolved around global supply chain and logistics issues, which continue to affect most companies worldwide.\nOur solid execution in the face of these challenges during the third quarter resulted in strong double-digit growth, with revenues increasing by 15% before accounting for divestitures.\nWhen adjusting for these divestitures, which more accurately reflects our core business performance, revenues increased over 36% compared to 2020 and over 20% compared to our pre-pandemic 2019 third quarter, a benchmark we consider highly significant.\nExamining our major business segments, our Industrial Solutions segment continues to rebound, with strong performance particularly in jewelry, automotive and transportation, and general manufacturing.\nIn Healthcare, we observe ongoing strong demand for personalized health services as well as solid performance in dental.\nAs Jagtar will discuss shortly, in addition to the strong revenue performance, our EBITDA increased by over 125%.\nWe generated positive cash from operations for the fourth consecutive quarter, the first time this has occurred in four years.\nWith our cash generation and proceeds from divestitures, we accumulated a substantial cash balance by the end of Q3.\nA portion of these funds will be used to finance the strategic growth initiatives I mentioned earlier, but we will still have significant liquidity remaining to pursue additional opportunities.\nI am clearly very excited not only about our accomplishments over the past year but even more so about the future, as our focus on growth in this final stage of our transformation has only just begun.\nFor the third quarter, we reported revenue of $156.1 million, a 14.6% increase compared to the third quarter of 2020.\nOur organic revenue growth, which excludes divestitures completed in 2020 and 2021, was 35.9% in Q3 2021 versus Q3 2020.\nSince the third quarter of 2020 marked the beginning of the economic reopening following COVID-related shutdowns, we believe it's valuable to compare our results to Q3 2019, which was unaffected by the pandemic.\nAgain, excluding divested businesses to ensure an apples-to-apples comparison, our revenue in the third quarter of 2021 was 21.2% higher than pre-pandemic Q3 2019.\nAs previously discussed, with the completion of our Simbionix and on-demand manufacturing divestitures in Q3 2021, we have finalized our planned divestitures and are now focused on the performance, growth, and investment of our core additive manufacturing business.\nIt's worth noting that post-divestitures, we continue to generate nearly two-thirds of our revenue from recurring revenue streams.\nThese high-margin lines of business highlight the strength and diversity of our core business, our ability to navigate various economic cycles, and around which we will continue to make strategic investments.\nWe reported GAAP net income of $2.34 per share in the third quarter of 2021 compared to a GAAP loss of $0.61 in the third quarter of 2020.\nThe year-over-year improvement was driven by gains on divested businesses as well as the goodwill impairment charge we recorded in the third quarter of 2020.\nFor our non-GAAP results, we reported non-GAAP income of $0.08 per share in the third quarter of 2021 compared to a non-GAAP loss of $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2020.\nThe year-over-year improvement reflects higher revenue with lower non-GAAP operating expenses resulting from the cost-cutting measures we implemented last year.\nNow I will discuss revenue by market.\nHealthcare grew 28.3% year-over-year and decreased 7.8% compared to the previous quarter.\nThe decrease was primarily due to the divestiture of the Simbionix medical simulation business during the quarter.\nAdjusted for divestitures, Healthcare revenue increased 44.5% year-over-year due to strong demand for dental applications in both printers and materials.\nIn fact, the last four quarters have seen the highest level of dental material sales ever compared to any prior four-quarter period.\nOur Industrial segment generated revenue growth of 4% to $79.7 million compared to the same period last year and remained flat compared to the previous quarter, reflecting the divestiture of the on-demand manufacturing parts business during the quarter.\nAfter adjusting for divestitures, Industrial revenue grew 28.1% compared to last year and 2.1% from the previous quarter.\nThe growth was fueled by increased demand for printers and materials across various sectors, particularly jewelry, automotive, transportation, and general manufacturing.\nLet's now discuss gross margin.\nIn Q3 2021, we reported a gross profit margin of 41.2%, down from 43.1% in Q3 2020.\nThe non-GAAP gross profit margin was 41.5%, compared to 43.2% in the same period last year.\nThe decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to businesses sold off in 2020 and 2021.\nExcluding the impact of these divestitures, gross margins improved by 80 basis points in Q3 2021 compared to the same period last year, driven by cost-cutting measures in 2020 and higher revenue leading to improved capacity utilization.\nAs demonstrated by our strong performance this year, there continues to be robust demand for our products across both business segments.\nThe main challenge we face is not unique to our company.\nEveryone is aware of the supply chain issues affecting businesses of all sizes and individuals alike.\nIn fact, our Q3 revenue, while impressive, was affected by limited availability of certain products.\nSimilar to last quarter, we continue to experience tightening costs and availability for specific components used in our products.\nOur team is doing an outstanding job managing these challenges.\nSupply chain constraints, rather than end-customer demand, remain the primary obstacle in our business and are our main focus as we close out the year.\nWe have implemented measures to reduce the economic impact, such as finding alternative suppliers for key components where possible.\nWe have experienced some cost increases due to supply chain constraints, particularly in shipping charges, and have implemented a temporary surcharge for customers on certain purchases starting in the fourth quarter.\nOur year-to-date non-GAAP gross profit margin was 42.6%, and we anticipate full-year gross profit margins to range between 41% and 43%.\nGAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $81.5 million, a 35.4% decrease compared to Q3 2020.\nThis year-over-year reduction reflects a goodwill impairment recorded in Q3 2020.\nOur Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses were $54.1 million, an 8% decrease from the same quarter last year.\nCompared to Q2 2021, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased by 2%, mainly due to lower R&D spending.\nAdjusted EBITDA, defined as non-GAAP operating profit plus depreciation, was $16.3 million or 10.5% of revenue, compared to $7.2 million or 5.3% of revenue in Q3 2020.\nOur disciplined approach to growth, cost management, and focus on our core business is resulting in continued strong adjusted EBITDA.\nRegarding the cash flow statement and balance sheet, we are pleased to report $502.8 million in cash, an increase of $418.4 million since the beginning of the year.\nThis increase was primarily due to proceeds from selling our on-demand parts business and medical simulation business, but was also significantly supported by our exceptionally strong cash generation from operations.\nWe generated $20.7 million in cash from operations during the quarter, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of positive operating cash flow.\nThis is the first time in four years that the company has achieved four straight quarters of positive operating cash flow, reflecting a strong transformation of our business.\nHaving demonstrated consistent profitability and cash generation, along with $0.5 billion in cash on hand post-divestiture, we are well-positioned to continue growing the company by taking a disciplined approach to investing in organic and inorganic solutions that will address customers' complex needs, drive adoption of additive manufacturing, and generate high-margin recurring revenue streams.\nWe have previously announced some of these growth opportunities, namely our acquisitions of Oqton, which closed on November 1, and Volumetric Biotechnologies, expected to close in Q4.\nThe cash considerations for these acquisitions will total approximately $130 million, leaving roughly $370 million in cash.\nThese acquisitions will position the company for strong growth and are central to our strategies in both high-margin software to enable additive manufacturing adoption and advanced 3D printing technologies in regenerative medicine, where we believe we will be a market leader.\nAs I conclude my remarks, I want to reflect on the past year.\nI joined the company at the beginning of Q3 2020, when the company was just starting its transformation.\nWe had just announced Q2 2020 results that included negative operating cash flow of $21 million for the first half of that year, only $64 million in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet, and $22 million in debt.\nFast forward to this year, and the transformation we've undergone is remarkable.\nWe have generated over $60 million in operating cash this year through Q3 and ended the quarter with over $500 million in cash and cash equivalents with no debt.\nWe are fully focused on additive manufacturing and growing strongly in our core markets.\nWe can make smart and strategic investments to support our core business and are rapidly advancing our key technologies into new segments such as regenerative medicine.\nI continue to believe that we are uniquely positioned in our industry with a strong balance sheet, growth, cash generation, and a suite of technologies that remain in demand by our customers.\nLastly, we wanted to provide an update on our Investor Day event.\nYou may recall that we had scheduled an event for September 9 in the Denver, Colorado area.\nOut of an abundance of caution for the safety of our investors, analysts, and employees, we postponed the planned Investor Day as COVID infection rates increased this past summer due to the Delta variant.\nWe are now seeing encouraging signs of progress, with declining infection rates once again, the rollout of booster shots, and a newly announced pill that seems to offer promise in dramatically reducing hospitalization rates from this infection.\nAs a result, we are in the early stages of planning an updated Investor Day, aiming for the first half of 2022.\nWe will provide an update as soon as possible and look forward to sharing our long-term growth strategy in more detail with the investment community.\nJagtar and I have covered the remarkable progress we've made over the last year.\nWe've created value for our investors, customers, and employees by transforming the business.\nOur growth and profitability set us apart in the industry and have made us a key partner for a growing number of organizations considering additive manufacturing.\nAt the same time, our transformation has also made us a more exceptional place to work to drive the future of additive manufacturing, and as a result, more talented individuals are joining the new 3D Systems every day.\nHowever, as much as we've accomplished this last year, it's more about the future.\nWe will continue to be a valuable solutions partner with customers and deeply integrate with them as they adopt our solutions and technologies.\nWe will also invest in our business and drive our solutions capabilities in the five key areas I mentioned earlier.\nI'm truly excited about the depth and breadth of technology we bring to our markets and our application expertise.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Rubun Dey, Head of Investor Relations, is joined by Horacio Rozanski, President and CEO, and Lloyd Howell, Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer, to discuss business and financial results.\nToday's presentation will cover some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics that we believe are valuable for investors.\nWe have provided explanations and reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our fourth quarter fiscal year 2021 presentation materials.\nWe are currently viewing Slide 5.\nThe company experienced an unprecedented year in its 107-year history.\nBefore delving into recent results and the current year's outlook, it's worth noting that the fiscal year ending March 31 also marked the conclusion of the three-year period outlined in our investment thesis.\nIn June 2018, we pledged to achieve 50% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share over three years.\nWe anticipated this growth would result from our unique market position and a combination of industry-leading organic revenue growth, improved adjusted EBITDA margins, and significant capital deployment.\nWith our fiscal year 2021 results now finalized, Booz Allen has considerably surpassed our three-year financial goals.\nADEPS nearly doubled during this period, reaching $3.90 in fiscal year 2021.\nThe average annual revenue growth exceeded the middle of the 6% to 9% range we initially projected.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin surpassed 10% in each of the three years, and we deployed $1.3 billion in capital.\nMost of this was accomplished through increased dividends and an extensive share repurchase program.\nDuring this three-year span, we navigated significant budget uncertainties, including the longest government shutdown in history, a tumultuous presidential transition, and an unprecedented global pandemic.\nThroughout these challenges, we continued to invest in our workforce, notably setting aside $100 million in response to the pandemic to support our employees and assist the most vulnerable in our communities.\nWe also maintained our investment in key technologies and developed elements of our option value portfolio.\nWhile the past three years demonstrate our outstanding financial performance, more importantly, it forms the foundation for our optimistic business outlook.\nOver the last decade, we have further distinguished Booz Allen's brand and market position, becoming a trusted provider of advanced technology solutions that deliver both speed and mission scale for federal and commercial clients.\nOur unique blend of consulting expertise, mission knowledge, innovation, and technology serves as a strategic catalyst for both our company and our clients.\nI've frequently stated that Booz Allen continuously learns and evolves.\nOur upcoming strategy and long-term financial outlook, which we plan to reveal in the fall, will build upon Vision 2020's growth and transformation.\nWe are confident in our trajectory as we anticipate the opportunities of the next decade.\nOur recent agreement to acquire Liberty IT Solutions, LLC exemplifies our confidence in our strategic direction.\nAs discussed when announced on May 4, this acquisition aligns perfectly with our strategy.\nLiberty is an exceptional company with highly skilled talent, trusted client relationships, proximity to mission, strong growth potential, and digital transformation capabilities that complement Booz Allen's extensive offerings.\nThe transaction is expected to conclude this quarter, subject to standard closing conditions.\nWe eagerly anticipate officially welcoming the Liberty team to the Booz Allen family.\nLloyd and I are proud of our team's performance in an unprecedented year, meeting or exceeding all metrics outlined in our updated guidance from late January.\nFor the full year, organic revenue growth was strong, albeit slower than recent years due to the pandemic and some delays in funding and awards following the election.\nWe also delivered excellent bottom-line results.\nFull-year earnings, profit margins, and cash flow all surpassed expectations.\nAs the market began to stabilize post-transition, our team excelled in capturing opportunities, achieving a record book-to-bill ratio in the fourth quarter and a year-end backlog of $24 billion.\nUnderlying demand for our services and solutions remains robust, with our defense and civil businesses delivering excellent organic growth in fiscal year 2021, while intelligence and global commercial continue to reshape their portfolios.\nLloyd will provide more detail about market dynamics shortly.\nI'm pleased to report that the Department of Justice has concluded the criminal investigation we first disclosed in June 2017.\nThe civil DOJ and SEC investigations are ongoing, and we continue to cooperate with the government to reach appropriate resolutions.\nLet's now consider our approach to the business in the coming year.\nAs we begin fiscal year 2022, we are focusing on several near- and mid-term priorities.\nFirst and foremost, to fully capitalize on our strong backlog and demand pipeline, we need to accelerate our recruiting efforts.\nSecond, we must leverage the reshaped portfolios in intelligence and commercial to drive growth in both sectors.\nThird, we will carefully manage the transition to a post-COVID environment by investing in our people and the advanced capabilities necessary for the future.\nFourth, having launched our next-generation financial system on April 1, we are making significant progress and will remain focused on a seamless implementation.\nFifth, upon closing the Liberty acquisition, we will work closely to ensure a smooth and successful integration.\nLooking further ahead, we are also focused on positioning for growth beyond the current fiscal year.\nOur primary goal is to accelerate into the next wave of market changes.\nFrom monetizing the option value portfolio to investing in new areas like Low Code, 5G, AI, or quantum, to finalizing our strategic review, Booz Allen is committed to leading the way in helping our clients scale new technologies into their missions faster than ever before.\nRegarding our fiscal year 2022 outlook, Lloyd will provide detailed guidance shortly.\nHowever, I'll note that the growth pattern will differ from recent years due to various factors including productivity and PTO trends, the Liberty acquisition, and the timing of headcount increases.\nWe expect these factors to produce a revenue profile with low single-digit growth in the first half, followed by significant acceleration in the second half.\nWe anticipate the full year to deliver another year of substantial revenue growth in FY'22.\nContinued excellence in operational performance is also expected to yield strong EBITDA growth, sustained cash generation, and strategic capital deployment.\nIn conclusion, I am excited and optimistic about the coming year and beyond.\nOur customers have distinct priorities and can allocate resources accordingly.\nWe possess an outstanding group of professionals who have proven their mettle in both prosperous and challenging periods.\nOur financial position is robust.\nOur steadfast dedication to our workforce over the past year has enhanced our already strong reputation in the talent market.\nEveryone in our organization is devoted to and concentrates on providing excellent service to clients while adhering to our purpose and values.\nAlthough we may encounter some turbulence and need to address hiring challenges in the coming months, I am extremely confident in our team's capacity to achieve growth in both the short and long term.\nI'll begin by reinforcing Horacio's remarks on the conclusion of our investment strategy.\nThe previous quarter marked the end of a three-year period with a 96% increase in ADEPS, primarily driven by robust organic revenue growth and sustained margin expansion.\nThis achievement stemmed from investments related to Vision 2020 and our early positioning in key areas of increasing client demand.\nBooz Allen has demonstrated its ability to outperform competitors even in some of the most challenging economic environments.\nGoing forward, we will maintain a keen focus on positioning Booz Allen for long-term success, building upon the excellent performance of the past three years.\nReflecting on the past year, we are proud of the resilience and dedication displayed by our team in close collaboration with our clients.\nTheir exceptional work resulted in another year of strong operational and financial performance.\nAs we enter fiscal year 2022 and anticipate transitioning to a post-pandemic operational rhythm, we expect some fluctuations, but we have clearly defined operational focus areas.\nOur confidence in continued success is rooted in our track record of consistent performance and the strong foundation we've established to meet both near- and long-term objectives.\nLet's examine our fiscal year 2021 results.\nRevenue increased by 5.3% for the full year, reaching $7.9 billion.\nRevenue, excluding billable expenses, grew by 7.1% to $5.5 billion.\nThis organic top-line growth largely reflects strong execution amid sustained demand for our services, aided by higher-than-normal staff utilization in the first half of the year.\nAs a reminder, we adjusted our revenue guidance in January to a range of 4.8% to 6% due to three factors: programmatic shifts during the presidential transition, a return to more typical PTO usage, and lower expectations for billable expenses as a percentage of revenue, which fell at the low end of our 29% to 31% range.\nThese factors played out as anticipated in the fourth quarter.\nLet me review the market performance.\nFull-year revenue growth was led by our defense and civil businesses, which grew by 9% and 8%, respectively.\nDefense growth slowed in the second half of the year due to the factors mentioned earlier.\nHowever, long-term demand for our services and solutions remained strong, as evidenced by recent business wins and continued tactical sales execution.\nGrowth in our civil business also decelerated in the second half of the year.\nThis was primarily due to a pause on a large cyber program caused by funding availability issues, which began in the third quarter and continued into the fourth quarter.\nGiven the program's importance and criticality for the client, we believe work will increase again in the coming quarters.\nRevenue from our intelligence business declined by 3% for the full year.\nOur focused effort to reshape that portfolio continues, and we are pleased with the results thus far.\nWe anticipate our intelligence business will return to growth this fiscal year as we ramp up recent contract wins.\nAdditionally, the pandemic-related challenges we faced in fiscal year 2021, including the inability to bill for fees, will continue to diminish as more employees return to work at client facilities.\nLastly, revenue in global commercial, which accounted for approximately 3% of our total revenue in fiscal year 2021, declined by 22% year-over-year.\nThis decrease was primarily driven by our decision to exit parts of our Middle East business due to market dynamics and geopolitical trends, and to focus strategically on our US-based cyber business.\nWe are pleased with our excellent book-to-bill performance for both the quarter and the full year.\nOur fourth-quarter book-to-bill ratio of 1.38 times set a record, resulting in a full-year book-to-bill of 1.42 times.\nTotal backlog grew by 16%, yielding our largest-ever fiscal year-end backlog of $24 billion.\nFunded backlog increased by 3% to $3.5 billion.\nUnfunded backlog rose by 35% to $6.1 billion, and priced options grew by 13% to $14.4 billion.\nThroughout the year, our team maintained our historical win rates for both recompete and new work, despite navigating the pandemic and a presidential transition period.\nAs previously noted, we continue to supplement our traditional foundation of diversified smaller awards by pursuing larger and more complex bids, which inherently cause quarter-to-quarter volatility in book-to-bill ratios.\nOur record backlog reflects ongoing robust demand for our services, the quality of our people, and our close alignment with client missions.\nTurning to headcount, as of March 31, we had 27,727 employees, an increase of 554 or 2% year-over-year.\nExcluding the impacts of our contract divestiture in the third quarter, headcount would have grown by 2.4%.\nAs Horacio emphasized, we are focused on accelerating headcount growth to meet strong demand signals and execute our backlog.\nMoving to the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2021 was $840 million, up 11.4% from the previous year.\nThis increase was primarily driven by our top-line growth, strong cost management, and lower-than-expected billable expense mix in what was truly an anomalous year.\nAs a result, our adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 10.7%.\nFull-year net income, diluted earnings per share, and ADEPS also grew significantly.\nNet income increased by 26% year-over-year to $109 million.\nAdjusted net income was $542 million, up 21% from the previous year.\nDiluted earnings per share increased by 28% to $4.37 from $3.41 the year prior.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 23% to $3.90 from $3.18 the year prior.\nThese increases were primarily driven by strong operating performance, a lower effective tax rate, and a lower share count in fiscal year 2021 due to our share repurchase program.\nRegarding our effective tax rate, during the fourth quarter, we recognized a tax benefit under the CARES Act that allowed tax loss carrybacks to prior tax years.\nWe identified roughly $77 million in tax benefit reassessment this quarter, which was not included in our adjusted net income and earnings per share calculations.\nThree years ago, we implemented a strategy to enhance our cash generation capabilities.\nWe are incredibly pleased with our team's achievements this year, which we view as the culmination of our multi-year efforts.\nOur operating cash flow for fiscal year 2021 reached $719 million, representing a 30% increase compared to the previous year.\nThis exceeded our projected range, and we concluded the year with $991 million in cash reserves.\nThe robust cash performance was primarily driven by collections growth outpacing revenue growth, while increased cash taxes were offset by reduced expenditures related to operating during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur capital expenditures for the year amounted to $87 million, aligning with our expectations as we continued investing in infrastructure and technology to support remote work.\nApril was a crucial month for us as we launched our new NextGen Financial System.\nOur year-end reporting process went smoothly, and we have not encountered any significant issues so far.\nAs expected, we faced a few minor challenges, which were promptly addressed.\nWe have already begun to reap the benefits in the form of improved data access and increased productivity.\nWe anticipate this will lead to cost savings over time, which will be reinvested to drive future growth.\nI will revisit this topic when discussing our outlook for fiscal year 2022.\nIn fiscal year 2021, we continued to implement a prudent capital allocation strategy aimed at delivering both short-term and long-term value for shareholders.\nWe distributed approximately $181 million to shareholders through quarterly dividends, including a 19% year-over-year dividend increase in the fourth quarter.\nThis marked the eighth consecutive fiscal year of double-digit growth in our quarterly dividend.\nWe also bought back 4.1 million shares for $318 million during the fiscal year, with 2.3 million shares repurchased for $185 million in the fourth quarter.\nCombined with our third quarter investment in Tracepoint, we allocated a total of $571 million in capital during fiscal year 2021.\nMoving forward, our capital allocation priorities remain consistent: reinvesting in our business, maintaining our quarterly dividend, pursuing strategic acquisitions, and repurchasing shares.\nWe are also announcing that our Board has approved a regular dividend of $0.37 per share, payable on June 30 to stockholders of record on June 15.\nDividends continue to be an important element of our strategy to create value for shareholders.\nLastly, I want to briefly mention our recently announced acquisition of Liberty IT Solutions.\nThis transaction, once completed, will be our largest acquisition to date and will immediately contribute to revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margin, and adjusted diluted earnings per share.\nFor us, this transaction embodies exactly what we seek in acquisitions: cultural, strategic, and financial alignment.\nLooking ahead, we are focusing on three objectives: first, ensuring a smooth and successful integration; second, continuing to hire to support Liberty's recent contract wins; and third, maintaining excellence in contract delivery.\nAs Horacio mentioned, we are excited about the acquisition and the long-term value it will create for our shareholders and the people of both Booz Allen and Liberty.\nWe look forward to providing updates in the coming months.\nRegarding guidance, please refer to Slide 9.\nFiscal year 2021 presented unprecedented challenges for our people and clients.\nThis resulted in several factors affecting our fiscal year 2021 financial results, which influence year-over-year comparisons as we enter fiscal year 2022.\nMost of these factors are temporary in nature.\nHowever, we expect them to limit top-line growth for the next couple of quarters before accelerating in the latter half of the fiscal year.\nLet me explain these factors.\nFirst, there is a natural ramp-up period required for both executing work on recently won contracts and for recruiting and hiring.\nAs Horacio noted, we are focused on both of these priorities.\nThey take time to gain momentum, which leads to a build-up towards the latter half of the year.\nSecond, we experienced unusually high productivity in the first half of fiscal year 2021, driving up revenue growth, then slowing growth in the second half as staff utilization and PTO trends normalized.\nThis dynamic will create challenging comparisons in the first half of fiscal year 2022.\nThird, we expect PTO trends to continue impacting results for the next few months.\nAlthough we successfully implemented a one-time PTO buyback program in the fourth quarter, we know that many of our employees still have higher balances due to the pandemic.\nWith increasing vaccinations and some travel restrictions easing, we expect and have been encouraging our people to take well-deserved time off.\nLastly, our implementation of the new financial system will result in minor timing differences in labor costing.\nWe do not expect this to significantly impact our full-year results.\nHowever, we forecast approximately 50 basis points of revenue growth headwinds in each of our second and third quarters, offset by roughly 100 basis points of tailwind in the fourth quarter.\nConsidering all these factors, we expect organic top-line growth in the low single-digit range in the first half of fiscal year 2022, with a significant increase in the third and fourth quarters.\nFrom an EBITDA perspective, a return to more normal indirect spending patterns and billable expense mix post-pandemic will cause some fluctuations in our quarterly margin profile.\nNow, let me outline our fiscal year 2022 guidance.\nWe expect total revenue growth between 7% and 10%, which includes a partial year contribution from our announced Liberty acquisition, assuming a first quarter 2022 close.\nThe difference between the high and low ends of our revenue growth outlook will largely depend on the successful execution and timing of our hiring and onboarding efforts.\nWe anticipate adjusted EBITDA margin to remain in the mid-10% range.\nWe expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4.10 and $4.30.\nThis range reflects strong organic growth, additional D&A expense related to our new financial system, a higher effective tax rate, and $0.20 to $0.24 of anticipated accretion from our acquisition of Liberty IT.\nWe expect operating cash flow to be between $800 million and $850 million, primarily driven by our operational performance, lower cash tax payments, and contributions from Liberty IT.\nLastly, we expect capital expenditures to be between $80 million and $100 million as we continue investing in infrastructure and technology.\nWe have once again demonstrated our ability to effectively manage the business, invest in our people, and deliver strong returns to our shareholders.\nWe accomplished all of this while navigating a challenging macro environment, which reinforces our confidence in our strategy and positioning to succeed in any market condition.\nOperator, please open the lines for questions.\nSummary: ",

I won't contribute to those summaries here.\nIt's sufficient to say that we're all relieved to move past 2020.\nNevertheless, it's a year we shouldn't rush to dismiss from memory.\nRather than focusing on the difficulties 2020 presented, we should emphasize our reactions to these challenges and our resolve in pursuing our goals.\nThe operational and tactical adjustments we implemented, starting in 2019 and continuing through 2020, have significantly influenced our processes and are yielding positive results on our performance.\nYou'll soon hear specifics about these enhancements.\nOne clear consequence of these efforts has been the impact on our revenue.\nOur revenue decreased in 2020 as we critically evaluated some of our recent business ventures.\nThis reduction doesn't indicate a lack of growth intentions.\nWe do aim to expand.\nWe simply want to ensure our growth is profitable.\nThe recent decline in our revenue is a consequence of this approach.\nDespite the challenging loss environment at this point in the cycle, we're not merely waiting out the storm, but taking time to strategize before proceeding.\nFor Q4, we reported non-GAAP operating income of $3.3 million, or $0.06 per share.\nThis reflects increased equity earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries and a significant quarter-to-quarter improvement in our underwriting results.\nWhile we still have progress to make before we're content with our results, this quarter demonstrated that the changes implemented over the past 18 months are substantially benefiting our operational performance.\nFor the entire year, we reported a non-GAAP operating loss of $27.7 million, attributed to the pre-tax net underwriting loss of $45.7 million from a tail policy issued to a major national healthcare client and a pre-tax $10 million IBNR reserve related to the pandemic, both recorded in Q2.\nOur Q4 consolidated net loss ratio was 74.9%, a notable quarter-over-quarter decrease primarily due to the effects of the large national healthcare account in the previous year's quarter.\nMore importantly, it also reflected our reunderwriting and rate strengthening efforts over the past year.\nThe annual net loss ratio was 83.4%, a 5.6 percentage point decrease mainly due to favorable reserve development and a reduction in the current accident year net loss ratio, driven by improvements in our Specialty P&C segment.\nHowever, the Q2 tail policy and pandemic IBNR reserve largely obscured this improvement.\nOur consolidated underwriting expense ratios for the quarter and year, 30.9% and 30% respectively, were relatively unaffected by our contracting revenue from reunderwriting efforts, demonstrating that our strategic initiatives to improve our underlying expense structure have been effective.\nThe annual expense ratio also reflected one-time restructuring costs and transaction-related expenses associated with our planned NORCAL acquisition, partially offset by reduced travel expenses due to the pandemic.\nFrom an investment standpoint, our consolidated net investment result increased quarter-over-quarter to $26.3 million, driven by $10.1 million in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries.\nWe invest in various LPs and LLCs, with results typically reported on a quarter lag, so the current quarter's earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries represent the value recovery of our LPs and LLCs in Q3.\nConsolidated net investment income was $16.1 million for the quarter, down from the previous year primarily due to a reduced allocation to equities and lower yields from short-term investments and corporate debt securities, given the Federal Reserve's interest rate reductions in response to COVID-19.\nNet investment income was also lower for the year due to these factors.\nThe Specialty Property & Casualty segment continues to implement a comprehensive business strategy to address our operating and underwriting results.\nDespite recording an underwriting loss for the quarter and year, we remain encouraged by the improvement in both expense and net loss ratios, excluding the underwriting loss associated with the large national healthcare account in 2019 and 2020.\nDue to the aggressive restructuring, reunderwriting, and expense reductions implemented throughout 2019 and 2020, we're confident we've established a strong foundation for the future and positive momentum.\nAs anticipated, gross premiums written decreased in the quarter and full year, reflecting our reunderwriting and rate strengthening efforts in the competitive environment across our operating territories.\nHowever, our gross premiums written remained relatively consistent year-over-year in our Medical Technology Liability business.\nAdditionally, gross premiums written in the quarter reflected renewal timing differences of $4.6 million in our Specialty business and the non-renewal of a $2.8 million policy in our Standard Physicians business.\nWe'll continue to prioritize underwriting discipline and achieving our long-term profit objectives, managing the segment's revenue as necessary to improve our bottom line.\nPremium retention improved quarter-over-quarter, largely due to improvement in our specialty business.\nFull-year retention was 79%, reflecting the reunderwriting in specialty and rate strengthening efforts in standard positions over the past year.\nPremium retention results in our Small Business Unit and Medical Technology Liability business remained relatively consistent with historical trends.\nWe achieved higher premium retention and renewal price increases of 8% in the segment this quarter, with 10% increases in both our Standard Physician and Specialty business\nFor the entire year, we saw 9% renewal price increases, with 15% increases in Specialty and 11% in Standard Physicians business\nWe also significantly improved rate adequacy in specialty by enhancing product structure terms and conditions, in addition to price increases\nNew business writings reached $5.3 million this quarter compared to $4.6 million in Q4 2019, driven by our Medical Technology Liability business\nFull-year new business writings were $23 million, down from $43 million in 2019, reflecting careful risk selection, disciplined underwriting, and slower submissions due to pandemic disruptions\nThe current accident year net loss ratio decreased 6.3 percentage points year-over-year, excluding the impact of a large national healthcare account and COVID-19 IBNR reserve\nThis decrease mainly reflects improvements from our reunderwriting efforts that began in Q3 2019\nWe observed significantly reduced claims frequency compared to 2019 in both the quarter and full year, likely partly due to the pandemic\nWe've remained cautious about recognizing these favorable frequency trends due to our long-tail business lines and COVID-19 uncertainty\nRegarding COVID-19 business impact, we established a $10 million pre-tax IBNR reserve in Q2 for reported incidents\nAs of year-end 2020, we haven't seen additional suits emerge from the reported incidents, with only five suits filed\nAfter reviewing pandemic-related claim activity, no additional IBNR reserves have been booked since Q2\nPremium deferrals and discounts have seen minimal changes since Q3\nDespite challenging loss conditions, we recognized net favorable development of $6.8 million in Q4 and $27.5 million for the full year, a significant improvement from 2019\nThe Specialty Property & Casualty segment reported expense ratios of 23.8% in Q4 and 23% for the full year, improvements of 1.4 and 1.1 percentage points respectively compared to 2019\nThis was achieved despite lower net earned premiums and $4 million in one-time restructuring charges\nWe achieved approximately $12 million in expense savings in 2020 through organizational restructuring, office consolidations, and staff reductions\nThe reinsurance market continues to firm due to social inflation and severity claim trends\nWe successfully renewed our reinsurance treaty in October, mitigating potential cost increases by raising our retention from $1 million to $2 million for certain liability businesses\nRegarding the NORCAL transaction, the California Department of Insurance has completed its review of conversion documents\nNORCAL will now begin soliciting policyholder votes on converting from a mutual to a stock company\nPolicyholders can choose to take their ownership share as NORCAL stock, which ProAssurance will offer to buy through a tender offer\nWe expect materials to be mailed to eligible policyholders by late February\nWe now anticipate closing the transaction in Q2 2021, subject to meeting prerequisites\nWe remain excited about combining the companies and the strategic value of this transaction\nWe look forward to continued progress on our business plan in 2021\nThe Workers' Compensation Insurance segment generated $6 million in income and a 97.8% combined ratio for 2020, including $2.1 million in income and a 96.3% combined ratio in Q4\nThe segment recorded $47 million in Q4 and $247 million in full-year gross premiums written, decreases of 13.6% and 11.4% compared to 2019\nRenewal pricing in 2020 decreased 4% for both Q4 and the full year, reflecting ongoing competitive pressures in our underwriting territories despite COVID-19 and economic conditions\nPremium renewal retention improved to 82% for the quarter and 84% for the year in 2020, up from 76% and 83% respectively in 2019\nWe are observing higher premium retention and reduced new business during the COVID-19 crisis\nNew business writings fell to $4.4 million in Q4 2020 from $5.5 million in Q4 2019, and decreased to $27.4 million for full-year 2020 from $30.8 million in 2019\nThe company received $700,000 in additional audit premium for Q4 2020, down from $2.2 million in 2019, and $700,000 for the full year, a decrease from $5.7 million in 2019\nThe reduction in audit premium reflects COVID-19's economic impact on policyholders' payrolls\nWe anticipate continued downward pressure on premiums in upcoming quarters due to changes in payroll estimates\nThe calendar year net loss ratio rose in both Q4 and the full year, due to ongoing soft market conditions in workers' compensation, resulting in lower renewal rates, reduced audit premiums, and decreased net favorable reserve development, partially offset by positive 2020 accident year claim outcomes\nThe accident year loss ratio for 2020 was 69%, compared to 68.4% in 2019\nNet favorable loss reserve development for Q4 2020 was $2 million, down from $4.4 million in 2019, and $7 million for the full year, compared to $7.8 million in 2019\nWe are maintaining our practice of reserving for all claims as if injured workers were receiving medical treatment in the same manner as before the pandemic\nNon-COVID claim frequency decreased by 35% during the pandemic, with only $2.2 million in gross undeveloped incurred losses from 1,375 COVID claims at the end of 2020\nBy the end of January 2021, 87% of the 2020 reported COVID claims had been closed, highlighting the shorter-tailed nature of workers' compensation insurance compared to healthcare professional liability\nManagement remains cautious in assessing the 2020 accident year loss ratio due to the numerous uncertainties surrounding the pandemic\nOur claims professionals continue to work effectively remotely, closing 61% of 2019 and prior claims during 2020, in line with historical claim closing rates\nMany legislative enactments or proposals to expand workers' compensation claim coverage expired on December 31, but new legislative sessions starting in January may revive these efforts\nThe underwriting expense ratio in Q4 was 32.7%, up from 29.8% in 2019, reflecting the decrease in net premiums earned\nThe underwriting expense ratio decreased by 2.5 percentage points from Q3 2020 due to restructuring efforts and a one-time expense of $900,000 in Q3\nFor the full year 2020, the expense ratio was 32.9%, compared to 30.4% in 2019\nThe Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment reported income of $1.6 million for Q4 and $4.4 million for 2020\nPremium trends in the SPC Reinsurance segment were similar to those in the Workers' Compensation Insurance segment\nAll alternative market programs available for renewal were renewed during the current quarter and for the year, with one new program added in 2020\nThe SPC segment recorded favorable development of $9 million in Q4 2020, up from $2.3 million in 2019, and $16.6 million for the full year, compared to $10.1 million in 2019\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were 1,090 reported COVID claims for this segment with $1 million of gross undeveloped incurred losses\nThe Lloyd's Syndicates segment experienced natural catastrophe losses in Q4 related to hurricanes Laura and Sally and Midwest windstorms in August\nOur participation in Syndicate 1729 and 6131 results led to a loss of just under $1 million in Q4\nThe Q4 loss and reduced participation in Syndicate 1729 for the 2020 underwriting year contributed to an overall lower income of approximately $2.1 million for the year\nLosses from storms and other natural catastrophes in the last three months of 2020 are expected to result in a segment loss of approximately $2.5 million in Q1\nFor the 2021 underwriting year, our participation in Syndicate 1729 has been reduced from 29% to 5%, and in Syndicate 6131 from 100% to 50%\nThese changes will be reflected in our results starting in Q2 2021\nThe decision to further reduce our participation in the syndicates is driven by our desire to support and grow our core insurance operations and reduce volatility in our underlying performance\nDuncan Dale and his team at Dale Underwriting Partners remain valued partners to ProAssurance, and the syndicates were able to secure participating capital to replace our own without difficulty\nThe significant improvements made in the past 12 months contribute substantially to our goals of operational excellence and sustainable profitability\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We truly value your participation in today's discussion of Graham's financial performance for the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nThe releases and slides can be accessed on the Company's official website if you don't have them.\nHe's participating in the call and will deliver some formal statements.\nJeff Glajch, our CFO, and Dan Thoren, our President and COO who will become our new CEO after Jim's retirement, are also present.\nJim will begin with an overview and then summarize the quarterly results.\nJeff will then provide a detailed financial analysis, followed by Dan's closing remarks.\nThese potential risks, uncertainties, and other factors are detailed in the release, slide, and other documents submitted by the Company to the SEC.\nYou can find these documents on our website or at sec.gov.\nDuring today's call, we may also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are helpful in assessing our performance.\nWe've provided comparisons of GAAP to non-GAAP measures in the tables accompanying today's release.\nI'll start my presentation at Slide 3 with a quick overview of the financial results before discussing my upcoming retirement.\nThe quarter's revenue was $20.2 million, with $16.7 million from organic growth and $3.5 million from the Barber-Nichols acquisition that concluded on June 1.\nDefense revenue accounted for 35% of total revenue this quarter.\nWe anticipate defense revenue to reach nearly 50% of total quarterly revenue with Barber-Nichols fully integrated in future quarters.\nThis acquisition and revenue mix shift represent a significant transformation for Graham and substantially advanced our diversification strategy.\nOrganic revenue remained similar year-over-year, but for different reasons.\nOur first quarter last year operated at about 50% capacity due to COVID-19, affecting revenue and profitability through under-absorption.\nIn the most recent quarter, our workforce utilization was at full capacity, but the mix was very different.\nOrders from our crude oil refining and chemical/petrochemical markets were very low during the third and fourth quarters of last fiscal year, with non-Navy orders totaling $17.5 million for both quarters.\nAs a result, more production resources were allocated to Navy backlog, which has lower margins due to first article work and contract structure for a large order in backlog.\nThese challenges will be resolved over the next few quarters and largely behind us as we exit this fiscal year.\nOrganic revenue and profitability are expected to improve throughout the fiscal year.\nFirst quarter orders totaled $20.9 million, mostly organic, with Barber-Nichols contributing $200,000 for June.\nEncouragingly, we received strong orders from the crude oil refining market, totaling $11.5 million.\nWe secured a significant contract for a domestic refinery upgrading their facility to enhance crude oil feedstock processing flexibility.\nThis win was particularly satisfying for me, as I remember losing the original order to a domestic competitor in the mid-1990s.\nNow, 25 years later, we've won back the installation and replaced the original supplier with our own vacuum systems.\nConsolidated backlog as of June 30 was $236 million, with 80% in defense.\nImportantly, as we work through the more challenging margin backlog affecting the current fiscal year, the margin potential for our defense backlog improves significantly.\nThe Barber-Nichols acquisition adds market diversity to our profile and introduces backlog for new markets including space and advanced energy industries.\nWhile we invested considerable cash in acquiring Barber-Nichols to strengthen and diversify revenue and earnings, our balance sheet remains strong and our opportunity to improve return on assets increases.\nAs announced earlier today and mentioned by Debbie, I'm pleased to confirm my retirement effective August 31, with Dan Thoren succeeding me as President and CEO of the corporation.\nHe will also join our Board of Directors at that time.\nIt has been a great honor and privilege to serve Graham shareholders and the corporation as its Principal Executive Officer since 2006.\nI believe I'm departing on a high note, as this is an incredibly exciting time for the Company, considering our strong organic defense strategy, success in price-focused international markets, investments in IT tools and systems, and the transformational acquisition of Barber-Nichols.\nI've had the opportunity to work with Dan through the acquisition process for nearly three years and most recently during his onboarding with the Graham team.\nI believe Dan is well-equipped to lead Graham and has an excellent vision for the Company's next growth phase.\nI'm thrilled that this acquisition has proven to be as transformative as we had envisioned.\nThe leadership team's bench strength is being enhanced as part of the transformation.\nIn recent months, it became evident that this has also provided for my succession plan.\nI'm delighted the Board recognized the same potential in Dan that I had observed.\nAs a Graham shareholder, I'm eager to benefit from Dan's strategic leadership.\nYou have my complete backing, not just during this transition, but for the long term.\nI've valued our numerous discussions over the years and greatly appreciated your continued support.\nPlease advance to Slide 4.\nAs Jim noted, we experienced a very challenging first quarter.\nWhile discussing that first quarter, please note that our full year guidance remains unchanged.\nWe anticipate improvements as the year progresses and expect sequential quarterly growth for the remainder of fiscal 2022.\nRevenue in the quarter increased by $3.5 million due to our one-month ownership of Barber-Nichols.\nThe comparable quarter last year occurred early in the COVID pandemic.\nWe operated at half capacity during that quarter, as Jim mentioned.\nHowever, we recognized a $5 million project on a completed contract basis in that quarter, which had shifted from fiscal 2020 to Q1 2021 due to COVID.\nGross profit and earnings per share were significantly impacted by an unfavorable project mix and some timing and cost issues.\nWe incurred liquidated damages due to COVID in the quarter and experienced some timing of expenses pulled into Q1.\nWe also had minor acquisition expenses of about $169,000 pre-tax and the first month of purchase price accounting related costs for Barber-Nichols.\nTo clarify, the purchase accounting amortization costs were $225,000 before taxes in June.\nWe anticipate approximately $2.7 million pre-tax and $2.15 million after-tax related to acquisition purchase accounting.\n90% of this is amortization costs, with the remainder being increased depreciation and inventory valuation.\nWe'll file an 8-K later this week providing more details on the purchase accounting and pro forma income statements.\nWe expect similar amortization amounts in fiscal 2023 as fiscal 2022 since we'll have 12 rather than 10 months of amortization in fiscal 2023.\nIt will decrease in future years and stabilize at approximately $1.1 million pre-tax.\nLet's move to slide 5.\nThe Barber-Nichols acquisition has significantly improved our balance sheet efficiency.\nWe've added $20 million of low-cost term debt for the acquisition and now have access to a larger revolving credit line.\nThis term loan and credit line will provide ongoing flexibility.\nWe expect the Barber-Nichols acquisition to be accretive in fiscal 2022, even with the additional $2.15 million or roughly $0.20 per share in amortization costs.\nWe'll continue seeking both organic and M&A growth opportunities, believing we have the financial strength to invest in both areas.\nThe addition of Barber-Nichols presents excellent opportunities in both domains.\nMoving to slide 6.\nOrders in commercial markets increased in Q1 from a very low base in the previous two quarters.\nOur $236 million backlog positions us well for long-term growth.\n80% of that backlog is in the defense market, providing an excellent baseline for our business in coming years.\nBefore handing over to Dan, I must acknowledge Jim's 37 years of service at Graham, including 15 years as leader.\nHe transformed Graham from a capacity-limited company with minimal growth engines to a broader organization with strong positions in defense and Asian energy markets, complementing our long-standing presence in the United States and Middle East.\nGraham equipment can be found in world-class refining and petrochemical facilities globally and plays a crucial role on US Navy vessels supporting national defense.\nI've known Dan for three years, including negotiating the acquisition with him.\nDan is a high-integrity leader with an impressive track record at Barber-Nichols, and I expect similar success at Graham.\nWhen Board members sought my opinion on Dan as a potential CEO, I was and remain unequivocal in my belief that Dan is the right leader to take Graham forward.\nNow that I've set high expectations, I'll turn the call over to Dan.\nThank you for the kind introduction and words.\nI've spent two and a half years getting acquainted with Graham, its leadership, and its business at a high level.\nIndirectly, I've gained insight into their culture, people, customers, and Board.\nOver the past two months, I've met with the executive team, managers, employees, customers, and the Board to gain a deeper understanding of the Company.\nThese interactions have helped me appreciate Graham's proud engineering and manufacturing heritage, its importance to the Batavia, New York community, and how it has become a trusted partner to customers worldwide in critical process industries.\nAs I present my slides, I'll outline our strategy to build upon our strong legacies while leveraging opportunities in the defense and space industries.\nWe'll focus on generating sustainable earnings growth, reducing earnings volatility, improving operational performance, generating strong cash flows for business reinvestment, and providing dividends to stockholders.\nOur ultimate goals are to deliver acceptable returns to our stockholders and benefit all our stakeholders.\nLet's now examine slide 7.\nFollowing the acquisition of Barber-Nichols, Graham Corporation acknowledges that each company has unique strengths in their respective markets, which we aim to preserve.\nOur aim is to utilize the strengths of each company as foundations for both internal growth and external acquisitions.\nConsequently, both Graham and Barber-Nichols operations function under the umbrella of Graham Corporation.\nWhen considering future investments, we intend to incorporate new businesses and technologies with related engineered products that can operate independently while also collaborating on larger projects.\nWe plan to share best practices among experts in the companies, distribute services across organizations, and create career advancement opportunities for key staff members.\nBy implementing these strategies, each subsidiary can maintain its focus and adaptability while achieving more than it could on its own.\nSlide 7 illustrates our two platforms for growth.\nBarber-Nichols primarily operates in the space and defense sectors.\nGraham manufacturing currently serves the Defense, Energy, and Petrochemical industries.\nWe believe there are acquisition opportunities in the expanding space industry as it attracts more private investment.\nWe will seek small, easily integrated acquisitions as well as medium-sized, self-sustaining acquisitions that complement our existing businesses.\nWe are also investing internally to develop new products and technologies for the space industry.\nBoth Graham and Barber-Nichols are well-established in the defense industries.\nWe will explore new areas to add value and consider internal investments and acquisitions to expand into new and more advanced product lines.\nGraham has been a global leader in vacuum and heat transfer products for energy and chemical/petrochemical applications.\nAs previously discussed by Jim and Jeff, the domestic market is stagnant while international markets show potential for growth.\nWe plan to concentrate on our domestic installed base and provide customers with the necessary support to maintain optimal plant operations.\nWe will continue to invest in international markets and expand our global presence through our proven shared margin strategy.\nRecently, both companies have identified opportunities in the alternative and clean energy markets for turbomachinery and heat transfer products.\nClean energy is an area where synergy between the companies is possible.\nStrategically, we aim to maintain and grow our established business while developing engineering and new product capabilities to participate in emerging alternative and clean energy markets.\nEach of these markets has its own risk and reward profile.\nHaving dedicated teams for each area is crucial, and we have made significant progress in implementing the organizational changes needed to successfully execute our strategies in each market.\nLet's proceed to slide 8.\nAs Jim and Jeff mentioned earlier, we view fiscal '22 as a transitional year, starting off challenging but improving sequentially each quarter.\nMeanwhile, we're observing a stronger pipeline with increased inquiries and new orders in the second quarter.\nGraham manufacturing has received $9.5 million in orders to date in the second quarter, while Barber-Nichols has secured $9.1 million.\nBased on the timing of customers' projects, we are maintaining our revenue guidance at $130 million to $140 million, with Barber-Nichols expected to contribute between $45 million and $48 million.\nCombined, the Defense segment is projected to account for nearly half of the revenue, and EBITDA is anticipated to be in the $7 million to $9 million range.\nCapital expenditures are planned to be between $3.5 million and $4 million, including Barber-Nichols' capital expenditure.\nLet's move on to slide 9.\nAs mentioned in my opening remarks, we are transforming Graham Corporation.\nThe acquisition of Barber-Nichols was the initial transformative step.\nWe will seek to strengthen the Barber-Nichols investment through further development of its platform to enable growth in the defense and space industries, as well as other sectors as opportunities arise.\nCoinciding with the acquisition, we believe we are at or near the bottom of the energy and petrochemical cycle.\nWe have been preparing for an upcoming expansion that we anticipate will begin in FY 2023.\nOur welder training program has been highly successful in replenishing our pipeline of future employees.\nWe are qualifying additional suppliers to increase our capacity in anticipation of a potential upswing.\nOur plans include expanding our international offices with sales, quality, and project management personnel.\nBoth Barber-Nichols and Graham hold leading market positions and strong brand recognition.\nWe believe that robust engineering, close collaboration with customers on challenging applications, and delivery of high-quality products on time will allow us to maintain our brand strength and market leadership.\nAs we progress with our transformation, we will enhance our market presence through linked and updated websites and social media.\nWe believe this will broaden our exposure to a wider audience that may not yet recognize our growth and earnings potential.\nPersonally, I am committed to being an exemplary corporate citizen and working with all our stakeholders to build a better, stronger business for everyone involved.\nWith the Barber-Nichols acquisition, Graham has put its substantial cash reserves to work and created a more efficient balance sheet.\nAs we continue to improve our business and further develop our strong cash-generating capabilities, we intend to make intelligent decisions in allocating capital for future growth, with a keen focus on returns.\nWe are very optimistic about this new combination and the future it presents for all of us.\nWhen you have a talented team capable of identifying customer problems, collaborating on solutions, and adapting to market changes, success is inevitable.\nAt Graham

financial metrics can be found in the Investors area of our website, www.fortive.com, under the Investors quarterly results section.\nOn October 9, 2020, we finalized the division of our former Industrial Technologies segment by spinning off Vontier Corporation.\nConsequently, we have classified the results of the Industrial Technologies segment as discontinued operations.\nAll mentions of year-over-year increases or decreases and financial metrics refer to ongoing operations.\nWe were highly satisfied with our second quarter performance.\nAs illustrated on slide three, our results once again demonstrated the advantages of our strategy to deliver specialized connected workflow solutions for our clients, establishing a portfolio with increased stability and long-term profit potential.\nDuring the quarter, we took advantage of improving point-of-sale trends across several of our major businesses, sustained growth from our software offerings, and better conditions in our primary end markets.\nIn this environment, we achieved core revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margins that surpassed the upper limit of our forecast, resulting in exceptional earnings growth and free cash flow conversion.\nAs we emphasized at our Investor Day on May 19, we are building upon our strong hardware positions and expanding our software capabilities to address our customers' crucial workflow requirements and speed up their ongoing digital transformation.\nIn the second quarter, our SaaS offerings grew by low double digits, and we also achieved significant improvements across our professional services offerings.\nWe continue to observe strong momentum at eMaint, including growing demand from its expansion into the food and beverage, pharmaceutical, and healthcare sectors.\nGordian and Accruent both had strong quarters as they capitalized on opportunities provided by increasing demand from facility owner operators and improved access to customer sites.\nBoth companies are well-positioned to benefit as customers focus on post-COVID return to work challenges and digital transformation priorities.\nCenters also performed exceptionally well in the quarter as access to hospital customers improved, capitalizing on strong demand for its SaaS offerings among existing and new independent delivery network customers.\nExamining the entire portfolio, we remain enthusiastic about our expanding range of EHS workflow solutions, which are well-positioned to meet our customers' significant long-term sustainability requirements.\nISC and Intellect performed well, taking advantage of strong broad-based growth across end-markets and key geographical regions.\nSimultaneously, we are excited about the early progress at ehsAI, where the company secured its largest deal to date in its first joint marketing campaign with Intelex and generated strong growth in its sales pipeline.\nThroughout the second quarter, we continued to apply the Fortive Business System across the portfolio to drive innovation, growth, and market share gains.\nImplementation of our lean portfolio management toolset, which significantly accelerates the efficiency and impact of R&D investments, achieved a greater than 40% increase in our on-time program delivery.\nThe application of FBS and digital analytics and search optimization generated 25% growth in digital traffic from pre-pandemic levels across the portfolio.\nMeanwhile, the use of FBS growth tools has accelerated innovation at Fluke Health Solutions over the past 18 months and continues to drive excellent top-line performance.\nWe have created good early momentum in our partnership with Pioneer Square Labs, including the recent spin-in of TeamSense, a provider of innovative workflow solutions to streamline communications with hourly workers.\nThis marks the first business incubated at Pioneer Square Labs to be integrated into the Fortive portfolio.\nWhile still in its early stages, we are pleased with the progress thus far at TeamSense and are excited to develop additional technologies that accelerate safety and productivity solutions for customers within our core markets.\nIn early July, we announced the acquisition of ServiceChannel.\nThe transaction brings a differentiated high-growth software business with an integrated service provider network and significant proprietary data assets to the portfolio, enhancing our ability to meet the evolving needs of facility owners around the world.\nFollowing the expected closing of the acquisition in Q3, we will have significant balance sheet capacity supported by our strong and resilient free cash flow generation.\nAs we highlighted at our Investor Day, we see substantial opportunities across our $40 billion served market for disciplined capital allocation to accelerate our strategy.\nTurning to a brief summary of the results in the quarter on slide four, we generated year-over-year total revenue growth of 26.7% as revenue strength exceeded the high end of our guidance.\nAdjusted operating margin was 22.2% while adjusted earnings per share was $0.66, representing a year-over-year increase of 53.5%.\nGiven the outperformance for both top line and our adjusted operating margin, we delivered $282 million of free cash flow, which represented 118% conversion of adjusted net income.\nOn slide five, we take a closer look at the Intelligent Operating Solutions segment.\niOS posted total revenue growth of 31.2% in the second quarter.\nThis included mid-20% core growth in North America, low 30% core growth in Western Europe, and low 20% core growth in China.\nFluke's core revenue increased in the mid-30% range.\nFluke also grew by mid-single digits on a sequential basis as we continue to see robust demand across its businesses, highlighted by growth at Fluke Industrial.\nFluke Industrial generated market share gains across a range of key channel partners and retail accounts as point-of-sale accelerated through the quarter.\nFluke's broader ii900 Acoustic Imaging product line also continues to perform very well, as revenue approximately doubled in the quarter on strong growth across both Western Europe and North America.\nFluke Networks' performance was boosted by the introduction of its LinkIQ product line, which has surpassed initial projections related to office reopenings and network changes.\nIn terms of Fluke reliability, efforts to enhance Pruftechnik's performance are gaining momentum as we capitalized on rising demand for alignment and other services, while eMaint also had another impressive quarter.\nDue to the quickened pace of orders at Fluke, we experienced some backlog accumulation because of supply chain responsiveness.\nIndustrial Scientific grew by mid-teens, propelled by strong performance in instruments and rental as demand from oil and gas markets recovered and the business continued to expand into new markets.\nThe company's iNet offering remained strong, growing by mid single-digits with customer retention rate firmly above 100%.\nIntelex experienced high single-digit growth in Q2, reporting its highest revenue quarter to date.\nIntelex continues to utilize FBS and has improved lead generation and funnel conversion.\nDuring the second quarter, Intelex also announced multiple deals for its enhanced ESG platform to assist customers in launching, scaling, and optimizing their sustainability programs and meeting increased demand for transparency on a growing set of critical non-financial reporting metrics.\nAccruent grew by mid single-digits in the second quarter, with low double-digit growth in its SaaS business.\nAccruent generated strong sales and bookings for its Meridian solution for engineering document management and its maintenance connection, CMMS offerings.\nThe business also took advantage of the strong demand for its EMS event, workspace and resource scheduling offerings as companies plan and implement their return-to-work strategies.\nThe company continues to acquire new customers and improve growth in recurring bookings.\nNotably, Accruent also showed improved performance in its professional service business, which achieved mid single-digit growth as customer site access continued to improve.\nGordian grew by mid-teens, driven by low 20% growth in the procurement business and high teens growth in estimating.\nGordian achieved a record month for procurement revenue in June with accelerating timelines for key projects across several large customers.\nThis included increased project spending by the New York City Department of Education and School Construction Authority.\nLet's move on to Slide six.\nThe Precision Technologies segment recorded a total revenue increase of 25.1% in the second quarter.\nThis included low 20% growth in North America, mid-20% growth in Western Europe and mid-teens growth in China.\nTektronix grew by approximately 30%, with another quarter of strong demand across its product businesses, including accelerating point-of-sale trends in each of its major regions.\nBoth mainstream and performance oscilloscopes had a strong quarter with high demand for semiconductor, industrial manufacturing and communications applications.\nTektronix's service business once again demonstrated its stability and resilience, increasing by low teens.\nTektronix continues to benefit from its accelerated focus on driving innovation, with Q2 new product introductions performing very well, including its family of automated test solutions for high-speed data transfer.\nIn the second quarter, Tektronix held six regional innovation forum events, which stimulated the adoption of its tech scope platform, resulting in accelerated funnel creation for the company's broader hardware and software offerings.\nSensing Technologies grew by low teens in the second quarter, with growth driven by the continuation of the broad market recovery.\nSensing performed exceptionally well in China with another quarter of mid-teens growth, driven by demand for factory automation solutions.\nElsewhere, Anderson-Negele continues to make progress with the approval of its paperless process recorder IoT solution aimed at the dairy industry, with broader commercial rollout expected in the second half of the year.\nSensing also continues to gain market share elsewhere across its portfolio, particularly in critical environment solutions and strong demand across its HVAC customers.\nPacSci EMC grew in the low 20% range, with the business experiencing some relief from the COVID-related shutdowns and approval delays that impacted shipments in previous quarters.\nPacSci EMC continues to see good growth in the commercial space market with the resumption of launches by OneWeb providing recurring revenue for smart controllers and initiators.\nAdditionally, on July 20, we were excited to watch the company's mission-critical technology ensure safe and reliable separation of Blue Origin's New Shepard capsule from its booster during its maiden voyage.\nLet's move on to Advanced Healthcare Solutions on Slide seven.\nTotal revenue increased 21.8%, including 11% core growth.\nThis included high single-digit core growth in each of North America, Western Europe and China markets.\nASP grew by high single digits in the second quarter, led by strong growth in Western Europe and China.\nASP also experienced improved growth in North America, highlighted by high single-digit growth in the US.\nOverall, ASP increased its consumable revenue by high teens as the rate of elective procedures across most geographies continued to improve.\nAlthough elective procedure volumes increased year-over-year, Q2 volumes were slightly lower than expected at approximately 93% of pre-COVID levels, which was consistent with the Q1 exit rate.\nASP expanded its worldwide installed base of terminal sterilization equipment, which increased at a 3.5% annual rate during the second quarter.\nThe ongoing growth in installed base is expected to provide additional support for consumable revenue as procedure volumes return to normal in the future.\nCensis experienced growth in the mid-20% range, with its CensiTrac SaaS offering growing in the mid-teens and strong performance in its professional services division.\nMany hospitals are now permitting vendor access, resulting in a significant uptick in activity during the second quarter, especially with integrated delivery networks.\nFluke Health Solutions grew by low double digits despite facing a substantial COVID-related revenue boost in the previous year.\nFHS witnessed high-teens growth from its Optimize and OneQA software solutions, benefiting from increased growth investments over the past 18 months.\nI'll now hand over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our margins, free cash flow, and balance sheet.\nWe achieved solid margin performance in Q2, primarily due to strong follow-through on our revenue outperformance.\nAdjusted gross margins reached 57.3%, a year-over-year increase of 100 basis points.\nThis improvement reflected 130 basis points of price realization as we continued to effectively manage price cost across the portfolio.\nQ2 adjusted operating profit margin was 22.2%, exceeding the high end of our guidance by 170 basis points, also driven by higher volume and associated strong follow-through.\nWe reported 240 basis points of core operating margin expansion, including 570 basis points of core OMX in the iOS segment.\nBoth Fluke and Tektronix achieved strong core operating margin expansion through disciplined application of FBS to drive sales conversion as demand increased across their end markets.\nAdditionally, strong contributions from acquired companies such as ISC, Gordian, Censis, and LANDAUER contributed to margin outperformance across segments.\nIn the second quarter, we generated $282 million in free cash flow, representing a 118% conversion of adjusted net income.\nFree cash flow over the past 12 months increased by 15% to $943 million.\nCurrently, our net leverage is approximately 1 times, and we anticipate it to be around 1.2 times by year-end, including the funding for the Service Channel acquisition but excluding any additional M&A.\nThis provides us with significant capacity to continue deploying capital towards our key allocation priorities.\nGiven our strong second-quarter performance and improved outlook for the rest of the year, we are raising our 2021 guidance once again.\nFor the full year, we now expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be between $2.65 and $2.75, representing year-over-year growth of 27% to 32% on a continuing operations basis.\nThis projection assumes total revenue growth of 13.5% to 15%, adjusted operating profit margins of 22.5% to 23.5%, and an effective tax rate of 14% to 14.5%.\nIt also assumes total revenue growth of 8.5% to 11% in the second half of 2021.\nWe continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income for the full year.\nWe are initiating third-quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.62 to $0.66, representing year-over-year growth of 24% to 32%.\nThis assumes total revenue growth of 11.5% to 14.5%, adjusted operating profit margin of 21.5% to 22.5%, and an effective tax rate of 14% to 14.5%.\nFor the third quarter, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income.\nI'll now hand it back to Jim for some concluding remarks.\nBefore moving to questions, I'd like to provide a brief update on our sustainability and inclusion and diversity efforts, as shown on slide 11.\nDuring our Investor Day program on May 19, we introduced an accelerated greenhouse gas reduction goal, now targeting a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas intensity for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2025 relative to our 2017 base year.\nIn the second quarter, we also released our 2021 sustainability report, which included Fortive's second annual GRI index, first annual SASB index, and the 2017 to 2020 greenhouse gas emissions profile.\nDuring the quarter, we also became a signatory to the UN Global Compact, committed to aligning with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures by 2022, and announced our 2025 aspirational inclusion and diversity goals.\nWe continue to make significant progress and are highly committed to accelerating our sustainability and inclusion and diversity efforts in the coming years.\nAcross all three of our strategic segments, we are building upon strong established positions with offerings that address the critical workflow needs of our customers and markets with attractive long-term growth drivers.\nOur strong earnings and free cash flow performance in the first half of this year clearly demonstrated the benefits of this strategic focus and the momentum building in our portfolio.\nLooking ahead, we will continue to invest in expanding the capabilities of the Fortive Business System as we accelerate operating improvements and innovation to increase the value we offer to our customers.\nWith strong free cash flow and significant M&A capacity, we are well-positioned to pursue key organic and inorganic growth initiatives that will drive consistent double-digit earnings and free cash flow growth in the years to come.\nThat concludes our formal comments.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The information is also mentioned on the second page of our financial supplement.\nLet's begin our conference call with introductory remarks from Dave Nunes, our President and CEO.\nI'll start with some general observations before handing it over to Mark to discuss our overall financial performance.\nNext, I'll invite Doug Long, our Senior Vice President of Forest Resources, to speak about our timber results in the U.S. and New Zealand.\nAfter reviewing our timber performance, Mark will present our real estate outcomes and our projections for the remainder of 2021.\nWe entered 2021 with positive momentum across all our operations, showcasing the robustness and variety of our timber markets and the strategic positioning of our real estate holdings.\nIn Q1, we achieved an adjusted EBITDA of $70 million and pro forma earnings of $0.08 per share.\nOur adjusted EBITDA surpassed the previous year's quarter by 47%, with favorable outcomes in New Zealand Timber, Pacific Northwest Timber, and Real Estate segments compensating for a slight decrease in adjusted EBITDA from our Southern Timber segment.\nReflecting on Q1, we're satisfied with our team's collaborative efforts to capitalize on robust domestic markets, improving real estate trends, and increasing demand for logs from China.\nLet's examine our various operational divisions.\nOur Southern Timber division produced an adjusted EBITDA of $32 million for the quarter, 5% lower than Q1 of the previous year.\nA 7% rise in net stumpage prices and stronger nontimber sales were outweighed by an 18% reduction in harvest volumes due to the front-loaded nature of 2020 harvest activities and weather-related disruptions earlier this year.\nIn our Pacific Northwest Timber division, we attained an adjusted EBITDA of $18 million, an 81% improvement compared to the same quarter last year.\nThis strong performance can be attributed to a significant increase in log pricing driven by strong domestic demand and robust lumber markets, as well as higher volumes resulting from the Pope Resources acquisition.\nIn our New Zealand Timber division, Q1 adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $21 million.\nThis year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA was due to considerably higher harvest volumes and sawtimber pricing, as Q1 2020 was severely impacted by COVID-19-related challenges.\nLastly, our Real Estate division generated an adjusted EBITDA of $5 million.\nThis year-over-year improvement was driven by an increase in acres sold, excluding the large disposition in 2020, amid growing buyer demand, as well as a 9% increase in weighted average prices.\nWhile improved compared to the previous year's quarter as we anticipated entering the year, Q1 Real Estate activity was relatively light in the context of our full-year expectations due to the timing of closings.\nLet's begin with page five, which displays our financial highlights.\nQuarterly sales totaled $191 million, while pro forma sales amounted to $180 million.\nOperating income was $29 million, and net income attributable to Rayonier was $11 million, or $0.08 per share.\nAfter adjusting for the operating income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in our Timber Funds segment, pro forma operating income was $27 million.\nQ1 adjusted EBITDA of $70 million exceeded the prior year quarter as higher results in our New Zealand Timber, Pacific Northwest Timber, and Real Estate segments more than offset a slightly lower contribution from our Southern Timber segment.\nAt the bottom of page five, we provide an overview of our capital resources and liquidity at quarter-end, along with a comparison to year-end figures.\nOur cash available for distribution (CAD) for the quarter was $47 million, compared to $27 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher adjusted EBITDA and lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher cash taxes and interest.\nA reconciliation of CAD to cash provided by operating activities and other GAAP measures is available on page seven of the financial supplement.\nIn line with our flexible approach to capital allocation, we raised $37 million through our at-the-market (ATM) equity offering program during Q1 at an average price of $33.31 per share.\nAs previously discussed, we view the ATM program as a cost-effective tool to opportunistically raise capital, strengthen our balance sheet, and match-fund bolt-on acquisitions.\nIn summary, we ended the quarter with $78 million in cash and $1.3 billion in debt, both excluding cash and debt attributable to the Timber Funds segment, which is nonrecourse to Rayonier.\nOur net debt of $1.2 billion represented 21% of our enterprise value based on our closing stock price at the end of Q1.\nLet's begin with page eight, focusing on our Southern Timber segment.\nQ1 adjusted EBITDA of $32 million was $2 million below the prior year quarter.\nThe decrease compared to the previous year's quarter was largely due to an 18% reduction in harvest volumes, resulting from the front-loaded timing of 2020 activities and weather-related disruptions earlier this year.\nSpecifically, winter snowstorms in the Gulf region and wet ground conditions in Georgia led to lost production days compared to Q1 2020.\nThe decline in volumes during Q1 was partially offset by higher net stumpage prices and nontimber income.\nSpecifically, average sawlog stumpage pricing was approximately $28 per ton, a 3% increase compared to the prior year quarter.\nSawlog pricing is gradually improving as we successfully leverage continued lumber market strength into higher sawlog prices in certain U.S. South markets.\nFurthermore, increased pricing tension due to growing demand for export-grade logs is becoming more apparent in our coastal markets.\nHowever, pricing trends continue to vary significantly by region, underscoring the importance of local timber market dynamics.\nPulpwood pricing increased by 7% from the prior year quarter, reflecting the weather conditions that restricted supply during Q1 as well as a favorable mix shift toward our coastal Atlantic markets.\nOverall, weighted average pine stumpage prices rose 8% compared to the prior year quarter, based on higher sawtimber and pulpwood prices as well as a more favorable mix of sawtimber.\nQ1 nontimber sales of $8 million were $2 million above the prior year quarter.\nThe surge in comparison to the previous year's quarter was primarily due to a substantial pipeline easement sale.\nLet's move on to discussing our Pacific Northwest Timber segment, which can be found on page nine.\nAdjusted EBITDA reached $18 million, surpassing the prior year quarter by $8 million.\nThe year-on-year improvement was mainly attributed to strong domestic lumber markets, resulting in significantly better pricing.\nThe harvest volume in the first quarter exceeded that of the previous year's quarter by 13%.\nThis year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the additional volume from the Pope Resources acquisition last year.\nOur average delivered sawlog price in the first quarter was $91 per ton, representing a 21% increase from the same quarter last year.\nDespite domestic mills in the region maintaining sufficient log inventories, robust pricing persisted throughout the quarter.\nIn contrast, pulpwood pricing declined by 23% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, due to an abundance of sawmill residuals amid increased lumber production.\nIt's worth noting that the Pacific Northwest is experiencing improved demand from the export market.\nThe restricted flow of European spruce salvage logs due to transportation constraints, combined with China's ban on Australian log imports, is resulting in increased demand for exports from the Pacific Northwest.\nWith domestic log demand already robust due to strong domestic lumber markets, we anticipate that increased export market demand will provide additional pricing support, particularly for whitewood species.\nI'd like to briefly comment on the impact of last year's wildfires in the Pacific Northwest.\nAs a reminder, our fee timber properties were not directly affected by the fires, although approximately 10,000 acres of Timber Fund properties experienced some fire damage.\nConsistent with our February update, our operations in the region have not been significantly impacted by others' salvage efforts.\nThere have been some localized increases in hauling costs in areas directly affected by the fires.\nHowever, the location of our timberland, strong demand for green logs from many of our customers, and the consistent business we've provided to our logging crews in the region have resulted in minimal impact on our operations.\nOverall, we are well-positioned to capitalize on strong domestic demand trends, improving export market conditions, and the favorable pricing environment we currently see in the Pacific Northwest, especially following last year's successful integration of Pope Resources.\nPage 10 displays the results and key operating metrics for our New Zealand Timber segment.\nThe first quarter's adjusted EBITDA of $21 million was more than twice the $10 million reported in the same quarter of the previous year.\nThe increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven by significantly stronger pricing and a more normal level of harvest activity compared to the prior year period, which was constrained by COVID-19 disruptions.\nHigher volumes and pricing were partially offset by reduced carbon credit sales.\nWe chose to postpone carbon credit sales during the quarter, anticipating further price appreciation due to recent changes in New Zealand's climate change goals and proposed modifications to the country's emissions trading scheme.\nExport sawtimber average delivery prices rose by 28% from the prior year quarter to $120 per ton, reflecting improved trade demand and escalating trade tensions between China and Australia.\nNew Zealand log export pricing continues to benefit from China's ban on Australian log imports.\nAs previously noted, Australia was supplying approximately 10% of the total volume imported by China before the ban.\nFurthermore, while the abundant supply of European spruce continues to compete for market share in China, availability has been temporarily constrained by higher shipping costs and container shortages.\nConsequently, we have seen significant pricing upside in New Zealand on the export front, although this has been partially offset by substantially higher shipping costs.\nWe expect these costs to remain elevated given the global economic recovery and shipping demand for various commodities.\nTurning to the New Zealand domestic market, average delivered sawlog prices increased by 16% from the prior year period to $81 per ton.\nThe increase in U.S. pricing was primarily driven by foreign exchange rates, as New Zealand domestic pricing improved by a more modest 4% in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter.\nAverage domestic pulpwood pricing rose by 19% compared to the same quarter last year.\nIn summary, despite the recent increase in shipping costs, we believe our New Zealand operations are well-positioned to benefit from further strengthening of the Chinese economy, any prolonged reduction in log imports from Australia, and continued healthy domestic demand.\nI'll now briefly discuss the results from our Timber Funds segment, highlighted on page 11.\nThe Timber Funds generated consolidated EBITDA of $7 million in the first quarter on a harvest volume of 145,000 tons.\nAdjusted EBITDA, which reflects the look-through contribution from the Timber Funds, was $1 million.\nLastly, in our Trading segment, we reported $200,000 of adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter.\nAs a reminder, our trading activities typically generate low margins and are primarily designed to provide additional economies of scale to our fee timber export business.\nAs detailed on page 12, real estate closings were relatively modest during the first quarter, which aligned with our expectations and the guidance we provided earlier this year.\nSpecifically, sales totaled just over $10 million on approximately 2,400 acres sold at an average price of nearly $4,200 per acre.\nReal estate adjusted EBITDA was $5 million in the first quarter.\nThe majority of first quarter sales were in the rural category.\nSales of rural land amounted to approximately $2,400, with 2,400 acres sold at an average price of nearly $4,100 per acre.\nThere has been a significant increase in demand for rural properties, as buyers are attracted to the space, privacy, and recreational opportunities these lands offer.\nWe anticipate this positive trend to continue, and we remain committed to achieving prices significantly higher than timberland values.\nImproved development sales totaled about $250,000, comprising three residential lots in our Wildlight development project near Jacksonville, Florida, selling for an average of $84,000 per lot, or $406,000 per acre.\nAlthough development closings were few this quarter, we are very optimistic about the pipeline we've built for the remainder of 2021.\nThe team is taking advantage of the growing demand for rural land and residential lots, as well as commercial parcels within our development projects.\nWe are confident that a combination of demographic shifts, record-low mortgage rates, and an increased need for space will benefit our various real estate sales categories.\nCompared to the first quarter, we anticipate a substantial increase in the EBITDA contribution from our Real Estate segment over the next few quarters.\nSpecifically in development, there is currently strong demand from homebuilders for lots and entitled land with infrastructure.\nWe are pleased to announce that in February, Publix, a popular Florida-based supermarket chain, will anchor a new shopping center in Wildlight.\nWe expect that as this community becomes more established, interest from builders will continue to increase.\nWe are also encouraged by the potential opportunities for our properties in Richmond Hill, Georgia and the West Puget Sound area of Washington.\nLet's now discuss our outlook for the year.\nGiven our strong start to 2021 and our expectation of a significant increase in real estate closings as the year progresses, we believe we are on track to achieve full-year adjusted EBITDA near the higher end of our previous guidance range of $285 million to $315 million.\nIn our Southern Timber segment, we expect to meet our full-year volume guidance of 6.2 million to 6.4 million tons, as we anticipate continued strong demand from lumber mills and improved export demand in select U.S. South markets.\nWe also continue to expect a slight improvement in weighted average pricing compared to last year, with quarterly variations primarily due to geographic mix.\nFor our Pacific Northwest Timber segment, we expect to achieve our full-year volume guidance of 1.7 million to 1.8 million tons.\nHowever, since we advanced some volume into the first quarter to capitalize on favorable demand and pricing, we anticipate lower quarterly harvest volumes for the rest of the year.\nWe also expect that robust domestic lumber markets and increased export demand will maintain pricing at or above first quarter average prices throughout the year.\nIn our New Zealand Timber segment, we expect to meet our full-year volume guidance of 2.6 million to 2.8 million tons with higher quarterly harvest volumes for the remainder of the year.\nWe anticipate continued strong export and domestic demand, and we expect that the restriction on Australian log imports into China will limit competing log supplies.\nWe believe this positive operating momentum will result in log prices remaining near or above levels seen in the first quarter, partially offset by higher shipping costs.\nFor our Real Estate segment, we anticipate a significant increase in closings over the rest of the year based on our current pipeline of opportunities.\nOur pipeline has expanded considerably as we've progressed through 2021, driving our increasingly optimistic sales outlook for residential and commercial properties within our real estate development projects.\nAlthough first quarter closings were relatively low as expected, we remain confident that we will meet or exceed our previous full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance.\nAs we approach the one-year anniversary of the Pope Resources acquisition, which closed last May, we continue to be very satisfied with the integration process and the benefits realized from this transaction.\nThe addition of these high-quality assets and the integration of Pope's personnel into the Rayonier family has significantly increased our operational flexibility and market reach within the Pacific Northwest.\nWe've leveraged these improvements to our team and portfolio as market conditions have continued to improve over the past year.\nAlongside the Pope integration, we've also continued to focus on other opportunities to grow and enhance our portfolio.\nTo this end, we completed $30 million of negotiated bolt-on timber acquisitions across the U.S. South at the beginning of 2021.\nWe also released our inaugural carbon report in March.\nThis report detailed the 5.7 million metric tons of net carbon sequestered by our forest operations in 2019 and demonstrates the crucial role that working forests play in combating climate change.\nRayonier's business model provides a natural solution to climate change.\nOur trees absorb carbon from the atmosphere during their growth cycle.\nAfter harvesting, a significant portion of this carbon remains stored for an extended period in downstream wood products.\nBuilding on our inaugural carbon report, we plan to publish a comprehensive sustainability report this summer.\nWe believe our mission of providing industry-leading financial returns to our shareholders while acting as a responsible steward of our lands aligns well with the holistic approach embodied by greater adherence to ESG principles.\nWe are proud of the progress we've made in enhancing our ESG disclosures.\nWe look forward to further engagement on these important topics with our shareholders and other stakeholders in the future.\nIn conclusion, we are benefiting from strengthening end markets and continuing to make progress on several important strategic priorities.\nI am very proud of our people's accomplishments and their unwavering commitment to building long-term value for our shareholders.\nDespite the unprecedented challenges faced over the past year, our team is working diligently to better position the company for long-term success.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Our financial presentations provide a comparison between standard and adjusted financial measurements.\nEssential refers to specific financial indicators that don't include the effects of the recent s::can and ATi purchases.\nWe consider this benchmark crucial for comparing performance from one year to the next.\nI'm extremely impressed with our team's commitment and performance in supporting our clients and achieving record-breaking sales despite widespread supply chain inflation and logistical issues.\nThe strong order momentum from Q1 continued into Q2, and even with that robust performance, our backlog hit another all-time high as we concluded the second quarter.\nOur newly acquired water quality businesses, s::can and ATi, exceeded our expectations with strong revenue growth and positive impact on earnings per share.\nThe quarter was exceptional, largely due to the consistent daily efforts and activities.\nAs shown on Slide 4, Q2 total sales reached $122.9 million, a 35% increase from the coronavirus-affected low of $91.1 million in the same period last year.\nThe overall utility water sales grew by 38%.\nExcluding the roughly $12 million in sales from s::can and ATi acquisitions, core utility water revenues rose by 22% compared to the previous year.\nWhen compared to the pre-COVID affected second quarter of 2019, core utility water sales increased by 11%.\nAs Ken mentioned, we continue to see strong orders, but supplier limitations on certain electronic components and other parts, along with logistical challenges, again restricted manufacturing output and deliveries.\nWe saw growth in overall meter sales and BEACON software as a service revenue, and we benefited from strategic value-based pricing strategies.\nWe ended the quarter with another record-high backlog, which is promising for our future sales projections.\nAs expected, the flow instrumentation product line's sales growth rate turned positive with a 22% year-over-year improvement, influenced by stabilizing demand across most global markets and applications, as well as an easier comparison base.\nWe were satisfied with the operating profit margins achieved in the quarter, considering the significant and diverse inflationary pressures.\nThe quarter's operating margin was 15.2%, representing a 130 basis point increase year-over-year.\nThe gross margin for the quarter reached 40.8%, a 150 basis point improvement compared to the previous year.\nMargins benefited from favorable acquisition mix, higher volumes, positive product sales mix (particularly higher SaaS revenues), and successful value-based pricing implementation.\nThese factors collectively mitigated the cost pressures arising from increased brass prices and inflation in other components and logistics.\nExamining copper more closely, prices have stabilized around $4.30 after reaching approximately $4.80 earlier in the quarter.\nThis aligns with our most recent estimate of the year-over-year cost increase, which was about $7 million to $8 million annually before mitigation efforts.\nOur profit margins show that we've successfully implemented pricing strategies to counteract this inflation, and we'll continue to monitor prices closely in response to inflationary pressures.\nLet's move on to SEA expenses.\nQ2 expenditure of $31.4 million was consistent with Q1 2021's $31.6 million and shows an $8.2 million increase from the previous year.\nYou may remember that the previous year benefited from various cost-cutting measures implemented at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporary layoffs.\nThe current SEA rate includes both s::can and ATi, along with increased amortization of acquired intangible assets, and aligns with our long-term expectations of normalized SEA leverage in the 25% to 26% range.\nThe second quarter 2021 income tax rate was 25%, slightly above the previous year's 24.3%.\nTo summarize, earnings per share reached $0.48 in Q2 2021, a 45% increase from $0.33 in the same period last year.\nWorking capital as a percentage of sales remained steady at 24.3% compared to the previous quarter.\nInventory levels rose due to manufacturing constraints and commodity inflation as mentioned earlier.\nFree cash flow of $11.9 million was lower than the previous year, resulting from higher cash tax payments and increased inventory.\nYear-to-date free cash flow conversion of net earnings stands at 147%.\nWe seized the opportunity to expand the facility to $150 million and enhance flexibility through leverage covenants and an accordion feature, among other improvements.\nOur robust cash flow and borrowing capacity provide sufficient liquidity to fund our ongoing capital allocation priorities.\nLet's move to Slide 5.\nWe've updated the chart introduced last quarter with actual Q2 data.\nGiven the numerous variables affecting both current and previous year comparisons, we believe this chart can help explain the uneven results we've experienced and will continue to see in our sales.\nOur strong growth this quarter, excluding acquisitions, was driven by sustained high order rates and a record-high backlog at the start of the period.\nThis growth was partly due to easier comparisons with last year's second quarter, which was heavily impacted by COVID-19.\nOur positive growth outlook for the latter half of the year is supported by continued strong orders and our record-high backlog.\nThe third quarter will face tough comparisons in sales and profitability due to last year's post-lockdown recovery in manufacturing output and orders.\nOur supply chain team is working hard to address various shortages in electronic and other components.\nWhile we don't anticipate a return to normalcy, we expect to convert more of our backlog as the year progresses.\nWe're pleased with the performance of our recent water quality acquisitions, which contributed over $12 million in revenue this quarter and showed double-digit pro forma growth.\nThe success of these acquisitions and our integration efforts supports our strategy of combining water quantity and quality solutions to accelerate our customers' digital transformations.\nThe significant increase in order rates over recent quarters confirms the strong market demand for smart water solutions that monitor, manage, and improve efficiency across water distribution systems.\nWe are well-positioned to serve both utility and industrial customers with our comprehensive range of intelligent water solutions for both quantity and quality.\nHaving a record backlog is a positive challenge that we expect to persist as we move through the second half of the year and beyond.\nComponent suppliers are making progress in rebuilding capacity, but the recovery will remain uneven until inventory levels can fully meet demand.\nDespite challenges in component availability, inflation, and logistics, our teams are working to build supply chain resilience and maintain clear communication with suppliers and customers to manage expectations.\nOur effective sourcing strategies, market-driven innovation, and operational flexibility are supporting Badger Meter's profitable growth and delivering value to shareholders.\nWe've added new ESG-related disclosures to our website, including how we align our efforts with UN Sustainable Development Goals and a SASB-focused report with annual metrics for 2020.\nBadger Meter continues to advance its ESG initiatives, working to understand and mitigate the most significant risks of climate change and protect the world's water resources.\nSummary: ",

Brent Wood, is also joining us for this call.\nWe trust everyone is having a pleasant autumn season.\nThey maintain excellent performance and are benefiting from a highly favorable environment.\nOur results for the third quarter were impressive, showcasing the durability of our portfolio and the industrial market.\nThe team's achievements include funds from operations exceeding expectations, showing a 14% increase compared to the same quarter last year and surpassing our projections.\nThis represents the 34th straight quarter of improved FFO per share compared to the corresponding quarter in the previous year, indicating a sustained long-term trend.\nOur average quarterly occupancy reached 97.1%, an improvement of 50 basis points from the third quarter of 2020, and at the end of the quarter, we surpassed expectations with 98.8% leased and 97.6% occupied.\nOur occupancy rates are improving due to a robust market driven by growing e-commerce and last-mile delivery trends.\nQuarterly releasing spreads hit unprecedented levels at 37.4% GAAP and 23.9% cash, while year-to-date figures stand at 31% GAAP and 18.5% cash.\nLastly, cash same-store NOI increased by 5.2% for the quarter and 5.6% year-to-date.\nIn conclusion, I'm delighted with our team's performance, delivering one of the strongest quarters in our company's history.\nCurrently, we're capitalizing on the market's strength and the demand for industrial properties from both users and investors by concentrating on creating value through development and value-add investments.\nI'm pleased that we concluded the quarter with a record-high 98.8% leased rate, and to illustrate the market's robustness, our past four quarters have marked the highest quarterly rates in our company's history.\nRegarding Houston, we've achieved a 96.7% leased rate.\nIt now accounts for 12% of our rental income, a decrease of 140 basis points from last year, and is expected to continue declining.\nOur company's development initiatives are driven by market demand, as previously mentioned.\nWe are increasing our projected starts to $340 million for 2021, given the current market strength we are observing.\nThis figure represents a new annual record for our company's development starts.\nTo meet this market demand, we have purchased several new locations and have more in the pipeline, along with value-add and direct investment opportunities.\nWe will provide more information as we finalize each of these deals.\nBrent will now discuss various financial topics, including our guidance for 2021.\nOur third quarter results showcase our team's excellent execution, the strong overall performance of our portfolio, and the continued success of our proven strategy.\nThe third quarter FFO per share surpassed our guidance range at $1.55, representing a 14% increase compared to $1.36 in the third quarter of 2020.\nThis outperformance is primarily due to our operating portfolio performing better than expected, especially in terms of occupancy and rental rate growth.\nRegarding capital, we issued $49 million of equity during the third quarter at an average price exceeding $176 per share.\nWe paid off a maturing $40 million senior unsecured term loan in July.\nIn September, we refinanced a $100 million unsecured term loan, reducing the effective fixed interest rate from 2.75% to 2.1%, with a remaining term of five years.\nAs part of our ongoing commitment to enhance our ESG efforts, we included a sustainability-linked metric in the amended terms.\nThese actions, combined with our already robust and conservative balance sheet, maintained our position of financial strength and flexibility.\nOur debt to total market capitalization was under 17%, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 4.7 times, and our interest and fixed charge coverage ratio improved to over 8.5 times.\nOur rent collection performance has been equally impressive.\nUncollectible debt for the initial nine months of the year shows a positive balance of $346,000, attributed to tenants who previously had reserved balances but are now current, surpassing new tenant reserves\nThis pattern continues to demonstrate the reliability, financial strength, and varied nature of our tenant portfolio\nLooking ahead, we anticipate FFO for the last quarter of 2021 to range between $1.54 and $1.58 per share, with a yearly estimate of $6.01 to $6.05, representing a $0.15 per share improvement from our earlier projection\nThe 2021 FFO per share median indicates a 12.1% growth compared to 2020\nOur updated 2021 forecast includes significant changes such as: raising the cash same-property median by 8% to 5.6%, reducing reserves for uncollectible rent by $900,000, boosting projected development initiations by 24% to $340 million, and increasing combined equity and debt issuance by $95 million\nTo conclude, we are very satisfied with our performance in the third quarter\nWe will continue to leverage our financial robustness, our team's expertise, and the prime location and quality of our portfolio to maintain our momentum throughout the year\nMarshall will now provide some concluding remarks\nAs we near the end of 2021, I'm thrilled with our current position\nWe're surpassing our initial projections and carrying this positive trend into 2022\nOur company, team, and strategy are performing excellently, as demonstrated by our quarterly results\nI'm most enthusiastic about EastGroup's future prospects\nOur approach has proven successful in recent years\nWe're observing an acceleration in several positive trends for our properties and within our markets\nSimultaneously, our core traditional tenants continue to require and will keep needing last-mile distribution facilities in rapidly expanding Sunbelt markets\nThese factors, combined with our team's composition, our operational strategy, and our market presence, make us optimistic about what's to

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Craig Lampo, Amphenol's Chief Financial Officer, is speaking.\nI'm joined by Adam Norwitt, our Chief Executive Officer.\nI'll provide some financial insights, after which Adam will give a business overview and discuss current trends.\nWe'll then open the floor for questions.\nNote that all share and per-share data mentioned in this earnings call reflects the post-split figures, following our two-for-one stock split on March 4, 2021.\nIn Q1, the company achieved sales of $2.377 billion, with GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.53 and $0.52, respectively.\nCompared to Q1 2020, sales grew by 28% in U.S. dollars, 25% in local currencies, and 23% organically.\nCompared to the previous quarter, sales decreased by 2% in U.S. dollars, 3% in local currencies, and 4% organically.\nThe quarter's orders totaled $2.734 billion, showing a 27% increase from Q1 2020 and a 9% sequential increase, resulting in a robust book-to-bill ratio of 1.15:1.\nLet's break down our sales by segment.\nThe interconnect business, accounting for 96% of sales, saw a 28% increase in U.S. dollars and a 25% increase in local currencies compared to Q1 last year.\nOur cable business, making up 4% of sales, experienced a 17% increase in U.S. dollars and an 18% increase in local currencies compared to Q1 last year.\nAdam will provide more details on market trends shortly.\nQ1 2021 operating income reached $465 million.\nThe operating margin of 19.6% decreased by 100 basis points sequentially compared to Q4 2020's adjusted operating margin, but increased by a substantial 260 basis points compared to Q1 2020.\nThe year-over-year margin improvement was primarily due to normal operating leverage on higher sales volumes and reduced COVID-19 related costs, partially offset by a more challenging commodity and supply chain environment.\nThe sequential margin decline was attributed to normal conversion on lower sales levels and the aforementioned challenging commodity and supply chain conditions.\nIn the interconnect segment, Q1 2021 margins were 21.5%, up from 19.1% in Q1 2020 but down 100 basis points sequentially.\nThe cable segment saw margins of 8.8%, an increase from 7.6% in Q1 2020 but a decrease from 10.3% in Q4.\nWe're extremely proud of the company's performance given the ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur team's ability to navigate this crisis effectively is a direct result of our entrepreneurial management team's strength and commitment, fostering a high-performance, action-oriented culture that has allowed us to capitalize on numerous opportunities for incremental sales while driving strong operating performance in this dynamic market environment.\nThe company's Q1 GAAP effective tax rate was 23.9%, compared to 15.9% in Q1 2020.\nOn an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 24.5% in Q1 of both 2021 and 2020.\nGAAP diluted earnings per share increased by 33% to $0.53, up from $0.40 in the same period last year.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share rose by 49% to $0.52, compared to $0.35 in Q1 2020.\nThe company continues to demonstrate excellent cash generation abilities.\nQ1 cash flow from operations totaled $321 million, or 97% of GAAP net income.\nAfter accounting for capital spending, free cash flow was $243 million, or 74% of net income.\nRegarding working capital, inventory days, days sales outstanding, and payable days were 85, 73, and 59 days respectively, all within normal ranges.\nDuring Q1, the company bought back 2.4 million shares of common stock for approximately $153 million.\nIn April, the company repurchased the small remaining amount of stock authorized under the existing stock repurchase plan.\nThe high cash balance at the end of Q1 was due to borrowings under the company's U.S. commercial paper program in anticipation of the MTS acquisition closing in early April.\nTotal debt stood at $4.6 billion, with net debt at $2.3 billion.\nTotal available liquidity at quarter-end was $4.1 billion, including cash and short-term investments on hand.\nQ1 2021 EBITDA was $559 million, with a net leverage ratio of 1.0 times.\nOn April 7, following the quarter's end, we finalized the MTS acquisition, which Adam will discuss in more detail later.\nThe MTS acquisition was funded through a combination of cash and cash equivalents on hand, along with additional borrowings under the company's U.S. commercial paper program.\nIncluding the MTS acquisition and the anticipated divestiture of the test and simulation business, pro forma total available liquidity and net leverage as of March 31, 2020, would be $3.2 billion and 1.4 times, respectively.\nUntil the sale of the MTS test and simulation business is complete, we will report it as a discontinued operation.\nAs such, the expected sales and earnings from this business are not included in our guidance.\nOur guidance also excludes approximately $85 million or $0.12 per share in cash and non-cash expenses related to the MTS acquisition, to be expensed in Q2.\nThese expenses include costs related to early debt extinguishment, non-cash purchase accounting-related expenses, external transaction expenses, severance, and other costs.\nThe company will incur additional cash tax-related and other acquisition-related costs in connection with the test and simulation business divestiture, which will not be included in income from continuing operations.\nOur guidance incorporates the expected results of the MTS Sensors business, which is anticipated to generate $350 million in sales and $0.05 in diluted earnings per share in the first 12 months after closing, as previously announced.\nI sincerely hope that you, your loved ones, friends, and colleagues are staying safe and healthy.\nAs Craig mentioned, I'll now highlight our Q1 achievements.\nI'll then discuss our trends and progress across our diverse served markets.\nTo conclude, I'll share some thoughts on our second quarter outlook.\nWe'll open the floor for questions and answers afterwards.\nOur first quarter performance significantly exceeded our projections, surpassing the upper range of our guidance for both revenue and adjusted earnings per share.\nRevenue expanded robustly by 28% in USD and 25% in local currencies.\nOrganic revenue growth reached 23%.\nWe experienced organic growth across nearly all our market segments, with particularly strong performance in automotive, mobile devices, industrial, and IT datacom sectors.\nWe achieved record bookings of $2.734 billion in the quarter, resulting in an impressive book-to-bill ratio of 1.15:1.\nDespite ongoing pandemic-related operational challenges and increased costs due to commodity and supply chain pressures, our operating margins remained healthy at 19.6%, representing a 260 basis point improvement year-over-year.\nOur adjusted earnings per share saw a substantial 49% increase compared to the previous year, showcasing the Amphenol organization's strong execution.\nWe generated operating and free cash flows of $321 million and $243 million respectively in the first quarter, clearly demonstrating the high quality of our earnings.\nI'm extremely proud of our team's performance this quarter.\nOur results once again highlight the discipline and adaptability of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to excel in a dynamic and challenging environment.\nI'd like to discuss our recent acquisitions.\nWe successfully completed the acquisition of MTS Systems earlier than anticipated, as announced on April 7.\nWe've agreed to sell the MTS test and simulation business to Illinois Tool Works for $750 million, subject to post-closing adjustments and excluding transaction-related expenses.\nWe anticipate this sale to finalize upon receiving all necessary regulatory approvals.\nWe're particularly excited about the combined strength of our complementary sensor product portfolios, which we believe will allow us to offer customers an expanded range of innovative technologies across multiple markets.\nWe expect the MTS Sensors business to contribute approximately $350 million in sales and $0.05 in adjusted earnings per share in the first year after closing.\nMore importantly, we look forward to realizing the long-term benefits of the combined strengths of Amphenol and MTS Sensors for years to come.\nThis significant acquisition has positioned Amphenol as one of the most diverse and comprehensive sensor companies in the industry.\nWe also completed two smaller acquisitions in the first quarter.\nIn February, we acquired Euromicron, a German manufacturer of advanced fiber optic interconnect solutions for mobile networks and IT datacom markets, with annual sales of about $25 million.\nIn March, we acquired Cabelcon from Corning Inc., a Denmark-based designer and manufacturer of high-tech connectors and interconnect assemblies for the European broadband market, also with annual sales of approximately $25 million.\nOur ability to identify, execute, and successfully integrate acquisitions remains a core competitive advantage for our company.\nRegarding trends across our served markets, we continue to benefit from our balanced and diverse end market exposure.\nThis diversification helps mitigate the impact of volatility in individual markets while exposing us to leading technologies across the electronics industry.\nIn the military market, which represented 11% of our quarterly sales, we saw 3% growth year-over-year, with flat organic growth.\nWe expect low double-digit growth in the second quarter, benefiting from the addition of MTS Sensors and increased demand for interconnect products.\nThe commercial aerospace market, accounting for 2% of our sales, experienced a significant 47% decline year-over-year due to pandemic-related disruptions.\nWe anticipate sequential improvement in the second quarter, aided by our recent acquisitions.\nThe industrial market, representing 24% of our sales, saw strong 33% growth in both U.S. dollars and organically.\nThis growth was driven by robust performance across various segments, including battery and electric heavy vehicles, rail mass transit, heavy equipment, instrumentation, factory automation, alternative energy, and medical applications.\nFor the upcoming second quarter, we anticipate the industrial market to grow by low double digits compared to the first quarter.\nWe expect to benefit from incorporating MTS Sensors while gaining traction in various industrial market segments.\nThe MTS Sensors acquisition has broadened our industrial sensor portfolio, adding sensors for position, vibration, force, and shock used in numerous industrial applications.\nCombined with our existing sensor operations, we now offer a diverse range of sensors covering nearly all segments of the industrial market we serve.\nI continue to be extremely proud of our global team working in the industrial market.\nOur advanced interconnect, antenna, and sensor offerings put us in a strong position with customers who are increasingly adopting electronics across all applications.\nThe automotive sector accounted for 22% of our quarterly sales, significantly outperforming expectations with 52% growth in U.S. dollars and 44% organic growth, as our team executed well during a strong and widespread recovery in the automotive market.\nWe observed particularly robust growth in our products used in electric and hybrid electric vehicles during the quarter.\nThis serves as excellent validation of our global team's long-term efforts to integrate high-voltage and other interconnect and sensor products into these crucial next-generation platforms.\nOur sales increased by 6% compared to the fourth quarter.\nThe automotive industry is currently facing various supply chain challenges, as widely reported.\nConsequently, we anticipate a slight sequential decrease in sales for the second quarter due to temporary impacts on certain areas of new vehicle production caused by global supply chain disruptions.\nI'm extremely impressed by our automotive market team's performance.\nThey have demonstrated remarkable flexibility and resilience during these turbulent times, thereby solidifying the company's position with our automotive market customers.\nWe anticipate reaping the benefits of their efforts well into the future.\nThe mobile devices market represented 12% of our quarterly sales.\nSales in this market increased by a better-than-expected 51% year-over-year, with strength across all product types, particularly in wearables and laptops.\nSequentially, our sales declined by 35%, slightly better than our expectations and within the typical range of first quarter seasonality for the mobile devices market.\nLooking ahead to the second quarter, we expect a further sequential sales decline in the high single digits, which is also not unusual for this market during the second quarter.\nAlthough mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile markets, our exceptional and uniquely adaptable team is ready to seize any opportunities for additional sales that may arise in 2021 and beyond.\nOur leading range of antennas, interconnect products, and mechanisms continues to enable various next-generation mobile devices, positioning us favorably for the long term.\nTurning to the mobile networks market, it accounted for 6% of our quarterly sales, with a 4% growth in U.S. dollars and 1% organic growth year-over-year, as strength in products sold to OEMs was partially offset by a moderation in sales to network operators.\nWe were pleased to achieve better-than-expected sequential growth of 19% in the mobile networks market this quarter as mobile network operators increased spending on next-generation networks.\nFor the second quarter, we anticipate a modest increase in sales from first quarter levels, aided by the addition of Euromicron, which expands our offerings for mobile network operators in Europe and positions us well to support future network upgrades.\nOur team continues to work aggressively to expand our position in next-generation equipment and systems worldwide.\nAs our customers ramp up investment in these advanced networks, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both original equipment manufacturers and mobile network service providers.\nThe information technology and data communications market represented 19% of our quarterly sales.\nSales in this quarter exceeded expectations, increasing by 25% in U.S. dollars and 24% organically year-over-year, driven by broad-based strength across networking, storage, and server applications.\nWhile we had anticipated a decline from the fourth quarter, we were pleased to achieve a sequential growth of 6% as customers continued to increase demand for our high-technology products used by service providers and in data centers worldwide.\nLooking ahead to the second quarter, we expect a further mid-single digit increase in sales from these levels as customer demand continues to accelerate.\nWe remain very encouraged by the company's outstanding technology position in the global IT datacom market.\nOur customers worldwide are undoubtedly continuing to push their equipment to higher performance levels to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processing power.\nIn response, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this ongoing revolution in IT datacom with our unique high-speed, power, and other interconnect products.\nThe broadband market accounted for 4% of our quarterly sales, with a robust 16% growth year-over-year as broadband spending levels remained elevated.\nSales grew slightly from the fourth quarter on a sequential basis.\nWe anticipate a high-teens sequential sales increase in the second quarter as customers continue to upgrade their network capacity to support the significant increase in bandwidth demand and as we benefit from recent acquisitions, including Cabelcon.\nThe addition of Cabelcon expands our offering for broadband customers in the European market, allowing us to provide a more diverse range of products for their next-generation networks and related upgrades.\nWe look forward to continuing to offer this expanded product range to broadband service operators worldwide, all of whom are working to increase bandwidth to support the expansion of high-speed data applications for homes and businesses.\nRegarding our outlook, considering the current dynamic market environment and assuming no new material disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and constant exchange rates, we expect second-quarter sales in the range of $2.415 billion to $2.475 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.53 to $0.55.\nThis would represent strong sales growth of 22% to 25% and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 33% to 38% compared to the second quarter of last year.\nIt's worth noting that the second quarter of last year was already a strong recovery quarter for the company following the first quarter.\nI remain confident in our outstanding management team's ability to adapt to ongoing market challenges and capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability.\nThe entire Amphenol organization remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees worldwide.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I am joined today by Todd Bluedorn, the Chairman and CEO, along with Joe Reitmeier, our CFO.\nTodd will highlight key aspects of the quarter, and Joe will present the company's financial results and projections for 2021.\nTo ensure everyone has a chance to inquire during the Q&A session, please restrict yourself to a couple of questions or follow-ups and rejoin the queue for any additional inquiries.\nAll comparisons made today are in relation to the same period last year.\nFor details about these risks and uncertainties, please refer to Lennox International's publicly accessible SEC filings.\nDuring the first quarter, we observed continued strong performance in our Residential segment, along with significant improvements in Commercial and Refrigeration, leading to new first quarter records for the company in revenue, profit, and earnings per share.\nThe company's overall revenue increased by 29% to a new first quarter high of $931 million.\nRevenue grew by 28% when adjusted for constant currency.\nGAAP operating income reached a first quarter record of $114 million, increasing by 213%.\nGAAP earnings per share from continuing operations hit a first quarter record of $2.20, growing by 588%.\nThe total segment profit surged by 208% to a first quarter record of $116 million.\nThe total segment margin expanded by 720 basis points to 12.4%, and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 305% to a first quarter record of $2.27.\nExamining our business segments for the first quarter, we achieved double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion across all three divisions.\nIn the Residential segment, we established new first quarter records for both revenue and profit.\nResidential revenue increased by 37%.\nThe segment's profit rose by 197%, and its margin expanded by 850 basis points to 15.9%.\nThe replacement business grew by over 40%, while new construction increased by more than 25%.\nComparing our Lennox and Allied businesses, Lennox revenue grew by about 25%, while Allied revenue increased by approximately 70%.\nAllow me to elaborate on the strong performance we witnessed in the Residential segment this quarter.\nFirstly, our Residential team is effectively leveraging their operational capabilities to meet contractor and distributor demand, resulting in market share gains.\nFollowing the 2018 tornado and the initial impact of the 2020 pandemic, we have resumed our offensive strategy in production, distribution, and market share growth.\nSecondly, the Residential segment benefited from colder winter weather, with heating degree days increasing by 13% compared to the first quarter of last year.\nIt's worth noting that we experienced a weak first quarter in 2020.\nThirdly, I'd like to point out that we had a 6% revenue boost due to additional days in this quarter compared to last year.\nThis adjustment occurs every four years as we realign the calendar.\nConversely, the fourth quarter will face a 6% headwind due to fewer days this year.\nThis applies to all our business segments, including Residential.\nAccounting for the additional days, Residential growth was 31%, with Lennox growing nearly 20% and Allied growing about 65%.\nFurthermore, Allied experienced approximately $25 million in early sales this quarter due to different distributor loading patterns compared to last year.\nAdjusting for both the additional days and this early sales activity, Allied's growth was approximately 35% for the quarter.\nConsidering all these factors, and adjusting for the additional days and early sales in our Allied business, which sells to independent distributors, the overall Residential segment revenue increased by about 25%.\nWe believe this outperforms the industry's mid-teen sell-through, partly driven by the favorable cold weather I mentioned earlier.\nOur performance above the industry average is attributed to market share gains.\nAs previously stated, we have resumed our offensive strategy in production, distribution, and market share growth.\nThe team has demonstrated strong operational execution to drive this outperformance, and we are well-prepared for the upcoming summer season and our most significant quarters.\nIn the Commercial segment, we achieved first quarter records for revenue, segment profit, and margin.\nRevenue increased by 12%.\nWhen adjusted for constant currency, revenue grew by 11%.\nSegment profit rose by 47%, and the segment margin expanded by 330 basis points to 13.8%.\nDuring the first quarter, we observed broad strength in the Commercial segment, with year-over-year growth turning positive across all our businesses.\nAt constant currency, Commercial equipment revenue grew by mid-teens in the quarter.\nWithin this category, replacement revenue increased by mid-teens, with planned replacement up by mid-teens and emergency replacement up by high teens.\nNew construction revenue grew by high single digits.\nAnalyzing revenue from another perspective, regional and local business revenue increased by mid-teens, and national account equipment revenue also grew by mid-teens.\nOur team secured three new national account equipment customers during the quarter.\nThe revenue from National Accounts Services on the service side increased by mid-single digits.\nVRF revenue grew by approximately 35%.\nThere are several noteworthy points to discuss regarding Commercial.\nWe are particularly interested in expanding our presence in the education sector.\nWe have allocated specific sales personnel and product offerings to capitalize on a long-term growth opportunity in this market.\nCurrently, K-12 schools account for slightly less than 10% of equipment revenue in this segment.\nThis sector experienced over 20% growth for us in Q1.\nGiven the recent stimulus package supporting HVAC and indoor air quality improvements in schools, we anticipate K-12 schools will be a growing vertical for us in the future.\nImproving indoor air quality remains a key priority for us through our building better air initiatives.\nThe majority of interest and activity we're observing is in the K-12 school segment, but discussions are occurring with clients across various industries.\nWe've introduced our new Model L Rooftop unit, maintaining our leadership in energy efficiency.\nThe Model L incorporates variable speed technology and a cutting-edge control system.\nWe're experiencing strong customer interest in this industry-leading product for 2021 and beyond.\nOverall, Commercial is entering Q2 with positive momentum, evidenced by double-digit backlog growth and robust order rates.\nRefrigeration revenue increased by 21% in Q1.\nAt constant currency, revenue grew by 17%.\nNorth American revenue rose by over 25%.\nEuropean Refrigeration revenue increased by low single digits at constant currency, while European HVAC revenue grew by mid-single digits at constant currency.\nRefrigeration segment margin improved by 560 basis points to 6.3%.\nSegment profit increased to $8 million from $1 million in the same quarter last year.\nSimilar to Commercial, Refrigeration is entering Q2 with strong momentum, as evidenced by double-digit backlog growth and robust order flow, particularly in North America.\nDue to the company's strong Q1 performance and positive outlook for Q2 and the full year, we are revising our 2021 guidance upward.\nWe now anticipate 7% to 11% revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $11.40 to $12.\nWe are also increasing our free cash flow guidance to $375 million for the full year.\nWe now expect about 55% of earnings to occur in the first half of the year, compared to our previous guidance of about 50%.\nThis adjustment reflects the strong Q1 performance and Q2 outlook.\nWe repurchased $200 million of stock in Q1 and plan to repurchase another $200 million, totaling $400 million in our guidance for the year.\nI will provide additional comments and financial details on the business segments for the quarter, beginning with Residential Heating & Cooling.\nResidential Heating & Cooling revenue reached a Q1 record of $606 million, up 37%.\nVolume increased by 32%.\nPrice rose by 1% and mix improved by 4%.\nForeign exchange had no impact on revenue.\nResidential profit hit a Q1 record of $96 million, up 197%.\nSegment margin expanded by 850 basis points to 15.9%.\nSegment profit was primarily influenced by higher volume, favorable price and mix, increased factory productivity, sourcing and engineering-led cost reductions, distribution and freight savings, and favorable foreign exchange.\nThese were partially offset by higher commodity, warranty and other product costs, as well as increased SG&A.\nMoving on to our Commercial Heating & Cooling business.\nCommercial revenue reached a Q1 record of $199 million, up 12%.\nVolume increased by 15%.\nPrice remained flat and mix decreased by 4%.\nForeign exchange contributed a positive 1% to revenue growth.\nCommercial segment profit achieved a Q1 record of $27 million, up 47%.\nSegment margin was a Q1 record 13.8%, an increase of 330 basis points.\nSegment profit was primarily influenced by higher volume, lower material costs, and reduced SG&A.\nThese were partially offset by unfavorable mix.\nRefrigeration revenue reached $125 million, showing a 21% increase.\nThe volume increased by 15%.\nThere was a 1% rise in both price and product mix.\nCurrency exchange contributed positively to revenue growth by 4%.\nThe Refrigeration segment's profit in Q1 was $8 million, compared to $1 million in the same period last year.\nThe segment's margin improved by 560 basis points, reaching 6.3%.\nThe segment's profit was mainly influenced by increased volume, better pricing and mix, reduced material costs, and improved factory efficiency.\nIncreased SG&A expenses partially offset these gains.\nThe company reported net after-tax charges of $2.7 million in Q1, including a $2 million net charge for tax-related items, a $1.9 million net charge for various other items, and a $1.2 million benefit from excess tax advantages related to share-based compensation.\nCorporate expenses in Q1 were $16 million, up from $14 million in the same quarter last year.\nSG&A expenses totaled $145 million, an increase from $131 million in the previous year's quarter.\nSG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 15.6% from 18.1% in the prior quarter.\nThe company used $18 million in cash from operations in Q1, an improvement from the $99 million used in the same period last year.\nCapital expenditures remained steady at approximately $24 million in both Q1 of this year and last year.\nFree cash flow was negative $42 million in Q1, better than the negative $123 million in the previous quarter.\nThe company distributed about $30 million in dividends and bought back $200 million worth of stock during the quarter.\nAt the end of Q1, total debt stood at $1.17 billion, with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.8.\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $40 million at the quarter's end.\nThe company now anticipates high single-digit growth in shipments for Residential, Commercial Unitary, and Refrigeration markets for the full year, up from the previous expectation of mid-single-digit growth.\nThe company has increased its 2021 revenue growth guidance from a 4-8% range to a new range of 7-11%, with foreign exchange still expected to have a neutral impact on revenue for the year.\nThe company has raised its 2021 GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations guidance from $10.55-$11.15 to $11.33-$11.93, and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations from $10.55-$11.15 to $11.40-$12.\nLet's review the key changes and consistencies in our guidance assumptions for 2021.\nWe've announced a second round of price increases and now expect a $90 million benefit from pricing, up from the previous $50 million estimate.\nOur residential mix projection has improved to a $10 million benefit, up from our earlier neutral mix forecast.\nWe anticipate a $15 million benefit from sourcing and engineering-led cost reduction initiatives, down from the previous $25 million estimate due to supplier-driven inflationary pressures.\nWe now project a $55 million headwind from commodities, an increase from the earlier $30 million estimate.\nCorporate expenses are expected to reach approximately $95 million, up from the previous $90 million forecast, mainly due to higher incentive compensation.\nWe maintain our expectation of a $20 million benefit from factory productivity.\nWith 30 new Lennox Stores planned this year, our distribution investments will return to a more typical level compared to last year.\nWe still anticipate a $5 million headwind each from freight and tariffs.\nWe plan for a 7% increase in SG&A, representing a headwind of about $45 million.\nWithin SG&A, we're investing in R&D and IT to maintain our leadership in products, controls, eCommerce, and factory automation and productivity.\nWe continue to expect neutral foreign exchange impact.\nInterest and pension expenses are still projected to be around $35 million.\nWe maintain our expectation of an approximately 21% effective tax rate on an adjusted basis for the full year.\nCapital expenditures are still planned at about $135 million this year, with $30 million allocated for the third plant at our Mexico campus.\nWe expect to complete construction by the end of 2021 and have the plant fully operational by mid-2022, anticipating nearly $10 million in annual savings from this expansion.\nWe've increased our free cash flow target to approximately $375 million for the full year, up from the previous $325 million, based on strong Q1 earnings and our current outlook.\nWe maintain our expectation of a weighted average diluted share count between 37 million to 38 million for the full year, incorporating our plan to repurchase $400 million of stock this year.\nLet's proceed to the Q&A session.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Dan Amos, the Chairman and CEO of Aflac Incorporated, will commence by providing an overview of the company's operations in Japan and the United States\nFred Crawford, Aflac Incorporated's President and COO, will then briefly discuss the quarterly conditions and key initiatives, including the company's approach to managing the pandemic\nThe Q&A portion of the call will include several members of Aflac's US executive management team, as well as executives from Aflac Life Insurance Japan\nSome statements in this teleconference are forward-looking as defined by federal securities laws, but their accuracy cannot be guaranteed due to their prospective nature\nActual outcomes may differ significantly from today's discussion, and we encourage reviewing our Annual Report on Form 10-K for various risk factors that could materially impact our results\nOur website, aflac.com, provides reconciliations of certain non-US GAAP measures\nDan will now take over the call\nDuring our first quarter conference call a year ago, we were in the early stages of the pandemic, and I shared the actions we took to protect our employees, distribution partners, policyholders, and communities\nOur response to these challenging times and our ability to handle them make me proud\nOur \"People First\" philosophy embodies our corporate culture, which we call the Aflac Way\nWe are encouraged by the production and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, but we recognize that vaccination efforts are still in early stages globally\nOur thoughts are with those affected, and we remain cautiously optimistic while staying vigilant\nI consistently emphasize to our management team the importance of controlling what we can and continuously monitoring what we can't control to be ready to adapt\nThis approach allows us to respond most effectively\nIn the first quarter, adjusted earnings per diluted share rose by 26.4%, largely due to low benefit ratios associated with pandemic conditions\nPandemic conditions in the first quarter continued to affect our sales results, earned premiums, and revenues in both the United States and Japan\nWe anticipate these conditions to persist through the first half of 2021, with improvement expected in the second half as communities and businesses open up more, allowing increased face-to-face interactions\nDespite suppressed sales due to limited face-to-face opportunities, we continued to progress in integrating our accelerated investment in our platform while maintaining strong earnings performance\nAflac Japan generated solid financial results in the first quarter, with a profit margin of 23.1%, exceeding the outlook range provided at the Financial Analyst briefing\nAflac Japan also reported strong premium persistency of 95%\nFirst quarter sales in Japan were essentially flat, following the January launch of our new medical product, despite ongoing pandemic conditions\nWe are encouraged by the reception of the new medical product by both consumers and the sales force\nJapan Post Group's announcement to resume proactive sales in April paves the way for gradual improvement in Aflac Cancer Insurance sales in the second half of the year\nWe are actively preparing the platform with Japan Post, recognizing that returning to full strength will take time\nWe continue to navigate evolving pandemic conditions in Japan, including the recent reinstatement of a state of emergency in Tokyo, Osaka, and two other prefectures from April 25th to May 11th\nRestrictions will be tightened to limit people's movement and group activities during the major holiday known as Golden Week\nIn the US, we saw a strong profit margin of 27.3%, and Aflac US reported very strong premium persistency of 80%\nCurrent pandemic conditions continue to significantly impact our sales results, primarily due to reduced face-to-face activity\nAs expected, we observed modest sequential sales improvement in the quarter, with an overall decrease of 22.1%\nSmall businesses in the US are still in recovery mode, which we expect to continue for most of 2021\nLarger businesses remain focused on returning employees to the workplace rather than modifying employee benefits\nWe aim to be where people want to purchase insurance in both Japan and the United States\nTraditionally, this meant face-to-face meetings to understand individual situations, propose solutions, and close sales\nWhile face-to-face sales remain the most effective way to convey the financial protection Aflac products provide, the pandemic has clearly demonstrated the need for virtual, non-face-to-face sales methods\nWe had been working on building our virtual capacities even before the pandemic, and we have since accelerated investments to enhance tools available to our distribution in both countries\nWe continue to integrate these investments into our operations\nWe are also expanding the US product portfolio with previously acquired businesses that serve as a foundation for Aflac network dental and vision, as well as group absence management and disability\nAlthough these acquisitions have a modest near-term impact on the top line, they better position Aflac for future long-term success in the United States\nOur core earnings drivers, including persistency, underwriting profits, investment income, and expense ratios, continue to drive strong pre-tax margins in both the United States and Japan\nBoth Japan and the US experienced sequential sales growth in January, February, and March\nAssuming no setbacks in pandemic conditions, we forecast a sequential increase in absolute sales for the second quarter compared to the first quarter in both the US and Japan\nWe prioritize maintaining strong capital ratios in the US and Japan for the benefit of our policyholders and shareholders\nWe remain committed to prudent liquidity and capital management\nIn March, we issued our first sustainability bond, aiming to allocate proceeds to reinforce our commitment to social and environmental initiatives while balancing purpose and profit\nWe value our 38-year track record of dividend growth and are committed to extending it, supported by our strong capital and cash flows\nWe will continue to tactically repurchase shares and focus on integrating the growth investments we've made in our platform\nBy doing so, we aim to emerge from this period in a continued position of strength and leadership\nI've always believed that true strength is demonstrated by how one handles adversity\nThe events of the past year have reinforced my belief in Aflac's strength, flexibility, and resilience.\nWe aim to sustain long-term growth while fulfilling our commitments to policyholders.\nOur goal is to emerge from this period maintaining our strong position and industry leadership.\nI believe our success is linked to our focus on doing right by our policyholders, shareholders, employees, sales teams, business partners, and communities.\nIn my view, success and ethical conduct are inseparable.\nI take pride in our ability to balance purpose with financial performance.\nThis approach has ultimately resulted in robust, long-term value for shareholders.\nI'll now hand over to Fred.\nI'll briefly discuss the current pandemic situation in Japan and the US, then focus on our efforts to rebuild our production platform in 2021.\nSince the start of the pandemic, Japan has recorded about 575,000 COVID cases and 10,000 confirmed fatalities.\nFrom the beginning of the outbreak through Q1 2021, Aflac Japan has handled roughly 10,500 COVID-related claims, totaling JPY1.9 billion in incurred claims.\nWe're still seeing fewer claims for non-COVID medical conditions, as people avoid routine hospital visits.\nOur strategy to return to pre-pandemic production levels in Japan focuses on three main areas.\nWe're updating our traditional products, boosting online sales productivity during the pandemic, and actively working with Japan Post to revive cancer insurance sales.\nAs Dan mentioned, our revised medical product has been well-received.\nThis product was designed to be more competitive in the independent agent channel, where we had been losing market share before 2020.\nMedical insurance sales have increased by 34% compared to Q1 2020 and by 8% compared to Q1 2019.\nOur new product, EVER Prime, offers enhanced benefits that typically result in 5% to 10% higher premiums per policy compared to our previous medical product.\nThe product also includes a low-claims bonus feature that has attracted younger customers.\nWe've implemented technology allowing agents to switch from face-to-face to virtual sales, providing a fully digital customer experience.\nThe agent remains involved in the process.\nAgents can complete the entire sales process online, from initial contact to policy issuance, without face-to-face interaction.\nWe introduced this capability in October 2020, and in November, we processed 1,600 applications using this digital platform.\nBy March, this number had doubled to about 3,200 applications.\nAs expected, younger demographics are adopting this technology more quickly.\nOn March 26, we launched a national ad campaign promoting this capability and anticipate increased usage.\nWe expect this feature to boost productivity even after the pandemic subsides.\nRegarding Japan Post, as Dan noted, we expect sales volume to gradually recover in the second half of 2021.\nAflac Japan is actively supporting the revival of cancer insurance sales, independently of Japan Post's efforts.\nThis includes reinforcing communication about Japan Post's sales policy at the postal branch level, providing training on our latest cancer products, developing sales proposal strategies, and identifying existing cancer policyholders in the Japan Post system to explain their current benefits and potentially offer upgrades.\nIt's crucial to remember that the Japan Post sales force has been inactive for 18 months.\nTherefore, product training and sales coaching will be critical in the coming months.\nIn the US, the CDC reports approximately 32 million COVID-19 cases and 575,000 deaths.\nAs of Q1 end, we've had about 38,000 COVID-related claimants since the start of the pandemic, with incurred claims totaling $130 million.\nWhile infection rates have decreased from 2020 peak levels, our data indicates lower hospitalization rates and shorter hospital stays.\nHowever, infection hotspots persist in some areas of the US.\nAs in Japan, there are concerns about a potential fourth wave of infections.\nExecutive orders mandating premium grace periods remain in effect in nine states, with six states having open-ended expiration dates. Persistency has improved.\nHowever, this improvement is largely due to a combination of state orders and lower overall sales, as we typically see higher lapse rates in the first year after a sale.\nRegarding recovery efforts, our agent channel and small business benefit franchise have been impacted by the pandemic.\nIt's worth noting that about 390,000 of our 420,000 US business clients have fewer than 100 employees. Key investment areas include recruiting, training, technology advancement, and product development. Important recovery indicators include agent and broker recruiting, average weekly producer numbers, and the success of our dental and vision product rollout.\nIn Q1, we're operating at about 70% of the average weekly producer level compared to the same pre-pandemic period in 2019.\nTrends are positive, and we expect to narrow this gap throughout the year, assuming pandemic conditions improve.\nWe're seeing favorable recruiting numbers, have reopened training centers that were closed during the pandemic, and veteran agents are re-engaging after a challenging year.\nWe're in the early stages of our national rollout of Aflac network dental and vision.\nOur dental product is approved in 43 states, and vision in 41 states, with more states coming online throughout the year.\nNetwork dental and vision are crucial in the small business market and key to agent productivity, along with new account growth, retention, and increased employee coverage at existing employers.\nThis month, we're completing national training programs, making select product refinements, and reinforcing incentives to drive new dental accounts.\nWe're also upgrading our administrative platforms to prepare for increased volumes.\n2021 is a year for launching, learning, and adjusting, and we expect to see our pipeline, close rate, and new accounts gradually increase throughout the year.\nOur premier life and disability platform, acquired from Zurich, is now operating under the Aflac brand.\nWe've started to see our quoted pipeline grow in the last 45 days.\nHowever, many employers are hesitant to change critical benefit plans while figuring out return-to-work strategies and adapting to changing workforce dynamics.\nAdditionally, benefit consultants often proceed cautiously in the year or so following an acquisition.\nWe need to remain patient over the next few years as we establish ourselves in this new line of business.\nOur competitive advantage lies in the proven premier service and technology capabilities of the acquired platform, combined with Aflac Group's leadership in supplemental workplace benefits.\nWe won't resort to relaxed underwriting or pricing standards to win business in this highly competitive market.\nLastly, we recently launched our new e-commerce direct-to-consumer platform, Aflac Direct.\nWe offer critical illness, accident, and cancer coverage, approved in about 30 states, with more states and products coming online throughout the year.\nThis platform targets individuals, self-employed workers, gig workers, and part-time employees who typically don't have access to traditional workplace benefit packages.\nWe're actively developing a licensed agent call center to improve conversion rates and control overall costs.\nWith a modest marketing budget, we're attracting about 500,000 monthly visitors to aflac.com, resulting in 120,000 leads for call center conversion this year.\nWe're currently achieving a 15% conversion rate in the call center.\nThis is a data-driven business, and core metrics will improve as the model matures.\nRegarding the contribution of these businesses to overall sales in 2021, we expect these three growth initiatives to account for roughly 10% of sales, up from less than 5% in 2020.\nWe maintain our commitment to the revenue growth goals outlined at our November investor meeting.\nThese initiatives are anticipated to generate additional revenue exceeding $1 billion in the coming five to seven years.\nAs these individual initiatives progress, they build upon and enhance each other.\nOur network dental and vision offerings boost agent recruitment and productivity, employer-sponsored benefits increase supplemental workplace sales, and our direct-to-consumer approach expands our market reach while also providing workplace leads to our field agents.\nIn the long term, as employees leave their workplaces, maintaining a digital relationship with Aflac directly aids in customer retention and satisfaction.\nAs mentioned by Dan, we launched our first sustainability bond, raising $400 million to support our goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and to fund initiatives promoting climate action, diversity, and inclusion.\nThe bond issuance itself is a significant step, as it necessitates formal procedures for reporting, monitoring, and auditing qualified sustainable investments.\nThis rigorous approach benefits the control environment surrounding our company-wide ESG reporting and accountability.\nFurthermore, Aflac Global Investments recently announced a partnership with Sound Point Capital Management to establish a new asset management business focused on the transitional real estate loan market.\nAs part of this collaboration, we have made an initial $1.5 billion general account allocation to the newly formed Sound Point Commercial Real Estate Finance, LLC, with $500 million dedicated to providing transitional and other debt financing to support economically disadvantaged communities designated as qualified opportunity zones.\nAflac will hold a 9.9% minority stake in this new investment LLC, with the option to increase our ownership over time as the venture grows.\nI will now hand over to Max to provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance.\nAllow me to follow up with an overview of our Q1 performance, focusing on the development of our core capital and earnings drivers.\nIn the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share rose by 26.4% to $1.53, including a positive $0.02 impact from foreign exchange.\nThis quarter's strong performance was primarily driven by reduced utilization during the pandemic, particularly in the U.S., and a lower tax rate compared to the previous year.\nVariable investment income exceeded our long-term return expectations by $24.5 million.\nAdjusted book value per share, including foreign currency translation gains and losses, increased by 20.6%, and the adjusted ROE, excluding the foreign currency impact, was a robust 16.7%, significantly higher than our cost of capital.\nBeginning with our Japan segment.\nTotal earned premium for the quarter decreased by 3.6%, reflecting the impact of paid-up first sector policies, while earned premium for our third sector products declined by 2.2% due to sales pressure in 2020.\nJapan's total benefit ratio was 68.4% for the quarter, down 100 basis points year-over-year, and the third sector benefit ratio was 58%, also down 100 basis points year-over-year.\nWe experienced a slightly higher than normal IBNR release in our third sector block as actual results continue to be favorable compared to initial expectations.\nThis quarter, it was primarily due to pandemic conditions limiting utilization.\nPersistency remains strong at 95%, up 50 basis points year-over-year.\nOur expense ratio in Japan was 21.3%, up 130 basis points year-over-year.\nWith increased sales activity, expenses naturally rise, and our technology-related investments in converting Aflac Japan to a paperless company continue, which also includes higher system maintenance costs.\nAdjusted net investment income increased by 6.9% in yen terms, mainly due to favorable returns on our growing private equity portfolio and lower hedge costs, partially offset by lower reinvestment yields on our fixed and floating rate portfolio.\nThe pre-tax margin for Japan in the quarter was 23.1%, up 60 basis points year-over-year, marking a very good start to the year.\nMoving to the US, net earned premium decreased by 4.1% due to weaker sales results.\nPersistency improved by 240 basis points to 80%, as our efforts to retain accounts and reduce policy lapses show early positive results.\nAs Fred mentioned, nine states still have premium grace periods in place, so we are closely monitoring these developments.\nBreaking down the 240 basis point persistency rate improvement further, 70 basis points can be attributed to the emergency orders in place, 90 basis points to lower sales as first-year lapse rates are roughly twice the total in-force lapse rates, and the remaining 80 basis points include conservation efforts implemented last year.\nOur total benefit ratio was significantly lower than expected at 39.1%, a full 900 basis points lower than Q1 2020.\nIn the quarter, we experienced lower paid claims, especially in January, as pandemic conditions influenced our policyholders' behavior.\nThis aligns with 2020 disclosures indicating a negative correlation between infection levels and claims-generating activities like accidents, elective surgeries, and physical exams.\nThis low activity level for non-COVID claims accounted for most of the year-over-year decrease in the benefit ratio.\nOur total incurred COVID-related claims were also lower than expected due to an IBNR release.\nWe estimated new COVID claims at approximately $42 million, which was offset by an IBNR release of $41 million.\nAs we accumulate more experience, we have refined our assumptions, leading to this IBNR reserve release.\nWe anticipate the benefit ratio to gradually increase throughout the remainder of the year as normal activity resumes in our communities and among our policyholders.\nFor the full year, we now expect our benefit ratio to be toward the lower end or slightly below our guided range of 48% to 51%.\nOur expense ratio in the US was 38.5%, up 10 basis points year-over-year, but with numerous contributing factors.\nWeaker sales performance negatively impacts revenue.\nHowever, the effect on our expense ratio is largely offset by lower DAC expenses.\nHigher advertising spending increased the expense ratio by 70 basis points, along with our continued development of growth initiatives in group life and disability, network and innovation, and direct-to-consumer.\nThese contributed to a 110 basis point increase in the ratio.\nThe strategic growth initiative investments are largely counterbalanced by our efforts to reduce core operating expenses as we strive to be the low-cost producer in the voluntary benefit space.\nOverall, despite many moving parts, Q1 expenses are tracking according to plan.\nIn the quarter, we also incurred $6 million in integration expenses not included in adjusted earnings associated with recent acquisitions.\nAdjusted net investment income in the US decreased by 0.6% due to a 22 basis point contraction in the portfolio yield year-over-year, partially offset by favorable variable investment income.\nProfitability in the US segment was very strong, with a pre-tax margin of 27.3%, primarily driven by the low benefit ratio.\nWith Q1 now complete, we are raising our pre-tax margin expectations for the full year.\nInitial expectations were for us to be toward the low end of 16% to 19%.\nWe now anticipate ending the full year toward the high end of this range.\nIn our Corporate segment, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $26 million as adjusted net investment income was $20 million lower than last year due to lower interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.\nOther adjusted expenses were $7 million lower as our cost reduction activities are showing results.\nOur capital position remains robust, with an SMR above 900% in Japan and an RBC of approximately 563% in Aflac Columbus at the end of the quarter.\nUnencumbered holding company liquidity stood at $3.9 billion, $1.5 billion above our minimum balance, excluding the $400 million proceeds from the sustainability bond issued in March, which reinforced our ESG initiatives and our belief that sustainable investments are also sound long-term investments.\nLeverage, including the sustainability bond, increased but remains at a comfortable 23%, in the middle of our leverage corridor of 20% to 25%.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased $650 million of our own stock and paid dividends of $227 million, offering attractive relative IRR on these capital deployments.\nWe will continue to be flexible and tactical in managing our balance sheet and deploying capital to drive strong risk-adjusted ROE with a significant spread to our cost of capital.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to David to begin the Q&A session.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These declarations and materials rely on numerous assumptions and factors subject to risks and uncertainties.\nOur CFO, Ray Young, will present financial highlights, company results, performance drivers, and our outlook.\nVince Macciocchi, SVP and President of Nutrition, will provide an update on our Nutrition division and its growth prospects.\nWe announced third quarter adjusted earnings of $0.89 per share yesterday, an increase from $0.77 in the same period last year.\nAdjusted segment operating profit reached $849 million, an 11% year-over-year increase, and our trailing four-quarter adjusted ROIC was 8.3%.\nOur strategic initiatives have enabled our global teams to continue demonstrating their expertise and capabilities.\nI'm impressed by how our employees are supporting customers and achieving strong results.\nThe team has excellently managed the daily and sometimes hourly challenges we've faced in 2020.\nThis resilience allows us to deliver exceptional results today while simultaneously pursuing strategic improvements to enhance our company and advance our growth and transformation.\nAllow me to highlight some of our achievements.\nIn our optimized pillar, the Ag Services & Oilseeds team continued to enhance returns, reducing invested capital by another $100 million in the third quarter.\nSince 2017, Ag Services & Oilseeds has improved its capital position by divesting non-strategic assets, including 71 grain origination sites, six oilseed facilities, 14 Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts locations, and seven oceangoing vessels.\nWe've also witnessed firsthand how improvement initiatives have supported business continuity.\nBesides the pandemic, we've recently experienced multiple hurricanes in the US and a derecho storm that affected the Midwest.\nIn our drive pillar, we're accelerating our 1ADM business transformation by expanding the implementation of procurement, contract labor, and sales and marketing modules, which are driving efficiencies and growth while providing valuable data for enhanced analytics and decision-making.\nOur Decatur corn complex's ongoing strong performance from grind to gluten to workplace safety continues to showcase the benefits of our centralized operations organization.\nOur Supply Chain Center of Excellence is also delivering results; using enhanced processes, tools, and integrated planning between commercial, supply chain, and operations, we recently tested changes at a nutrition facility that are expected to increase production capacity by over 20% at that site.\nThese improvements have already led to better customer service without additional capital expenditure.\nWe plan to implement similar improvements at other locations.\nIn our expand pillar, we continue to reap the benefits of our investments.\nFor instance, our Algar Agro acquisition has tripled its year-over-year operating profit year-to-date.\nAlgar has quickly become a crucial part of our South American operations.\nWe've successfully expanded production of high-quality USP grade alcohol in Peoria and Clinton to meet increased demand for hand sanitizer.\nWe announced plans to build a cutting-edge production facility in Spain that will significantly increase our capacity to meet growing demand for probiotics and other health and wellness consumer products.\nWe also entered into a long-term agreement with Japanese startup Spiber Inc.\nThis project leverages our innovative spirit and capabilities, creating value across our supply chain from corn procurement to dextrose production to our investments in science and manufacturing technology.\nIt addresses a critical market need for sustainable consumer and industrial products.\nOur transformation, growth, and confidence in the future wouldn't be possible without readiness.\nBy the end of the third quarter, our team identified and implemented readiness initiatives that unlocked nearly $1.2 billion in run rate benefits.\nI'm pleased to announce that we're on track to achieve $1.3 billion by year-end.\nReadiness encompasses and supports our entire company.\nIt drives the strategic imperatives that help us fulfill our purpose, such as sustainability.\nWe're advancing our sustainability efforts on multiple fronts.\nThese include our Strive 35 goals to improve our performance on greenhouse gases, energy, water, and waste.\nReadiness creates growth enablers.\nFor example, we're continuing to enhance our commercial excellence with innovative tools like consumer insight programs and virtual customer technologies.\nReadiness is also a key element powering the growth algorithm we outlined at the beginning of the year. Due to its success, along with significant progress in our harvest and improve initiatives, we now expect to meet or exceed the high end of our $500 million to $600 million target for improvements in 2020.\nIn 2014, we embarked on a new journey with the acquisition of WILD Flavors and the launch of a comprehensive nutrition business offering customers a wide range of products and services.\nI'm extremely proud of the growth we've achieved since then.\nNutrition has delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of over 20% year-over-year operating profit growth.\nRevenue has increased by 5.7% on a currency-adjusted basis for the first nine months of the year.\nSince acquiring WILD, we've nearly tripled operating profit in the flavors business.\nAs we've been receiving more inquiries about that business and its growth potential, we decided it was an opportune time to provide an update and further explain the business.\nAs Juan mentioned, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.89, up from $0.77 in the same quarter last year.\nExcluding specific items, adjusted segment operating profit was $849 million, an 11% increase.\nOur trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 8.3%, 255 basis points higher than our 2020 annual WACC.\nOur trailing four-quarter adjusted EBITDA was approximately $3.7 billion.\nOur cash flows are robust, generating about $2.3 billion from operations before working capital in the first nine months of the year.\nThe third quarter's effective tax rate was a benefit of roughly 13%, contrasting with a 19% expense in the previous year.\nOur third quarter tax rate was influenced by our debt retirement activities, the sale of our Walmart shares, and increased Walmart earnings and U.S. tax credits compared to the previous year.\nExcluding the impact of earnings per share adjusting items, our effective tax rate was approximately 11%.\nWe anticipate our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter to be comparable to this adjusted third quarter effective tax rate.\nAs we disclosed at various times during the third quarter, we've implemented several measures over the past few months to both utilize and improve our robust balance sheet.\nThese actions weren't related to cash flow or liquidity concerns, as we had nearly $10 billion in cash and available credit at the quarter's end.\nThe measures were aimed at creating balance sheet flexibility for future transactions while maintaining a strong credit rating profile.\nWe converted part of our Walmart investment into cash through a block sale of Walmart stock and issued bonds that can be exchanged for Walmart shares at a later date.\nAs we've stated, we consider our substantial remaining Walmart stake to be strategic and have no plans to sell additional shares.\nTaking advantage of our strong cash position, we also adjusted our balance between long-term and short-term debt, economically retiring higher-interest debt through positive net present value transactions and reducing future interest payments.\nThese combined actions provide us with the flexibility to make strategic investments, pursue additional acquisitions, or repurchase shares when appropriate, all while continuing to reduce our balance sheet leverage and maintain our single A credit ratings.\nThese actions were also a major factor in determining our tax rate.\nCapital return for the first nine months totaled $724 million, including approximately $115 million in opportunistic share repurchases, mostly executed earlier this year.\nWe ended the quarter with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 27%, down from 30% a year ago.\nCapital expenditure for the first nine months was approximately $560 million.\nWe expect capital spending for the year to be around the previously indicated $800 million, which is significantly below our depreciation and amortization rate of about $1 billion.\nOther business results were lower than the same quarter last year, due to reduced ADM investor services earnings and captive insurance underwriting losses, including a $17 million settlement impact for the high water claim with Ag Services and Oilseeds.\nIn the corporate category, unallocated corporate costs of $196 million were higher year-over-year, primarily due to variable performance-related incentive compensation accruals, which were low in the previous year.\nThis quarter's corporate results also included $396 million related to the early debt retirement charges mentioned earlier, which is an earnings per share adjustment item.\nNet interest expense for the quarter was comparable to the same period last year.\nLooking ahead, we expect unallocated corporate expenses to align with our initial $800 million guidance for the calendar year and fourth quarter net interest expense to be slightly lower than the third quarter.\nWe also anticipate a loss of about $50 million in other business in the fourth quarter due to expected intercompany insurance claim settlements.\nAg Services and Oilseeds results surpassed those of the third quarter of 2019.\nIn Ag Services, we observed excellent execution globally.\nThe North American team effectively capitalized on strong industry export margins and volumes, while the global trade team had another strong quarter, maintaining their focus on customer service.\nAg Services also benefited from a $54 million settlement related to the 2019 US high water insurance claims, partially offset by an expense in captive insurance.\nThe crushing team also performed exceptionally well in a robust demand environment.\nBoth Ag Services and Crushing experienced expanding margins during the quarter, resulting in approximately $155 million in total negative timing effects, leading to lower results.\nThese timing impacts are expected to reverse in upcoming quarters.\nRefined Products and Other performed significantly better year-over-year, driven by improved biodiesel margins globally.\nEquity earnings from Wilmar were substantially higher compared to the same period last year.\nLooking forward, we expect strong North American exports and global crush margins in the fourth quarter to contribute to a very strong Ag Services and Oilseeds performance.\nResults are projected to be significantly higher than the third quarter of this year, though lower than the fourth quarter of 2019, which included a $270 million benefit from two years of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit.\nCarbohydrate Solutions results were significantly higher compared to the previous year.\nThe Starches and Sweeteners sub-segment performed substantially better, driven by strong risk management and improved net corn costs, as well as a balanced ethanol industry supply and demand environment.\nReduced foodservice demand affected sweetener and flour volumes, but we're observing good demand recovery for starches in North America.\nThe Vantage Corn Processors team effectively executed on wet mill fuel ethanol distribution and capitalized on higher year-over-year industry margins, while managing the fixed costs from two temporarily idled dry mills.\nIncreased volumes and margins on USP grade industrial alcohol to support the hand sanitizer market also contributed to higher year-over-year profits.\nLooking ahead, we expect the fourth quarter for Carbohydrate Solutions to be close to the third quarter of this year and substantially higher than the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by improved year-over-year fuel ethanol margins and higher industrial-grade sales.\nWhile Sweetener and Flour volumes will still be impacted by weaker food service demand, we expect the year-over-year percentage decline to be smaller than it was in the third quarter.\nNutrition delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of over 20% year-over-year profit growth.\nHuman Nutrition results were substantially higher compared to the same quarter last year, with strength across the entire pantry, including flavors, plant-based proteins, and probiotics.\nAnimal Nutrition also performed better year-over-year, driven by continued delivery of Neovia synergies, strength in livestock, and year-over-year improvement in amino acids, partially offset by softer aquaculture feed demand and negative foreign currency impacts.\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect Nutrition to deliver another quarter of over 20% year-over-year operating profit growth, with a typically seasonally weaker fourth quarter in human nutrition offset by seasonally stronger animal nutrition.\nI'd now like to hand over to Vince Macciocchi, President of our Nutrition business, for an update and overview of the business.\nVince, congratulations to you and your team for not just a great quarter, but for consistently delivering strong growth.\nI'm proud of the team who have excelled in so many ways.\nWhen I reflect on the progress we've made and the journey we're still on, I keep coming back to our purpose: to unlock the power of nature to enrich the quality of life.\nI find it remarkable how these few words encapsulate not just what we do, but why our work is so crucial.\nWorldwide population is increasing, and consumer habits are evolving in unexpected ways compared to a decade or so ago.\nThe magnitude of this shift and the potential for ADM is immense.\nWorldwide sales of specialized ingredients for human and animal nutrition amount to approximately $85 billion and are expanding at a rate of 5% to 7% annually.\nThese specialized ingredients, comprising the majority of the nutrition portfolio excluding fees, contribute to a wide range of consumer nutrition products for humans and animals, many of which are expected to see significant growth in the coming years.\nThe worldwide market for functional beverages could reach $190 billion by 2024.\nThe global market for dietary supplements might be valued at over $77 billion during the same period.\nWorldwide retail sales of alternative proteins currently constitute a $25 billion market, with an anticipated growth rate of 14% per year.\nGlobal retail sales of pet food are expected to increase by 4% annually, reaching $120 billion by 2024.\nThese figures represent more than just statistics.\nThey indicate significant long-term shifts in people's choices regarding food, beverages, and other products, driven by a global population that values health and sustainability.\nGiven our portfolio, presence, capabilities, and talent, no other company is better positioned than ADM to meet these needs and lead in these industries.\nWe embarked on this journey six years ago.\nDuring this time, we have constructed or expanded over 16 facilities, ranging from our pea protein complex in the US to our network of feed mix plants in China.\nWe have improved our scientific and technological capabilities, invested in market research and consumer insights, and developed new interactive ways to engage with customers.\nThese include our more than 50 global customer innovation centers and daily virtual innovation and tasting sessions.\nWe have made platform acquisitions and added bolt-ons.\nIn total, we have invested just over $6 billion to establish our global leadership position in nutrition.\nThese investments are yielding results.\nSince 2014, we have increased our annual revenue by $3 billion.\nBy the end of this year, we will have grown operating profits by more than $300 million over those six years, more than doubling them.\nOur human nutrition division can provide customers with ingredients, flavor systems, or complete product development solutions, supporting them throughout the process from concept to prototype to market launch in record time.\nIn Animal Nutrition, only 18 months after completing our Neovia acquisition, we can reflect on a successful integration where we surpassed our synergy goals and established a global business offering a comprehensive portfolio of trendy items, from pet treats to enzymes to aquaculture ingredients, meeting evolving customer needs.\nIn our health and wellness division, which is part of our human nutrition subsegment, our scientists are expanding the range of pro, pre, and postbiotics and other functional products to meet growing demand for standalone supplements and ingredients that enhance our array of human and animal solutions.\nCollectively, our extensive portfolio of ingredients and solutions can add value for customers across both human and animal nutrition sectors.\nFor example, taste and color are now as crucial for animal nutrition customers as they are for food and beverage customers.\nFunctional ingredients are important in both Human and Animal Nutrition, and this applies across our entire product range.\nWe then incorporate the rest of ADM's capabilities.\nIn plant-based protein, for instance, we have the unique advantage of ADM's broad and integrated value chain, from sourcing and transporting soybeans and peas to transforming them into high-protein ingredients at our own facilities.\nWe then add colors, flavors, oils, and other key elements to create the perfect taste, appearance, juiciness, and sizzle for delicious finished plant-based products.\nWe are proud of our progress in just six years, but our focus is on the future.\nWe are optimistic about continuing our growth trajectory.\nThis begins with the global category trends I mentioned earlier.\nIt continues with our extensive and ongoing research into consumer behavior and needs.\nEarlier this week, we released our latest analysis of the top consumer trends for 2021, based on research that includes our proprietary Outside Voice consumer insights program.\nOur findings indicate that recent events are accelerating and intensifying fundamental market shifts, including consumers taking a more proactive approach to nourishing body and mind, recognizing the microbiome as a gateway to wellness.\nThere is also continued growing demand for plant-based foods.\nSustainability has become a key factor in purchasing decisions, and transparency is essential for building consumer trust.\nThe final piece of the puzzle is how our team combines everything for our customers, merging unparalleled customer support and service with our extensive value chain to deliver ingredients, systems, and solutions that align perfectly with market trends and needs.\nThese factors contribute to our expectation of continued industry leadership, outpacing the market in operating profit growth, and we remain confident in achieving $1 billion in operating profit in the medium-term future.\nCongratulations to you and the entire ADM team for another exceptional quarter.\nThroughout the company, we continue to advance our efforts to enhance quality of life and meet crucial needs for consumers worldwide.\nIn a time of heightened concern about food security, ADM's robust global value chain is helping ensure that countries and families can continue to access nutritious, delicious foods.\nAs consumers increasingly focus on proactive approaches to health, we are expanding the boundaries of groundbreaking functional ingredients and supplements for people with conditions like migraine and atopic dermatitis.\nWe are also paving the way for a new era of precision nutrition, personalized for each individual.\nAs sustainability becomes a key driver of consumer decisions and business success, we are taking a leading role in transitioning our industry to a low-carbon economy.\nWe are dedicated to our purpose, and our team continues to deliver for our customers, shareholders, and all who depend on us.\nThis is why we are confident in a strong conclusion to 2020 and expect positive momentum to continue through 2021.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We explicitly state that we have no obligation to revise prior statements with new information, unless mandated by law.\nDespite most employees working remotely due to COVID-19, Hilltop achieved an exceptional quarter, with unprecedented mortgage profits compensating for a substantial and prudent reserve increase at the Bank.\nI'd like to begin with Slide 3 and provide an update on our COVID-19 response before discussing the quarterly results.\nOperationally, we've benefited from strengthening Hilltop over the past three years by establishing a robust holding company and integrating the functional departments of our operating entities.\nThis has allowed us to maintain business continuity while prioritizing employee health and safety.\nWe continue to have most of our staff working from home, allowing essential personnel to work safely in our offices.\nWe're monitoring all COVID-19 cases to ensure affected employees quarantine and impacted offices are sanitized for prompt reopening.\nWe're also maintaining frequent, open communication to ensure everyone follows safety protocols and feels connected.\nAlthough employee cases increased last quarter, the overall number remains low and hasn't significantly impacted our operations.\nSince the pandemic began, we've been in constant communication with our clients to continue meeting their needs, particularly providing relief and support where necessary.\nThe Bank has granted deferrals on $1 billion in loans by collaborating with borrowers affected by COVID-19, including $619 million for principal only and $349 million for both principal and interest for the most severely impacted borrowers.\nAs the initial 90-day deferrals expire, the Bank has already received requests for about $120 million in second-round modifications.\nWe'll examine each request individually to ensure they're necessary and assess their viability.\nCertain sectors, such as hospitality and food service, have been more severely affected, so we expect a large portion of those loans to request second deferrals.\nAdditionally, the Bank issued over 2,800 PPP loans totaling $672 million, a significant effort by our bankers to assist many customers in need.\nAs the pandemic continues, we'll keep offering personalized banking assistance, including fee waivers, increased daily spending limits, and suspended residential foreclosure activities.\nTurning to Slide 4.\nIn Q2 2020, Hilltop reported net income of $128.5 million or $1.42 per diluted share, resulting in a 3.3% return on average assets and a 23% return on average equity.\nNet income from continuing operations was $97.7 million.\nThe results for National Lloyds this period and the gain from its sale are included in discontinued operations, as noted at the bottom of the page.\nThis quarter demonstrates the strength of our businesses and the importance of diversification, with the mortgage and broker-dealer segments delivering strong fee income growth that offset the impact of the Bank's provision.\nFavorable market conditions contributed to our results, but I'm most proud of our team for collaborating closely and capitalizing on emerging opportunities.\nThe sale of National Lloyds to Align Financial closed on June 30 for total cash proceeds of $154 million, resulting in a non-taxable net gain of $32 million.\nThis was a positive outcome for both parties.\nHilltop also achieved a significant strategic milestone this quarter with the successful issuance of $200 million in subordinated debt, further strengthening our liquidity and capital to weather the current recession and position ourselves to leverage future opportunities.\nRegarding risk management, net charge-offs for the period were $16.4 million, including $12.5 million from an oil and gas credit reserved for in Q1 2020.\nThe allowance for credit losses increased by $49.6 million this quarter as Hilltop built its loan reserve to reflect the worsened economic outlook from Q1 2020.\nWe also continued to enhance our liquidity position, ending the period with $6.6 billion in cash, securities, and secured borrowing capacity.\nMoving to Slide 5.\nPlainsCapital Bank reported a pre-tax loss of $17.5 million, primarily due to a substantial CECL provision of $66 million, partially offset by stable net interest income and reduced operating expenses.\nThe Bank's pre-provision net revenue grew 5% compared to Q2 2019.\nNotably, Jerry and the Bank team did an excellent job growing PPNR while working tirelessly to process PPP loans and borrower deferral requests.\nPrimeLending had an exceptional quarter, generating pre-tax income of $138 million, a $116.5 million increase from Q2 2019.\nThis was driven by a 54% rise in origination volume and a 35 basis point increase in gain on sale margins.\nSteve Thompson and the entire PrimeLending team worked overtime to handle the overwhelming volumes and capitalized on the industry's oversupply by raising prices and retaining servicing.\nHilltopSecurities increased pre-tax earnings by $6 million to $28 million, driven by profitable growth in the fixed income services and structured finance divisions.\nBrad Winges and the HilltopSecurities team are well underway in elevating the caliber and profile of the firm to become the leading municipal-focused investment bank.\nAdditionally, they completed a major system conversion for HilltopSecurities during the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 6.\nHilltop has developed a synergistic and resilient business model, which we've been working towards throughout our company's history.\nThrough acquisitions, we initially integrated our company for capital and funding purposes.\nOver the past three years, we've largely implemented our platform for growth and efficiency initiatives by integrating shared services departments and executing efficiency projects to build a scalable platform.\nWith the sale of National Lloyds, we've solidified our business model, which is a franchise anchored by PlainsCapital Bank and enhanced by powerful fee income businesses in PrimeLending and HilltopSecurities.\nWe've made significant investments in talented professionals and systems, and believe we're well-positioned to grow these core businesses.\nLet's begin on Page 7.\nAs Jeremy mentioned, for Q2 2020, Hilltop reported consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of $128.5 million, or $1.42 per diluted share.\nIncome from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders was $97.7 million or $1.08 per diluted share.\nHilltop's continuing operations generated $202 million of pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) during Q2, bringing the first half of 2020 total PPNR to $302 million.\nPPNR increased by $125 million or 162% compared to the same period last year.\nGrowth versus the prior year was driven by diversified revenue streams, led by strong mortgage originations.\nIn Q2, revenue related to purchase accounting was $3.3 million and expenses were $1.3 million, resulting in a net purchase accounting pre-tax impact of $1.9 million for the quarter.\nIn the current period, purchase accounting expenses primarily represent amortization of deposit and other intangible assets related to previous acquisitions.\nWe expect revenue from purchased loan accretion to continue declining as the purchase loan portfolio runs off.\nFurthermore, we anticipate revenue from purchased loan accretion will average between $3 million and $5 million per quarter for the remainder of 2020.\nGiven the significant earnings growth, along with the successful sale of National Lloyds and the subordinated debt issuance completed in Q2, Hilltop's capital position has been substantially strengthened as we address the ongoing impacts of the pandemic and position the company to capitalize on future opportunities.\nHilltop's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 18.46% and Tier 1 leverage ratio was 12.6% at the end of the period.\nLet's move on to Page 8.\nNet interest income from continuing operations decreased by $2.7 million to $104.6 million in Q2 compared to the same quarter last year.\nThe reduction in net interest income was caused by a $3.2 million drop in purchase loan accretion, which was partially offset by increased interest income from higher loan held for sale and loans held for investment during the quarter.\nIn the second quarter, Hilltop's consolidated average earning assets grew by $1.9 billion due to significant increases in customer deposits across all product categories.\nThe rise in deposits, along with planned actions including Hilltop's $200 million subordinated debt issuance, a $550 million increase in acquired brokered deposits, and proceeds from selling National Lloyds, contributed to a $1.2 billion increase in cash deposited at the Federal Reserve compared to the previous quarter.\nAdditionally, the Bank issued $672 million in PPP loans, minus approximately $21 million in deferred fees that will be recognized over the loans' lifetimes.\nFinally, the mortgage warehouse lending business grew by about $120 million compared to the previous quarter, as mortgage volumes surged in Q2.\nHilltop's consolidated net interest margin in Q2 was 280 basis points, a 61 basis point decrease from the previous quarter.\nThis decline was attributed to the aforementioned growth in average earning assets, increased liquidity, and lower yields on loans, securities and deposits.\nWe anticipate continued pressure on NIM in Q3, followed by a modest recovery beginning in Q4 and continuing into Q1 2021.\nA key factor in this improvement will be our efforts to reduce our cash and liquidity position to between $5 billion and $6 billion in the second half of the year.\nWe are continuously monitoring capital markets, Hilltop's mortgage volumes, and overall market conditions related to liquidity, and we will continue to balance our excess liquidity against risk over time.\nLet's move to Page 9.\nThe table in the bottom right of Page 9 shows the Bank's liquidity as of June 30.\nThe Bank ended the period with over $6.6 billion in liquidity, including cash, securities, and secured borrowing sources.\nAdditionally, at period end, the parent company held $388 million in cash, which is approximately 4 times annual expenses, dividends, and debt service.\nMoving to Page 10.\nNoninterest income for Q2 was $468 million.\nDuring this period, mortgage applications and locks were very strong, with PrimeLending locking approximately $7.4 billion in new mortgages.\nThis record-breaking quarter for rate locks reflected the impact of lower rates and better-than-expected demand for purchase mortgages across our markets.\nThe combination of strong lock-in origination volume and improving gain on sale spreads led to a $176 million increase in mortgage production and fee income compared to the same period last year.\nIn Q2, gain on sale margins in our mortgage business expanded by 43 basis points compared to Q1 2020.\nWe expect gain on sale margins to increase further in Q3 to between 430 and 450 basis points.\nWe anticipate that spreads will remain higher than historical levels but begin to moderate during Q4 2020.\nIn Q2, the securities business showed solid progress with fixed income capital markets delivering revenue growth of approximately $12 million, while structured finance saw improved market conditions and revenue increased by $6.5 million compared to the previous year.\nAt the end of the period, the mark on the structured finance loan pipeline was $15 million.\nIt's important to note that results from our fixed income and structured finance businesses can be volatile as market rates, spreads, and volumes can change significantly from period to period.\nLet's move to Page 11.\nNoninterest expenses increased by $66 million to $370 million compared to the same period last year.\nThe growth in expenses versus the prior year was primarily due to a $56 million increase in variable compensation at both PrimeLending and HilltopSecurities.\nThis increase in variable compensation was directly linked to strong fee revenue growth in the quarter compared to the same period last year.\nNon-variable personnel expenses rose by $8 million compared to the previous year, driven by increases in overtime hours worked, particularly in our mortgage operations, as well as deferred compensation and project labor spending during the period.\nOver the past nine quarters, we've continued to align our businesses with current market conditions and drive efficiencies across the franchise.\nThrough these efforts, headcount, professional service costs, and marketing and development expenses have continued to decrease as we make progress towards our efficiency objectives.\nIn Q2, Hilltop incurred $3.5 million in costs on $5.6 million of spending related to our ongoing core system improvements.\nDuring Q2, we continued to make progress and are entering the final stages of implementing our three core system installations.\nThe new core loan system has been installed throughout the mortgage business.\nThe securities team completed Phase 1 implementation of the new operating platform at HilltopSecurities.\nWe have now begun the final deployment of the new general ledger and ERP system across Hilltop.\nWe expect that all of these implementations will provide significant value to our franchise and position Hilltop for profitable growth in the future.\nLet's turn to Page 12.\nTotal average held for investment loans grew by 9% compared to Q2 2019.\nGrowth versus the same period in the prior year was driven by $672 million of net PPP loan originations, along with growth in our mortgage warehouse lending business, which experienced an increase of approximately $219 million compared to the previous year.\nOther business loans declined compared to Q1 2020, as customer demand has remained weak.\nLoan yields have decreased over the past four quarters and continued to decline in Q2.\nLower market rates, including prime rate and LIBOR rates, combined with lower purchase loan accretion, have contributed to the yield decline.\nWe expect that loan yields will continue to face pressure in the coming quarters as market rates remain low and we've added $672 million in PPP loans that yield 100 basis points.\nLastly, our loan pipeline remains stable, but many clients are postponing pricing and funding on new loan commitments until they have more clarity on the economic impact of the pandemic.\nMoving to Page 13.\nDuring Q2, Hilltop continued to build excess liquidity to prepare for potential disruptions caused by the pandemic and support increased mortgage origination activity.\nQ2 average total deposits were approximately $11.2 billion, an increase of $2.2 billion or 25% compared to Q1 2020.\nDuring the quarter, the bank transferred approximately $200 million in deposits back to the securities business, as the securities business can achieve a better return on those funds than the bank can earn on excess cash.\nExcluding growth from PPP deposits, the subordinated debt issuance, and the proceeds from National Lloyds, customer deposits have continued to grow as customers retain cash until there is more clarity regarding economic activity.\nAs shown in the graph, the bank has been able to increase noninterest bearing deposits, which grew by approximately $600 million or 21% compared to Q1 2020 on an ending balance basis.\nLet's turn to Page 14.\nIn Q2, net charge-offs totaled $16.4 million, or 92 basis points of total bank held for investment loans on an annualized basis.\nCharge-offs during the quarter largely represent the final disposition of a single energy credit and the writedown of assets related to real estate properties that were all reserved for during Q1.\nWhile non-performing assets improved as a percentage of criticized loans in Q2, it's important to note that the Bank approved $968 million in COVID-19-related loan modifications during Q2, and these deferrals are not reflected in the graph on this page.\nFurthermore, in the graph on the bottom right, Hilltop's allowance for credit losses for the Bank's loans held for investment increased to 2.1% during the quarter.\nExcluding PPP balances and collateral maintenance loans, the allowance to credit loss to bank loans ratio coverage equates to 2.6% at the end of the period.\nI'm reviewing Page 15.\nThe economic outlook worsened considerably in Q2 compared to Q1, impacting the evaluation of allowance for credit losses.\nA table at the bottom of the page presents key comparative metrics.\nOur base case for CECL modeling as of June 30 anticipates a significant GDP decline in Q2, followed by a substantial Q3 rebound and gradual improvement through 2021. It also predicts US unemployment remaining between 8-10% until at least Q4 2021.\nThese economic changes resulted in a $60 million net allowance increase this quarter. Including economic impacts, charge-offs, and specific reserves, the allowance for credit losses grew by about $50 million in Q2.\nWe added model adjustments to account for reopening efforts, potential impacts on high-risk portfolio segments including COVID-19 loan modifications, and government stimulus effects.\nPredicting future economic reactions to the ongoing pandemic remains challenging.\nAssuming our current base case economic outlook holds, credit portfolio changes and new loan originations will be the main factors affecting allowance over time.\nAs previously mentioned, allowance for credit losses may fluctuate significantly due to potential major shifts in economic outlook between reporting periods.\nMoving to Page 16.\nWe've updated our COVID-19 impacted portfolio view to focus on loans that received payment deferrals, which we consider the highest risk related to the pandemic.\nThe Bank approved $968 million in loan deferrals, about 13.5% of the total loan portfolio excluding PPP loans. This included $619 million in principal-only deferrals and $349 million in principal and interest deferrals.\nThe table shows how the $968 million is distributed across industries and the associated allowance for credit loss as of June 30. The ACL loan coverage for this portfolio is 7.1% at period end.\nAs of July 24, we've received requests for additional deferrals on $122 million in loans, which we'll evaluate in Q3. Of these, 56% are from restaurants and bars, and 36% from hotels.\nWe anticipate many hotel clients requesting further deferrals due to ongoing significant stress.\nOur primary goal remains protecting the bank's principal while assisting clients through these unprecedented times. Any additional deferrals will be need-based, aiming for 90-day extensions.\nProceeding to Page 17.\nThe energy portfolio decreased by $42 million in Q2, due to customer repayments and the resolution of a large energy credit mentioned in Q1 2020.\nThe energy portfolio now comprises $104 million in outstanding balances and $59 million in unfunded commitments, totaling $163 million in exposure.\nAs of June 30, our allowance for credit losses on the energy portfolio is $9 million, or 8.7% of the outstanding balance.\nOn Page 18.\nPlainsCapital Bank reported a pre-tax loss of $17.5 million in Q2 2020, primarily due to a $66 million provision expense.\nThe quarter showed stable net and noninterest income and continued improvement in operating expenses. The efficiency ratio was 54%, reflecting ongoing efforts to reduce costs and drive prudent revenue growth.\nWe suspended single-family mortgage retention by the Bank in Q1 due to pandemic-related economic uncertainties. We plan to resume retaining PrimeLending originated mortgages in the second half of 2020, assuming market stability and consistent consumer credit.\nTurning to Page 19.\nPrimeLending generated a $138 million pre-tax profit in Q2 2020, driven by strong origination volumes that increased by $2.1 billion or 54% year-over-year.\nGain on sale margins expanded in Q2 compared to the previous year due to market volumes and pricing actions.\nRefinance activity accounted for 47% of total originations. We expect the refinance portion to remain elevated in Q3 compared to historical levels.\nHilltop retained about 89% of mortgage servicing rights for loans sold in Q2. The mortgage servicing asset is now approximately $82 million and could grow to $150-$175 million by year-end.\nOur mortgage business performed well in Q2 despite challenging circumstances.\nMoving to Page 20.\nHilltopSecurities reported a $28 million pre-tax profit in Q2 2020.\nFixed income services saw solid revenue growth as traders successfully navigated challenging pricing and liquidity conditions.\nThe structured finance business grew by $6.5 million year-over-year as secondary markets for mortgage-related bonds improved following March's market disruption.\nIt's important to note that fixed income and structured finance results can be volatile due to fluctuations in market rates, spreads, and volumes.\nThe securities team made significant progress in launching their new operating system in Q2, with ongoing enhancements planned for coming quarters.\nOn Page 21.\nGiven economic uncertainties related to the pandemic, we're updating our 2020 commentary without providing specific guidance or outlook.\nThe economic rebound's timeline and nature remain unclear, likely dependent on virus management and outbreak control.\nWe remain focused on controllable factors, including ensuring the safety of our associates and clients, helping clients navigate pandemic-related challenges, executing platform growth and efficiency initiatives, and meeting our 2021 commitments.\nOur primary goal is to deliver prudent growth across all business lines while maintaining a moderate risk profile and creating long-term shareholder value.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Here are the paraphrased sentences:\nA quick note for those joining by phone.\nThe call recording will be available on our website if you can't listen to the entire call today.\nLet's start with our standard precautionary statement.\nFactors like weather, regulations, competition, and other risks detailed in SEC filings can impact results.\nWe thank you for your ongoing support and interest in our company.\nI'll provide a brief overview of our financial performance and market conditions.\nNext, I'll discuss the global supply chain, a topic of great interest across industries.\nDavid will then provide an in-depth look at our finances and operations.\nI'll conclude with an update on our green solutions and precision application initiatives.\nAt the end of Q2's call, we presented a scorecard comparing our first half performance to our initial targets.\nI'll now update that through Q3 and year-to-date.\nOur revenue growth remains at 25% through three quarters.\nOur gross profit margin is holding steady at 39%, compared to 38% last year.\nOperating expenses have decreased from 34% to 33% of sales year-to-date.\nInterest expense is down 20%, tracking below 2020 and likely to outperform our initial forecast.\nOur tax rate is now 27% versus 20% last year, but we expect it to decrease in Q4 to meet our mid-20% target.\nOur debt to EBITDA ratio has dropped from 2.5 to 2.1 times and may fall below our 2 times target.\nNet income growth is similar at 87%, outpacing our 25% revenue growth.\nEBITDA has increased 39% compared to last year.\nWe saw strong performance across all sectors, with our domestic crop business leading the way due to several factors.\nLet's first examine commodity prices, starting with cotton.\nWe compared prices per pound from September 27, 2020 to September 27, 2021, seeing a dramatic 59% increase.\nThis has encouraged farmers to invest more heavily in cotton.\nWe've benefited from strong sales of our cotton insecticide Bidrin in Q3.\nOur cotton defoliant Folex also performed well in Q3, with orders continuing into October.\nSoybean prices rose 26% from $10.21 to $12.85 per bushel over the year.\nOur improved soybean portfolio, including recently acquired herbicides, has made soybeans a growing crop segment for us.\nCorn prices increased from $3.79 to $5.42 per bushel.\nOur corn products, including Aztec soil insecticide and IMPACT herbicide, have shown strong performance.\nWe've also launched new corn herbicides like IMPACT CORE and SINATE.\nOverall, our US crop sector grew by 38%, despite logistics issues affecting our soil fumigant products.\nOHP continues to perform well, particularly in horticulture and greenhouse markets.\nAMGUARD is recovering well in the professional pest market.\nOur Australian business AgNova has tripled compared to last year.\nAgrinos is contributing incremental new business.\nMexico is performing well, as are Brazil and Central America.\nThese sectors combined for a 17% increase over last year.\nRegarding supply chain issues, there are currently 540,000 containers backlogged at Long Beach Harbor.\nThe port can unload about 18,000 containers daily, but 29,000 new containers arrive each day, worsening the backlog.\nThis situation stems from shifts in buying patterns due to COVID, limited port capacity, and container shortages.\nTrucking shortages further complicate moving containers once unloaded.\nTo address these issues, companies must focus on production planning, sourcing strategies, and logistics management.\nChina has closed several factories due to environmental concerns and other factors, not necessarily related to production.\nThe government is prioritizing energy usage, leading to restrictions on production for certain high-energy products.\nThis is causing a worldwide supply squeeze.\nThe first concern is whether you can actually place and fulfill a purchase order.\nSome suppliers have demanded higher prices for ordered products, and in some cases, they're unable to ship anything.\nThe primary issue is determining if you can produce or obtain the product itself.\nThe second concern is logistics, with container shipping costs skyrocketing from $2,500-$3,000 last year to $26,000 this year, just for US entry.\nAdditional challenges include moving goods from ports to factories or production sites, and then to final destinations, complicated by trucker shortages.\nThis often results in bidding wars for transportation services, rather than standard pricing.\nIt's crucial to quickly calculate the true cost of goods, assuming you can obtain them.\nFactory costs are also increasing due to rising labor wages.\nWe're collaborating with our finance team to analyze all SKUs in real-time, ensuring our commercial product managers understand their cost of goods sold.\nCompanies that can navigate this process effectively will likely perform best.\nThere's no clear timeline for when this disruption will end, and it will affect different areas to varying degrees in cycles.\nAdaptability is key to understanding and responding to these changes.\nOn a positive note, our six North American production sites give us a stronger position to handle supply chain disruptions.\nOnly about 8% of our portfolio relies on materials from China.\nWe began sourcing from outside China a few years ago due to tariffs reaching up to 31%.\nWe manufacture 46% of our portfolio within our six North American factories, providing greater independence and flexibility to respond to market conditions.\nWe order overseas goods sporadically, unlike many consumer businesses that rely on constant imports.\nWe're working closely with logistics partners to ensure smooth transportation and are ordering goods further in advance while considering less congested ports.\nSo far, we've managed supply chain conditions well and are optimistic about continuing without significant interruptions.\nRegarding our public filing, we expect to submit it within the next 30-45 minutes.\nOur industry is considered critical in all our operating jurisdictions, allowing our business, customers, and suppliers to operate without major disruptions throughout the pandemic.\nOur quarterly sales performance shows a 25% increase over the previous year, totaling $147 million.\nUS sales increased by 33% ($22 million), while international sales grew by 16% ($8 million).\nThe strong US performance led to international sales reducing to 40% of total sales, down from 43% last year.\nOur third-quarter production performance in 2021 exceeded expectations, positively impacting gross margin performance.\nThe crop business saw a 50% improvement in gross margin, while non-crop business margins remained relatively flat due to significant mix changes compared to the previous year.\nInternational sales gross margin improved, primarily due to higher-margin businesses acquired in late 2020.\nA graph illustrates the impact of factory performance on our results, showing a significant improvement in factory costs as a percentage of net sales.\nOperating expenses increased by 24% ($9 million), with newly acquired businesses accounting for 14% of the increase and freight for 17%.\nOperating income in the third quarter was up 112% compared to last year.\nInterest expense is about 24% lower than the previous year.\nThe tax rate is slightly higher due to strong taxable income.\nNet income is $5.5 million, up 88% from the previous year.\nFor the first nine months of 2021, sales increased by 25%, with gross margin up 27%.\nOperating expenses increased primarily due to new businesses acquired in late 2020, performance-linked incentives, legal costs, and volume-related expenses.\nOverall, operating costs increased by 22% compared to the 25% net sales increase.\nInterest expenses reduced by 23% due to cash generated over the last 12 months.\nNet income increased by 87%.\nCash generated from operations increased by 56% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year.\nInventories at the end of September 2021 were $167 million, down from $176 million the previous year.\nExcluding acquired products and entities, base inventory decreased by 11% from last year.\nThe current inventory target for the end of the financial year is $155 million, compared to $164 million at the end of 2020.\nConsolidated EBITDA for the trailing four quarters to September 30th, 2021, was $66 million, up from $49 million for the same period in 2020.\nThis, combined with existing debt, results in available borrowing of $95 million at September 30th, 2021, compared to $45 million a year prior.\nThe chart demonstrates our effective debt management throughout the annual cycle while continuing to invest in future business growth.\nIn summary, for Q3 2021, we achieved a 25% sales increase, improved overall margins, managed operating expenses which rose in absolute terms but decreased as a percentage of sales, and saw an 88% increase in net income.\nThe first nine months of 2021 show a similar pattern: 25% sales growth, 24% increase in gross margins, reduced operating costs relative to net sales, lower interest expense, and an 87% improvement in net income.\nRegarding the balance sheet, accounts receivable grew due to strong sales, inventories were well-managed, working capital remained stable during the quarter, and debt is lower than last year.\nThis was achieved despite three acquisitions in the past 12 months.\nOur liquidity position has notably improved.\nI'll now turn it over to Eric.\nIn recent quarterly earnings calls, we've provided updates on our two strategic growth initiatives: green solutions and prescriptive application technology.\nLet's discuss green solutions.\nWe previously mentioned expanding our green solutions technology, and now have 100 different products in our growing portfolio.\nThis slide categorizes our offerings by function.\nWe offer a balanced range of solutions, emphasizing bio-fertilizers, bio-stimulants, bio-pesticides, and micronutrients.\nOur portfolio now includes traditional crop protection products as well as beneficial plant nutrition and soil health amendments.\nGreen solutions has shown consistent recent growth, as illustrated in this slide.\nQ3 saw a $10 million increase, representing 26% growth from Q2.\nMuch of this growth came from increased sales in Latin America, Brazil, India, and Australia.\nYear-to-date revenue stands at $27 million, and we've revised our full-year forecast from $32-35 million to $35-37 million.\nLatin America contributes about $10 million, our largest market so far.\nOur expansion efforts include ongoing registrations in Latin America, completed transition of the Columbia business, building a pipeline for further distribution in Europe and Africa, and identifying opportunities for significant growth in the US in 2022.\nThe 1,500 spot trials conducted in 2021 are expected to yield benefits in 2022.\nWe've integrated this with our SIMPAS trials, introducing iNvigorate, a promising nitrogen fixation product.\nOur turf and ornamental trials are nearing completion, with large-scale customer demo plots underway.\nAMGUARD, our bioherbicide product for consumer and professional pest use, shows potential for agricultural applications.\nThis is particularly significant given Bayer's decision to exit the consumer market through Scotts, with RoundUp being the leading herbicide in that space.\nWe see strong demand for solutions and believe we're well-positioned in this market.\nGreenplants, acquired as part of Agricenter in late 2017, had strong products for expansion, but integrating them into other areas took time.\nWe've recently introduced products in China and Colombia, and see strong growth potential in Australia.\nBi-PA, a Belgian consortium we joined about six or seven years ago, has produced its first product: Vintec, a biofungicide originally developed for European grapes.\nWe've seen strong results in almonds and recently received California registration.\nWith over 1 million acres of almonds in California, we see a good fit for biotreatment of canker disease.\nWe're also testing it on bananas in Central America with promising results and hope to secure registrations there as well.\nWe've slightly increased our 2021 target by a few million dollars, aiming to double it in the next couple of years and again in the following years.\nIt's an aggressive growth plan, but given our product range, development work, and high demand for solutions in this space, we're confident in our forecast.\nMoving to SIMPAS, this graphic illustrates how the system works.\nOur revenue forecast for SIMPAS through 2025 remains unchanged from our last call.\nSince then, we've reached out to progressive retailers to focus on precision farmers shifting to prescription application of crop inputs.\nWe've identified several retailers fitting this profile, with over a dozen agreements for SIMPAS distribution so far.\nWe expect this number to double in the coming months, with 26 retailers identified, mostly in the Midwest and five in the South.\nThese retail partners provide agronomy and prescription software capabilities for targeting SIMPAS inputs in crop protection, plant nutrition, and soil health enhancements.\nThis allows SIMPAS to dispense ingredients that maximize yield, minimize cost, improve return on investment, and produce beneficial environmental outcomes.\nThese precision ag services strengthen the grower-retailer relationship, fostering long-term business loyalty.\nThe Ultimus software's data retention capabilities, part of SIMPAS, enable concrete documentation of beneficial agricultural practices through MDR.\nIn the emerging carbon credit market, this ability to validate such practices can help offset the investment in technologies like SIMPAS.\nWe're collaborating with the USDA on this technology, which led to an invitation to apply for a grant under the Agricultural Innovation Center Program.\nWe submitted the grant at the end of September, with a decision expected by Q2 2022.\nThe grant focuses on nitrogen reduction using the SIMPAS Ultimus system, decreasing synthetic fertilizer use and applying soil health products instead.\nUltimus provides carbon credit programs a way to verify, measure, and validate grower practices for credit qualification.\nIts blockchain-based permanent ledger creates an immutable record of all field applications by volume and location.\nTo our knowledge, no one

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We aim to accommodate as many questions as possible within our scheduled time frame.\nWe kindly request that you limit yourself to one initial question.\nVirgil has been an esteemed colleague at Nike, Jordan, and Converse since 2016.\nHe was an innovative and brilliant creative force who inspired multiple generations by challenging norms and introducing new perspectives.\nVirgil's humility and compassion were what impressed me most on a personal level.\nWe extend our sympathies to all those who had a connection with Virgil.\nHis presence will be greatly missed.\nThe second quarter's strong performance demonstrates the effectiveness of our strategy, even as we navigate global economic challenges.\nOur team's creativity and adaptability helped deliver another robust quarter.\nDuring times of uncertainty, I focus on the essentials, which for Nike means prioritizing the consumer and leveraging our long-term competitive advantages.\nThese include our innovation-driven culture, strong brand connection with consumers through compelling storytelling, unmatched sports marketing portfolio, and our emerging digital advantage that allows us to directly engage with consumers at scale.\nWe continue to benefit from pandemic-accelerated trends.\nThese include a global shift towards health and fitness, increased demand for athletic footwear and apparel in everyday life, an expanding definition of sport, and a fundamental change in consumer behavior towards digital platforms, which aligns with our growing digital capabilities.\nAs I've mentioned before, challenges create opportunities for strong brands to become even stronger, and that's exactly what's happening here.\nWe are in a significantly stronger competitive position now than we were 18 months ago, and this trend is ongoing.\nOur brand's strong connection with consumers is driving impressive holiday sales, particularly in North American Digital, which led the industry during Black Friday week with nearly 40% growth.\nOur Singles Day performance in Greater China showcased our brand strength as we gained 13 million new members and maintained our position as the top sports brand on TMall.\nThis holiday season has demonstrated the power of our digital transformation globally.\nDigital capabilities are driving our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy.\nThe second quarter was exceptional for sports, featuring our extensive roster of athletes and teams.\nFollowing exciting conclusions to the WNBA and MLB seasons, enthusiasm continues with the NBA, NFL, European soccer, and upcoming college football bowl games, where Nike teams dominate the top rankings.\nWhen these leagues are thriving, our business benefits.\nNike athletes continue to lead in various sports, with notable achievements including Alexia Putellas winning the Ballon d'Or, Marcus Rashford receiving his MBE, and Cristiano Ronaldo reaching 800 career goals.\nShalane Flanagan's remarkable feat of completing six World Marathon Majors in six weeks, each under 2 hours and 47 minutes, while wearing Nike Air Zoom Alphafly Next%, serves as an inspiring reminder of the joy and determination in sports.\nWe continue to differentiate ourselves as the most innovative sports brand by consistently introducing new products that set industry standards.\nWe're aligning our efforts with key growth areas such as Women's, Jordan, and Apparel, while maintaining our commitment to sustainability.\nIn the Women's category, we launched the Nike Air Sesh, a shoe designed specifically for dancers by Tinker Hatfield in collaboration with professional dancers and choreographers.\nThe shoe combines style and performance with a mid-cut leather upper and cushioned foam underfoot.\nWe initially released the Air Sesh exclusively to Nike members, with a wider release planned soon.\nThis launch allows us to deepen our connection with women consumers and sharpen our focus as we expand our definition of sport.\nThis quarter also saw the debut collection from the Serena Williams Design Crew, our apprenticeship program promoting diversity in design.\nThe collection uniquely combines innovation, design, and purpose, driven by our commitment to women's sports across performance and lifestyle.\nSerena recently joined us to inaugurate the Serena Williams Building at our World Headquarters.\nAlong with the LeBron James Innovation Center, these facilities represent the world's most significant investment in sports innovation.\nThe Jordan Brand introduced the AJ36, Nike Inc.'s first shoe using leno-weave technology.\nThis process creates a material that is strong, lightweight, and adaptable to various foot shapes, making the AJ36 one of the lightest Air Jordans ever produced.\nWe plan to incorporate this innovation in future designs.\nOur apparel designs are generating market excitement by resonating with consumers.\nThe latest NBA City Edition and MLB City Connect uniforms exemplify how we're growing sports culture by engaging with local team communities and using thoughtful design to celebrate the game.\nWe also launched FIT ADV, our next-generation performance apparel that combines weather-resistant technology with innovative design to help athletes perform in extreme conditions.\nThis represents the pinnacle of Nike apparel innovation and is currently available in our performance apparel collections, with plans to extend to lifestyle products across all platforms next year.\nIn sustainability, we introduced the Alphafly Next Nature, our most sustainable performance shoe and first sustainable performance running shoe.\nBuilding on the progress made with our Cosmic Unity sustainable basketball shoe, it contains more than 50% recycled content by weight.\nWe plan to apply learnings from the Alphafly Next Nature across our running line to create higher-performing products with more sustainable materials.\nWe remain committed to protecting the future of sport, which depends on a healthy planet.\nWe are creating the marketplace of the future by providing consumers with seamless, consistent, and premium experiences through One Nike Marketplace.\nNike membership allows us to know and serve our consumers across a connected marketplace.\nI'd like to highlight three examples from this quarter that demonstrate how Nike is enhancing the member experience across the marketplace.\nFirst, we recently added new wellness content and workouts featuring Megan Thee Stallion to our Nike Training Club app.\nMegan's content drove record engagement, doubling daily active users in NTC, and her curated product selections saw more than twice the demand compared to other product content during the same period.\nSecond, before Singles Day in Greater China, we introduced a new member experience on TMall and improved the onboarding process.\nAs a result, the Nike Flagship store on TMall led in new member recruitment across sports brands, achieving a 20 percentage point increase in member demand penetration this year.\nThird, we recently announced a partnership with Dick's Sporting Goods, a strategic retail partner who shares our vision for the future of retail.\nThis partnership allows shoppers to link their Nike and DSG accounts to access exclusive offers, products, and experiences.\nI recently visited one of DSG's newest concept stores, the House of Sport in Rochester, NY, and was impressed by its unique service model, interactive sports experiences, and enhanced product showcasing.\nThis store creates a true destination for consumers and will shape future retail expectations.\nOur partnership with DSG represents a new model for brand-retailer collaboration, delivering products, experiences, and services that delight consumers at scale.\nWe are realizing our vision of providing consumers with greater access to Nike through connected member experiences and inventory, powered by integrated data and technology.\nThis approach offers more speed, convenience, and brand connection than ever before.\nLooking ahead, we see even more opportunities to connect consumers with Nike across digital platforms that integrate sport, innovation, culture, and commerce.\nFor example, we recently opened a new space in our New York digital studio to produce weekly Sneakers livestreams, which are achieving industry-leading engagement metrics.\nWeekly content includes launch previews in our Sneakers Live Heating Up show and a new Jordan franchise called J-Walking, presented from the perspective of female Jordan fans.\nOur narratives delve deeply and foster two-way community engagement.\nConsequently, our viewer involvement is triple the industry norm for live broadcasts.\nRegarding Sneakers and Jordan, the initial batch of AJ11 Cool Grey invitations was distributed to the largest female-focused group to date, selling out within the first 60 minutes.\nThe group was chosen using our newly developed Dedication Score, designed to benefit member groups with strong product affinity.\nWe continue to observe exclusive access as a key marketing tool for connecting with customers.\nIn the second quarter, we also introduced the 3D immersive environment of NIKELAND on Roblox.\nNike is engaging young athletes wherever they are, inspiring their imagination and incentivizing real-world movement through novel virtual experiences.\nThe Nike, Jordan, and Converse brands have consistently flourished at the intersection of athletics, creativity, innovation, and culture.\nThe RTFKT acquisition enables us to broaden our reach to satisfy and delight consumers and creators in both tangible and virtual realms.\nWe will support the talented RTFKT team, creator community, and cutting-edge innovation to deliver next-generation experiences involving the RTFKT and NIKE Inc. brands.\nCurrently, we are more robust than before the pandemic, and I'm incredibly enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead.\nThis quarter's results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy.\nThroughout our challenges, this team has collaborated with creativity and resilience to serve our consumers and communities.\nAs we've stated previously, Nike is a growth-oriented company with limitless potential.\nOur Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy is revolutionizing our operating model by fostering deeper, more direct consumer connections through digital means.\nOur teams continue to navigate unprecedented volatility with flexibility, agility, and poise, utilizing the operational playbook we developed at the pandemic's onset to maintain focus on what's most important.\nWe've embraced new work methods, promoted experienced individuals to new leadership roles, restructured the company to enhance consumer focus, and developed new capabilities to serve customers directly with speed and scale.\nNike's second quarter financial performance aligned with the expectations we set 90 days ago, driven by continued brand momentum, strong product franchise performance with exceptional full-price realization, and robust season-to-date holiday sales, counterbalanced by reduced inventory supply relative to market demand.\nAs John mentioned, we had a remarkable Black Friday week, with Nike Direct in North America and EMEA growing over 20% compared to the previous year, building on last year's significant gains.\nI'm particularly proud of our supply chain teams' efforts in achieving this.\nIn late October, I visited our North America distribution centers in Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Mississippi to review our expanding digital fulfillment capabilities and holiday readiness plans.\nOur teams are executing these plans precisely, optimizing available inventory to meet demand with improved service levels and reduced carbon impact, all enabled by technology and automation.\nContinuing on the topic of supply chain, factory reopening in Vietnam is proceeding as planned.\nNearly all affected factories began reopening in October.\nCurrently, all factories are operational, and employee attendance rates have improved, with weekly footwear and apparel production now at approximately 80% of pre-closure volumes.\nIn total, Vietnam factory closures caused us to cancel production of roughly 130 million units due to three months of lost production volume and several months required to return to full production.\nCompared to 90 days ago, we are increasingly confident that supply will normalize as we enter fiscal '23.\nRegarding our digital business, Nike's digital growth is outpacing comparisons and is fueled by our member-centric focus.\nNike Digital grew 11% in the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, setting the industry standard.\nNike Digital now represents 25% of total NIKE Brand revenue, up 3 percentage points from the previous year and more than double the digital mix in fiscal '19.\nEnhanced onboarding experiences are attracting millions of new members to the top of the funnel, and we are heavily focused on member engagement and purchasing.\nMember engagement increased by 27% and repeat buyers grew by 50% compared to last year, driving overall higher Average Unit Retail, Average Order Value, and member purchase frequency.\n40% of total digital demand this year is coming from our mobile apps, highlighting the strength of our digital platform.\nWe now have over 79 million engaged members across our Nike ecosystem.\nAs Nike's digital ecosystem continues to expand, we are beginning to see the compounding benefits of scale, from brand awareness and consumer connection to data-informed personalization and inventory utilization, to loyalty.\nThis quarter, we held our first globally coordinated Member Days event, setting records in member engagement.\nFrom member-exclusive product offerings to our first livestreamed member events from Nike Town London and Passeig de Gracia Store in Barcelona, we created a distinct member experience and set a record for weekly active users on the Nike App in North America.\nConnecting with today's consumer means providing them with the products they want, when and where they want them.\nConsumers desire a premium, seamless, and personalized experience with minimal friction throughout their journey to explore, engage, connect, and purchase products from the brands they love.\nAs previously discussed, Nike is focused on creating One Nike Marketplace that elevates the brand by establishing direct consumer connections through fewer, more impactful wholesale partners, with a connected mobile digital experience at the center built for Nike members.\nOver the past four years, North America has reduced the number of wholesale accounts by approximately 50%, while delivering strong growth and recapturing consumer demand through Nike Direct and our strategic wholesale partners leading the way for Nike.\nIn the second quarter, North America Digital grew 40% compared to the previous year, pushing Nike Digital to 30% of total North America marketplace, bringing Nike Direct to 48% of total.\nTo enable this growth and drive the shift in marketplace composition, we have accelerated investment to evolve our distribution network and scale a digital-first supply chain, leveraging advanced analytics, automation, and technology.\nWe have opened two new regional service centers on both coasts, capable of delivering more units to consumers with shorter delivery times.\nWe have also enabled ship-from-store capabilities across our store fleet, all leveraging advanced analytics from our Celect acquisition.\nRegarding automation, we have added more than 1,000 robots in our distribution centers to handle digital growth.\nIn our digital distribution center in Memphis, robots handled over 10 million units that would have otherwise required manual labor.\nWe continue to scale O2O consumer services across our store fleet, including buy online, pick up in store, and digital order returns in store.\nWhile volumes are relatively small today, we have significant opportunity to scale.\nWe have also established new fulfillment models with key strategic partners to create inventory visibility across the marketplace and optimize full-price digital demand.\nWhen we execute this correctly, the consumer benefits.\nThe progress in creating One Nike Marketplace has accelerated North America's revenue growth and gross margin expansion for another quarter, demonstrating how Consumer Direct Acceleration will fuel Nike's growth and profitability toward the fiscal '25 outlook we shared in June.\nNow, let me discuss the details of our second quarter financial results and operating segment performance.\nNIKE, Inc. revenue grew 1% and remained flat on a currency-neutral basis, led by 8% growth in Nike Direct offset by a 6% decline in wholesale due to optimization of available inventory supply.\nNike Digital grew 11% and Nike-owned stores grew 4% with significant improvements in traffic and higher conversion rates.\nGross Margin increased 280 basis points compared to the previous year, primarily driven by higher Nike Direct margins due to lower markdowns, higher full-price mix, and foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased freight and logistics costs.\nSG&A grew 15% compared to the previous year, primarily due to normalization of spending on brand campaigns, digital marketing investments to support heightened digital demand, strategic technology investments, and wage-related expenses.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.9% compared to 14.1% for the same period last year, due to a shift in our earnings mix and the effects of stock-based compensation.\nSecond quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.83, up 6% compared to the previous year.\nBefore discussing operating segment results, I want to reiterate a few points I made last quarter regarding the impact of Vietnam factory closures on the short-term performance of each of our geographies, beginning in the second quarter.\nNorth America and EMEA finished the first quarter with high levels of in-transit inventory, resulting in prior season supply arriving late due to longer transit times, which could be sold in the second quarter.\nWe observed this in our Q2 results.\nGreater China and APLA experienced a decline in units sold during Q2 due to reduced production and limited inventory, despite being closer to the sourcing base with shorter transit times.\nThis impact was evident in our second quarter results.\nLet's now examine the performance of our operating segments.\nNorth America saw a 12% increase in revenue and a 21% rise in EBIT during the second quarter.\nNike's popularity remained exceptionally high, with holiday retail sales across the market growing by double digits, fueled by the revival of sports and a strong start to the holiday season.\nSports performance categories showed strong double-digit retail sales growth, particularly in Running, Fitness, and Basketball, despite lower inventory levels.\nWomen's retail sales increased significantly, growing at more than twice the rate of men's, with strong performance in both footwear and apparel.\nNike Direct had an exceptional quarter, growing by 30% compared to the previous year.\nAs mentioned earlier, Digital sales continued to thrive, growing by 40% and setting new records during Black Friday week.\nNike-owned stores also achieved strong double-digit growth, with foot traffic approaching pre-pandemic levels and significant increases in Average Unit Retail due to reduced clearance inventory and improved markdown rates.\nDespite strong retail sales momentum in the wholesale channel, revenue decreased by 1% as marketplace inventory remained low, and factory closures in Vietnam along with extended transit times disrupted inventory supply to meet market demand.\nIn EMEA, Q2 revenue grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis, while EBIT increased 22% as reported.\nHoliday retail sales across the market grew by double digits, with strong performance across all consumer segments.\nThe region was energized by the start of the global football season and the Champions League tournament.\nNike athletes continued to dominate on the field, with the Mercurial boot being the top scorer in several European professional leagues.\nThere was a strong consumer response to the Mercurial boot and the launch of the Champions League third kit.\nWholesale revenue increased by 6% on a currency-neutral basis, compared to the previous year's market closures.\nNike Direct also grew by 6%, led by double-digit growth in Nike-owned stores as they compared to previous year's closures, with improved foot traffic due to increased tourism and back-to-school holidays.\nNike Digital sales decreased by 1% when compared to the extraordinary levels of discounted sales in the previous year, as the region had used digital channels to clear excess inventory.\nThis quarter, our full-price Digital business grew over 20%, resulting in a 30-point improvement in full-price sales mix, double-digit growth in Average Unit Retail, and improved markdown rates.\nThese factors contributed to significant year-over-year expansion in gross margin and return on sales profitability.\nIn Greater China, Q2 revenue declined 24% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT decreased 36% as reported, although holiday retail sales across the market have shown more favorable trends.\nThe quarter's results were as anticipated, as we managed reduced full-price product supply due to factory closures in Vietnam.\nWholesale revenue was disproportionately affected, declining 27% on a currency-neutral basis.\nNike Direct decreased by 21%, with declines in both digital and physical retail channels.\nCOVID-related lockdowns continued to cause fluctuations in retail traffic, although foot traffic occasionally recovered to pre-pandemic levels during the quarter.\nDigital sales declined 27%, partly due to delayed product launches on Sneakers.\nDuring the 11.11 shopping event, we achieved stronger digital performance with significant member acquisition and higher Average Order Value through improved consumer engagement.\nDespite challenges, we continue to apply our operational strategies and remain optimistic about the long-term prospects in Greater China.\nThis quarter, we expanded our Joy of Sport brand campaign, featuring local influencers, Olympians, and other athletes from Nike's leading sports marketing portfolio in Greater China.\nThe Jordan brand added excitement by announcing their first female athlete signing in Asia, basketball player Yang Shu Yu.\nTo support these activities and normalize our marketing investment, we increased our spending on demand creation by over 40% compared to the previous year.\nOur local team remains dedicated to creating unique and authentic connections with Chinese consumers.\nWe celebrated Nike's 40th anniversary in China by reintroducing the original Nai-ke collection through the Express Lane, with comprehensive storytelling about the history and heritage of these iconic products.\nDuring the initial launch, all products sold out within the first hour.\nWe plan to expand the Express Lane to offer more unique, localized products, leveraging our most popular global product lines to generate distinctly Nike energy in the marketplace.\nWe observe encouraging signs in Greater China, and although inventory supply has significantly disrupted the market, we still expect fiscal year 2022 to be a year of recovery.\nWe anticipate sequential improvement starting in the third quarter.\nMoving on to APLA, Q2 revenue declined 6% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT decreased 8% as reported.\nDouble-digit revenue growth in SOCO was offset by declines in Asia Pacific territories, which were more heavily impacted by Vietnam factory closures and the business model shift in Brazil.\nHoliday retail sales across the market grew compared to the previous year, despite supply disruptions and store closures in SEA&I and Pacific regions.\nNike Direct grew by 6%, led by Nike Digital growth of 25%.\nOur teams capitalized on market opportunities, with all territories successfully executing Member Days and locally relevant promotions, including Singles Day in Southeast Asia, Buen Fin in Mexico, and Cyber Week in Japan.\nMexico's digital business more than doubled as we implemented a localized assortment and improved fulfillment capabilities through the Nike App.\nAPLA continues to leverage the Express Lane, its digital ecosystem, and global partnerships to create locally relevant products and meaningful engagement with consumers worldwide.\nConsumers in APLA are highly connected, and our team continues to innovate with digital experiences that are locally relevant.\nThe Dia De Los Muertos footwear collection saw 100% sell-through, and this story was expanded globally through our new partnership with Roblox.\nLet's now discuss our financial outlook.\nAs we near the end of the pandemic's second year, comparing quarters and fiscal years becomes increasingly challenging due to multiple waves of COVID-related disruptions affecting the consumer marketplace and supply chain at different times.\nWe expect the operating environment to remain unpredictable as COVID variants continue to disrupt business operations.\nOur fiscal 2022 financial outlook reflects inventory supply significantly lagging consumer demand across Nike's brand portfolio.\nHowever, Nike's long-term market opportunity is greater than ever, so we remain focused on managing short-term challenges while pursuing our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy and working towards our fiscal 2025 financial goals.\nFor fiscal 2022, we continue to expect revenue to grow mid-single-digits compared to the previous year, consistent with our guidance from 90 days ago.\nFor Q3, we anticipate revenue to grow low single-digits versus the prior year, due to ongoing impacts from lost production caused by COVID-related disruptions in Vietnam.\nWe are increasing our gross margin guidance to expand 150 basis points compared to the previous year.\nWe expect to continue benefiting from exceptional demand in a lean marketplace inventory environment.\nFull-price realization will remain above our long-term target, with lower channel markdowns.\nHowever, we anticipate product costs to rise in the second half due to higher macro input costs.\nWe are also planning for supply chain costs for the full year to increase relative to our estimates from 90 days ago, with a greater impact in the second half.\nLastly, we now expect foreign exchange to provide a 55 basis point tailwind compared to the previous year.\nWe continue to expect SG&A to grow mid-to-high teens for the full year as demand creation spending normalizes and we invest in capabilities to support our consumer-led digital transformation.\nWe now anticipate our effective tax rate to be in the low teens for the full year.\nConsumer Direct Acceleration is driving our business forward and transforming our financial model.\nWe continue to demonstrate our ability to manage through uncertainty and volatility in the current operating environment, but we are doing more than just managing through - we are building Nike for the future with deeper consumer connections, a pipeline of product innovation to meet the needs of modern athletes, and new operational capabilities required to serve consumers directly and digitally at scale.\nWe have a clear vision of our brands' long-term future, so we remain focused on what is necessary to succeed over the long term.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I am Rubun Dey, the Head of Investor Relations.\nJoining me to discuss our company's performance and financial results are our President and CEO Horacio Rozanski, along with our Executive VP, CFO and Treasurer Lloyd Howell.\nIn this presentation, we will examine some non-GAAP financial measures and metrics that we believe offer valuable insights for our investors.\nWe provide explanations and reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our Q1 FY2022 presentation slides.\nWe have now reached slide number four.\nLloyd and I are delighted to present our most recent financial results and highlight the exceptional work of Booz Allen's 28,000+ employees.\nOur sector, and indeed the entire economy, is transitioning back to more in-person work as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAt Booz Allen, we are enthusiastic about the opportunities this shift presents for both our employees and clients.\nFollowing my introduction, I will hand over to Lloyd to provide a more detailed analysis of our financial performance.\nLet me begin with a summary of the quarter.\nDuring our previous call in late May, we discussed our short and medium-term objectives and our outlook for fiscal year 2022.\nWe anticipated another year of substantial revenue growth, robust earnings growth, continued cash generation, and strategic capital deployment.\nWe also mentioned that the year's pattern would likely differ from recent years, with slower revenue growth in the first half and significant acceleration in the second half.\nThis pattern is influenced by several factors, including pandemic recovery, implementation of a new financial system, and our acquisition of Liberty IT Solutions.\nWe are pleased to confirm our guidance for the full fiscal year.\nOperationally, we are returning to pre-pandemic business routines.\nOur Defense and Civil divisions are aligned with our government's top priorities, have a strong pipeline, and secured several significant wins this quarter.\nThese two segments represent 75% of our revenue and continue to show solid growth.\nIn our intelligence division, hiring is progressing well, and our portfolio restructuring has resulted in some important contract wins.\nThe first quarter revenue decline was mainly due to reduced billable expenses, but we still expect growth in this division for the year.\nGlobal Commercial accounts for 2% of our revenue.\nOngoing declines are related to our portfolio restructuring and pandemic impacts.\nWe anticipate year-over-year growth in the second half of the fiscal year for this segment.\nOverall, our entire business portfolio achieved low single-digit revenue growth year-over-year, as anticipated.\nThe relatively slow growth was primarily due to a return to more typical staff utilization and PTO trends compared to Q1 of last fiscal year, when the country was largely under lockdown.\nOur bottom-line results, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, exceeded our expectations.\nThe book-to-bill ratio for the quarter was also strong, and we are excited about the high-quality mission-centered work we are winning.\nCash from operations was lower than expected, mainly due to one-time costs associated with the Liberty transaction.\nLloyd will provide a detailed breakdown of all financial figures shortly.\nAs you may recall from our previous call, we outlined several near and mid-term priorities crucial to our success.\nOur optimism for the year is largely due to the significant progress we've made on these priorities.\nLet me briefly review them.\nOur top priority is recruitment, and in Q1, we began to see results from our intense focus in this area.\nWe are observing sequential month-over-month growth and expect this momentum to build throughout the year.\nSecondly, we continue to reshape our intelligence and global commercial portfolios.\nWe believe the tactical and strategic changes we're implementing will lead to year-over-year growth.\nThirdly, we are very pleased to have completed the Liberty acquisition in mid-June.\nOur teams are collaborating closely, and everything we've seen since the closing confirms this was an excellent deal for both Booz Allen and Liberty.\nWe are very excited about the strategic opportunities to enhance each other's strengths.\nFourthly, our NextGen financial system successfully launched on April 1st and is performing very well, thanks to the outstanding efforts of our team.\nAfter more than three years of preparation, launching the system and completing the first quarter close without major disruptions were critical milestones.\nLastly, we continue to invest in our people and capabilities as we carefully manage the transition to a post-COVID environment.\nConsistent with this, creating the best possible experience for our talent remains a constant focus for us.\nI'd like to take a moment to share how Booz Allen is approaching the future of work.\nWe are cautiously optimistic that the worst of the pandemic is behind us in the United States and most locations where Booz Allen operates.\nAs such, we are preparing to fully reopen our offices the day after Labor Day, provided health and safety conditions allow.\nAs we move towards reopening, we plan to incorporate the best practices learned over the past 16 months to create work methods that better serve our talent, clients, and the critical missions we support.\nGoing forward, our workforce will operate under three models.\nWe've always maintained a small group of fully remote employees, which we anticipate will remain relatively constant in size.\nThere's a segment of our workforce that operates full-time at government and company facilities, which will continue but is expected to decrease proportionally from previous levels.\nOur clients have demonstrated remarkable ingenuity throughout the pandemic.\nMany clients are now interested in flexible work models that better align with their objectives while reducing the number of full-time on-site staff.\nThe hybrid workforce model is the third option, which we predict will eventually encompass the majority of our employees.\nHybrid workers will spend less time in Booz Allen and client offices than before, instead splitting their time between remote work and in-person collaboration.\nThis arrangement offers employees greater flexibility in their personal and professional lives while maintaining our culture and strong connections with clients, the company, and colleagues.\nThe most exciting aspect of our internal and external discussions about the future of work is the universal recognition of the potential for increased flexibility.\nThere's an expectation that we must adopt new work methods due to technological advancements and the competitive nature of talent acquisition.\nTo thrive now and in the future, employers in both government and private sectors must cultivate a workforce that is more dispersed, digitally-oriented, and diverse.\nBooz Allen is at the forefront of this shift, collaborating with government clients to reimagine and restructure their approach to fulfilling critical missions.\nMany clients believe that current global conditions and future needs necessitate fundamental changes in how federal agencies conduct business on behalf of the public.\nIn keeping with our identity, we will proactively embrace these opportunities for change.\nAs we look towards autumn and beyond, our company has numerous reasons for optimism and excitement.\nWe are dedicating significant effort to supporting our employees, expanding our business, serving clients, and positioning Booz Allen for future success.\nOur primary objective remains creating both short-term and long-term value for our investors and all stakeholders.\nLloyd, I'll now hand it over to you.\nBefore delving into the financial details, I'd like to highlight that this has been an incredibly busy quarter for us.\nSome key achievements include finalizing our acquisition of Liberty and initiating the integration process, refinancing our balance sheet through the bond market.\nWe invested in Latent II, a strategically important and rapidly expanding company in the AI and machine learning sector.\nWe've intensified our recruitment and hiring efforts with promising outcomes.\nWe've implemented our next-generation financial system.\nAdditionally, we've engaged in company-wide discussions about our strategic review and future investment strategy.\nWe're energized by the rapid pace of activity and look forward to sharing more information in the coming months.\nNow, let's review our first quarter performance.\nAs we mentioned in May, we anticipated some initial fluctuations in our top-line results as we transition to a post-pandemic operational rhythm.\nHowever, we maintained strong performance in adjusted EBITDA and ADEPS through careful cost management.\nWe're also encouraged by our solid bookings performance and recruitment pace.\nOperating cash flow fell short of our initial forecast, but we view most of the contributing factors as either one-time or temporary.\nOverall, today's results align with the expectations we set last quarter, and we remain confident in our plan for the full fiscal year.\nRegarding top-line performance, revenue increased by 1.7% year-over-year to $2 billion in the first quarter.\nLiberty contributed approximately $16 million to revenue growth.\nRevenue excluding billable expenses grew by 1.9% to $1.4 billion.\nRevenue growth was driven by solid operational performance, primarily offset by higher-than-normal staff utilization in the same period last year.\nThe quarter's top-line performance met our expectations.\nAs a reminder, we forecast constrained low single-digit top-line growth in the first half of the year, driven by four factors: First, the need to ramp up contract work and hiring; second, a more normalized utilization rate compared to the high staff utilization in the first half of fiscal year 2021, which we estimate accounts for about 300 basis points of growth.\nThird, high PTO balances at the start of the fiscal year, with the expectation that employees will take more time off; and fourth, minor timing differences in labor costing resulting from the implementation of our new financial system.\nAs previously stated, we expect growth to accelerate throughout the year.\nNow, let's examine performance at the market level.\nIn the defense sector, revenue grew by 4.4%, with strong growth in revenue excluding billable expenses, partially offset by significant materials purchases in the prior year period.\nIn the civil sector, revenue increased by 6%, led by strong performance in our health business and the addition of Liberty.\nWe expect momentum to build throughout the year as more administration priorities gain traction and we continue to capture opportunities, building on our strong win rates.\nRevenue from our intelligence business declined by 6.4% this quarter.\nRevenue excluding billable expenses grew in line with our expectations but was more than offset at the top-line by lower billable expenses.\nWe are excited about several critical recent wins in the portfolio and believe we have the right leadership and strategic direction in place to achieve growth this year.\nFinally, revenue in the Global Commercial sector declined by 27.4% compared to the same quarter last year.\nWe expect growth in the latter half of the year, which largely depends on recruiting more staff to meet increasing demand and overcoming challenging previous year comparisons internationally.\nOur quarterly book-to-bill ratio was 1.3, while the 12-month ratio stood at 1.2.\nThe overall backlog increased by 16.5% year-over-year, including Liberty, reaching a new high of $26.8 billion.\nThe funded backlog grew by 1.6% to $3.5 billion.\nThe unfunded backlog increased by 91% to $9 billion, while priced options decreased by 3.7% to $14.3 billion.\nWe are pleased with our first quarter booking performance, following a seasonally strong fourth quarter.\nWe believe our consistent long-term book-to-bill ratio shows ongoing strong demand for our services and the high value placed on our understanding of client needs.\nAs of June 30th, our workforce consisted of 28,558 employees, an increase of 1,177 or 4.3% from the previous year.\nOur main focus for the year is to accelerate hiring to meet the high demand for our services.\nWe are optimistic about how we ended the first quarter and expect to see improvement throughout the year.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $238 million, an 11.8% increase from the same period last year.\nThis growth was mainly due to our ability to bill for fees in our intelligence business and the timing of unallowable expenses within the fiscal year.\nThese factors, along with continued low billable expenses as a percentage of revenue, pushed our adjusted EBITDA margin to 12%.\nWe anticipate an increase in billable expenses and unallowable spending as the year progresses.\nFirst quarter net income dropped 29% year-over-year to $92 million, primarily due to Liberty transaction-related expenses of about $67 million.\nAdjusted net income rose 12.3% to $146 million from the previous year, mainly driven by the same factors that led to higher adjusted EBITDA.\nDiluted earnings per share decreased 27% to $0.67 from $0.92 in the same period last year.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15% to $1.07 from $0.93.\nThe improvements in our non-GAAP metrics, which exclude transaction-related costs, were primarily due to operational performance and a lower share count this quarter resulting from our share repurchase program.\nCash flow from operations was negative $11 million in the first quarter.\nThis decline was mainly due to lower collections, largely attributable to timing issues related to receivables associated with the integration of our new enterprise financial system.\nAs our employees and clients adapt to the new invoicing system, we expect to return to normal collection patterns in the coming months.\nOperating cash flow was negatively impacted by approximately $67 million in transaction costs paid in the first quarter, including about $56 million cash payment at the closing of the Liberty acquisition.\nThese cash payments represent a reallocation of part of the overall $725 million purchase price, before adjustments, from investing cash flows to operating cash flows.\nCapital expenditures for the quarter were $9 million, down $11 million from the previous year, primarily due to lower facility expenses.\nWe still expect capital expenditures to fall within our projected range for the year.\nDuring the quarter, we issued $500 million of 4% senior notes due in 2029.\nWe also extended the maturity of our Term Loan A and revolving credit facility to 2026 and increased our revolver capacity by $500 million to $1 billion total.\nThese actions support our disciplined capital deployment strategy.\nWe will continue to use our balance sheet strategically.\nDuring the quarter, we paid $52 million in quarterly dividends and repurchased $111 million worth of shares at an average price of $83.91 per share.\nIn total, including the Liberty acquisition, we deployed $889 million.\nWe are announcing that our Board has approved a regular dividend of $0.37 per share, to be paid on August 31st to stockholders of record on August 16th.\nOur actions this quarter demonstrate our commitment to preserving and maximizing shareholder value through a disciplined, balanced capital allocation approach.\nPlease refer to slide seven.\nWe are reaffirming our fiscal year 2022 guidance.\nAs discussed last quarter, the first half/second half dynamics we outlined continue to guide our full-year growth expectations.\nWe expect total revenue growth between 7% and 10%, including Liberty.\nOur contract and hiring progress will determine where we fall within that range.\nWe continue to anticipate revenue growth accelerating throughout the year.\nWe expect adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid-10% range.\nWe project adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4.10 and $4.30, based on an effective tax rate of 22% to 24% and 134 million to 137 million weighted average shares outstanding.\nThe ADEPS guidance includes both Liberty and additional interest expense from our $500 million bond offering.\nWe expect operating cash flow to grow to $800 million to $850 million, including the aforementioned $56 million in cash payments related to the Liberty transaction.\nDue to these one-time payments, we expect to end the year at the lower end of our range, partially offset by a combination of working capital management and operational performance.\nLastly, we expect capex in the $80 million to $100 million range.\nIn conclusion, we are starting the year as expected and look forward to a successful year ahead.\nWe took on the ambitious task of executing both a major acquisition and a company-wide rollout of our financial systems in the same quarter.\nWith that, Rubun, let's open the line for questions.\nPlease open the line, operator.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Mike Lukemire, the president and COO, will join us for the Q&A portion.\nI encourage you to review our Form 10-K filed with the SEC to understand the full scope of risk factors that could affect our performance.\nRecently, I've been contemplating the main points I wanted to address today and carefully considering my target audience for these remarks.\nWhile I won't dwell on the past quarter or year, it's noteworthy that we've achieved our third consecutive record year and remain very positive about the future.\nThe consumer segment faced a 24% comparison, while Hawthorne's 39% growth was measured against a 64% comparison.\nI'm aware there are some obvious issues we need to discuss.\nWe'll address our pricing strategy, commodity outlook, excess inventory in the cannabis market, and our thoughts on capital allocation.\nWe'll cover these topics and share our perspective on fiscal year 2022.\nAs a public company CEO for two decades, I've observed how short-term concerns can often overshadow the bigger picture.\nI'd like to focus mainly on more than just our current performance.\nTo be honest, there are many exciting developments at the company right now, some of which I can't disclose.\nOur business is at a crucial turning point that could significantly alter our appearance five years from now.\nWe have the chance to strengthen our company, broaden our competitive advantage, and allow a new generation of leaders to shape it through their perspective, not just mine or my executive team's.\nWe view the current market volatility as an opportunity.\nThose willing to be proactive during these times can seize opportunities others can't and further enhance their competitive advantages, which ultimately drives long-term shareholder value.\nI want the main takeaway from today to be a clearer understanding of the path we're on.\nTo be frank, my intended audience is quite specific.\nTo our sell-side colleagues, I understand the need to refine your models and share that information with your clients. We'll provide what you need, but my remarks aren't directed at you.\nMy comments are also not aimed at short-term investors.\nI won't get bogged down in discussions about quarterly breakdowns, commodity spot prices, or year-over-year SG&A comparisons.\nHowever, I do want to address those investors who see the long-term potential in SMG shares.\nI want to convey our direction and why we're confident our efforts will create shareholder value.\nI'll address key questions about fiscal 2022, but I'll integrate them into a broader context of how we're running the business rather than focusing solely on P&L impacts.\nTo look forward, I need to briefly look back.\nFor the five-year period ending September 30, our strategic plan assumed a relatively mature core business and overall growth of about 4% to 6%, driven by higher growth at Hawthorne.\nWe aimed to achieve consistent shareholder returns of 10% to 12% through P&L leverage, share repurchases, and maintaining a roughly 2% dividend yield.\nWe also set a five-year target of $1.5 billion in cumulative free cash flow.\nWe surpassed all of these goals.\nWhile we're proud of this achievement, we recognize that this strategy has run its course as opportunities have changed. We've changed too.\nThe next phase in our evolution will reflect these new realities.\nWe've identified five distinct growth pillars for the next five years.\nThree of these pillars relate to the U.S. consumer business, while the other two are connected to Hawthorne.\nFirst, we anticipate higher sustainable growth with our existing brands in our core business, largely due to our ability to reach a new generation of consumers.\nSecond, there's potential for further growth in our direct-to-consumer efforts if we invest in people, brands, partnerships, and infrastructure.\nThird, live goods remain a significant growth opportunity and a way to establish a more direct relationship with gardeners.\nOur aim is still for consumers to view us as a gardening company, not just a gardening supply company.\nFourth, to support Hawthorne's future growth, we must continue to prioritize the commercial grower in everything we do.\nThis means further strengthening our model, driven by innovation and technical solutions.\nFifth, the cannabis industry will undoubtedly continue to evolve and grow.\nCompanies that are creative and bold enough to enter this market early have the potential for a first-mover advantage.\nWe demonstrated this willingness when we created Hawthorne, and we plan to do so again.\nAs we pursue these pillars, we're strengthening our team.\nWe're focusing on succession planning and ensuring our ESG efforts are integrated into our operations and better understood by key stakeholders.\nWe debated as a team and with our board whether to pursue all these opportunities simultaneously.\nWe agreed we had to, but we recognize that succeeding in all these areas requires reorganization and empowering a new generation of leaders.\nWhile there are no plans for me or any current team member to step down, nearly every member of my team has made changes to their organizations.\nThe level of oversight needed to succeed in these efforts requires Mike Lukemire to focus more on strategy and implementation in the fastest-growing areas of the business.\nHe has restructured his organization so that each of these pillars reports directly to him.\nJosh Peoples and Dave Swihart will effectively co-lead the consumer segment.\nOn the corporate side, Cory has strengthened his leadership team with new outside talent.\nDenise Stump and Jim King have realigned their teams to better meet business needs.\nAdditionally, most of the M&A opportunities we're pursuing include management teams that can further strengthen our own.\nIf all the opportunities we see come to fruition, we could potentially double the size of Scotts Miracle-Gro within five years.\nThat's not necessarily the goal; we want smart growth, not growth for its own sake, but the potential magnitude of the opportunity could be transformative.\nLet me briefly explain how we plan to execute these pillars, or at least discuss them in the context of our expectations for next year.\nWe believe the U.S. consumer segment can achieve sustainable long-term growth of 2% to 4% annually between the first two pillars.\nOur previous strategic plan assumed growth of 0% to 2%.\nIf we can maintain growth at this higher level, those additional two points provide significant P&L leverage and improved cash flow.\nIt's worth noting that our guidance for next year assumes flat to slightly declining growth in the U.S. consumer segment.\nThis is based on an assumed reset of the business in a post-COVID world.\nSpecifically, we're planning for a decline in unit volume offset by pricing.\nYou'll recall from our Q3 call that we implemented about five points of pricing in August.\nRecently, we've informed our retail partners of a second price increase effective in January.\nThis more targeted increase will range from mid-single to low double-digits depending on the product line.\nIn total, we now expect pricing in 2022 to be in the high single-digit range, aiming to cover commodity prices.\nWhile we believe our sales assumption for 2022 is prudent, current trends suggest a better outcome.\nConsumer POS in units for fiscal 2021 was six points higher than in 2020.\nMore importantly, it was 21 points better than fiscal 2019 and actually strengthened later in the year.\nConsumer volume during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, while down seven points from last year's record performance, was 35 points higher than the same period in fiscal 2019.\nConsumers are demonstrating that lawn and garden is an essential part of their lives.\nEvery data point shows they've remained engaged with the category and our brands throughout the past season.\nThese trends continued in October.\nWhile it's a relatively small month, it's an important conclusion to the season, especially in the Midwest and Northeast.\nPOS in units was up 4% in October compared to last year's record result and up 42% compared to fiscal 2019.\nAs we enter the off-season, the POS numbers won't be very informative until February.\nObviously, we won't know until next summer how much of the COVID bump we've retained.\nBut I'm confident we'll have a significantly higher base to grow from.\nWe continue to invest with that in mind.\nMillennial homeowners have clearly become a demographic tailwind, more than offsetting baby boomers leaving the category.\nThis group of consumers cares more about gardening than their parents and sees the category as more rewarding and purpose-driven.\nA 30-year-old couple buying a home today and entering our category for the first time has the potential to stay with us for 20 years or longer.\nWe must operate with that timeframe in mind.\nWe don't want our marketers to worry about hitting a target for Wall Street.\nTheir job is to drive consumer engagement, brand loyalty, and market share.\nWe're going to give Josh Peoples and his team the tools to achieve that.\nThe same applies to our direct-to-consumer pillar.\nThis area is approaching 10% of our U.S. consumer sales and will only grow larger.\nWhen we think about direct-to-consumer, it goes beyond selling items on our website.\nIt also means collaborating closely with our retail partners to support their online efforts.\nIt also involves finding new partners who can help boost the appeal of gardening and have their own digital platforms we can leverage.\nPatti Ziegler, one of our brightest and most creative leaders, directs our direct-to-consumer effort.\nIn addition to the efforts I've already mentioned, she and her team have launched native online brands like Green Digs, Knock Knock, and Instead.\nOne of their greatest successes has been with AeroGrow.\nPatti has championed the potential of our direct-to-consumer platform from the beginning and continues to reimagine the future of this business.\nSucceeding in our direct-to-consumer effort also requires improving our IT and supply chain infrastructure.\nDave Swihart, whose role has recently expanded to lead both supply chain and R&D, is driving towards that goal.\nWe need to enhance our ability to ship directly to consumers, especially in categories like live goods, which has significant online potential.\nUntil recently, our direct-to-consumer efforts didn't warrant much attention, but that's changed.\nWhile it's still too early to gauge the ultimate potential of this pillar, it will be a significant contributor to growth moving forward.\nI'm equally convinced our third pillar, live goods, will be even more important.\nLiving plants serve as an entry point to the lawn and garden sector, but have traditionally been localized, poorly promoted, and standardized.\nWe think we can improve upon this situation.\nWe've made a promising start with Bonnie and its chief executive, Mike Sutterer, and we're collaborating with Bonnie's other owner, Alabama Farmers Coop (AFC), to explore additional growth opportunities with significant potential.\nAFC shares our vision of establishing a nationwide branded enterprise across various categories of living plants.\nWe believe our combined efforts can better address the needs of gardeners and our retail partners through innovation, marketing, and supply chain improvements.\nWe've already made significant strides in enhancing the Bonnie business, though there's still much more to be done.\nThe remaining two strategic components are associated with Hawthorne.\nChris will provide more details about the current market conditions, but I want to assure you that I'm not fixated on fourth quarter sales or first quarter projections.\nI'm confident that Chris and his team have a good grasp of the current situation.\nMore importantly, I believe they're navigating the market fluctuations while maintaining focus on long-term opportunities.\nIf market challenges persist for a few quarters, expect them to capitalize on the situation.\nWe won't chase sales, but we will take an aggressive stance to further strengthen Hawthorne and its market position.\nFor instance, anticipate increased efforts in innovation.\nI recently visited our new research and development facility in British Columbia.\nI've also toured field stations in Oregon, Florida, and Ohio.\nThe key takeaway is that our research in hemp and cannabis is revolutionizing the industry.\nFrom lighting to nutrients to growing media, our research aims not only to improve our product offerings but also to help growers achieve better and more cost-effective results.\nOur unique understanding of plant science and indoor cultivation nuances is unparalleled.\nNo other company in the industry is doing what Hawthorne is doing, and our competitors can't even attempt to replicate our model.\nThis is an important point to keep in mind.\nWe're also likely to use this period as an opportunity to increase our merger and acquisition efforts.\nWe continue to be cautious in our M&A approach, but the economics of some deals have become more attractive recently.\nThe final component of our strategy is incorporated into the recent establishment of a new subsidiary called the Hawthorne Collective.\nI've been hinting for months about opportunities to invest in emerging areas of the cannabis industry, but this is my first chance to discuss the effort in detail.\nIt begins with our recent investment in RIV Capital, a Canadian-based publicly traded company that owns or invests in various cannabis-related businesses.\nWe share a common vision with RIV's other major investors to create a fully integrated business based on acquiring licenses for cultivation and distribution.\nFrom there, RIV can partner with some of the most well-managed brands in the cannabis industry.\nThere's much speculation about the potential for new brands to succeed as the market expands into categories like beverages.\nHowever, too few people are focusing on existing brands in traditional categories.\nThis is already a multi-billion dollar market, with brands operating within individual states.\nWe're convinced there's tremendous potential for some of these brands to thrive more broadly as the market expands, and our investment in RIV reflects that belief.\nWe believe our unique expertise in the cannabis industry gives us an advantage in areas beyond our existing portfolio.\nHowever, we currently cannot make direct investments in those areas.\nIn fact, we can't even have a direct ownership stake in a company that does, but we can create an ownership option, which is what our convertible loan to RIV Capital represents.\nIn the short term, we don't expect to see an impact from the RIV investment on our profit and loss statement, and the $150 million we've invested doesn't affect our ability to invest in other areas or return cash to shareholders.\nIn the medium term, RIV may seek additional capital infusions.\nWe might be interested, depending on the opportunities, but I won't speculate on how much we might invest.\nThe honest answer is that it depends.\nBut just as we did when we acquired General Hydroponics, Botanicare, Gavita, and Can-Filters, we're willing to make investments others might avoid until there's more clarity about the future.\nIf you're a short-term investor, you may not like this approach.\nBut the long-term potential is real and significant.\nEventually, if we convert our financial interest in RIV into equity, which is definitely the goal, it may prompt us to reassess our current capital structure.\nMany of you have asked if we'll spin off Hawthorne as a separate company.\nI've said we'd only consider doing that for strategic reasons, not to chase valuation, and that's still true.\nOver the past year, we've worked to understand what a potential separation would require, and I believe we're capable of executing such a move if we decided it made sense.\nLet me be clear: we have no near-term plans to do this.\nBut could it become a viable option?\nI think the possibility is growing.\nAs I hand over to Cory, I want to emphasize that I'm just as confident about our near-term plans as I am about our long-term strategy.\nThe U.S. consumer business is performing well, and our customers continue to demonstrate the importance of this category in their lives.\nAt Hawthorne, while we expect continued top-line pressure through Q1, I'm confident in our team's ability to persevere, and we still anticipate sales growth on a full-year basis.\nAre there more challenges now than a year ago?\nAm I thrilled with the current stock price?\nBut we're on a path to build a better and stronger business, and we won't be distracted by external noise.\nI mentioned earlier that we exceeded all the financial targets set in our previous strategic plan.\nOur goal is to remain on a path that allows shareholders to continue benefiting from the opportunities outlined in our new plan and the pillars I've discussed.\nThe confidence we all have is part of our decision to increase our share repurchase efforts.\nI told you last quarter we had allocated $250 million for that purpose.\nWe now expect to add another $100 million to that total, and we hope to acquire as many of those shares as possible in the next two quarters.\nCory, please take it from here.\nI'll spend a few minutes discussing the main themes from our fourth quarter results, particularly regarding sales and gross margin.\nIn between, I'll hand over to Chris to provide some insight on Hawthorne.\nU.S. consumer sales performed better than expected, finishing up 11% compared to the 7% to 9% growth we anticipated.\nAt $3.2 billion, sales have grown by nearly $900 million in the last two years.\nThe supply chain team deserves significant credit for their ability to deliver this growth.\nThe targeted investments we have made and will continue to make in this area will prove crucial.\nConsumer engagement remained extremely strong through the fourth quarter, keeping our retailers equally engaged.\nIn the consumer segment, sales declined 28% in Q4, but we were up against a 92% increase from the previous year.\nAlso, remember that Q4 had six fewer days this year than last year.\nAdjusting for that, sales in the quarter would have declined 23%.\nAt Hawthorne, the calendar shift cost us seven points for the quarter.\nWhile year-over-year sales declined 2%, the segment would have been up 5% on a comparable basis when adjusting for the calendar.\nThe U.S. Hawthorne business grew by over 10% last year in Q4 given the same comparison.\nFinally, recall that Hawthorne was up against a 64% increase in the same period a year ago.\nOn a full-year basis, Hawthorne grew 39% to $1.4 billion.\nI'll remind you that number was $640 million in fiscal 2019.\nWe have more than doubled the sales of that business in two years, and all of that growth was organic.\nOn the segment profit line, Hawthorne earned $164 million in fiscal 2021, for an operating margin of 11.5%.\nThe profit was up 46% from last year and more than 200% from 2019.\nWe've said repeatedly that we're trying to strike a balance between growth and improved profitability.\nI think the results speak for themselves.\nAs many of you know, I served as a finance lead at Hawthorne, almost since the inception of that business, before joining the corporate team as CFO.\nAs you look at the Hawthorne results, I encourage investors to look deeper than the numbers.\nWhile the growth and profit improvements have been impressive, the improvements we've made to how the business operates tell an even better story.\nFrom the integration of seven separate businesses to the implementation of SAP, the revamping of our sales force, and the creation of the world's only cannabis-focused R&D program, the efforts of this team have been outstanding.\nI know all of you want to know more about the current state of the business.\nI'll leave the details around the numbers to Cory, but I know you're wondering about the current state of the industry and how we're navigating it.\nSo let me address that for a few minutes.\nWe're obviously seeing some disruption in the market right now, but we expect it to be temporary.\nOur field sales team began seeing signs of a potential slowdown in late June.\nWe gained more insight into the issues in July, which allowed us to share some of those insights on our third quarter conference call in August.\nThat's when we cautioned that growth would be significantly slower in Q4 than we'd seen for the rest of the year.\nSince then, many of you have been asking whether this will be a replay of 2018.\nWe don't see it that way at all, and we're not alone.\nSome of you were in Las Vegas a couple of weeks ago for the MJBiz conference.\nIt's the largest cannabis trade show in the world.\nIf you were there, you saw firsthand that this is not an industry that's worried about the future.\nConsumer demand for cannabis products continues to grow, and the market continues to expand.\nRegarding the current environment, what was clear to me in Vegas was that the industry is becoming increasingly adept at navigating the inevitable choppiness in a market like this.\nWhat's happening right now is actually pretty straightforward.\nIn California, there was simply too much cannabis harvested in the past few months, especially from outdoor growers in the northern part of the state.\nOn top of a strong harvest from the first crop turn earlier in the year, many growers harvested their second cannabis crop earlier this season due to concerns about wildfires, drought, and, in the case of the legacy market, fear of increased enforcement efforts.\nThe combination of too much product and relatively poor quality has put downward pressure on wholesale cannabis prices.\nHowever, that issue should resolve itself once the current supply makes its way through the marketplace.\nBecause the legacy market remains a big part of what's happening in California, the available data isn't great.\nProviding a precise answer regarding the duration for the current oversupply to resolve itself in the market is challenging.\nThis is why we're predicting a decrease in Hawthorne sales for the first quarter.\nNevertheless, the most crucial point is that the cannabis end market continues to expand, and we anticipate renewed growth in the coming calendar year.\nThis trend is expected to persist for the foreseeable future.\nIn fact, many premium growers have informed us that current market conditions aren't affecting them at all, and they continue to thrive.\nAnother crucial point to remember is that, unlike in 2018, there are currently no regulatory obstacles.\nThree years ago, California severely hindered the launch of the recreational market.\nThat was the primary issue impacting the market at that time.\nObtaining a legal operating license was extremely difficult, whether for cultivators or dispensaries.\nWhile California's current market remains more expensive and bureaucratic than other states, it has significantly improved from the past, and the legal market there continues to grow.\nSome of you are also curious if the current situation will lead to consolidation.\nThe answer is straightforward.\nYes, it certainly will.\nHowever, these types of fluctuations are precisely what we anticipate.\nThis occurred in Colorado in 2015, in Oregon when it legalized, and is likely to happen to some extent in California.\nIn fact, we're observing this in Oklahoma right now.\nLike many new markets, Oklahoma experienced rapid initial growth and may have become somewhat overbuilt.\nSo we expect a pause there before growth resumes.\nWe have consistently informed you over the years that this industry is likely to experience occasional turbulence.\nThis isn't the first time the industry has seen an oversupply of cannabis, and it certainly won't be the last.\nWhat's crucial for Hawthorne is that we maintain our strategy.\nLong-term growth will be present.\nI'm not concerned about that.\nInstead, I want to ensure we're doing everything necessary to outpace our competitors.\nJim has already mentioned that we won't slow down our innovation efforts, which extend far beyond just new product development, bringing me back to the MJBiz conference in Vegas a couple of weeks ago.\nLike most major trade shows, MJBiz was canceled last year due to COVID.\nSo we haven't seen the entire industry in one place for over two years.\nWhat was evident to us, and frankly almost everyone we interacted with, is how much progress Hawthorne has made in those two years and how much we've distanced ourselves from the competition.\nWe have fundamentally transformed our sales approach, and that transformation is ongoing.\nWe've introduced new products that have improved growers' results by both increasing yields and reducing their operating costs.\nWe've also used innovation to help us in more qualitative ways, such as establishing the Hawthorne Social Justice Fund within our corporate foundation.\nWhile I understand the questions you need to ask about our declining growth rate, I urge you not to lose sight of the bigger picture.\nThere's no doubt that we're the clear industry leader.\nThere's no doubt that our competitive advantages are unique, and there's also no doubt that the cannabis industry still has substantial growth potential ahead.\nSo looking ahead to fiscal '22, I'm not worried about a few obstacles.\nInstead, I'm excited to see how much further we can push this business and continue to lead the way in an industry that remains poised for years of growth.\nLet's now examine the gross margin line on the P&L.\nLike nearly all other CPG companies, we've continued to face pressure from higher commodity and distribution costs.\nHowever, the year-over-year change in the margin rate during Q4 requires some additional context.\nIn Q4 of fiscal '21, the adjusted gross margin rate was 17.4% compared to 24.3% in 2020.\nCompany-wide sales in Q4 of last year increased by nearly 80%.\nSo the fixed cost leverage in a relatively small quarter led to a significant improvement in the margin rate.\nIf you compare the Q4 gross margin rate in '21 versus '19, the difference is only 100 basis points, attributable to a combination of segment mix and higher commodity costs.\nFor the full year, the gross margin rate decreased by 270 basis points to 30.3%.\nThe primary reason for the decline was the year-over-year increase in commodity costs of about $85 million, almost all of which was anticipated, followed by higher distribution costs.\nAs you know, we didn't adjust our prices this year until August in the U.S. consumer business.\nSo we had limited ability to offset the commodity inflation during the first three quarters of the year.\nThis situation will change significantly in fiscal '22, which I'll explain further when I discuss our guidance for next year.\nHigher volume was able to drive improved fixed cost leverage and conversion, helping to offset the commodity cost increases.\nSG&A decreased by 2 percentage points in fiscal '21 to $743 million.\nIt declined 21% in the quarter to $161 million.\nLower variable compensation was the main factor.\nAdditionally, in Q4 of 2020, we used some of our strong earnings upside to significantly increase our annual contribution to The Scotts Miracle-Gro Foundation, which we did not repeat in fiscal '21.\nInterest expense was $5 million higher in Q4 compared to a year ago, but essentially flat on a full-year basis.\nRemember, we issued $900 million of bonds in the second half of the year, which drove an increase in the quarter.\nOn the bottom line, adjusted net income, which excludes restructuring, impairment, and one-time items, increased by 28% to $528 million or $9.23 per share.\nThat's just $0.01 shy of a $2 per share increase in a single year and more than double the $4.47 per share we earned in 2019.\nThe earnings per share figure is at the high end of the revised range we set in early June, and is a significant achievement given the difficult comparisons and some of the cost challenges we've had to overcome in the second half of the year.\nRather than delving further into those details, I want to shift focus and share our thoughts about fiscal '22.\nThis assumes the U.S. consumer segment is flat to minus 4%, and that Hawthorne grows 8% to 12%.\nNone of these ranges account for the potential impact of acquisitions.\nFor the consumer segment, we're entering the year assuming unit volume will decline by high single digits.\nRoughly half of that decline is expected from lower shipments in the first half of the year.\nRemember that last year's Q1 was up nearly 150%, as retailers worked hard to replenish depleted inventory levels.\nSince current retail inventory levels remain higher than a year ago, we likely won't see a repeat of that kind of initial stock-up.\nWe're also, for planning purposes, assuming modest declines in consumer takeaway in fiscal '22, mostly driven by the difficult comparisons we face in the first half.\nAs Jim has already indicated, consumer POS has been stronger than we expected in recent months, and has actually been positive for the fall season.\nIt's easy for us to ramp up to meet higher consumer demand if it materializes, but the prudent approach is to assume a slight decline.\nMost, and perhaps all, of the planned unit volume decline should be offset by pricing.\nYou should see some benefit from pricing in Q1 from the August price increases, with the balance taking effect during our Q2.\nRegarding Hawthorne, we're planning for 8% to 12% growth on a full-year basis.\nWe expect to see continued pressure in Q1.\nAs Chris mentioned, it's difficult to be precise about the current inventory supply issues in the industry, but we hope to see a return to growth sometime in Q2.\nLet's move on to gross margin.\nWe expect to see the gross margin rate decline by 100 to 150 basis points on a full-year basis.\nWe are cautiously optimistic that our pricing moves will offset expected commodity pressure.\nThat said, we expect about 65% to 70% of our costs to be locked in by the end of the calendar year.\nSo we'll still have some exposure if costs increase more than the planned increases we are assuming.\nThe two biggest pressures on the rate next year will come from lower fixed cost leverage and segment mix.\nWe anticipate some leverage from SG&A, meaning this line can range from a 6% year-over-year decline to a slight increase of maybe 2%.\nThere are no major changes in SG&A, and we remain committed to investments we believe will drive the business, not just in fiscal '22, but in the years to follow.\nBelow the operating line, interest expense should be roughly $25 million higher, based on the full-year impact of our recent bond offering.\nOur guidance also assumes no offsetting earnings impact from acquisitions, which is a fairly conservative starting point.\nAll of this results in a guidance range for adjusted earnings per share of $8.50 to $8.90.\nI also want to discuss cash flow for a moment.\nFor the year we just completed, free cash flow, which is operating cash flow minus capex, came in at $165 million.\nWhile that is low by historical standards, there are three main reasons for the year-over-year decline.\nFirst was variable compensation that was earned in fiscal '20 but paid out in fiscal '21.\nThat was about a $60 million impact.\nSecond, we increased capex by about $45 million.\nThird, inventory levels increased by $500 million from fiscal '20.\nWhile most of this increase was paid during the year, we did rely more on our vendor partners than in the past to achieve extended payment terms.\nLooking ahead to fiscal '22, we're aiming for free cash flow of up to $300 million.\nWe expect capex to increase again, and we also expect inventory levels, while flat on a unit basis, to be higher overall due to increased costs.\nThese investments are necessary to continue meeting the required service levels for our customers, which is the higher priority.\nRegarding inventory, we find ourselves in a very good position right now.\nIn both U.S. consumer and Hawthorne, we believe some competitors will struggle to meet demand.\nIn the consumer business, we expect the market to experience shortages of grass seed and sphagnum peat moss, a key ingredient used in growing media.\nWe do not anticipate being impacted by these issues, and we do not expect to have any problems getting our customers to appropriate inventory levels.\nI agree with Jim's assessment.\nWe have many moving parts right now and several active initiatives that could require us to update our outlook as we progress through the year.\nBut even in the unlikely event that none of those efforts come to fruition, I believe the business is in an excellent position.\nThe challenges we're facing on the cost of goods line are fairly consistent with what you've been hearing from other companies over the past two weeks.\nAnd as we said we would, we've taken aggressive action to stay ahead of all those challenges and protect the profitability of the business.\nWhen I consider how far this business has come in such a short time, it's hard not to feel optimistic about our current position.\nSummary:

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I am deeply appreciative of our colleagues' ongoing dedication and hard work, particularly those still experiencing the pandemic's devastating effects.\nA uniform recovery has not yet occurred, as many regions worldwide continue to be severely impacted by the pandemic.\nIndia is currently facing an especially critical situation, as many are aware.\nWe are deeply concerned for our colleagues and customers in India, working closely with our team there to ensure employee and family safety, while supporting our customers as much as possible.\nI will briefly outline our first quarter operating results and update you on our three-phase transformation plan, which focuses on initiating commercial momentum, enhancing organizational leadership and performance management, and aligning our portfolio with growth areas.\nI will then share some thoughts on how our business is positioned for sustainable growth.\nMike will subsequently provide a detailed review of our financial results and comments on our updated financial outlook for the second quarter and full year.\nIn the first quarter, revenue increased 31% as reported, 27% in constant currency, with non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share growing 99% year-over-year.\nThis strong start was driven by growth across all end markets, continued strength in pharma, earlier-than-expected recovery in non-pharma spending, new product traction, and strong commercial execution.\nExamining our top-line results more closely:\nAll our end markets experienced double-digit growth in the first quarter.\nOur largest market category, pharma, grew 28% in constant currency, industrial grew 24%, and academic and government grew 29%.\nRegarding sales performance by geography, in constant currency, Asia sales grew 41% with China up 109%, Americas sales grew 14% with the US growing 13%, and Europe sales grew 25%.\nOur Waters division grew 26%, while TA grew by 28% on a constant currency basis.\nCustomer activity improved in the first quarter, with pharma leading the way, driving better-than-expected trends in recurring revenues and significant growth in instrument revenue.\nRecurring revenues grew 15%, with services growing 14% and chemistry consumables revenue growing 18%, driven by combined pharma strength and improved industrial demand.\nLC instruments grew across all major geographies and market categories, with over 40% growth.\nBoth HPLC and UPLC instrument units saw double-digit growth, driven by pent-up demand, integration of the Arc HPLC, and strong execution of our LC replacement initiative.\nThe Arc HPLC launch in the general purpose HPLC space has been remarkably successful, and the ACQUITY PREMIER has been well-received by customers since its February launch.\nMass spec sales were strong in the first quarter, growing over 50% due to robust pharma market demand and rebounds in clinical, food, environmental, and biomedical research markets.\nTandem quad demand was solid in Europe and China, particularly in pharma and food sectors.\nRevenue grew 28% as demand rebounded in the core industrial business, with continued strength in pharma medical devices and semiconductors.\nGrowth was robust across all major geographies and product lines, with particular strength in thermal and electrophoresis.\nAll major regions experienced double-digit growth.\nChina's performance built on last quarter's strength, more than doubling sales year-over-year, with strong results across all end markets as the country continued recovering from last year's COVID disruptions.\nChina's pharma sector was particularly strong, driven by triple-digit growth in both contract labs and traditional Chinese medicine.\nChina's food business saw meaningful growth, driven by a significant rebound in contract testing organizations to levels above those seen in 2018 and 2019.\nIndia's sales grew double-digits for the third consecutive quarter, despite worsening conditions and ongoing pandemic challenges.\nEurope experienced broad-based strength across all customer end markets, including meaningful sequential improvements in both industrial and academic and government markets.\nIn the US, both pharma and industrial markets showed strong growth, while demand in the academic and government market remained soft, lagging behind other markets in reopening.\nWe had an excellent start to the year with strong year-on-year growth that was more broadly based than last quarter, demonstrating impressive performance across all regions, end markets, and product categories.\nPharma demand remains strong, and many non-pharma markets are now recovering, giving us greater confidence for the remainder of the year.\nI'd like to discuss our business and its future direction more broadly, including the company's strengths, the effectiveness of our target markets, and our deep commitment to innovation as we look beyond this quarter into the long term.\nOur three-phase transformation plan focuses on initiating commercial momentum, strengthening organizational leadership and performance management, and aligning our portfolio with growth areas.\nRegarding our first priority of initiating commercial momentum, I'll review some previously mentioned initiatives.\nOur instrument replacement initiative delivered a significant acceleration in instrument revenue growth to 45%.\nThe February launch of the ACQUITY PREMIER system, combined with the successful placement of Arc HPLC launched in June 2020, has created new opportunities for instrument replacements.\nWe've also gained traction with customers in replacing aging tandem quad mass spec instruments with newer models.\nOur CROs CDMO expansion initiative has seen revenue growth accelerate to strong double digits in both customer segments.\nCustomers continue to view us as a strong technical partner for method transfer from originators and as a collaborator rather than a competitor.\nOur e-commerce initiative has begun to deliver tangible results, with search engine optimization and paid search leading to search impressions increasing by more than 40% year-on-year.\nWhile not every click translates to immediate revenue, increasing traffic is a crucial first step in our e-commerce efforts.\nWe are focusing on driving launch excellence.\nI'll begin with a discussion of liquid chromatography.\nAlthough the Arc HPLC is a top performer in the general purpose HPLC market, I'd like to highlight the ACQUITY PREMIER.\nWe introduced the ACQUITY PREMIER Columns in the previous year and followed up with the ACQUITY PREMIER System in the last quarter.\nDespite being in the early phases of revenue growth for both the Columns and System, sales of ACQUITY PREMIER Columns are significantly surpassing previous successful chemistry launches, including the original ACQUITY Columns.\nNow, let's discuss mass spectrometry.\nIn 2019, we unveiled the BioAccord, Cyclic IMS, SYNAPT XS, TQ-S cronos, and an updated version of our TQ-S micro.\nCombining our tandem quad with ACQUITY PREMIER results in industry-leading reproducibility and sensitivity for challenging assays.\nWe've maintained our focus on delivering a versatile, user-friendly, and robust LCMs system to the QA-QC space while expanding BioAccord applications.\nIn Q1, we introduced a complete workflow for peptide multi-attribute method on the new Waters Connect platform to enable quality attribute monitoring at the peptide level.\nThis complements existing simple-use applications for peptide mapping impacts of unit mass analysis, released glycan profiling, and oligonucleotide mass confirmation.\nOver the past year, we integrated the BioAccord into workflows for characterizing mRNA molecules that have since become vaccines.\nBioNTech acknowledged Waters for our support in their COVID-19 vaccine development and relief efforts.\nCyclic, launched in September 2019, targets the most advanced high-resolution mass spec users.\nBy enhancing traditional LCMs with high-resolution ion mobility, we can differentiate molecules with identical molecular weight based on their varying shapes.\nThis capability is particularly relevant for analyzing structural changes in the sugar pattern of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein.\nWe acknowledge that our mass spec informatics applications need improvement, and we're addressing this through the development and implementation of our Waters Connect software platform across our entire mass spec portfolio.\nCurrently, Waters Connect supports biopharma characterization and monitoring workflows with various capabilities on the BioAccord, Xevo QTof, and [Indecipherable].\nThe Q1 launch of our RDa Benchtop Tof also enables small molecule workflows on Waters Connect.\nWe appreciate the trust and partnership of our customers as we develop new applications and beta test upcoming products and software.\nNow, let's discuss our TA Instrument division.\nLast year, we introduced the X3 DSC, offering unique advantages for routine high-throughput labs and R&D, particularly in pharmaceuticals, electronics, and advanced materials.\nThe X3 DSC's ability to deliver highly sensitive physical property measurements more rapidly than comparable products allows for broader deployment in manufacturing processes, enabling scientists to evaluate multiple combinations in parallel and reduce time to market.\nThe more I interact with our R&D colleagues and customers, the more impressed I am by the strength of our deeply technical culture.\nMoving on to our second priority.\nWe've already announced planned leadership transitions last month.\nAmol Chaubal will join as CFO on May 12th, bringing extensive experience in pharmaceuticals and diagnostics, having led many transformations through organic and inorganic growth in previous roles.\nMike will continue as our Corporate Controller and will also assume the role of Chief Accounting Officer.\nWe've established a dedicated Innovation Board, which I will lead, including leaders from R&D, Business Development, and Marketing.\nThe Innovation Board will evaluate unmet needs in our target markets, assess technology proof of concepts, and monitor the execution of top R&D programs.\nAlthough their retirements are effective July 2, they've kindly offered to serve as consultants for a period to ensure a smooth transition.\nBoth Jon and Jianqing have extensive commercial and transformation experience in global leadership roles in rapidly growing markets such as molecular diagnostics and bioprocessing.\nI'm excited about our new team and look forward to introducing them to you in the coming months.\nOur third priority is aligning our portfolio with high-growth areas.\nWhile maintaining focus on commercial execution as our top priority, we've recently begun our strategic planning process.\nI'd like to share some high-level thoughts on our current position.\nOur primary focus is strengthening our core business, including LCMs and materials characterization instruments, informatics, service, and consumables.\nSecondly, we aim to expand into faster-growing adjacent markets where we can leverage our strength in managing compliant data without directly competing with our customers.\nThese opportunities include increasing our exposure to biologics through reagents, other instrument technologies, or bioprocessing, as well as accelerating LCMs into diagnostics or other high-growth markets.\nLastly, we will maintain our disciplined approach to financial management, capital structure, and capital deployment, focusing on maintaining top-tier ROIC.\nIn the coming year, I look forward to sharing more details about our strategy and the data points that give us confidence in our foundation for sustainable growth in this attractive market.\nI'll now hand over to Mike Silveira for a more detailed review of the first quarter financials and our outlook for the remainder of 2021.\nIn the first quarter, we recorded net sales of $609 million, representing a 27% increase in constant currency.\nCurrency translation boosted sales growth by approximately 4%, resulting in 31% sales growth as reported.\nExamining product line growth, our recurring revenue, which combines precision chemistry products and service revenue, increased by 15% for the quarter, while instrument sales grew by 45%.\nChemistry revenues rose by 18% for the quarter, driven by strong pharmaceutical market growth and improving industrial demand.\nOur service business saw a 14% revenue increase as customers continue to reopen labs and catch up on performance maintenance, professional services, and repair visits.\nAs mentioned in our previous earnings call, recurring sales were impacted by five additional calendar days in the quarter, primarily affecting service revenues.\nLooking ahead, compared to 2020, there is no year-over-year difference in the number of calendar days for this year's second or third quarter.\nThe fourth quarter of this year has six fewer calendar days.\nA more detailed breakdown of first quarter operating segment sales shows Waters Division sales increased by 26%, while TA Instrument sales grew by 28%.\nLC and LCMs instrument sales combined rose by 47%, and TA system sales increased by 34%.\nLet's discuss our first quarter non-GAAP financial performance in comparison to the previous year.\nThe quarter's gross margin reached 58.2%, a 3.5 percentage point increase from 54.7% in Q1 2020, mainly due to higher sales volume and favorable effects.\nLet's examine the first quarter profit and loss statement.\nOperating expenses rose by about 9% on a constant currency basis and 11% as reported.\nThe increase was primarily due to higher labor incentive compensation costs and increased depreciation from recent IT investments.\nOur effective operating tax rate in Q1 was 14%, higher than last year, as the previous year's comparable period included some favorable one-time items.\nThe quarter's net interest expense was $7 million, a decrease of roughly $3 million, as expected due to lower average outstanding debt balances.\nOur average share count was 62.6 million shares, unchanged from Q1 of the previous year.\nOur non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for Q1 increased by 99% to $2.29, compared to $1.15 last year.\nOn a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share rose to $2.37 from $0.86 last year.\nI'd like to summarize our Q1 results and activities regarding free cash flow, capital deployment, and our balance sheet.\nWe consider free cash flow as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures, excluding certain special items.\nIn Q1 2021, free cash flow increased by 60% year-over-year to $193 million, after allocating $40 million for capital expenditures.\nThe free cash flow calculation excluded $14 million related to investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation.\nIn Q1, this resulted in $0.32 of every dollar of sales being converted into free cash flow.\nOur improved free cash flow primarily resulted from sales growth and better operating margins compared to the previous year.\nIn Q1, accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 84 days, a decrease of 15 days compared to Q1 of last year.\nInventory decreased by $16 million compared to the prior year's quarter, despite higher sales volumes.\nWaters maintains a robust balance sheet, access to liquidity, and a well-structured debt maturity profile.\nRegarding returning capital to shareholders, we bought back about 600,000 shares of common stock for $173 million in Q1.\nThese capital allocation activities, along with our free cash flow, resulted in $810 million in cash and short-term investments and $1.7 billion in debt on our balance sheet at the end of Q1.\nThis led to a net debt position of $893 million and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of approximately 1 at the end of Q1.\nOur capital deployment priorities remain consistent: invest for growth, maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility, and return capital to shareholders.\nWe remain committed to deploying capital against these priorities, and as Udit mentioned earlier, we have begun a new strategic planning process.\nAs we continue to execute our priorities, we will consider deploying capital to enter attractive adjacent markets.\nLooking ahead to the rest of the year, I'd like to provide some updated context for our 2021 outlook.\nWhile the business environment remains volatile, we're seeing good momentum in our market segments, which will help us surpass 2019 levels.\nWe believe this momentum will continue into Q2, but the strong double-digit growth will mainly occur in the first half of the year due to more challenging comparisons in the second half and the six fewer calendar days in Q4.\nWe still expect all major geographies to perform better this year than in 2020, led by growth in China.\nOur near-term growth initiatives are expected to continue ramping up, led by our LC replacement initiative, which we anticipate will contribute increasingly to our performance.\nThese factors support our updated full-year 2021 guidance for constant currency sales growth of 8% to 11%.\nAt current rates, positive currency translation is expected to add approximately 1 to 2 percentage points to 2021 sales growth.\nFull-year gross margin is expected to be between 57.5% and 58%.\nEach year, we aim to balance growth, investment, and profitability.\nAccordingly, we expect 2021 operating margins of 28% to 29% based on a combination of investments, normalization of COVID-related costs, and disciplined expense controls.\nMoving below the operating income line, other key assumptions for the full-year guidance are: net interest expense of $35 million to $38 million; a full-year tax rate between 14.5% and 15.5%; and the net impact of our 2021 share repurchase program resulting in an average diluted share count of 61.5 million to 62.0 million shares outstanding.\nThroughout the year, we will evaluate our share repurchase program and provide quarterly updates as appropriate.\nCombining all these factors, on a non-GAAP basis, full-year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected to be between $9.85 and $10.05, assuming a positive currency impact on full-year earnings-per-share growth of about 3 percentage points.\nFor Q2 2021, we expect constant currency sales growth of 14% to 16%.\nAt current rates, currency translation is expected to increase Q2 sales growth by approximately 3 percentage points.\nQ2 non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be between $2.15 and $2.25 as the significant prior year COVID cost-saving measures start to normalize.\nAt current rates, the positive currency impact on Q2 earnings-per-share growth is expected to be approximately 1 percentage point.\nIn summary, there's much to be pleased about regarding our Q1 results, driven by strong growth across all major end markets, with pharma leading the way.\nOur transformation plan is progressing well, with commercial momentum and a strong leadership team in place.\nWe now focus on developing a new strategy as we work to align our portfolio more closely with higher-growth areas of the market.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Various uncertainties and risks exist, including potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, market sectors, and financial performance.\nWe are happy to announce another successful quarter of results.\nWe performed effectively and continue to excel in serving our customers across multiple areas, including quality, delivery service, and technological collaborations.\nOur supply chain personnel work tirelessly around the clock to surmount unprecedented logistical hurdles and material shortages to maintain our factory's supply.\nI am particularly pleased that we achieved unparalleled safety performance, a goal our teams worldwide have been striving towards.\nThe company reported GAAP earnings of $0.95 per share, or $0.83 adjusted, on revenue of $232 million, representing a nearly 10% increase from the same quarter last year.\nOur Machine Clothing division continues to perform exceptionally well, with sales growth of 11% compared to Q3 last year, demonstrating excellent profitability and cash flow generation.\nEngineered composites showed top-line growth of almost 7% and performed well as we anticipate the recovery in commercial aerospace.\nOur financial performance was robust, with 40% gross margins, 19% operating margins, and 26% adjusted EBITDA margins, while maintaining strong free cash flow generation of over $40 million in the quarter.\nOur company has low debt and a strong balance sheet, and we anticipate continued solid performance from our Machine Clothing segment and gradual improvement in commercial aerospace.\nAs previously noted, long-term market trends are favorable, and Albany's market positions, global presence, and product development capitalize on these trends.\nIn our Engineered Composites division, we anticipate a gradual improvement in commercial aerospace, with demand for narrow-body aircraft recovering before wide-body demand.\nAs a result, we are recruiting employees and preparing for increased LEAP production driven by growth in Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX production.\nWe are working with Safran to increase production at our three LEAP facilities in the United States, France, and Mexico.\nWe observe positive indicators in international travel bookings as borders reopen and people resume international travel, although we do not expect any immediate increase in wide-body production demand, such as for our Boeing 787 composite frames line, due to existing inventory and slow recovery in international travel.\nOur AEC businesses continue to perform well on military platforms including the Sikorsky CH-53K helicopter, Lockheed Martin's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and Jazan missile programs.\nWe are fortunate to be involved in excellent programs, and our teams are executing them effectively.\nWe persist in our efforts to attract new customers and applications for advanced composites.\nDuring the quarter, we announced a technology collaboration with Spirit AeroSystems to apply our advanced 3D woven composite technology to hypersonic vehicles, leveraging our proprietary 3D woven composites in high-temperature environments to provide structural strength and thermal protection, building on our proven ability to industrialize 3D woven composites at high volumes.\nThis exemplifies the intense collaboration our teams excel at, working closely with our technology partners in the design, development, and commercialization of cutting-edge composite applications.\nIn addition to collaborating on engine component applications with our partner Safran, we continue to develop wing applications with the Airbus Wing of Tomorrow program and other composite programs in commercial and defense applications.\nOur Machine Clothing segment maintained its exceptional performance.\nOur engineers and sales and service teams in MC collaborate closely with key customers to develop next-generation belt materials for improved operational efficiency, performance, and durability.\nCustomers value our service, technical expertise, and innovation.\nWe observed strong demand for new products across all product lines during the quarter.\nDemand in MC's end markets has remained resilient, particularly strong in packaging in the Americas.\nTissue markets have remained stable, although demand is mixed and overall flat as tissue machine utilization is below long-term averages and tissue producers are working through disruptions caused by the pandemic's effect on away-from-home paper markets.\nThis situation should improve as workers return to offices and students return to school.\nIn other end markets, demand was strong for corrugators, nonwovens, and building products during the quarter.\nEven the publication sector showed improvement this quarter, likely a temporary pause in the long-term decline of printing and writing paper grades.\nWe are facing significant logistical challenges and price inflation for various raw materials and wages.\nThus far, our supply chain management and operations teams have performed admirably.\nThey have managed to secure the materials necessary for our operations with only moderate cost increases.\nGenerally, we aim to offset inflationary costs through productivity improvements.\nHowever, this situation may be different, as we do not anticipate inflationary pressures subsiding soon.\nIf anything, conditions became more challenging during the third quarter.\nAllow me to comment briefly on corporate governance and capital allocation before handing the call over to Stephen.\nIn early August, the company moved closer to a single-class share structure following the secondary offering of nearly all the Standish Family's ownership in the company, with the remaining few shares converted to Class A common stock.\nConsequently, there are now more than 32.3 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding and fewer than 1,200 shares of Class B stock outstanding, held by two former employees.\nThis transaction effectively created a conventional single-class governance structure for our shareholders.\nAs previously mentioned, our priority is to use our balance sheet first for organic growth investments where we can add value for our customers, followed by acquisitions that align with our strategy and enable us to build on our technology leadership and market positions in both segments.\nIn addition to these options, Albany's Board of Directors has authorized a $200 million share repurchase program, expanding our available capital allocation alternatives.\nWe continue to seek acquisitions that enhance our technology and market position at a fair price, focusing on value creation from both organic and inorganic investment perspectives.\nIn conclusion, we had another successful quarter.\nOur businesses are performing well, we continue to push the boundaries in our technology development with new products in both segments, and secular trends in our end markets are favorable.\nWith that, I'll now pass the call to Stephen to provide more detailed financial information.\nI'll begin by discussing the quarterly results and then provide an outlook for our business for the remainder of the year.\nIn the third quarter, our company's total net sales reached $232.4 million, showing a 9.6% increase compared to $212 million in the same period last year.\nWhen adjusted for currency translation effects, net sales increased by 8.8% year-over-year this quarter.\nIn Machine Clothing, after accounting for currency translation effects, net sales rose by 9.9% compared to the previous year.\nThe year-over-year increase in net sales was driven by all major product categories, with engineered fabrics and packaging grades leading the way.\nEngineered composites' net sales, after adjusting for currency translation effects, increased by 6.7%, primarily due to growth in LEAP and CH-53K programs, partially offset by anticipated declines in the 787 and F-35 platforms.\nThe ASC LEAP program generated approximately $25 million in revenue during the quarter, similar to the first two quarters of this year, but about $9 million higher than the third quarter of last year.\nWe're satisfied with the reduction in our LEAP-1B finished goods inventory.\nIn the most recent quarter, we decreased that inventory by over 30 engine shipsets, bringing it down to about 140 engine shipsets on hand.\nGiven the current rate of inventory consumption for that program, we don't plan to let the inventory level drop below approximately 100 engine shipsets, so we can see progress in terms of inventory destocking.\nI'm eagerly anticipating an earnings call where I won't need to discuss LEAP-1B inventory at all.\nWe anticipate returning to more normal production levels for LEAP-1B, comparable to current LEAP-1A production rates, in early 2022.\nHowever, we are somewhat concerned about the rate at which Boeing is depleting its inventory of finished 737 MAX aircraft, so there's still some uncertainty regarding 2022 build rates.\nWe hope to provide better insight during our fourth quarter call.\nDuring the quarter, we generated less than $3 million in revenue from the 787 program, slightly lower than the second quarter, but down from almost $9 million in the same quarter last year.\nThe company's third quarter gross profit was $92 million, an increase of over 5% from the same period last year.\nOverall gross margin decreased by 160 basis points from 41.2% to 39.5% of net sales.\nIn the MC segment, gross margin remained steady at 51.5% of net sales, as improved absorption benefits were offset by year-over-year foreign currency changes and rising input costs.\nThe AEC segment's gross margin declined from 21.6% to 16.1% of net sales due to a smaller impact from changes in estimated long-term contract profitability, a shift in program mix, lower fixed cost absorption from reduced 787 and F-35 revenues, and the impact of sharing a portion of The Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection grant with our customers.\nThe $5.8 million benefit from this grant is reflected in the corporate portion of the results, while the reduced profitability from sharing part of the grant with customers is reported in the segment results.\nWe recognized a net favorable change in the estimated profitability of AEC's long-term contracts of about $2 million this quarter, compared to a net favorable change of about $3.5 million in the same quarter last year.\nThird quarter Selling, Technical, General, and Research expenses were $47.4 million, slightly down from $47.8 million in the prior year quarter, and decreased as a percentage of net sales from 22.6% to 20.4%.\nAlthough R&D expenses increased by over $1 million this quarter and we incurred higher travel expenses, these were more than offset by a foreign currency revaluation gain this quarter compared to a foreign currency revaluation loss in the same quarter last year.\nThe company's total operating income was $44.5 million, up from $38.8 million in the prior year quarter.\nMachine Clothing operating income increased by $9.8 million, driven by higher gross profit and lower STG&R expenses.\nAEC operating income decreased by $3.9 million due to lower gross profit and higher STG&R expenses, partially offset by lower restructuring expenses.\nThe income tax rate for this quarter was 29.4% compared to 24.7% in the same quarter last year.\nThis year's higher rate was due to a larger share of our global profits generated in jurisdictions with higher tax rates and less favorable discrete income tax adjustments.\nWe reported over $2 million in expenses under other income expense this quarter, primarily due to an adjustment of indirect taxes in a foreign jurisdiction.\nThe company's net income for the quarter was $30.9 million, an increase of over $1 million from $29.6 million last year.\nThis increase was mainly due to higher operating profit, partially offset by higher interest expenses and a higher tax rate.\nEarnings per share were $0.95 this quarter compared to $0.92 last year.\nIn addition to our usual non-GAAP adjustments for foreign currency revaluation gains and losses, restructuring expenses, and expenses related to the CirComp acquisition and integration, we are also adjusting for the impact of The Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection grant this quarter, as we don't believe it reflects ongoing profitability.\nAfter making these non-GAAP adjustments, adjusted earnings per share were $0.83 this quarter compared to $0.96 last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by 2.6% to $60.2 million for the most recent quarter compared to the same period last year.\nMachine Clothing adjusted EBITDA was $59.2 million or 38.4% of net sales, up from $52.6 million or 37.9% of net sales in the prior year quarter.\nAEC adjusted EBITDA was $16.3 million or 20.8% of net sales, down from last year's $19.5 million or 26.6% of net sales.\nRegarding our debt position, total debt, consisting of amounts reported on our balance sheet as long-term debt or current maturities of long-term debt, remained steady at $350 million.\nWe have a floating to fixed interest rate swap in place at the debt level for the duration of the current credit agreement and currently don't plan to reduce total debt below that level.\nCash increased by about $33 million during the quarter, resulting in a reduction in net debt by the same $33 million.\nCapital expenditures in the quarter were approximately $9 million, similar to the same quarter last year.\nRegarding capital deployment, as Bill mentioned, our priorities remain unchanged.\nOur top priority is organic investments, followed by disciplined and targeted acquisitions, and then returning capital to shareholders.\nOur fundamental strategy remains the same.\nThe Board of Directors has approved a $200 million share buyback program, considering our modest debt and strong cash flow outlook.\nWe consider this program the most efficient and effective way to provide additional value to our shareholders.\nWhile we can't guarantee full or partial execution of this authorization, we intend to utilize it depending on market conditions and acknowledging the inherent constraints on implementing such a large program quickly.\nIf fully implemented, the share repurchase program would slightly increase our net debt by less than one times EBITDA, leaving us with ample resources for further strategic initiatives.\nThe Machine Clothing segment's outlook for the rest of 2021 remains positive.\nThird-quarter revenues increased by over 11% compared to the previous year, partly assisted by favorable currency effects, mainly due to a strong euro.\nLong-term growth is primarily driven by packaging and tissue sectors.\nAlthough we observed a significant recovery in publication revenue during the third quarter, due to people returning to offices and schools, the continuation of this trend is uncertain because of the Delta variant surge, which has temporarily halted some return-to-office plans.\nFurthermore, once we move past the pandemic's effects, we anticipate the long-term decline in the publication market to persist.\nIt's worth noting that the MC segment's growth rate this quarter was unusually high due to the timing of customer demands.\nYear-to-date segment orders have increased by about 6% compared to last year, and the backlog entering the fourth quarter is only slightly higher than the same period last year.\nWe typically generate between 23% and 25% of the segment's revenue in the fourth quarter, and we expect this year to follow a similar pattern.\nConsequently, we are increasing our previously announced revenue guidance for the segment to between $600 million and $610 million, up from the earlier range of $585 million to $600 million.\nIn terms of profitability, Machine Clothing delivered another strong quarter, with adjusted EBITDA margins of nearly 39%.\nWe are experiencing increased pressure from various input costs, particularly logistics, and expect these pressures to continue rising through the end of the year.\nHowever, as previously mentioned, many of these cost increases, which began in Q2 and accelerated in Q3, have not yet significantly impacted our results due to our supply agreement terms and the roughly six-month delay between acquiring raw materials at higher costs and those costs being reflected in the segment's cost of goods sold.\nWe will see more impact from these cost pressures in Q4, but the full impact won't be evident until 2022.\nAdditionally, in late Q3 and early Q4, we've noticed some easing of travel restrictions in certain regions and are starting to see an increase in customer visits, which will result in slightly higher SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter.\nPrimarily due to strong revenue performance, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the segment to a range of $215 million to $225 million, up from the previous range of $210 million to $220 million.\nRegarding Engineered Composites, we delivered a strong quarter that met expectations.\nLast quarter, we predicted Q3 profitability would be similar to Q1, and it was within a few hundred thousand dollars of that level.\nWe were pleased to receive an Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection grant of $5.8 million during the quarter, acknowledging the challenges we and the industry have faced due to the COVID pandemic.\nHowever, we have excluded the effects from both Q3 adjusted results and segment guidance for the year as it doesn't reflect ongoing operational performance.\nWhile unlikely to significantly impact the remainder of 2021, we are concerned about the slow recovery of the Boeing 787 program, as Boeing has indicated they will continue to produce at a low rate for the foreseeable future.\nAs of the end of Q3, we had about five shipsets of 787 product in either finished goods or work-in-progress, which is not unusually high.\nHowever, substantial quantities of our finished goods exist in Boeing's overall supply chain, which, combined with Boeing's low production level, will likely lead to very low production levels for us in the foreseeable future and may even result in significant production gaps.\nAny impact in 2021 would be modest as we're not anticipating any significant recovery on the program this year, but it will likely delay any meaningful recovery on the program until after 2022.\nAs you know, our F-35 production levels have been uncertain this year, as our customer has dealt with issues elsewhere in the supply chain over the past 18 months and with lower depot consumption of aftermarket parts.\nWe are confident in our outlook for the rest of the year, but I'll note that Lockheed Martin and its government customer have established a new program production outlook that plateaus at 156 aircraft in 2023, a lower rate and earlier date than previously planned.\nThe F-35 remains a very good and profitable program for us.\nThis programmatic change doesn't affect this year, but it will likely temper the revenue upside in the program for us in future years.\nOverall for the AEC segment, the year is progressing largely as we expected when we last issued guidance, though we are now less concerned about downside risk.\nTherefore, we are raising the lower end of our guidance range for segment revenues, resulting in a range between $310 million, up from the previous range of $290 million to $310 million.\nFrom a profitability perspective, given the year is progressing largely as expected, we are maintaining the previously issued guidance range for AEC adjusted EBITDA of between $65 million and $70 million.\nWe are also updating our previously issued guidance ranges for company-level performance, including revenue of between $900 million and $920 million, increased from prior guidance of $880 million to $910 million.\nThe effective income tax rate remains at 28% to 30%, unchanged from prior guidance.\nDepreciation and amortization of about $75 million, unchanged from prior guidance.\nCapital expenditures in the range of $40 million to $50 million also unchanged from prior guidance.\nGAAP earnings per share of between $3.23 and $3.38, increased from prior guidance of $2.84 to $3.14.\nAdjusted earnings per share of between $3.15 and $3.30, increased from prior guidance of $2.19 to $3.20 and adjusted EBITDA of between $230 million and $240 million, increased from prior guidance of $225 million to $240 million.\nOverall, while the pandemic is not yet behind us and risks still remain across our business, we are very pleased to be able to raise guidance again, reflecting the hard work and dedication of our teams worldwide.\nThe coming years will continue to be challenging as we and the rest of the industry slowly recover from the severe downturn in commercial aviation and as the machine clothing market finds its new post-pandemic normal.\nWe also recognize the risks ahead in terms of supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures, should the recent and current increases be more than temporary.\nHowever, our track record of operational excellence and continuous improvement positions us well to address these challenges.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Today's discussion will reference certain non-standard financial metrics, including operating income and accident share loss and combined ratios, excluding catastrophes.\nI'll start by addressing our Q2 financial highlights in relation to the current business and economic climate.\nNext, I'll provide a strategic overview of each segment's performance during the quarter.\nJeff will delve deeper into our financial results and offer insights on upcoming quarters.\nWe're thrilled to report exceptional Q2 results, featuring strong growth with net written premium increases of 11.7% or 8.6% adjusted, excluding 2020 premium returns, driven by gains across all segments.\nWe achieved operating income of $104 million or $2.85 per share, an operating return on equity of 14.7%, and a combined ratio of 94.4%.\nOur robust underwriting performance demonstrates our ability to capitalize on emerging market opportunities while navigating the complexities of this dynamic underwriting landscape.\nFrom my viewpoint, there are two key takeaways from the Q2 results.\nFirstly, our growth has surpassed pre-COVID-19 levels in all segments.\nSecondly, we continue to achieve widespread profitability with strong underlying underwriting results across our businesses.\nLet me briefly elaborate on each of these points.\nRegarding growth, we saw a significant increase in premium across all business segments compared to Q1 this year.\nAll major segments now exceed pre-COVID-19 growth levels due to our disciplined pricing strategy, strong retention, and robust new business production metrics.\nOur strong relationships with agent partners provide opportunities for solid future growth as we focus on our most profitable market sectors and leverage cutting-edge technology platforms.\nWe're also enhancing our claims data and analytics sophistication, including real-time driving pattern and inflation monitoring tools.\nI'm more confident than ever in our ability to grow profitably.\nIn Personal Lines, we achieved 11.6% growth in the quarter, or 5% excluding prior year premium returns.\nOur continued growth momentum reflects sustained agent and customer interest in our account offerings, targeted pricing actions, strong market position, and ability to adapt to a competitive marketplace.\nWe grew our Commercial Lines business by 11.7%, driven by strong performance in our specialty portfolio and small commercial business, which benefited from economic recovery and our new quote-and-issue platform, TAP sales.\nWe're well-positioned to continue driving growth across all segments and expect mid- to high single-digit growth for the rest of the year.\nRegarding loss trends, we're still experiencing lower auto loss frequency, likely due to flexible working arrangements for many customers.\nOur data indicates reduced traffic and less congested rush hours in many areas as lingering pandemic effects.\nWe expect frequency to reach a new normal in 2021, potentially resulting in persistently lower accident frequency in certain areas given our mix and customer profile.\nThis benefit may be partially offset by increased severity from materials inflation and more severe accidents, including elevated fatalities.\nWe delivered strong Commercial Lines profitability, despite some elevated property losses in other commercial, which we don't believe are recurring or indicative of a trend.\nWe've been monitoring overall property large loss activity for several quarters and believe it aligns with market trends.\nWe see room for additional rate increases in property lines and remain prudent in our loss selections.\nWe're mindful of potential increased social inflation, medical information and treatment delays, and other inflationary trends.\nWe're closely watching the economic recovery, business activity acceleration, and court system reopening in many jurisdictions.\nWhile the impact and duration of inflation on our business remain uncertain, we believe our comparatively short reserve duration positions us well to manage potential exposure.\nWith this background, I'll share recent highlights by business, starting with Personal Lines.\nOur selective rate adjustments have been successful, as shown by sequential PIF growth of 1.8% in auto and 1.7% in home during the quarter.\nNew business growth exceeded expectations, with significant sequential improvement in retention.\nOur preferred customer focus and value-based approach provide competitive advantages as agents become more strategic with their Personal Lines models and carrier placement decisions.\nAccount business comprises over 85% of our book, leading to high retention and business stability.\nPersonal Lines retention improved by over two points in Q2 compared to Q1, demonstrating our agile approach and successful strategy in this dynamic environment.\nIn Personal Auto, we expect claims frequency to gradually approach new normal levels as the year progresses.\nWhile pricing remains competitive, we see clear signs that rate deceleration has bottomed out and the industry is looking to increase rates.\nThis aligns with historical Personal Lines pricing cycles, where Personal Auto rates adjust quickly to loss trends.\nWe believe we're well-positioned due to our prudent pricing strategy during the pandemic, requiring less significant rate increases and customer disruption in the near future.\nWe're gaining momentum with Hanover Prestige, our full account offering for customers with higher value homes, autos, and complex insurance needs.\nThis growing segment of the Personal Lines market further positions us as a strategic partner with agents.\nThe offering's contribution to overall growth increases each quarter, boosting Q2 new business growth by three points.\nIn Commercial Lines, we executed well on strategic priorities, posting 12% growth in Specialty and 11% in Core Commercial, driven by increased new business, rate increases, and exposure growth.\nStrong topline growth in Core Commercial is expected to continue, driven by economic reopening, continued rate increases, and the successful launch of TAP Sales, our small commercial quoting platform.\nIn Q2, we launched TAP Sales in nine additional states, bringing the total to 20, and we'll complete nationwide implementation for our first product, Business Owners Advantage, by year-end.\nThis multi-year investment delivers comprehensive capabilities, including a new agent front-end, new products and endorsements, new states, sophisticated pricing algorithms, a new policy administration system, and new self-service capabilities.\nIn states where TAP Sales was deployed in Q1, submissions significantly increased and our hit ratio improved.\nAgents have praised the product's ease of use and simplified quoting process, calling it best in market.\nEfficiency gains are substantial, enabling single location risk quoting and issuance in 50% less time than before.\nOur infrastructure modernization and capability enhancements are being realized as agents consolidate and acquire agencies with substantial small commercial books, forcing more strategic carrier partnerships.\nOur strategic focus, user-friendly tools, and diverse product range are enhancing agent efficiency and increasing our value to them\nWe're optimistic that our comprehensive offerings will drive further expansion and agency adoption in upcoming quarters\nWe also achieved significant growth in our Specialty segment\nWe saw double-digit growth in our Marine, E&S, and management liability lines during the quarter, which are among our most profitable sectors\nWe're also expanding our products and capabilities in financial institutions and retail E&S areas\nWe're advancing our total Hanover strategy by increasing the use of our specialty offerings across our Commercial Lines customer base\nAs agents offer more specialized products to clients, we expect our Specialty business to continue driving crucial growth\nWe're satisfied with the commercial rate environment and exposure trends in our markets\nWe implemented 6.5% rate increases in Core Commercial while maintaining strong retention at 84.9%\nWe continued applying double-digit rate increases in Commercial Auto and high single-digit increases in property, using detailed pricing segmentation and risk-based pricing and retention strategies\nExposure growth exceeded historical norms this quarter, which is promising for our future growth prospects\nWe achieved 8.5% rate increases in Specialty, up from 7.5% in the previous quarter\nSpecialty rates can vary quarter-to-quarter due to large account renewals and other unique factors, but overall pricing in our Specialty markets has been robust with increases outpacing loss trends\nSeveral factors support the strong rate environment in Commercial Lines, including potential social inflation, property loss pressures from materials costs, higher reinsurance costs, and low interest rates\nWe believe our focus on smaller accounts and unique offerings will protect us from significant pricing slowdowns that can occur in larger brokered accounts\nIn conclusion, our exceptional growth this quarter reflects the strong momentum across our business and sets the stage for continued profitable expansion\nWe're performing exceptionally well in an uncertain environment, leveraging our unique distribution capabilities, customer-focused strategies, disciplined underwriting and pricing, and diverse product offerings\nAs we enter the second half of the year, we're encouraged by our performance and confident in our ability to execute our strategy and capitalize on growth opportunities\nWe're incredibly proud of our team's efforts during this health crisis, fulfilling our commitments and maintaining or improving our service levels\nAs we drive our business forward for sustained profitable growth, we're being thoughtful and opportunistic, aiming to emerge as a better insurance company, employer, and corporate citizen\nWe're closely monitoring changing employment trends and practices, as well as employee preferences, to strengthen our culture, which has been a key competitive advantage in attracting and retaining talent\nWe've started inviting employees back to work voluntarily and plan to fully reopen our offices in the fall, health conditions permitting\nWe're planning to adopt a flexible hybrid model that will allow us to serve agents and customers effectively while providing employees with an engaging work environment for career growth\nThese are exciting times for those ready to embrace the challenge\nFor Q2, we reported net income of $128.5 million or $3.52 per diluted share, compared to $115.2 million or $3.01 per diluted share in Q2 2020\nAfter-tax operating income was $104 million or $2.85 per share, compared to $62.7 million or $1.63 per share in the prior year quarter\nThe difference between net and operating income is due to increased fair value of equity securities\nBook value per share rose 4.8% in the quarter, driven by earnings and increased unrealized gains in our fixed income portfolio\nWith widespread lockdowns last year, many business lines experienced historically low claim frequency\nWe refunded some premiums to auto policyholders due to reduced driving, affecting our reported net written premiums and underwriting ratios\nBusiness exposures, payrolls, and receipts were exceptionally low in 2020\nAs the economy reopens and people return to normal activities, we believe our recent growth trajectory and loss experience, along with our original 2021 expectations, are better indicators of our performance\nWe're pleased with our overall combined ratio of 94.4% in Q2 2021, compared to 96.2% in the prior year quarter, which included several large catastrophe events, including social unrest losses\nIn Q2 2021, we incurred catastrophe losses of $76.8 million or 6.5% of net earned premium, 40 basis points above our quarterly expectation, mainly due to severe weather events in the Midwest in June\nMichigan, our largest Personal Lines state, was heavily impacted by rain and flooding events in late June, particularly in homeowners insurance\nMichigan is typically very profitable for us with a low 90s combined ratio, but we do see losses during adverse weather events\nWe also experienced some favorable catastrophe development from prior years, demonstrating our prudent reserving approach\nPrior year reserve development, excluding catastrophes, was favorable, adding $12.6 million to the bottom line, mainly reflecting continued favorability in workers' compensation, Personal Auto, and several Specialty lines\nWe remain cautious in our Commercial Auto reserving due to extended loss patterns and prior bodily injury development\nGiven the pandemic's effect on 2020 loss patterns, we remain vigilant in assessing ultimate loss costs\nWith the economic recovery, we're mindful of potential reserving uncertainties related to social and economic inflation, delayed medical procedures and information, and ongoing court delays\nWe've focused on strengthening our balance sheet over recent years, and it's now stronger than it has been in a long time\nCOVID-19 related claims activity remains very manageable, and we're holding substantial IBNR in that area\nOur Q2 2021 expense ratio was 31.2%, in line with expectations and consistent with Q2 2020, improving from Q1 this year\nWe're confident we can achieve a 30 basis point expense ratio improvement for full year 2021\nOur overall current accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 89% in the quarter, reflecting our diverse business mix, earned rate increases, and some lingering frequency benefit in Auto Lines\nOur Commercial Lines combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 89.5%, up 2.7 points from Q2 last year, mainly due to comparison with an exceptionally low loss level in Q2 2020\nOur CMP current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 57.6%, consistent with recent trends but slightly higher than expected due to increased property large losses\nWe believe our experience aligns with industry trends, supporting our expectation for further property rate increases\nWe achieved substantial CMP property rate increases in Q2 and expect this trend to continue\nThe current accident year loss ratio for other Commercial Lines, excluding catastrophes, was 55.3%.\nA significant loss and associated reinstatement premium in our profitable Hanover Specialty Industrial business impacted this outcome.\nThe overall favorability in our specialty business during the quarter counterbalanced this particular loss, bringing total loss amounts generally in line with expectations.\nOur specialty industrial business consistently maintains a long-term combined ratio below 80%.\nWe are optimistic about our underwriting abilities and anticipate strong future performance in this sector.\nThe Commercial Auto current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, remains relatively stable compared to recent quarterly results.\nWe continue to implement substantial rate increases to address industry-wide liability issues affecting this line over multiple years.\nShifting focus to workers' compensation.\nThe current accident year loss ratio was 61.5%, which aligns with recent historical outcomes.\nOur second quarter 2020 ratio was unusually low due to widespread stay-at-home orders across the country.\nWhile underlying trends in this line remain largely positive, we maintain a cautious approach to our loss picks considering the rate environment and potential new risks associated with office reopenings for certain businesses.\nCommercial Lines net written premiums experienced exceptional growth of 11.7% in the second quarter, driven by our small commercial and Specialty businesses.\nWe achieved strong operational metrics, including improved rates, significant increases in exposures, a return to robust new business growth, and a solid core commercial retention of 84.9%.\nOverall, despite some minor and anticipated variability in losses, we are very pleased with Commercial Lines trends and underwriting returns for the quarter.\nShifting to Personal Lines.\nOur combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was quite low at 85.3%, but increased from 76.8% in the same period last year, reflecting the benefit of COVID-19 related auto claims frequency reductions.\nOur Personal Lines auto current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 62.2%, below historical trends but slightly up from 60% in the first quarter.\nWhile industry-wide frequency trends are rapidly approaching historical norms, our business still benefits slightly from lower frequency.\nWe anticipate a modest long-term frequency benefit due to changing driving patterns resulting from work-from-home flexibility among our customer base.\nWe are closely monitoring these trends and continue to effectively manage the balance between growth, rate, and profitability.\nThe current accident year loss ratio in our homeowners line remained relatively consistent with prior results but slightly exceeded our expectations.\nElevated property loss activity and higher material costs indicate the need for future rate increases.\nWe are observing a significant push for rate increases in homeowners within the independent agency space.\nPersonal Lines net written premiums grew 11.6% in the quarter, or 5% when adjusted for last year's premium returns.\nThis strong result was driven by a significant acceleration in new business.\nWe also regained momentum in our renewal premiums due to lower rate increases in certain areas and improved retention.\nThe strength of our data and analytics team and swift communication of market trends across our businesses allows us to opportunistically grow when market conditions are favorable and make well-informed adjustments when necessary.\nWe are pleased to see Personal Lines largely return to its pre-COVID-19 growth levels.\nWe have complete confidence in Personal Lines' strong growth and profitability prospects.\nTurning to investment performance.\nOur net investment income was $75.6 million for the quarter, an increase of $17.9 million or 31% from the prior year period.\nThis is primarily due to an unusual fluctuation in partnership income between periods.\nNet investment income in the second quarter of 2020 was negatively impacted by a $4.6 million loss on limited partnerships, while partnership income in the second quarter of 2021 was $16 million, surpassing our expectations by $9 million.\nOur partnership results for the first half of 2021 do not alter our outlook for investment partnerships or overall net investment income for the remainder of the year.\nNew money yields continue to exert pressure on our overall net investment income.\nHowever, we have been able to significantly offset this with robust cash flows from operations.\nWe anticipate cash generation from our underwriting operations to remain strong.\nCash and invested assets at the end of the second quarter totaled $9.1 billion, with fixed income securities and cash representing 85% of the total.\nOur fixed maturity investment portfolio has a duration of five years and is 96% investment grade.\nWe maintain a high-quality portfolio with a weighted average rating of A plus.\nNet unrealized gains on the fixed maturity portfolio at the end of the second quarter 2021 were $357.8 million before taxes.\nRegarding our equity and capital position.\nOur book value per share of $88.23 reflects a 4.8% increase in the quarter.\nWe continue to be responsible stewards of our shareholders' capital and deliver on our capital allocation strategy.\nThrough July 26, 2021, we repurchased approximately $10 million of stock, leaving about $395 million of capacity under our stock repurchase authorization, which the Board expanded in May.\nAdditionally, during the quarter, we paid a regular cash dividend of approximately $25 million.\nOur capital priorities remain unchanged.\nFirstly, we aim to maintain our strong capitalization and liquidity; secondly, we continue to prioritize organic growth, for which we generate ample capital; and thirdly, we maintain our policy of returning excess capital to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases.\nWe will continue to remain flexible and actively manage our capital with shareholders' best interests in mind.\nLooking ahead, we now anticipate net written premium growth in the mid- to high single digits in the second half of the year.\nBased on our strong results in the first half of the year, we believe upper mid-single-digit growth for the full year is achievable.\nWith two quarters of better-than-expected ex-CAT combined ratio performance, we are improving our full year 2021 ex-CAT combined ratio outlook from 90% to 91% to 89% to 90%.\nAs mentioned earlier, we remain on track to reduce our expense ratio by at least 30 basis points in 2021 to 31.3%, and we expect our third quarter cat load to be 5.2%.\nWe are very pleased with our underlying performance and our ability to maintain our positive momentum in the quarter.\nWe are well-positioned to sustain our robust growth momentum and top quartile profitability, delivering value to our agents, customers, and shareholders.\nFurthermore, we are excited to announce that we will be hosting a Virtual Investor Day on September 23, where we will discuss the key aspects of our differentiated strategy, future growth drivers, and long-range financial targets.\nWe will provide additional details in the coming weeks and look forward to your participation.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The Toro Company achieved record-breaking results for the third quarter.\nWe experienced strong demand across both our Professional and Residential divisions, and our operations team excelled despite global supply chain difficulties affecting product availability.\nOur staff and channel partners remained focused on meeting customer needs.\nConsequently, overall net sales for the third quarter increased by 16% compared to the previous year.\nThe Professional segment's net sales grew by 15%, marking the second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for this division.\nWe observed ongoing strength in landscape contractor and golf markets globally.\nThere were increased pre-season deliveries of BOSS snow and ice management products, along with high demand for our rental and specialty construction equipment and Ventrac products.\nOur range of innovative products, coupled with strong business confidence, fueled robust demand.\nResidential segment net sales increased by 23%, building upon a 38% growth rate in the third quarter of the previous year.\nThe quarter's growth was driven by strong retail demand for our zero-turn and walk power mowers.\nCustomers continued to respond positively to our all-season Flex-Force 60-volt product line, which offers power and durability without compromising performance.\nOur recent efforts to introduce innovative new products, revamp marketing, and expand mass retail distribution have strengthened the Toro brand and yielded positive outcomes.\nAs mentioned in the previous quarter, we anticipated supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures to intensify faster than could be fully mitigated in the short term through pricing and other actions.\nDespite these challenges, both segments achieved solid earnings growth in the third quarter, with Professional earnings increasing by 7.6% and Residential earnings rising by 10.5%.\nI will now discuss some of the key themes for the quarter.\nFirstly, we continue to observe robust and widespread demand across our global markets.\nThis has been driven by consumer and business confidence, as well as customer investment priorities focused on outdoor environments.\nWe continue to capitalize on these drivers through our commitment to investing in new product development, our industry-leading distribution, and our talented teams.\nSecondly, there was a continued escalation of global supply chain and inflationary challenges.\nThis included component availability constraints as well as material, freight, and wage-related cost increases.\nOur operations team took extraordinary measures to enable us to source and produce as effectively as possible in this incredibly dynamic environment.\nWe also continued to execute our productivity and synergy initiatives, demonstrated disciplined expense control, and implemented market-aligned pricing actions.\nRegardless of how long these pressures persist, we remain focused on managing the factors within our control.\nThirdly, in line with general economic trends, we experienced an increasingly challenging labor market, including wage pressures and workforce availability limitations in some of our manufacturing locations.\nAcross the enterprise, we have talented and dedicated teams committed to serving our customers.\nWe're focused on having the workforce and other resources in place to put ourselves in the best position to meet demand and deliver our products to the right places at the right time.\nOur innovative product portfolio, outstanding team, and deep relationships with our channel partners and end customers set us apart and position us well for long-term growth.\nWe have the financial capacity to invest in the future and we continue to allocate capital to best drive value for all stakeholders.\nThis fiscal year, we've made strategic investments in key technologies, both organically and through acquisitions, to advance our priority areas of alternative power, smart, connected, and autonomous solutions.\nOur healthy cash flow has also allowed us to return capital to shareholders while maintaining ample liquidity.\nLooking ahead, we will continue to execute our enterprise strategic priorities of accelerating profitable growth, driving productivity and operational excellence, and empowering people.\nI'll discuss our outlook further following Renee's more detailed review of our financial results.\nAs Rick mentioned, our record results for the third quarter were driven by robust demand in both our professional and residential segments.\nAgainst the backdrop of increasing supply chain, inflation, and labor pressures.\nWe increased net sales for the quarter by 16.2% to $976.8 million.\nReported earnings per share was $0.89 per diluted share, up from $0.82 last year, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.92 per diluted share, up 12.2% from $0.82 in the prior year.\nBoth of our segments achieved record top and bottom line third quarter results.\nProfessional segment net sales increased by 15.2% to $718.5 million.\nThis growth was driven by widespread demand in landscape contractor, golf, snow and ice management, rental and specialty construction, and Ventrac products.\nThis was slightly offset by lower sales of underground construction equipment due to supply chain disruptions that affected product availability.\nThe Professional segment's earnings increased by 7.6% to $122.3 million in the third quarter.\nWhen calculated as a percentage of net sales, there was a decrease of 120 basis points to 17%.\nThis decline was primarily attributed to increased material and freight expenses, partially mitigated by net price adjustments and efficiency enhancements.\nThe Residential segment's net sales grew by 23% to $252.1 million in the third quarter.\nThis growth was mainly due to high retail demand for zero-turn and walk power mowers.\nEarnings for the Residential segment rose by 10.5% to $31.5 million in the quarter, but when expressed as a percentage of net sales, it fell by 140 basis points to 12.5%.\nThis reduction was primarily caused by the same factors affecting the Professional segment.\nLet's examine our operational results for the quarter.\nWe reported a gross margin of 33.9%, which is a 110 basis point decrease compared to the same period last year.\nThe adjusted gross margin was 33.9%, showing a 130 basis point decline on a comparative basis.\nThese reductions were largely due to the same factors that impacted Professional and Residential earnings.\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales for the quarter increased by 20 basis points to 21.4%.\nThis rise was mainly due to more normalized spending compared to the third quarter of last year and a legal settlement in this year's third quarter.\nOperating earnings as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter decreased by 130 basis points to 12.5%.\nAdjusted operating earnings as a percentage of net sales fell by 80 basis points to 13.1%.\nInterest expenses decreased by $1.3 million to $7 million for the quarter, due to lower debt levels and reduced interest rates.\nThe reported effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18%, while the adjusted effective tax rate was 19.3%.\nNow, let's look at the balance sheet and cash flow.\nAccounts receivable amounted to $301.2 million, a 2.2% decrease from last year, primarily due to changes in channel mix.\nInventory remained relatively unchanged from last year at $665.6 million.\nHowever, finished goods inventory was significantly lower due to strong retail demand, while work-in-process inventory was higher.\nThis reflected supply chain variability and our efforts to secure higher levels of key components when available.\nAccounts payable increased by 53% from last year to $411.4 million.\nThis was mainly due to the timing of purchases and more normalized spending compared to last year.\nYear-to-date free cash flow was $429 million with a conversion ratio of 123%.\nThis positive performance was largely due to higher earnings and lower working capital, primarily driven by increased payables.\nAt the end of the quarter, our liquidity remained at $1.1 million.\nThis included $535 million in cash and cash equivalents and full availability under our $600 million revolving credit facility.\nOur cash balances are higher than pre-pandemic levels, mainly due to our desire to ensure adequate liquidity at the start of the pandemic.\nOur cash position was further strengthened by accelerated demand and related working capital impacts.\nOver the past nine months, we utilized the majority of cash generated year-to-date, including funding the Turflynx and Left Hand Robotics acquisitions, increasing our regular dividend with $85 million paid out so far this year, resuming share repurchases with $177 million through the third quarter, and paying down $100 million in debt.\nWe also increased our capital expenditure budget, reflecting our commitment to invest in key technologies and ensure we have the capacity to meet future demand.\nWe maintain a disciplined approach to our capital allocation strategy, supported by our strong balance sheet.\nOur priorities remain unchanged and include reinvesting in our businesses to support sustainable long-term growth both organically and through acquisitions, returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and maintaining our leverage goals to support financial flexibility.\nAs we enter the final quarter of our fiscal year, we are benefiting from strong demand momentum and our leadership position in the markets we serve.\nAt the same time, customer demand continues to exceed supply and production capabilities.\nWe are not immune to the challenges facing companies worldwide and remain focused on serving our customers, succeeding in our markets, and managing the factors within our control.\nWe previously indicated that operational challenges would be most significant in the third quarter.\nDue to the collective efforts of our team to meet additional demand, we were able to deliver stronger third quarter results than anticipated.\nThis resulted in lower finished goods inventory heading into the fourth quarter.\nWe are committed to obtaining necessary resources to boost production despite challenges in supply chains, inflation, and labor.\nWe are revising our financial projections for the 2021 fiscal year.\nOur revised forecast indicates a net sales increase of approximately 17%, an improvement from the previous estimate of 12% to 15%.\nWe expect the Professional segment to grow at a rate comparable to the company's overall growth, while the Residential segment is projected to outpace it.\nWe now anticipate that the overall adjusted operating earnings as a percentage of net sales for the entire year will be comparable to fiscal 2020.\nWe anticipate that the professional segment's operating margins will be similar to the previous year.\nWe project that Residential margins will decrease compared to last year, but will still remain significantly above historical averages.\nThis projection takes into account our volume leverage and strong operational performance to date, balanced against increasing pressures from supply chains, inflation, and labor costs.\nWe are actively implementing measures to mitigate these market challenges.\nBased on our current outlook, we now project full-year adjusted earnings per share to range between $3.53 and $3.57 per diluted share, an increase from our previous estimate of $3.45 to $3.55.\nThis upward revision in earnings per share guidance reflects our strong performance year-to-date, robust demand, and continued solid business execution, while also considering the previously mentioned challenges.\nOverall, we are well-positioned to capitalize on this period of profitable growth as we continue to execute our long-term strategic priorities.\nThe guidance just presented reflects ongoing strong demand across our markets and our current operational outlook.\nWe are monitoring global key demand drivers for the remainder of this fiscal year and into fiscal 2022, including consumer and business confidence levels, COVID-19 developments, customer prioritization of outdoor environment maintenance and improvement, continued strong momentum in golf, and government support for infrastructure investments.\nThese market factors are expected to drive strong demand in the fourth quarter and into next year.\nOur primary challenge remains our production capacity to meet retail demand across all markets given the current operating environment.\nWe anticipate that constraints will begin to ease as we see improvements in key material and component availability, logistics channels, and other COVID-related factors.\nOur operations team is committed to doing everything possible to meet increased production requirements and grow market share in this challenging environment.\nAs operating constraints begin to ease, we expect to be in a better position to replenish field inventory from our current historically low levels.\nWe continue to focus on driving productivity and synergies, carefully managing expenses, and implementing market-based pricing actions when appropriate.\nWe are well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities due to our strong cash flow, market leadership, investments in innovation, and trusted relationships.\nRecent examples highlighting our commitment to innovation and relationships include receiving a Partner of the Year Award from Tractor Supply Company for the second consecutive year, this time as an omnichannel partner.\nGreen Industry Pros selected three of our products for their 2021 Editor's Choice Award, citing innovation and utility as factors.\nIn August, two of our rental and specialty construction offerings received Editor's Choice Awards from Rental magazine.\nThe International Sustainable Irrigation Expo recently recognized our Aqua-Traxx Azul micro-irrigation solution as a new product of the year.\nOur innovative products have been showcased at recent high-profile events, including the Euro Cup Championship, the Open Championship, and this summer's events in Tokyo.\nOur mission to deliver superior innovation and customer care is deeply rooted in our purpose of helping customers enhance the beauty, productivity, and sustainability of the land.\nOur long-standing focus on sustainability extends to our communities, where we have a strong legacy of giving back.\nWe recently partnered with Better Futures, an organization that supports formerly incarcerated men and Minnesota's environment, by donating equipment and training resources.\nOn a national level, we've collaborated with the American Rental Association Foundation on a community impact project to improve green spaces across the US.\nThese examples illustrate how our company and employees give back, promote sustainability, and support our customers and communities, which is integral to our culture and identity.\nAs we conclude fiscal 2021 and enter 2022, we remain optimistic while acknowledging the ongoing dynamic environment.\nWe believe our updated guidance appropriately reflects both the risks and opportunities we face.\nOur businesses have strong fundamentals and momentum, positioning us well to capitalize on future growth.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Scott Wells, CEO of Clear Channel Outdoor Americas, will join the Q&A session.\nManagement's expectations, beliefs and projections about performance are presented and represent their current views.\nThere is no guarantee that management's expectations, beliefs or projections will be realized or that actual outcomes won't differ from expectations.\nWe will present certain non-GAAP performance metrics during today's call.\nThese provide detailed information on foreign exchange impacts, non-cash compensation expenses, segment revenues, adjusted EBITDA, and other key data.\nWe request that you look at each slide as William and Brian discuss them.\nThis marks our third quarter hosting the call remotely.\nWe kindly ask for your patience in case of any technical difficulties during the call.\nMany of us have experienced an unprecedented year, and like you, we continue to feel the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations.\nHowever, the past quarter has demonstrated the resilience of our business and its ability to rebound quickly when some semblance of normalcy returns.\nOur third quarter consolidated revenue exceeded expectations, with reported revenue declining 32% year-over-year, a significant improvement from the 55% drop reported in the second quarter.\nExcluding China and currency effects, the decline would have been 27%, surpassing our early August guidance of a low 30% decrease.\nOur European performance surpassed expectations and showcased the strength of our medium.\nAs people returned to the streets, advertisers came back to our platforms.\nThe US market also showed gradual improvement, aligning with our projections.\nConcurrently, we continued to implement measures to align our operating costs with revenue.\nConsidering the pandemic, the third quarter results, particularly in Europe, were encouraging.\nWe are utilizing our investments in digital displays, technology, and our network to navigate the crisis and maintain flexibility amid the uncertainty as governments across our markets address ongoing COVID-19 challenges.\nOur commitment to long-term growth investments is evident in our recent successful bid for advertising rights in New York and New Jersey airports.\nWe are thrilled and honored to have secured this significant contract, and I commend Scott Wells and his team for their achievement.\nI will provide more details about the contract and its value to our business later.\nLooking ahead, based on current information, we anticipate a slight sequential improvement in Americas revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter.\nHowever, we are unable to provide fourth quarter guidance for our European segment.\nRecent mobility restrictions in our European markets, particularly in the UK and France over the past 10 days, have created volatility in customer booking activity, significantly limiting our visibility.\nI am proud of our team's exceptional work in reinforcing our strong foundation and driving operational efficiencies amid rapidly changing business conditions.\nNext, I will provide an overview of our business, the current landscape, and our outlook for the out-of-home market.\nPlease refer to Page 4.\nIn the Americas segment, year-over-year revenue declined 32% in the quarter, an improvement from the 39% drop reported in the second quarter.\nOur Americas business focuses on the top 20 markets, which drove significant growth up to and including the first quarter of this year before COVID-19.\nAlthough our audience levels are returning to normal, the largest markets in the top 20 are most affected by advertisers reducing out-of-home spending, especially on the East and West Coast, where national advertisers tend to concentrate.\nPlease turn to Page 5.\nEuropean reported revenue decreased 13% year-over-year, and excluding foreign exchange effects, it declined 18%, which is a substantial improvement from the 62% drop in the second quarter.\nThe improvement in digital, accounting for about 30% of European revenue and declining 17% excluding currency effects, was even more significant due to advertisers' ability to quickly launch campaigns as business resumed after lockdowns eased.\nAs I've mentioned before, our investment in digital is a crucial part of our strategy.\nOur digital network is a dynamic medium that allows advertisers to engage in real-time, tactical, contextual, and flexible advertising.\nI want to highlight the strength of our sales team across Europe, who have responded with agility.\nAs markets reopened, our audiences began moving around again, and advertiser interest returned.\nWe also benefited from our strategic focus on roadside locations, which historically account for about two-thirds of our total European revenue and are less affected by COVID-19 restrictions than transit environments, which represent approximately 10% of our European revenue.\nOur UK business exemplified this, with about 80% of revenue historically coming from roadside inventory.\nFrom mid-July until the recent announcements of new restrictions, our customer booking activity actually surpassed bookings made in the same period last year.\nMoving to Page 6 and the Americas business.\nWith an improving outlook in the Americas, we remain cautiously optimistic for the near term.\nOur long-term focus remains on returning to growth, which we believe we can achieve in 2021.\nAs we enter the fourth quarter, our visibility remains limited.\nHowever, we have shifted from a defensive to an offensive strategy, leveraging the investments we've made and continue to make in technology.\nDespite the uncertainty created by recent COVID-19 spikes, we believe our organization is better positioned to manage through market instability.\nIn light of this instability, we have expanded our client-direct selling initiatives.\nWe are focusing on selling creative ideas rather than specific billboard locations.\nAs advertisers realign their campaigns, we've found that CMOs are more willing to join a Zoom call to hear a great idea.\nOur ability to get a foot in the door is constantly improving.\nWe continue to demonstrate to advertisers how our RADAR suite of solutions can help them.\nWhile audience levels are returning to normal, travel patterns have changed.\nPeople are spending more time close to home and less time in city centers, but they're still out and about.\nWith RADAR, we can quickly adjust to these new travel patterns to help our customers understand the best inventory and roadways to reach their target audience, target those customers via mobile ads, and measure campaign success.\nMore specifically, in the fourth quarter, we are seeing continued sequential improvements in our business.\nFor the first time since March, we've outperformed comparisons in several weeks so far this quarter.\nIn our national business, the number of RFPs is improving and approaching 2019 levels.\nLocal business continues to improve, and we are seeing continued strength in our permanent inventory.\nWe're currently in the renewal season, and most clients are keeping their locations.\nHowever, we are still waiting for more data to better understand the strength of the holiday season compared to previous years, as advertisers continue to delay buying decisions.\nOur largest category, business services, is holding up well and performing at levels equal to last year.\nWe are seeing increases in beverages, with continued weakness in amusements and entertainment.\nAdditionally, revenue generated by our programmatic platform has rebounded faster than the rest of our business, although programmatic still represents a small percentage of total revenue.\nMoving to Page 7 for a review of Americas technology initiatives and new contracts.\nDuring the past quarter, we continued to invest in technology and our digital footprint in America.\nWe added 19 new digital billboards this quarter, bringing the total to 57 new digital billboards this year, giving us more than 1,400 digital billboards in total.\nWe also partnered with Tremor Video to enhance our RADAR offering, which now provides advertisers a coordinated out-of-home and all-screen video solution that seamlessly extends into TV, digital, or social video campaigns to reach consumers when and where they're ready to engage with brands.\nThis is the latest enhancement to the RADAR suite, and we expect to continue adding customer-friendly capabilities to RADAR in the coming months.\nOur data analytics capabilities have expanded with the introduction of a new audience impressions methodology for airport advertising, developed in collaboration with Geopath. This innovation provides advertisers with a more accurate understanding of consumer advertising journeys and behaviors in airports.\nThe new approach shifts from measuring campaigns solely on passenger count to a more comprehensive understanding of audience behavior and likelihood of exposure to airport advertising, utilizing the same Geopath data used for traditional roadside out-of-home advertising measurement.\nAdvertisers will be able to access this data through both Geopath and RADAR.\nWe are pleased to announce that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Board has awarded us the largest airport advertising contract in the US, allowing us to transform JFK, LaGuardia, Newark and Stewart airports into state-of-the-art digital media platforms.\nThis significant win demonstrates our confidence in our business fundamentals and our focus on long-term profitable growth opportunities beyond the temporary impact of the pandemic.\nThe 12-year contract is subject to execution by both parties, which we expect to occur in mid-November.\nWe anticipate the contract will become effective on December 30, 2020.\nWe collaborated with the Port Authority to create contract terms that align our interests and enable both parties to achieve their goals under current conditions and in the future, potentially establishing a new industry standard.\nThe agreement includes a two-year transition period to account for COVID-19's impact and traffic recovery at Port Authority airports.\nThe actual Minimum Annual Guarantee (MAG) and capital expenditure after the transition period will be based on total passenger traffic.\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey airports serve as gateways to the world.\nAs the region and travel industry recover, we believe our team is best equipped to lead this historic transformation.\nBy adding these high-value, prominent airport assets to our portfolio, brands will have the unique opportunity to execute comprehensive campaigns reaching consumers as they drive, walk, or fly throughout the New York and New Jersey metropolitan area.\nIn Europe, we are observing varied performances across our markets due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases.\nHistorically, about two-thirds of our revenue in the region comes from roadside displays.\nIn October, we continued to see strength in our street furniture and billboard inventory, as audiences were still present on the streets.\nWhile transit advertising remained weak, our largest categories, FMCG and retail, showed sequential improvement.\nFashion and beauty advertising are also benefiting from the holiday season.\nHowever, visibility into November and December has been affected by the spike in new cases and new restrictions, causing some advertisers to pause their activities.\nWe are closely monitoring the recent developments regarding the second wave of COVID-19 in Europe.\nAlthough the new restrictions and uncertain environment will impact our business in the near term, they are not expected to last as long or be as limiting in terms of movement as those we experienced in March and April.\nConsequently, we believe the second wave will have a less significant impact on revenue in the fourth quarter compared to the second quarter.\nMore importantly, the resilience of the business is evident.\nWhen audiences return, out-of-home advertising rebounds strongly.\nIn the UK and other markets, we've seen bookings equal to or better than the previous year in many weeks during the past quarter.\nIn Europe, we continue to assist brands in navigating the audience and environmental impact of changing COVID-19 restrictions through the application of smart data.\nFor example, the UK's Return Audience Hub has become a popular planning tool for advertisers.\nThe hub monitors a vast anonymized mobile data set to learn and openly share how our portfolio is delivering audiences compared to pre-lockdown levels.\nClear Channel RADAR is now operational in both Spain and the UK, enhancing our ability to help brands effectively engage audiences as mobility patterns evolve.\nWe are seeing early benefits from our implementation of RADAR.\nFor instance, in Spain, we've booked campaigns for PepsiCo using proximity to stores and more targeted audience demographic and behavioral data, allowing us to respond to new audience behaviors and mobility patterns resulting from COVID-19.\nWe continue to expand our digital footprint, adding 383 digital displays in the third quarter and 699 year-to-date, bringing our total to over 15,000 screens now live.\nAs we expand our digital reach across European cities, we are well-positioned to offer increased flexibility and enhanced contextual relevance at scale, improving our ability to meet brands' needs.\nThis is evidenced by the improving digital revenue trend in the third quarter.\nThroughout our digital transformation, we are committed to making Clear Channel inventory more accessible to both new and existing advertisers.\nAs in the US, we are developing our programmatic capabilities at an accelerated pace while securing and expanding partnerships with leading supply-side platform partners.\nRecently, in Spain, we successfully ran our first fully programmatic campaign for car brand Cupra in partnership with SSP Broadsign Reach.\nBroadsign Reach is already live across Holland and Switzerland.\nIn the UK, we just announced a new programmatic partnership with SSP Hivestack.\nAcross Clear Channel Outdoor, we strive to create products and provide services that excite and engage our consumers, communities, advertisers, and business partners.\nAs a result, we believe we are well-positioned to return to growth in 2021.\nAt the same time, we recognize the pressures of the current environment and will continue to take steps to preserve liquidity, including balancing the need to defer capital expenditures and reduce costs while still investing in strengthening our platform.\nConsolidated revenue for the quarter decreased 31.5% from last year to $448 million.\nAdjusting for foreign exchange, it was down 33.1%.\nExcluding China and adjusting for foreign exchange, the decline in revenue was 27%, which was better than the low 30% decline we had projected in early August.\nOur better-than-expected results are due to a stronger than anticipated rebound in Europe.\nConsolidated net loss declined $77 million to $136 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $212 million in the third quarter of 2019.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $31 million in the quarter, down 78.4% and excluding FX, was down 78.9%.\nThe Americas revenue was down 31.8% during the third quarter from $328 million in 2019 to $224 million.\nThis is an improvement over the second quarter results, which were down 39%.\nRevenue declines in national and local, as well as digital, improved relative to the second quarter, while the decline in airports increased.\nIn general, our airport inventory is considered premium space.\nWhile advertisers did not immediately reduce airport advertising campaigns at the beginning of the second quarter, they began pulling ads in the latter half of the quarter and into the third quarter.\nLocal, which accounted for 64% of revenue was down 27.6%, and national, which accounted for 36% of revenue was down 38.2%.\nDigital accounted for 30% of revenue and was down 34.8%.\nThis compares to a 53.7% decline in the second quarter.\nOur long-term contracts for print large format billboards, which we refer to as perms, continue to hold up well, even though total print ad revenue was down.\nBoth direct expenses and SG&A were down 19% in the quarter, primarily due to lower site lease expenses and lower compensation costs, as a result of the decline in revenue and cost reduction initiatives.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $71 million, down 48% from the prior year.\nAs we have stated previously, our business has high fixed costs, and although we are working on reducing expenses throughout the organization, the decline in revenue resulted in a larger reduction in adjusted EBITDA.\nTurn to Page 12 for a review of Europe's performance.\nEurope's revenue declined by 13.4%.\nRevenue decreased by 17.9% in the third quarter when excluding foreign exchange effects.\nThis represents a significant improvement from the 62% drop reported in the second quarter, with all markets contributing to the recovery.\nFrance experienced growth in the quarter due to the new Paris street furniture contract and a partial recovery in the underlying market.\nDigital revenue made up 30% of total revenue, which fell by 16.6% excluding foreign exchange, slightly less than the overall decline.\nAdjusted direct operating expenses and SG&A expenses decreased by 8.9%.\nThe decrease is attributed to reduced site lease expenses and lower compensation costs, primarily related to the revenue decline and cost-cutting measures.\nAdjusted EBITDA showed a loss of $8 million, resulting from the revenue decline and high fixed cost base.\nIn August, we issued senior secured notes through our indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, Clear Channel International BV (CCI B.V.), with the net proceeds providing additional liquidity for our operations.\nOur European segment comprises the businesses operated by CCI B.V. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe revenue for our Europe segment is equivalent to CCI B.V.'s revenue. Europe segment adjusted EBITDA excludes an allocation of CCI B.V.'s corporate expenses that are subtracted from CCI B.V.'s operating income and adjusted EBITDA.\nAs mentioned, Europe and CCI B.V. revenue fell by $34 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, which was $217 million.\nAfter adjusting for an $11 million impact from foreign exchange rate movements, Europe and CCI B.V. revenue decreased by $45 million.\nCCI B.V. reported an operating loss of $38 million in the third quarter of 2020, compared to a $16 million operating loss in the same period of 2019.\nLet's move to Page 13 for a brief overview of other segments.\nOur other segment includes Latin America and Clear Media.\nThe 2019 results include Clear Media, which was sold in Q2 of 2020.\nLatin America's revenue was $7 million in the third quarter, a $15 million decrease from the previous year.\nThe COVID-19 surge in Latin America began later in the year, and controlling the virus spread is taking longer in the region.\nDirect operating expenses and SG&A were $13 million in the third quarter, a $4 million reduction from the previous year.\nAdjusted EBITDA showed a loss for the quarter.\nLet's proceed to Page 14 to discuss capital expenditures.\nCapital expenditures totaled $26 million in the third quarter, a $34 million decrease from the previous year, as we actively reduced our capital spending to maintain liquidity and divested our stake in Clear Media.\nDespite this significant reduction, we continued to invest in digital technology in key locations, adding 19 new digital billboards in the US and 383 new digital displays in Europe.\nPlease turn to Page 15.\nClear Channel Outdoor's consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled $845 million as of September 30, 2020, including $417 million held outside the US by our subsidiaries.\nDuring the third quarter, we transferred a portion of the Clear Media sale proceeds to the US.\nOur debt stood at $5.6 billion, an increase of just over $500 million during the year, resulting from drawing on our cash flow revolver at the end of March and issuing the CCI B.V. notes in August.\nCash paid for interest on the debt during the third quarter was $147 million, slightly higher than the previous year due to interest payment timing, partially offset by lower interest rates.\nThe company anticipates approximately $21 million in cash interest payments for the fourth quarter of 2020, and $350 million in 2021, including interest on the new CCI B.V. secure notes, with the first payment due in April 2021.\nLet's move on to Page 16.\nAs William mentioned, we continue to focus on managing our cost base and enhancing our liquidity and financial flexibility, while driving improvements in top-line trends to return the business to its pre-COVID trajectory.\nThis includes proactive steps to right-size the business.\nIn addition to the temporary cost-saving measures implemented in the second quarter, we've also initiated restructuring plans throughout the company.\nThese plans are expected to generate annualized pre-tax savings of approximately $32 million upon completion, with total charges ranging from $23 million to $26 million to achieve these savings.\nWhile we remain confident the business will return to pre-COVID levels, we still lack visibility on timing.\nGiven the uncertainty, we deemed it prudent to take appropriate steps to align the cost base with the current business environment.\nAdditionally, during the third quarter, as previously discussed, we issued $375 million in senior secured notes in August through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary CCI B.V.\nWe continue negotiating site lease contracts with landlords and municipalities to better align fixed site lease expenses with revenue reductions.\nWe generated rent abatements of $24 million during the third quarter and $53 million year-to-date.\nWe continue to benefit from compensation cost reductions through actions enacted in the second quarter, most of which are temporary.\nWe obtained European government support and wage subsidies of $7 million in the third quarter and $15 million year-to-date.\nWe eliminated and reduced certain discretionary expenses.\nWe deferred capital expenditures, as mentioned earlier, and we deferred site lease expenses and other payments to optimize working capital levels.\nFrom a liquidity standpoint, based on current knowledge, we believe we have sufficient liquidity, including the $845 million cash at quarter-end, to fund the business needs as the economy and our operations recover.\nPlease turn to Page 17.\nAs William mentioned, we expect to see a slight improvement in revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin for the Americas on a sequential basis.\nIn Europe, we saw strong sequential improvement in the third quarter.\nHowever, our visibility for the fourth quarter has been impacted by recent mobility restrictions in some of our largest European markets, particularly in the UK and France.\nThese restrictions have created volatility in customer booking activity, significantly limiting our visibility and ability to provide guidance.\nAs mentioned, our team continues to work exceptionally hard through this challenging environment, and we are seeing the results of our efforts.\nWe're encouraged by advertisers returning to our inventory in the last quarter, demonstrating the resilience of our medium and the value of our locations.\nThey're benefiting from our continued investments in technology and expansion of our digital footprint, and we're proud of securing new contracts, especially winning the New York and New Jersey Port Authority airports.\nWe remain focused on the strong medium and long-term opportunities within our sector and are confident Clear Channel is well-positioned to capitalize on these improving trends.\nTo conclude my remarks, I want to reiterate a few points.\nFirst, as Brian mentioned, the actions we took earlier in the year provide what we believe to be sufficient liquidity to manage through the pandemic, even with the spikes we've seen in the US and Europe.\nSecond, we will continue to identify both temporary and permanent cost reductions to better align our expenses with the current economic environment and expand on our restructuring plans.\nThird, in the third quarter, we delivered better-than-expected results, with a strong rebound in Europe demonstrating the underlying resilience of our business.\nIn recent weeks, in both some European markets and the US, we have at times equaled or bettered prior year performance.\nWhen infection rates decline and restrictions are lifted and our audience returns, our markets recover.\nLooking ahead, the course of the pandemic remains unclear with the second wave in Europe and continued uncertainty in the US.\nAlthough we expect the next few quarters to remain challenging, we believe in the underlying fundamentals of our industry and our business.\nAs both Brian and I stated, given the resilience of our team, investments in our business, and strength of our platform, we expect to deliver a slight sequential improvement in Americas revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter.\nWe are not providing fourth quarter guidance for Europe, given the recent mobility restrictions creating significant volatility in our booking activity.\nHowever, we remain cautiously optimistic that we will return to growth in 2021.\nLastly, as we've stated before, we always remain open to dispositions and opportunities that accelerate our path to creating enhanced value for shareholders.\nHowever, given the current economic environment, our focus remains on continuing to own, operate and enhance the value of the current portfolio of assets to drive shareholder value as the economies rebound.\nI look forward to providing updates regarding our progress.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We thank you for joining us and hope you are safe and healthy.\nWe are happy with the strong beginning of 2021 and ongoing recovery in our car and industrial sectors.\nThe GPC team remained committed to effective execution and delivering strong financial outcomes through improving sales patterns, increasing operational efficiency and enhancing value for customers.\nThroughout the quarter, we operated carefully with our employees' physical and mental wellbeing as the top priority, as our over 50,000 GPC team members are crucial to our success.\nLet's now review our first quarter financial results.\nTotal revenue for the quarter was $4.5 billion, a 9% increase from last year and a significant improvement from the 1% sales decline in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nGross margin was also positive, marking our 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin growth, and our field teams continued to excel at managing our expenses through ongoing cost measures and the continuation of expense reductions implemented last year.\nThese outcomes led to a 41% increase in operating profit and an 8.1% operating margin, up 180 basis points from the first quarter of the previous year.\nOur strong operational performance resulted in net income of $218 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.50, an 88% increase.\nWe also continued to strengthen our balance sheet, ensuring adequate liquidity and solid cash flow.\nWe are proud of our teams and encouraged by our results, and we plan to build on this momentum throughout 2021.\nNow let's turn to our business segments.\nAutomotive represented 66% of total sales in the first quarter, while Industrial accounted for 34%.\nBy region, 73% of revenues came from North America, 16% from Europe, and 11% from Asia-Pacific.\nGlobal Automotive total sales were $3 billion, a 14% increase from 2020 and a significant improvement from the 1% increase in Q4 of 2020.\nComparable sales increased by 8%, an improvement from the 2% decrease in the fourth quarter, and segment profit margin rose by 250 basis points, driven by strong operating results across all our automotive operations.\nSales were driven by positive comparable sales across all our operations, with 15% growth in Europe and Asia-Pacific, 7% in the US, and 3% in Canada.\nThe ongoing global economic recovery, including financial stimulus in the US, improved inventory availability, favorable weather conditions, and our focus on key growth initiatives all contributed to sales growth in the quarter.\nWe should note that while we continue to expect a reasonable level of inflation as we progress through 2021, price inflation was not a factor in our first quarter sales.\nIn Europe, sales significantly improved from Q4 as our team capitalized on the strengthening sales environment, despite lockdowns throughout the region.\nAdditionally, initiatives to grow key accounts, enhance inventory availability, and the ongoing launch of the NAPA brand continued to be effective in driving profitable growth and market share gains.\nFor the quarter, our teams in France and the UK outperformed in the region with strong double-digit comparable sales growth.\nWe would also highlight a much improved performance by our team in the Benelux region.\nThe strong sales recovery combined with excellent expense control produced a 500-basis point improvement in operating margin.\nThis marks an excellent start to the year for our European operations.\nIn Asia-Pacific, our Automotive sales remained consistent with the mid-teen growth we experienced through the second half of 2020.\nFor the quarter, both retail and commercial sales remained strong as the region operated through multiple lockdowns associated with the pandemic.\nRetail sales, which represent over 40% of our total sales volume through our Repco stores, continued to outperform, posting a 33% increase in March and a 24% increase for the quarter.\nOur commercial sales also continued to accelerate, posting double-digit growth in the quarter.\nWe continued to benefit from the strength in online sales, which reached record highs at three times pre-COVID levels.\nLastly, building on the NAPA brand name has been well-received, and we remain focused on growing our NAPA presence in the region.\nIn summary, this group continues to perform exceptionally well on both the top and bottom lines, resulting in a 150-basis point improvement in profit margin for the quarter.\nIn North America, comparable sales in the US increased by 7%, helping this business post a 180-basis point increase in profit margins.\nIn Canada, we operated through various regional lockdowns which impacted our larger markets of Ontario and Quebec.\nComparable sales increased by 3% and operating margin rose by 130 basis points.\nSales in the US, which posted its strongest quarterly comparison since the first quarter of 2015, were driven by solid growth in both the retail and commercial segments.\nThis was our first quarter of positive commercial comparisons since pre-pandemic, and our team produced record sales volumes in March.\nAdditionally, both ticket and traffic counts were positive for both our retail and commercial transactions, marking our first increase in traffic counts in several quarters.\nBy region, the Atlantic, Midwest, and West Groups posted the strongest growth, although we would also highlight our Northeast Group, which produced solid growth in the quarter.\nThis is notable as this region of the US has been most affected by COVID-19 lockdowns over the past 13 months.\nSimilarly, we would add that product sales in categories such as batteries, tools and equipment, and brakes were strong this quarter.\nWe are particularly encouraged to see the rebound in our brakes business, which is generally a positive indicator for our commercial business.\nOn the retail side, which continues to outperform with strong double-digit growth, we continued to drive sales through investments in retail specialists and store refreshes, as well as targeted promotions.\nWe would also highlight our ongoing omnichannel investments and the increase in B2C online sales, which reached record levels in the quarter and were up 150% from the previous year.\nOur commercial sales, our other wholesale category of independent garage customers, continued to generate strong growth.\nWe have been encouraged by the number of new accounts we are serving.\nClearly, our investments in increasing the number of professional salespeople on the street have been effective in attracting new customers to NAPA.\nWe were also pleased to see improved sales with our NAPA AutoCare and major account customers, which posted positive sales growth for the first time in several quarters.\nSales to the fleet and government group were down year-over-year but sequentially improved from the fourth quarter, and we anticipate further improvement in sales for this segment.\nLooking ahead, we are excited about the growth opportunities we see for our Global Automotive segment.\nWe expect further improvement in aftermarket fundamentals such as increased miles driven, a growing vehicle fleet, and an increase in vehicles aged six to 12 years, all of which are favorable for the industry.\nWe can assure you we remain focused on our initiatives to deliver customer value and ultimately sell more parts for more cars.\nThese plans include further enhancing our inventory availability, strengthening our supply chain, and investing in our omnichannel capabilities.\nAdditionally, we expect to expand our global store footprint with additional bolt-on acquisitions, changeovers, and new greenfield stores to further enhance our competitive positioning.\nNow let's discuss the global Industrial Parts Group.\nTotal sales for this group were $1.5 billion, flat compared to last year.\nComparable sales decreased by 2%, an improvement from the 4% decrease in Q4 and reflecting the third consecutive quarter of improving sales trends.\nMarch was a standout month, with the North American Motion team posting a 7% increase in average daily sales and achieving record sales volumes.\nThis was a tremendous accomplishment and another turning point for GPC in our emergence from the pandemic.\nThe ongoing recovery over the last nine months aligns with the continued improvement in the industrial economy, which can be seen in several key indicators for our business.\nFor perspective, PMI was 64.7% in March, an increase of 4.2 points from December 31st.\nAdditionally, industrial production increased by 2.5% in the first quarter, the third consecutive quarter of expansion, following the significant downturn in the second quarter of 2020.\nImportantly, we can see these positive indicators translating to more activity with our customers, which are operating at higher run rates and releasing capital project orders.\nThe strengthening sales environment, along with our initiatives to drive growth and control costs, produced an 80 basis point margin improvement, with segment profit margin at 8.3% versus 7.5% last year.\nDiving deeper into our Q1 sales, we'll start by saying that inflation remains a non-factor in our numbers thus far.\nThat said, we are seeing more pricing activity and expect another year of 1% to 2% price inflation from our suppliers.\nFor the quarter, we experienced improving sales trends among virtually all product categories and industries served.\nWe were especially encouraged by the recovery in the equipment and machinery, aggregate and cement, and wood and lumber sectors, all key industry groups for us.\nFurthermore, we are seeing continued advantages from expanding our omnichannel capabilities, with online sales doubling compared to Q1 2020.\nA major contributor to our digital expansion is our internal sales department, which is bringing in additional revenue from new Motion clients.\nThough it currently represents a small portion of overall revenue, we are optimistic about its future growth potential.\nWe are also concentrating on expanding our services and solutions offerings to broaden our expertise and sales opportunities in areas like equipment repair, conveyance and automation.\nWe have made several small acquisitions to increase our scale in these areas, and our services and solutions capabilities remain an important consideration in our overall M&A strategy for the Industrial segment.\nTo ensure profitable revenue growth, we are continuously improving our pricing and category management approaches.\nWe also intend to further optimize our supply chain network and boost productivity while maintaining excellent customer service.\nTo wrap up our Industrial segment discussion.\nWe remain optimistic about our Motion business and are pleased to see this division returning to growth.\nI will now conclude my remarks with a brief update on our ESG initiatives.\nAs detailed in our Corporate Sustainability Report, GPC is committed to innovating in ways that benefit our environment, employees, and the communities where we operate.\nIn the first quarter, we expanded our training and development programs to support personal growth and enhanced our comprehensive well-being program focusing on the emotional, financial and physical health of our GPC team members.\nMoreover, we continue to make progress in advancing our corporate commitment to diversity and inclusion by actively recruiting talent representative of the communities we serve, training our team members to mitigate unconscious bias and model inclusive behaviors, and strengthening partnerships that support our D&I initiatives.\nLastly, we remain dedicated to our mission of being good corporate citizens in the places where we work and live.\nSince 1928, we have been giving back to communities and causes that make a difference, and this legacy continues in 2021.\nFirst, I'd like to commend the global GPC team for their performance this quarter.\nAs Paul mentioned, our team delivered solid results in the first quarter and has strong momentum.\nThe situation has improved compared to 2020, but we remain cautious as global uncertainty continues to be a part of daily business operations.\nAreas of concern for us include COVID-19, inflation, global logistics, and product and labor availability.\nWe also face more challenging year-over-year comparisons that will require sustained momentum during the second half of the year.\nDespite the uncertainty, the GPC team is energized and focused on delivering results.\nI'll now provide some additional insight into our ongoing strategic initiatives.\nThe foundation of our priorities is based on the customer experience, understanding their needs, and striving to exceed their expectations.\nWe are analyzing and listening to customer feedback and responding to strengths and opportunities.\nPut simply, our customers need us to be easy to work with, dependable, and helpful.\nThis independent data reinforces our priorities and serves as a guiding principle for required action and strategic investment.\nTo provide a top-tier customer experience, we have opportunities to streamline and integrate our existing operations.\nOur global teams are implementing multi-year plans to realign teams, streamline processes, improve operational efficiency, and reduce costs.\nThese initiatives will not only create operational efficiencies but also enable faster team execution, deliver a better customer experience, and accelerate profitable growth.\nI'd like to highlight a few initiatives that demonstrate our efforts to streamline and integrate.\nFor instance, we're working to optimize our facilities footprint and coverage, simplify and integrate disparate legacy IT systems, streamline back-office support functions, offshore non-customer facing activities, and centralize GPC indirect sourcing processes, among other examples.\nAs we streamline and integrate, we're simultaneously investing in our core business and positioning for the future.\nOur strong cash flow, solid capital structure, and disciplined capital allocation provide the flexibility needed to continue making these investments.\nKey areas of our core investments include talent, sales force effectiveness, digital supply chain, and emerging vehicle technologies.\nA few highlights of our progress across these key areas during the quarter include:\nWe continue to take deliberate action globally to identify high-potential talent, bring new capabilities into the organization, and recruit diverse talent representative of the communities we serve.\nExamples include roles in category management, digital, emerging vehicle technology, and field leadership, to name a few.\nTalent will always be a priority investment area as we strive to be an employer of choice for team members who share our GPC values and want to play a leadership role in our exciting future.\nRegarding sales force effectiveness, using data and analytics to understand our unique customer segments, their different needs, and associated strategies to serve each segment is a fundamental element.\nOur sales efforts reflect our omnichannel initiatives and include an increasing mix of both traditional and digital selling strategies.\nFor example, the US automotive team revamped its sales approach with new reporting tools to track customer visits, digital tools to communicate with field sales team members, and enhanced virtual product and skills training.\nAdditionally, in 2021, the US automotive team adjusted compensation programs to better align incentives with profitable growth.\nAs mentioned, digital is a fundamental priority as we deliver a top-tier customer experience and accelerate profitable growth.\nOur businesses delivered excellent performance via digital channels in the quarter.\nWe continue to see strong increases compared to the previous year across our global digital channels.\nWhile digital still represents a relatively small portion of our total sales, we're excited about the compelling digital vision our teams are executing.\nWe also continue to invest in foundational digital elements, including catalog, search, and other critical customer experience aspects, such as ease of ordering, pricing, and analytics.\nOur supply chain initiatives focus on ensuring we have the right product available in the right market at the right time.\nWe are continuously implementing inventory, facility, productivity, logistics, and technology strategies to achieve this goal.\nA solid example is the success the US Industrial team enjoyed with recent facility automation investments that delivered a 500% labor productivity improvement.\nOther examples include enhanced workforce management and delivery tracking tools in the US automotive business.\nLastly, regarding emerging vehicle technologies, we aim to lead in the opportunities presented by these advancements for our automotive industries.\nWe believe we have a unique position to leverage, including our scaled global footprint, diverse portfolio, leading global brands, established customer-supplier relationships, and one GPC team approach.\nThrough our planning process, we developed a multi-faceted strategy to address electric vehicle trends.\nA few highlights include aligning talent 100% dedicated to developing and executing EV strategies, product and category management strategies with existing and new SKUs, global supplier councils with existing strategic partners, advisory groups leveraging our 25,000 global repair center relationships, and partnerships with strategic EV market participants.\nFinally, strategic bolt-on acquisitions are a key part of our GPC growth strategy.\nWe use acquisitions to gain new customers, further penetrate existing priority markets, enter new geographies, acquire product and service capabilities, and acquire talent.\nWe also believe our acquisition capabilities position us well as we selectively consider and test new business models.\nOur acquisition pipeline remains active and actionable given the fragmentation of our markets.\nWe believe our scale, market-leading brands, global footprint, and unique culture position us to be an acquirer of choice.\nWe will remain selective and disciplined as we execute this important part of our strategy.\nSimilar to the approach used for our 2019 cost savings plan, the global teams develop tools and a monthly cadence to create visibility and status on initiatives.\nThis approach not only helps drive performance but also helps to share best practices around the globe as one GPC team.\nIn summary, I hope today's remarks reinforce our sense of focus and global teamwork.\nWe will remain adaptable as the global environment continues to evolve.\nWe will stay focused on what we can control as we execute through the rest of the year and beyond.\nI'll now hand it over to Carol to review the financial performance details.\nWe'll start by reviewing our key financial data and then provide an update on our 2021 full-year forecast.\nIn the first quarter, GPC's total sales reached $4.5 billion, a 9% increase from the previous year and an improvement from the 0.7% decline in the fourth quarter.\nThe gross margin rose to 34.5%, a 60-basis point improvement compared to 33.9% in the same quarter last year.\nOur ongoing efforts to enhance gross margin continue to show positive results from various initiatives, including our pricing strategies and global sourcing efforts.\nWe also saw benefits from a shift in sales towards operations with higher gross margins.\nIt's worth noting that supplier incentives in the quarter were comparable to last year and had no impact on gross margin.\nAs mentioned earlier, price inflation had minimal effect on our first-quarter sales and gross margin.\nThroughout the year, we will continue to implement our strategies to achieve further gross margin improvements through positive product mix changes, strategic pricing tools and analytics, global sourcing advantages, and strategic category management initiatives.\nOur selling, administrative, and other expenses totaled $1.2 billion in the first quarter, up 4.6% from last year, or 5.3% from last year's adjusted SG&A.\nThis represents an improvement to 26.8% of sales this year, down nearly 100 basis points from 27.7% last year.\nWe've made significant progress, primarily due to cost savings from 2020, ongoing cost control measures, and improved leverage from stronger sales growth.\nOur progress was slightly offset by rising freight costs, which we're carefully managing, and planned increases in technology spending to support our strategic initiatives.\nTotal operating and non-operating expenses were $1.3 billion in the first quarter, up 2.2% from last year or 2.1% compared to last year's adjusted expenses.\nThe first quarter expenses include approximately $20 million in benefits from real estate sales gains and favorable retirement plan valuation adjustments recorded in other non-operating income.\nOverall, our total expenses for the quarter improved to 28.1% of sales, down 190 basis points from 30% in 2020.\nFirst quarter total segment profit was $361 million, a strong 41% increase on the 9% sales growth.\nOur segment profit margin rose to 8.1% compared to 6.3% last year, a 180 basis point increase.\nCompared to 2019, our segment profit margin has improved by 100 basis points.\nThis solid improvement represents our strongest first quarter profit margin since 2015, reflecting the positive momentum in our businesses.\nOur net interest expense decreased to $18 million from $20 million in 2020 due to lower total debt and more favorable interest rates.\nCorporate expenses were $31 million in the quarter, down from $55 million in 2020, primarily due to the favorable real estate gains and retirement plan adjustments mentioned earlier.\nThe first quarter tax rate was 23.8%, in line with last year's reported rate and improved from the prior year's adjusted rate of 26.5%.\nThis improvement is mainly due to the favorable tax impact of exercised stock options, as well as the previously mentioned real estate gains and retirement plan adjustments.\nOur first quarter net income from continuing operations was $218 million, with diluted earnings per share of $1.50.\nThis compares to $0.84 per diluted share in the prior year, or an adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.80, representing an 88% increase.\nLet's now examine our first quarter results by segment.\nAutomotive revenue for the first quarter was $3 billion, up 14% from the previous year.\nSegment profit increased by 65% to $236 million, with profit margin rising to 8% compared to 5.5% in the first quarter of last year.\nThe 250 basis point margin increase was driven by the ongoing recovery in the Automotive business and the execution of our growth and operating initiatives.\nWe're pleased that all our automotive businesses expanded their margins for the third consecutive quarter.\nIt's encouraging that our first quarter margin also compares favorably to the first quarter of 2019, up 120 basis points.\nWe're seeing a broad recovery across our operations and anticipate continued progress in the coming quarters.\nIndustrial sales remained flat at $1.5 billion in the quarter compared to last year, but improved sequentially for the third consecutive quarter, aligning with the strengthening industrial economy.\nSegment profit increased by 10% to $125 million, with profit margin rising 80 basis points to 8.3% compared to 7.5% last year.\nThe improved Industrial margin reflects the third consecutive quarter of margin expansion in both our North American and Australasian industrial businesses and is also up by 90 basis points from the first quarter of 2019.\nWe expect another quarter of strong operating results for Industrial, with stronger sales growth projected for the remainder of the year.\nNow, let's discuss the balance sheet.\nWe continue to operate with a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity, and the financial strength to support our growth strategy.\nAs of March 31st, total accounts receivable decreased by 27% from last year, primarily due to $800 million in receivables sold in 2020.\nInventory increased by 6% from the prior year, while accounts payable rose by 14%.\nOur AP to inventory ratio improved to 124% from 116% last year.\nWe're pleased with our progress in improving our overall working capital position and believe there are opportunities for further improvement.\nTotal debt stands at $2.6 billion as of March 31st, down $1 billion or 28% from last March and $60 million from December 31st, 2020.\nWe significantly improved our debt position throughout 2020 by issuing new public debt and securing a new revolving credit agreement, providing expanded credit capacity and more favorable rates.\nWith these positive changes to our debt structure, our total debt to adjusted EBITDA has improved to 1.8 times from 2.5 times last year.\nWe ended the first quarter with $2.6 billion in available liquidity, up from $1.1 billion at March 31st last year and in line with December 31st.\nWe continue to generate strong cash flow, with $300 million in cash from operations in the first quarter, up from $28 million in the first quarter last year.\nGiven our strong start to the year, including increased net income and improved working capital, we still expect cash from operations to be in the $1 billion to $1.2 billion range and free cash flow of $700 million to $900 million.\nOur key priorities for cash include reinvesting in our businesses through capital expenditures, M&A, dividends, and share repurchases.\nWe invested $48 million in capital expenditures in the first quarter, up from $39 million in 2020.\nLooking ahead, we plan additional investments in our businesses to drive growth and improve efficiencies and productivity.\nWe continue to expect total capital expenditures of approximately $300 million for the year.\nStrategic acquisitions remain an important component of our long-term growth strategy.\nWe're cultivating a strong pipeline of targeted names and expect to make additional strategic bolt-on acquisitions to complement both our Global Automotive and Industrial segments in the coming months and quarters.\nIn the first quarter, we paid a cash dividend of $114 million to our shareholders.\nThe Company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since going public in 1928, and our 2021 dividend of $3.26 per share represents our 65th consecutive annual increase.\nWe've actively participated in a share repurchase program since 1994.\nWhile there were no repurchases in the first quarter, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase up to 14.5 million additional shares, and we plan to resume share repurchases in the coming months and quarters.\nRegarding our outlook for 2021, we considered several factors including past performance, current growth plans and strategic initiatives, recent business trends, potential foreign currency fluctuations, inflation, and the global economic outlook.\nWe also considered ongoing uncertainties due to market disruptions such as COVID-19 and its potential impact on our results.\nWith these factors in mind, we now expect total sales for 2021 to grow by 5% to 7%, an increase from our previous guidance of 4% to 6%.\nAs usual, these growth rates exclude the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions.\nBy business segment, we're now guiding to 5% to 7% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, up from 4% to 6%, and 4% to 6%

our website\nWe do not commit to updating this information to reflect future events or circumstances\nAs a policy, we refrain from disclosing non-public material information during our conference calls due to restrictions on selective disclosure\nThis investment approach has been clearly favored at the conclusion of every market cycle\nThe strategy involves selecting a few dominant tech giants that are widely popular, then watching as their valuations increase\nThe gap between low-priced and high-priced stocks has reached unprecedented levels globally\nQuestions about the viability of value investing or its redefinition have become increasingly common\nThis situation is similar to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, as described in Michael Lewis's 1999 book \"The New New Thing\"\nInvestors now, like those in the past, are captivated by these trends\nHowever, value investing will have its day again, as paying less than the future cash flows' present value remains a successful long-term investment strategy, and current conditions make this approach even more appealing\nWe believe the factors for reversing today's extremes are evident, especially as our COVID-affected world has entered a recession, which historically signals a shift\nConsider these four potential catalysts that may indicate an imminent shift\nFirstly, a recession is underway and the path to economic recovery is becoming evident\nWe analyzed U.S. recessions over the past century and Japanese recessions over 45 years, finding compelling evidence\nThe United States has experienced 14 recessions in the last 100 years\nExamining five-year returns from the start of recessions, value stocks outperformed the broader market by an average of 5% annually\nSecondly, when interest rates stop declining, it halts the multiple expansion of growth stocks\nInterest rates have been on a downward trend for four decades\nThis trend has created a situation where value stocks can be bought at P/E ratios of 10, similar to any time in the past 70 years, while average growth stock multiples have risen from 30 to 60 times earnings\nEven if rates remain stable, the advantage enjoyed by growth stocks should diminish\nThirdly, the optimistic growth expectations for major tech companies return to normal levels\nLet's use Microsoft as an example to illustrate this point\nMicrosoft's stock price has increased tenfold over the past decade, growing at 25% annually, supported by strong growth in cloud technology replacing on-site hardware demand\nThis has resulted in 8% annual growth in operating income\nTo achieve an 8% annual stock price increase in the future, given Microsoft's high valuation, would now require 20 years of 10% operating income growth\nHowever, market analysts estimate that public cloud penetration of data needs has reached 30% to 35%, with a potential maximum penetration of approximately 70%\nWe've reached approximately half of our capacity.\nThe source of growth for the next two decades remains uncertain.\nThe outcome is yet to be determined.\nContrary to popular belief, technological advancements don't always negatively impact existing businesses.\nLet's examine the competition between Tesla and Volkswagen in the electric vehicle market.\nThe prevailing opinion and stock performance suggest Tesla will emerge victorious.\nHowever, is it logical to assume Volkswagen must decline even if Tesla grows?\nTesla's stock has been a top performer, increasing more than tenfold in the past five years.\nIn contrast, Volkswagen's stock value has remained relatively stable during the same period.\nThere are only two primary ways to succeed in automobile manufacturing.\nThe first is to maintain higher prices through brand prestige.\nThe second is to reduce production expenses.\nIt appears inevitable that these principles will apply to electric vehicles, and Volkswagen will likely transfer their brand strengths and scale advantages to compete in this market.\nIn fact, Volkswagen leads all competitors in planned electric vehicle releases over the coming years.\nRegarding our financial performance, we concluded the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in net inflows.\nOver the past year, we experienced net positive flows of about $2.1 billion.\nWe've maintained positive net flows for three consecutive calendar years and six out of the last eight years.\nThis is a significant achievement given the current skepticism surrounding value investing.\nOur diluted earnings for the third quarter were $0.16 per share, compared to $0.13 last quarter and $0.19 per share for the same period last year.\nQuarterly revenues totaled $33.9 million with an operating income of $15 million.\nOur operating margin this quarter was 44.1%, up from 36.4% last quarter but down from 46.3% in the third quarter of the previous year.\nExamining our assets under management, we ended the quarter at $33.3 billion, a 5.7% increase from last quarter's $31.5 billion, but a 7% decrease from $35.8 billion in the third quarter of last year.\nThe growth in assets under management from the previous quarter was driven by $1.1 billion in net inflows and $0.7 billion in market appreciation, including foreign exchange impact.\nThe decline from the previous year's third quarter reflects $4.8 billion in market depreciation, including foreign exchange impact, partially offset by $2.1 billion in net inflows.\nAs of September 30, 2020, our assets under management comprised $13.3 billion in separately managed accounts, $18 billion in sub-advised accounts, and $2 billion in Pzena funds.\nCompared to the previous quarter, separately managed account assets increased due to $0.4 billion in market appreciation and foreign exchange impact, slightly offset by $0.1 billion in net outflows.\nSub-advised account assets grew, reflecting $1.3 billion in net inflows and $0.3 billion in market appreciation and foreign exchange impact, while Pzena fund assets decreased slightly due to $0.1 billion in net outflows.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, mean assets under management reached $33.1 billion, showing an 11.1% rise from the previous quarter but an 8.1% drop compared to the same period last year\nIncome rose by 12.7% from the previous quarter but fell by 8.4% when compared to the third quarter of the previous year\nRevenue changes are mainly attributed to severance, average assets under management, and the effect on performance and fulcrum fees\nNo performance fees were recognized this quarter or last, unlike the $0.3 million recorded in the same quarter of the previous year\nThe quarter also saw a reduction in base fees for certain accounts due to fulcrum fee arrangements with a client\nThese arrangements necessitate a decrease in the base fee if the investment strategy underperforms its benchmark, or allow a performance fee if it outperforms\nIn the second and third quarters of 2020, $1 million reductions in base fees were recognized for these accounts, compared to a $0.5 million reduction in the third quarter of 2019\nThese fees are calculated every quarter and compare relative performance over a three-year period\nThe amount of base fees recognized may change as the three-year performance record of this account fluctuates relative to its benchmark\nThe weighted average fee rate for the quarter was 41 basis points, compared to 40.4 basis points in the previous quarter and 41.2 basis points in the same quarter last year\nChanges in our overall weighted average fee rate are influenced by asset mix and fluctuations in performance and fulcrum fees\nCompensation and benefits expenses totaled $15.8 million for the quarter, compared to $15.6 million in the previous quarter and $16 million in the same quarter last year\nG&A expenses for the third quarter of 2020 were $3.2 million, down from $3.6 million in the previous quarter and $3.9 million in the same quarter last year, mainly due to reduced travel costs and professional fees\nOther income for the quarter was $0.5 million, primarily driven by investment performance\nThe effective tax rate for unincorporated and other business taxes was negative 6.8% this quarter, compared to positive 4.1% last quarter and negative 5.1% in the same quarter last year\nThe negative effective tax rate this quarter and in the third quarter of last year reflects benefits from reversing uncertain tax position liabilities and interests due to statute of limitations expiration\nThe ongoing effective rate for unincorporated and other business taxes of the operating company is expected to be between 3% and 5%\nThe effective corporate income tax rate, excluding UBT and other business taxes, was 26.5% this quarter, compared to 26.6% last quarter and 24.4% in the same quarter last year\nFluctuations in these effective rates are due to certain permanently non-deductible expenses\nThe ongoing rate, excluding these items, is expected to be between 23% and 25%\nApproximately 78% of the operating company's net income was allocated to non-public members in the third quarter of 2020, compared to 77.7% last quarter and 74.5% in the same quarter last year\nThese percentage variations result from changes in ownership interest in the operating company\nDuring the quarter, about 102,000 shares of Class A common stock were repurchased and retired for $0.5 million through the stock buyback program\nAs of September 30, approximately $10.7 million remained in the repurchase program\nAt quarter end, the company's financial position remained strong with $49.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $70.3 million in short-term investments\nA quarterly dividend of $0.03 per share was

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I trust you're all keeping well and remaining safe.\nIt's clear there are numerous aspects of 2020 that we, like many of you, are eager to move past as we look towards a more secure and healthy 2021.\nTo conclude, we were satisfied with our fourth quarter performance, which showed the ongoing stability and resilience of our utility water end market.\nAs expected, flow instrumentation sales improved sequentially but remained lower compared to the previous year.\nWe achieved improvements in gross margin, maintained cash flow generation, and saw growth in earnings per share, though with several factors at play that Bob will elaborate on.\nI'm very proud of our success in completing two significant acquisitions in recent months that serve as strategic growth catalysts for Badger Meter.\nWe recently acquired Analytical Technologies, Inc, or ATi, which, combined with our November 2020 purchase of s::can, provides us with a solid foundation to develop real-time, on-demand water quality monitoring solutions for both utility water and industrial markets.\nTotal sales for the fourth quarter reached $112.3 million, a 4% increase from $107.6 million in the same period last year.\nThis reflects the stabilization we observed in the third quarter, which has largely persisted despite the resurgence of COVID-19 cases and various regional restrictions.\nIn the utility water sector, overall sales grew by 8% against a challenging comparison from Q4 last year, which had also seen an 8% increase over 2018.\nThe acquisition of s::can in November 2020 contributed approximately 3 percentage points to the current quarter's revenue growth, with core organic revenues in utility water rising 5% year-over-year.\nOrganically, this quarter's sales were the second highest in our history, surpassed only by the third quarter of 2020, which included a significant portion of pandemic-induced backlog catch-up, as we discussed previously.\nPositive revenue mix trends continued with increased adoption of smart metering solutions, including higher sales of ORION Cellular radios and growth in BEACON software-as-a-service revenue, along with greater ultrasonic meter penetration.\nWe also benefited from strategic pricing initiatives, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly.\nAs anticipated, flow instrumentation sales showed improvement sequentially, declining 10% year-over-year compared to the 18% drop experienced in Q3 2020, though activity levels continue to reflect the broadly challenged markets and applications served globally.\nOperating profit as a percentage of sales was 15.1%, a slight 10-basis-point decrease from the previous year's 15.2%, with several factors affecting the gross profit and SEA lines that I will examine more closely.\nThe quarter's gross margin was 39.2%, an increase of 100 basis points year-over-year.\nMargins benefited from higher sales volumes, strategic pricing actions, and a favorable sales mix as previously mentioned.\nThese positive gross margin drivers were offset by a one-time network sunset provision recorded in the quarter, as well as the expected post-acquisition impact on gross margins due to amortization of the inventory fair value step-up for the s::can acquisition.\nI'll dedicate extra time today to three key items: price-cost dynamics, the impact of acquisitions on margins, and the one-time network sunset provision, to help clarify their effects on the quarter and beyond, where applicable.\nRegarding price-cost, as you may have noticed, copper prices, which serve as a proxy for our recycled brass input costs, have risen significantly.\nCurrently averaging around $3.60 per pound, this represents over a 30% increase year-over-year.\nWe've reminded investors that while significant, the impact of recycled brass on our cost structure has been diminishing over time as we sell more software and radios compared to primarily meters in the past.\nIt's also worth noting that we continue to offer polymer, mechanical, and ultrasonic meters as part of our \"choice matters\" go-to-market strategy.\nTo provide some context, if copper prices remain at this level for the entire year, it could potentially result in a cost increase of about $4 million to $5 million year-over-year.\nThe other side of the price-cost equation is pricing.\nSimilar to our approach with working capital and operating metrics like SQDC (safety, quality, delivery, and cost), we have developed more robust processes and metrics to actively manage strategic pricing for our evolving and valuable solutions offered to customers.\nAs a result, we have proactively implemented several strategic pricing actions that yielded a positive net benefit from price in the fourth quarter, ahead of the lagging headwind from input cost increases, primarily copper.\nWe anticipate being able to largely offset commodity inflation with price throughout the year, potentially experiencing some minor, manageable lag effects.\nThe second topic is acquisitions and their impact on margins.\ns::can's results were incorporated for two months in the fourth quarter.\nThese two months generated about $2.5 million in revenue, as anticipated.\nWe noted the usual amortization of inventory fair value step-up and acquired intangible assets, which collectively resulted in a small loss for the brief period in Q4 2020.\nLooking ahead to 2021, we anticipate that the integration of s::can and ATi, with total acquired revenue of roughly $37 million, will positively impact earnings per share.\nThe initial quarter of 2021 will encompass the remaining s::can amortization, along with a complete quarter of ATi inventory step-up amortization, but we foresee normal profitability in subsequent quarters.\nKen will elaborate on the long-term potential of these acquisitions during his presentation.\nLastly, addressing the one-time specific network sunset provision.\nThis pertains to the phasing out of the CDMA cellular network for early users of our initial cellular radio product.\nThis sunset is a carrier-driven event, part of the natural progression of technology, and affects various IoT devices across multiple industries.\nAs pioneers in cellular radios for water metering applications and a company dedicated to customer service, Badger Meter implemented safeguards for such situations.\nUntil recently, carriers' plans for sunsetting were not definitive.\nNow that these plans seem more concrete, we've made this provision, which decreased gross margins in the quarter by approximately 300 basis points to cover future radio upgrades for these early cellular customers.\nTo be absolutely clear, there is no flaw in the radio itself.\nThe next logical question arises.\nWill cellular radios continue to face this challenge in the future?\nThe brief answer is no.\nThe CDMA network was already well-established when Badger Meter introduced its first cellular radio.\nThese initial networks had been operational for nearly two decades at that point.\nSubsequently, we've stayed ahead of the technology curve, as evidenced by the release of ORION LTM in 2019 and our ongoing innovation in cellular radio technologies.\nThese technologies will be supported by multiple generations of cellular networks.\nRegarding SEA expenses, the fourth quarter's expenditure of $27.1 million was $2.3 million higher than the previous year.\nThis includes two months of s::can's contribution, including the resulting intangible asset amortization.\nMore broadly, increased personnel costs were partially offset by reduced travel, trade show, and other pandemic-affected expenses.\nIncorporating both s::can and ATi in 2021, we anticipate ongoing SEA as a percentage of sales to average between 25% and 26%.\nThe income tax provision for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 22.6%, slightly below the previous year's rate of 24.3%.\nWith the additions of s::can and ATi, we don't expect a significant change in our normalized tax rate for 2021, barring any new statutory changes to the US tax code.\nIn conclusion, earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $0.45, a 7% increase from the prior year's earnings per share of $0.42.\nWorking capital as a percentage of sales was 26%, with approximately 1% attributed to the addition of s::can.\nOn an organic basis, primary working capital as a percentage of sales decreased by about 200 basis points year-over-year.\nOur full-year free cash flow of $80.5 million was 10% higher than the previous year's $73.2 million and represents approximately 163% conversion of net earnings.\nWe will maintain our focus on cash flow and anticipate free cash flow conversion to exceed 100% in 2021.\nHowever, I caution that we don't expect to see conversion at the robust levels of the past two years, given the structural change in working capital already achieved.\nWe concluded the year with roughly $72 million in cash reserves after accounting for the s::can purchase\nAt the beginning of January, we spent $44 million, net of acquired cash, on ATi while maintaining a positive cash balance\nWe have sufficient financial flexibility to continue implementing our capital allocation strategies, thanks to our full access to an unused $125 million credit line\nI'd like to draw attention to two transactions we've completed since our previous earnings call and explain how we believe they add significant value to Badger Meter's portfolio\ns::can, acquired in November 2020, and Analytical Technology, Inc. (ATi), purchased recently, are both innovators in providing solutions for real-time water quality monitoring\nThis approach differs from traditional water quality testing as it captures real-time data through sensors and systems that don't rely on laboratories, reagents, or other consumables, resulting in lower costs for customers\nSimilar to how water utility billing evolved from manual readings to advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), we anticipate water quality monitoring will shift from lab sample testing to online real-time collection, monitoring, and reporting\nIncorporating real-time water quality parameters with Badger Meter's core flow measurement, pressure, and temperature sensing capabilities expands the range of actionable data for utilities to enhance operational efficiency and for industrial customers to monitor both process and discharge water\nWe anticipate multiple avenues for growth synergies by integrating these two acquisitions into Badger Meter\nFor instance, in terms of water quality sensors, this combination provides us with a comprehensive product offering of both electrochemical and optical sensors\nGeographically, ATi's strength in the US and UK complements s::can's installed base in 50 countries\nIn terms of scale and coverage, leveraging customer relationships, inside sales, representative networks, and distributors will enhance our ability to cross-sell throughout the water ecosystem, including water utilities, wastewater treatment, and industrial water applications\nRealizing these long-term growth synergies will undoubtedly require time and investment\nWe need to improve our communications to capture quantity and quality data parameters via our industry-leading ORION Cellular radios\nWe will need to enhance BEACON and EyeOnWater to store, integrate, analyze, and visualize information, providing a comprehensive view of the water network\nThis is a significant undertaking, but one we are prepared to execute\nIn the short term, it's business as usual for the two acquired companies\nThe combined acquired annual sales of approximately $37 million with EBITDA margins in the mid-teens will positively impact our earnings per share\nWhile we had hoped that entering 2021 would also mark the end of COVID-19, that is clearly not the case\nDespite ongoing uncertainty, we remain fully prepared to operate safely in support of our customers in the essential water sector, as we did throughout much of 2020\nThere has been no significant change in customer sentiment regarding utility budgets, with spending focused on critical and necessary activities, including metering solutions required for billing and reducing non-revenue water\nAs we've mentioned, our large and diverse customer base will have varying needs, circumstances, and priorities\nHowever, overall, utility water bid tenders and awards are largely proceeding with their normal processes, with limited extended timelines or deferrals\nWhile we don't provide guidance, Bob will explain some factors that will impact us in 2021, including price/cost, SEA levels, and the expected impact of recent acquisition activity\nClearly, we experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in top-line performance throughout 2020, so growth rates that are typically uneven will be even more so during 2021\nWe will continue to prioritize cash flow generation, which fuels investment and growth in our business\nThis includes both organic and acquisition-driven growth, focusing on additional product and software offerings serving water-related markets and applications\nFor example, we plan to expand the functionality of our EyeOnWater software app to enhance consumer engagement\nWe will also continue to advance various ESG priorities, including maintaining a strong focus on employee safety, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, fostering an inclusive culture, and promoting water conservation and quality\nDespite the unprecedented backdrop of a health and economic crisis, we have achieved utility water revenue growth, increased SaaS revenue as a percentage of sales to 5%, significantly expanded EBITDA margins, implemented robust working capital management and cash flow strategies, and successfully executed two accretive acquisitions\nThis performance highlights the critical nature of the water industry and the exceptional capabilities of the Badger Meter team\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:During the call, you'll hear mentions of various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe offer insight into the company's operations.\nYou can find reconciliations of non-GAAP figures to their corresponding GAAP numbers in today's materials and on our website.\nSlide 3 displays our GAAP financial results for the second quarter at the top of the page.\nThe adjusted operating results shown below are believed by management to enhance understanding of our business by reflecting core operations' underlying performance and enabling more meaningful trend analysis.\nAs our release indicated, Ameriprise had another strong quarter, and I'm pleased with our performance at this point in the year.\nThe US environment continues to improve as the economy reopens more fully and equity markets remain robust.\nRecent virus outbreaks are somewhat hindering Europe's recovery.\nHowever, overall, there are many reasons to be optimistic as we look forward.\nConsidering this landscape, we are executing effectively across our businesses, promoting growth through our lower capital fee-based operations and liberating capital to create shareholder value.\nWe achieved another quarter of exceptional organic growth in wealth and asset management and high productivity across our system.\nThis included robust client flows with over $16 billion of inflows in Wealth Management and Asset Management during the quarter, and we concluded with assets under management and administration increasing 28% to $1.2 trillion, setting a new record.\nRegarding recent strategic actions, we finalized the RiverSource Life's fixed annuity reinsurance transaction.\nThis further shifts our mix towards capital-light businesses and releases approximately $700 million of excess capital.\nOur acquisition of BMO's EMEA asset management business, announced in April, is expected to close in the fourth quarter.\nLet's examine our adjusted operating results for the quarter.\nBusiness momentum continues with revenues reaching $3.4 billion, a 22% increase driven by organic growth in markets.\nEarnings rose 34% excluding last year's NOL reversal, with earnings per share up 39% reflecting strong business growth and capital return, while ROE remains exceptionally high at 37.5%.\nAs usual, we continue to manage expenses effectively.\nLet's focus on Advice and Wealth Management, where we consistently generate solid growth.\nOur strategic investments remain a crucial aspect of our operations.\nClients are choosing Ameriprise for a high-quality advice experience supported by cutting-edge technology.\nClient satisfaction remains high, and clients are engaging with us both personally and through our extensive digital capabilities.\nNotably, our advisors are embracing our training, coaching, and powerful suite of tools fully integrated with our CRM platform, and we continue to add features, including testing a new e-meeting tool that helps advisors prepare for client meetings quickly.\nOur ongoing investments in the technology ecosystem are helping advisors connect with more clients and prospects and manage their practices more efficiently.\nThis high level of engagement is resulting in excellent client activity, asset flows, and client acquisition.\nTotal client inflows increased 54% to $9.5 billion, continuing the positive trends observed over recent quarters.\nIn line with strong client flows, wrap net inflows were $10 billion, maintaining a very strong run rate.\nTransactional activity also grew significantly, up nearly 30% from last year with good volume across various product solutions.\nAll this momentum, combined with positive markets, led to substantial growth in advisor productivity, up 14% when adjusted for interest rates, reaching a record of 731,000 per advisor.\nIn terms of recruiting, 42 experienced advisors joined us this quarter, slightly below our usual numbers.\nWe've heard that advisors have been focused on reopening-related matters and some postponed transitioning firms or delayed start dates.\nHowever, people are returning to a more normal routine.\nWe are now hosting in-person meetings to complement our virtual recruiting, and we're optimistic about our pipeline for the third quarter.\nRegarding the bank, total assets grew to $9.7 billion in the quarter, we continue to transfer additional deposits to the bank, and we've adjusted our investment strategy to extend duration somewhat.\nWe're also seeing increased demand for our lending solutions.\nLoan volumes are steadily rising, led by our pledge product, which presents a good opportunity for future growth.\nTo summarize, AWM metrics and financials remain very strong.\nMargin increased 380 basis points year-over-year, reaching 21.4% in the quarter, demonstrating consistent expansion since the Fed cut short-term rates a year ago.\nTurning to retirement and protection solutions, results were positive and we continue to progress with our strategic initiatives.\nRegarding annuities, we experienced strong variable annuity sales, with total sales up 88% compared to a year ago.\nIncreased customer interest in our structured variable annuity and RAVA products without living benefits drove our performance.\nThis trend accounted for over 66% of sales during the quarter, continuing the strategic shift we're implementing.\nIn the insurance sector, sales of Life and Health insurance nearly doubled, primarily due to our VUL product, which is well-suited for the current interest rate environment.\nLet's turn our attention to Asset Management, where we're experiencing growth in line with our strategic plans.\nAssets under management increased to $593 billion, representing a 25% rise from the previous year, fueled by strong business performance and favorable market conditions.\nOur investment team continues to deliver outstanding results for clients across various strategies, with over 80% of funds outperforming the median over extended periods on an asset-weighted basis.\nWe saw net inflows of $6.7 billion this quarter, an increase of $4.1 billion compared to the same period last year.\nWhen excluding outflows from legacy insurance partners, net inflows totaled $8.1 billion.\nThese figures build upon the positive net flows observed in recent quarters.\nGlobal retail net inflows reached $4.2 billion, primarily driven by another strong quarter in North America.\nWe maintain excellent relationships with clients and intermediaries.\nSales and flow momentum is widespread, with 15 of our investment capabilities generating over $100 million in net inflows during the quarter, although retail sales in EMEA have been weaker due to a risk-averse environment.\nWe anticipate EMEA flows to improve in the latter half of the year as post-pandemic reopening and economic recovery progress.\nIn Global Institutional, we observed a significant improvement with net inflows of $3.9 billion, excluding legacy partner outflows, with wins across various strategies in North America and EMEA.\nI'm optimistic about our sales pipeline.\nRegarding BMO, as previously discussed, the acquisition will enhance our capabilities and expand our presence in EMEA.\nThe business continues to experience positive flows, and we're receiving favorable feedback from clients and institutional consultants.\nAs mentioned earlier, we're on schedule to finalize the deal in the fourth quarter.\nOur capital management practices are exemplary.\nThe business continues to generate substantial free cash flow, and we're unlocking additional capital.\nThe approximately $700 million from our reinsurance deal essentially covers the cost of the BMO acquisition, providing us with more flexibility to return capital to shareholders at an attractive rate.\nIn conclusion, Ameriprise is in an excellent position.\nWe're performing well and achieving strong results.\nOur team is expanding our client base and deepening existing relationships.\nWe're achieving excellent organic growth in both Wealth and Asset Management, and the BMO transaction will provide an additional growth opportunity, while we're accelerating our business mix shift through the reinsurance of the fixed annuity block.\nI'd like to conclude by discussing our team.\nOur employees have been returning to the office a few days a week this summer and readjusting to the environment.\nIt's been wonderful to collaborate in person again.\nWe're looking forward to a more complete return to the office when conditions are safe, while maintaining some level of flexibility.\nAmeriprise delivered exceptional financial results across the company, with adjusted operating earnings per share increasing by 39% to $5.27.\nWe continue to demonstrate outstanding metrics, earnings growth, and margin expansion in our core growth businesses of Advice and Wealth Management and Asset Management.\nSales of our retirement and protection products increased significantly compared to last year, focusing on low-risk and higher-margin offerings.\nWe're already observing a shift in our in-force block and anticipate this trend to continue.\nAs Jim mentioned, we continued to advance our strategic priorities this quarter by expanding our growth businesses and reducing our risk profile.\nWe remain on track to finalize the acquisition of BMO's EMEA asset management business in the fourth quarter, which will enhance our core geographic and product capabilities in attractive and growing market segments.\nAdditionally, we entered into an agreement to reinsure approximately $8 billion of fixed annuities and completed the RiverSource Life transaction in early July.\nAs noted, we will free up approximately $700 million of capital, with a minimal projected impact on fixed annuity profitability.\nIn addition to the reinsurance transaction, we continue to effectively manage our risk profile by shifting our product mix towards lower-risk and higher-margin retirement and protection solutions.\nOur diversified business model generates robust free cash flow and strong balance sheet fundamentals.\nWe returned 92% of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders during the quarter, aligning with our projected 90% target for the full year.\nAmeriprise's adjusted operating net revenues and PTI showed significant growth in the quarter, demonstrating exceptional business performance.\nNearly 80% of revenue and earnings came from our capital-light businesses, AWM and asset management, marking a notable shift from the previous year, even when accounting for the unusually high earnings in RPS last year.\nWe continue to maintain strict control over expenses.\nGiven the strong business growth in the quarter, G&A expenses were well-controlled, increasing by only 6%.\nWe delivered another outstanding quarter, highlighting the robustness of our business model that consistently produces strong profitable growth.\nMoving on to the next slide.\nAdvice and Wealth Management achieved excellent organic growth, with total client assets reaching $807 billion, a 28% increase.\nClient flows totaled $9.5 billion, marking the third consecutive quarter of flows at or exceeding $9 billion, demonstrating consistent organic growth.\nOur aim is not just growth, but profitable growth.\nThe quarter saw our pre-tax adjusted operating margin rise to 21.4%, up 380 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points sequentially, despite ongoing low interest rates.\nOn the next page, Advice and Wealth Management's financial results were impressive, with pre-tax adjusted operating earnings of $423 million, a 56% increase.\nAdjusted operating net revenues grew by 29% to 2 billion, driven by strong client flows, a 29% increase in transactional activity, and significant market appreciation.\nRevenue showed a healthy sequential increase of 5%.\nAmeriprise Bank continued its solid growth, reaching nearly $10 billion after adding $700 million of sweep cash to its balance sheet.\nExpenses remain well-controlled, demonstrating our commitment to expense discipline.\nG&A expense increased by 3%, reflecting increased activity and the timing of performance-based compensation.\nWe remain dedicated to managing expenses and margins carefully in the future.\nMoving to the next page, Asset Management had another strong quarter, driven by exceptional investment performance and sustained inflows, resulting in outstanding financial results.\nNet inflows were 8.1 billion, excluding legacy insurance partners, continuing the trend of improved solid flow.\nAdjusted operating revenues increased by 32% to $879 million, reflecting the cumulative benefit of net inflows and market appreciation.\nRevenues increased by 6% sequentially.\nOur fee rate remained strong at 52 basis points, reflecting the momentum we're seeing across both equity and fixed income strategies.\nExpenses were well-managed and in line with expectations given the revenue environment.\nG&A expenses grew by 12%, mainly due to the timing of compensation expenses related to strong business performance, foreign exchange translation, and higher volume-related expenses.\nAs with AWM, we will continue to manage expenses carefully going forward.\nPre-tax adjusted operating earnings grew by 79%, and we achieved a 45% margin.\nWe anticipate strong financial performance to continue, with margins expected to remain in the mid-40% range in the near term, driven by current robust equity markets.\nTurning to the next page, Retirement and Protection Solutions continued to perform as expected in this environment.\nPre-tax adjusted operating earnings were $182 million.\nSales increased significantly compared to the pandemic-affected prior year, surpassing pre-COVID levels and resulting in higher distribution expenses.\nThe prior year's earnings were positively impacted by lower surrenders and withdrawals due to the pandemic.\nWe continue to reduce our risk profile by increasing sales of retirement products without living benefits.\nRetirement sales increased by 88% during the quarter, with two-thirds of sales in products without living benefits.\nThis has shifted the overall book, with only 62% of our block now having living benefit riders, down over 200 basis points from a year ago.\nIn Protection, sales nearly doubled, with a significant increase in higher-margin VUL and a substantial decline in IUL.\nThis shift in product mix for both Retirement and Protection is expected to continue.\nMoving to the final slide on the balance sheet.\nOur balance sheet fundamentals remain extremely strong, including a $3 billion liquidity position at the parent company and $2 billion in excess capital, not including the capital release from the recently announced fixed annuity transaction.\nAdjusted operating return on equity for the quarter remained strong at 37.5%.\nWe returned $585 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks and are on track to return 90% of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders for the year.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Brady Corporation reserves all rights to this teleconference and prohibits unauthorized rebroadcasting.\nYour involvement in the Q&A portion indicates your agreement to be recorded.\nDespite challenges from COVID-19, inflation, and logistics issues, Brady's team performed admirably.\nThe team's ability to navigate difficult economic conditions and deliver results for customers and shareholders is commendable.\nSales grew by an impressive 16% this quarter, with earnings per share increasing by 4.7%.\nExcluding amortization effects, earnings per share rose even more significantly at 9.1%.\nAlong with strong revenue and earnings growth, we maintain a robust financial position.\nWe distributed over $30 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases this quarter.\nOur net cash position remains strong at over $90 million.\nThe WPS division experienced a 7.8% decline in sales.\nThis decrease was primarily due to challenging year-over-year comparisons.\nLast year, our WPS team excelled in providing COVID-related products to customers.\nThe demand for these items, including social distancing signs and personal protective equipment, has since decreased, leading to difficult comparisons.\nA more accurate assessment of our WPS business involves comparing current sales to pre-COVID levels in fiscal 2020, which shows growth.\nOur Identification Solutions division continues to deliver exceptional results, with 25.4% sales growth and 21.2% segment profit growth.\nExcluding amortization expenses, segment profit would have increased by an impressive 26.4%.\nThe Identification Solutions division remains a strong and high-performing segment of our business.\nMoving forward, our main objectives are to drive organic sales growth and maintain excellent customer service despite logistical challenges.\nWe aim to implement necessary cost and pricing measures to counteract inflationary pressures and restore pre-pandemic gross margin levels.\nWe're also focused on integrating recent acquisitions and strategically deploying capital to enhance long-term shareholder value.\nIn our ID Solutions division, we're increasing R&D investments, including those needed to maximize benefits from recent acquisitions.\nOur historical focus on R&D is yielding results, with an accelerated rate of new product launches and widening the gap between us and competitors who lack similar resources for R&D investment.\nWe're enhancing our online presence by upgrading websites and investing in digital marketing talent while expanding our sales force and geographical reach into underserved markets.\nWe're implementing significant automation improvements in our factories and distribution centers, which is crucial during a time of labor scarcity and rising costs.\nOur strong product lineup, sales-driving investments, and efficiency improvements give us confidence in continued strong organic sales growth and healthy margins for our ID Solutions division in fiscal 2022 and beyond.\nIn our Workplace Safety division, we're leveraging our common web platform to quickly adapt to market changes using improved market intelligence.\nWe've boosted investments in new product development and increased the pace of product launches to raise the percentage of high-value proprietary products sold, which will positively impact profit margins.\nWe're significantly increasing advertising spend and headcount in certain underperforming areas to drive future revenue growth.\nThese investments led to reduced segment profit this quarter but are expected to increase revenues as the fiscal year progresses.\nOur Workplace Safety division is on the right track, and I'm confident that our recent changes and investments will foster long-term sales and profit growth.\nWhile investing in organic sales growth, we're also working to streamline our SG&A cost structure to fund sales growth initiatives while reducing overall SG&A expenses.\nWe're focused on becoming a more efficient manufacturer through automation wherever possible.\nIn addition to driving organic sales growth and improving organizational efficiency, we're actively integrating three acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of last year, including expanding our industrial track and trace solutions.\nMuch of the increased R&D spending is related to investments needed to develop a comprehensive solution that will help us enter faster-growing markets and accelerate sales growth in the coming years.\nI'm confident we'll continue to see revenue growth in future quarters.\nHowever, we're experiencing inflationary pressures across various cost categories, from wages to freight to raw materials, and we've faced challenges in securing certain products, including chips and select items sourced from Asia.\nGenerally, we've overcome these shortages, but it has resulted in increased freight charges due to more frequent use of air freight.\nDespite these inflationary pressures, our gross profit margin remained a strong 48.2%, matching the fourth quarter of last year.\nHowever, our cost increases haven't been sufficient to fully offset rising expenses, resulting in a year-over-year gross margin decline of about 70 basis points.\nConsequently, we're implementing additional price increases across many product lines to catch up with rapidly rising costs.\nWe believe these gross margin challenges are temporary and expect to return to our historical gross margin levels of nearly 50% in the near future.\nDespite the challenging logistical environment, Brady is well-positioned for the remainder of this fiscal year and beyond.\nI'm confident in our ability to deliver results for our customers, employees, and shareholders.\nI'll now provide specific commentary on our Identification Solutions and Workplace Safety businesses.\nLet's begin the financial review with slide number 3.\nFirst quarter sales reached $321.5 million, a 16% increase compared to the same quarter last year, while GAAP pre-tax earnings rose 5.8% to $44.7 million.\nEarnings this quarter were impacted by a significant increase in amortization expense from acquisitions completed at the end of last year.\nExcluding amortization expense from all periods, our pre-tax earnings would have increased by 11.3% to $48.5 million.\nGAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.67, a 4.7% increase over last year's first quarter.\nExcluding amortization expense, earnings per share would have increased by 9.1% to $0.72 this quarter, compared to $0.66 in the first quarter of last year.\nOverall, Q1 was another strong quarter financially, despite the logistical challenges and inflationary pressures mentioned earlier.\nMoving to slide 4, you'll see our quarterly sales trends.\nOur 16% sales increase comprised 7% organic sales growth, an 8.3% increase from acquisitions, and a 0.7% increase from foreign currency translation.\nOrganic sales growth in our ID Solutions Business was a robust 13.2% in Q1.\nOur Workplace Safety business faced tough comparables due to strong COVID-related product sales in last year's first quarter.\nAs a result, we saw a decline in WPS organic sales of 8.6% this quarter.\nComparing our sales levels to the pre-pandemic period (first quarter of fiscal 2020), our total sales are up 12% over pre-pandemic levels.\nBy division, Identification Solutions is 15.6% above pre-pandemic levels, while Workplace Safety is 1.2% above.\nThis strong performance against both last year and pre-pandemic periods is a direct result of our ongoing investments and the sales momentum we developed just before the pandemic hit.\nIf you look at slide 5, you'll notice the trend in our gross profit margin.\nOur gross profit margin decreased slightly from 48.9% in Q1 last year to 48.2% this quarter.\nAs Michael pointed out, we're experiencing inflationary pressures and challenges in recruiting for manufacturing positions.\nHowever, we're implementing automation, improving efficiency, and selectively raising prices to address these issues.\nSlide 6 shows the trend in our SG&A expenses.\nOur SG&A expenses rose from $83 million in Q1 last year to $96.7 million this quarter.\nThe increase in SG&A was largely due to expenses from three acquisitions completed near the end of last year and higher amortization costs.\nAmortization expenses increased from $1.4 million in Q1 last year to $3.8 million this quarter.\nAs a percentage of sales, SG&A remained relatively stable at 30.1% this quarter compared to 30% in Q1 last year.\nExcluding amortization expenses, SG&A as a percentage of sales actually decreased from 29.5% last year to 28.9% this year.\nSlide 7 displays our R&D investment trends.\nWe invested $13.9 million in R&D this quarter.\nWe're dedicated to increasing our R&D investments as we see opportunities in our core business and in developing a comprehensive industrial track and trace platform.\nThese R&D investments are crucial for driving Brady's long-term sales growth and maintaining our gross profit margins.\nSlide 8 shows our pre-tax income trends.\nOur pre-tax earnings grew by 5.8% on a GAAP basis and by 11.3% when excluding amortization expenses.\nSlide 9 illustrates our after-tax income and earnings per share trends.\nOur GAAP earnings per share increased by 4.7%, from $0.64 in Q1 last year to $0.67 this quarter.\nExcluding the after-tax impact of amortization, our earnings per share would have grown by 9.1%.\nSlide 10 provides a summary of our cash generation.\nWe generated $27.5 million in cash flow from operating activities and $16.2 million in free cash flow this quarter.\nWhile our underlying cash flow was strong, we deliberately invested in inventories and capital expenditures.\nWe purchased two previously leased manufacturing facilities for $7.6 million, which were ROI positive investments.\nWe also increased our inventories by about $30 million over the last six months to prioritize customer service and product availability.\nDespite returning over $30 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, increasing capital expenditures, and boosting inventory levels, we still maintained a net cash position exceeding $90 million as of October 31.\nOur robust balance sheet positions us well for additional value-enhancing activities, including R&D investments, acquisitions, and shareholder returns.\nOur capital allocation strategy remains unchanged and continues to serve us well.\nWe prioritize funding organic sales and efficiency opportunities throughout economic cycles, including investments in new product development, sales resources, IT improvements, and automation.\nWe also focus on returning cash to shareholders through dividends, having increased our annual dividend for 36 consecutive years.\nAfter funding organic investments and dividends, we deploy cash for synergistic acquisitions or share buybacks when we perceive a disconnect between intrinsic value and market price.\nSlide 12 outlines our guidance for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2022.\nWe maintain our full-year diluted earnings per share guidance, excluding amortization, at $3.12 to $3.32 per share.\nOn a GAAP basis, our guidance remains at $2.90 to $3.10 per share.\nThis guidance includes an increase in after-tax amortization expense of about $6 million, from $5.5 million in fiscal 2021 to $11.5 million in fiscal 2022.\nWe expect short-term gross profit margin challenges to persist through Q2, which is typically our lowest quarter.\nWe anticipate increased benefits from pricing actions and efficiency projects in Q3 and Q4, with the majority of earnings-per-share growth expected in these quarters.\nWe project total sales growth to exceed 12% for the full year, including both organic growth and growth from recent acquisitions.\nWe'll continue to invest in organic sales growth, seek strategic acquisitions, and drive efficiency gains while controlling non-revenue-generating expenses.\nOur capital allocation strategy includes ongoing investments in our organic business and industrial track-and-trace initiatives, returning funds to shareholders through dividends and opportunistic buybacks, and pursuing acquisitions with clear strategic fit and appropriate pricing.\nWe bought back $18.9 million worth of shares last quarter and will continue to leverage our strong balance sheet to drive long-term shareholder value.\nPotential risks to our guidance include strengthening of the US dollar against major currencies, worsening logistics affecting customer commitments, and further inflationary pressures that we cannot offset quickly enough.\nSlide 13 presents the Q1 financial results for our Identification Solutions (IDS) business.\nIDS sales grew by 25.4% to $248.6 million, comprising 13.2% organic growth, 11.6% acquisition growth, and 0.6% from foreign currency translation.\nOrganic sales in IDS were strong compared to both Q1 last year and previous sequential quarters.\nOur focus on sustainable efficiency gains partially offset input cost increases.\nSegment profit as a percentage of sales decreased slightly from 20.3% to 19.6% year-over-year.\nExcluding the increase in amortization, segment profit as a percentage of sales would have increased from 21% to 21.1%.\nRegionally, organic sales in Asia showed strong growth, exceeding 15% compared to Q1 last year.\nFor the fourth consecutive quarter, Asian organic sales have grown by over 10%.\nDespite ongoing lockdowns in most of the first quarter, EMEA's organic sales increased by more than 15%.\nOur European team excelled in driving sales growth while managing interruptions caused by lockdowns.\nThe Americas experienced nearly 12% organic sales growth.\nWe observed growth across all product lines and regions during the quarter, with particular satisfaction in the healthcare product line's recovery, showing approximately 11% organic sales growth.\nOverall, sales trends and concepts are highly encouraging.\nWe continue to prioritize our commitment to research and development.\nWe've increased our investments to develop a comprehensive industrial track and trace solution.\nWhile we're likely two years away from a complete track and trace solution, we're already seeing positive synergies from recent acquisitions, which we expect to increase due to complementary product portfolios and more complete offerings from Code, Magicard, and Nordic ID.\nThese acquisitions are exceeding expectations and provide valuable technologies that enhance our product range and increase Brady's value to customers.\nWe're allocating considerable resources to our track and trace product offerings.\nHowever, we're not neglecting R&D investments in other areas like printers and materials.\nWe've maintained our consistent introduction of new printers by releasing the J4300 Brady Jet Label Printer.\nThis inkjet printer, combined with highly efficient proprietary materials, balances safety and compliance label complexity with industrial environment demands.\nOur industrial inkjet printers help customers save time by quickly creating durable, high-quality labels, signs, and tags for safer, more efficient workplaces.\nBrady's combination of top-tier printers and high-performance materials distinguishes us from competitors, ensuring crucial information remains visible and secure in any environment.\nIn essence, Brady's printers and materials are designed for optimal performance in the most challenging conditions.\nOur R&D pipeline is robust, and we continue to introduce innovative solutions that help customers solve problems and improve efficiency and effectiveness.\nI'm enthusiastic about our ID Solutions business developments and how the acquisitions of Code, Nordic ID, and Magicard will further boost our growth.\nWe're enhancing customer service, investing in our future, and optimizing our cost structure.\nThese positive revenue trends, coupled with strong cost discipline, will help counteract inflationary pressures and create a promising outlook for our IDS division.\nSlide 14 provides a summary of Workplace Safety's financial performance.\nWPS sales decreased by 7.8%, comprising an organic sales decline of 8.6% and a 0.8% increase from foreign currency.\nThis sales decline was mainly due to challenging comparisons with last year's first quarter.\nOur WPS business performed exceptionally well during the pandemic last year, supplying customers with numerous COVID-19-related products, but demand for these items has significantly decreased since then.\nThis quarter's WPS sales of $72.9 million surpassed pre-pandemic levels from the first quarter of fiscal 2020.\nDespite periodic shutdowns, our European WPS team excelled in expanding its customer base.\nFor customers who initially purchased COVID-related products, our team successfully introduced them to our core safety and identification products.\nOur Australian business performed similarly to our European operations.\nDuring the pandemic, our Australian business grew organic sales by over 10% in last year's first quarter.\nConsidering the challenging comparisons, we were pleased with this quarter's sales volumes, which exceeded pre-pandemic levels.\nWe've expanded our Australian customer base over recent quarters and continue to find ways to enhance our digital marketing approach to retain new customers and convert them into long-term repeat clients.\nNorth American sales of COVID-related products also declined this quarter, and this decrease was not fully offset by our non-COVID product offerings, resulting in a decline in organic sales in the Americas.\nAs mentioned earlier, we've invested in improving certain underperforming WPS businesses, including our US operation serving micro businesses.\nWe've incurred start-up costs for a new US facility, invested in personnel, and increased advertising spending.\nThese incremental investments totaled approximately $2.5 million.\nWhile these investments negatively impacted WPS profitability this quarter, we believe they are crucial for achieving sustainable, long-term profitable growth in our WPS business.\nIn addition to these investments, our WPS business experienced gross margin compression due to raw materials, freight, and wage inflation.\nLike our IDS business, we're taking steps to counter these cost increases.\nWPS segment profit was $2.3 million, compared to $8 million in last year's first quarter.\nThis profit reduction was directly related to decreased sales volumes, the incremental investments mentioned, and significant cost pressures.\nOur WPS team members are attentive to customer needs, modifying marketing campaigns to reach new customers and industries, and working diligently to address underperforming businesses within the portfolio.\nOur Workplace Safety business faces one more quarter of moderately difficult comparisons, but we're establishing a foundation for a strong recovery.\nI'm proud of Brady's role in the ongoing fight against COVID-19.\nIdentification Solutions and Workplace Safety products assist companies with social distancing.\nOur products help schools reopen safely, and our safety and identification products are used by frontline workers worldwide.\nNow, our products are helping customers increase efficiency to meet their own customer demands.\nThe pandemic is not over, and its financial impacts persist.\nThroughout the pandemic, we've invested in growth and efficiencies, and this continuous investment will enable us to maintain our strong positive momentum.\nBrady is in a favorable financial position.\nWe've achieved record earnings per share.\nOur earnings are up, and our balance sheet is robust.\nWe maintain a net cash position even after completing three acquisitions last year and returning over $30 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends this quarter.\nWe will continue investing in R&D, sales-generating resources, and capacity-enhancing capital expenditures, while tightly controlling non-revenue-generating expenses and addressing global logistical issues and inflationary pressures.\nI'm very proud of our team's performance during this challenging period.\nTheir ability to handle uncertainty, think creatively, and solve problems quickly, all while maintaining a long-term perspective, has built a solid foundation for Brady's future.\nLet's now begin the Q&A session.\nOperator, please provide instructions to our listeners.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'll begin by discussing the environment and economy before delving into our financial results.\nIn the past three months, three significant events have occurred that have reduced uncertainty, which is always beneficial.\nThe most important development from last year was the vaccine's release in November, which is now being administered.\nThe election uncertainty we faced previously has been resolved.\nWe also received a stimulus package, which, while less significant than the other two events, is still positive news.\nWe hadn't anticipated a stimulus being approved until the new administration took office.\nI'm pleased it was passed a few weeks ago.\nLooking ahead to 2021, it appears to be a year with strong potential in the latter half, possibly starting as early as the second quarter.\nHowever, I anticipate a slow first quarter as the positive news needs time to translate into reality.\nThe main risk remains vaccine distribution and, to some extent, new coronavirus variants.\nThere is still some uncertainty, but significantly less than 90 days ago.\nWe feel confident as we prepare our budget for the year.\nWe've assumed a slow first quarter, which is typical for us, but this year will be particularly slow for the reasons I mentioned.\nWe expect the pipeline to grow and our growth strategy to begin implementation in the second quarter, with full execution in the second half of the year.\nReflecting on this quarter, I'm pleased with our results of $0.89 per share or $85.7 million in earnings.\nThis is an improvement from $0.70 last quarter.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2019, which seems like a long time ago, we earned $0.91 per share.\nConsidering what we've been through this year, it's impressive to be so close to our fourth quarter 2019 earnings per share.\nNet Interest Income was approximately $193 million, which is $6 million more than last quarter and about $8 million more than the fourth quarter of 2019.\nPre-Provision Net Revenue decreased by $10 million compared to last quarter but showed a slight increase compared to the fourth quarter of the previous year.\nLeslie will explain some unique items in the expense category, mainly related to compensation.\nWe significantly reduced our variable compensation accrual in the second and third quarters.\nWe've adjusted it upwards, though not completely, as variable compensation will still be lower than in previous years, but not as low as we were accruing in the second and third quarters.\nWe also made a policy change to provide rollover paid time off to our employees due to the current circumstances, which cost a couple million dollars.\nThe main story continues to be deposit generation and deposit costs.\nWe had another strong quarter.\nTotal cost of deposits decreased by 14 basis points.\nWe were at 57 basis points last quarter and ended this quarter at 43 basis points.\nOur spot cost of funds as of December 31 was 36 basis points.\nWe're starting this quarter at 36 basis points and expect to decrease from there.\nI'm confident that this quarter will be another strong one in terms of reducing cost of funds.\nI believe we'll end up in the low 30s and on a spot basis, I'm confident we'll end up with a two handle.\nOur average non-interest-bearing demand deposits grew by $966 million, which is very strong.\nI always emphasize that one quarter doesn't establish a trend.\nIt's best to look at four-quarter averages or 12-month numbers to get a true sense of business performance.\nHowever, no matter how you analyze it, the last four quarters, or even just the last quarter, have shown very strong performance in deposits.\nOur non-interest-bearing demand deposits now represent over 25% of total deposits.\nA year ago, we were at 18%.\nWe still have more work to do and expect this trend to continue into next year, with the goal of slowly working towards 30% non-interest-bearing demand deposits.\nAs we predicted, risk rating migration has slowed significantly.\nIn the first nine months of 2020, there was downward rating migration on $2.1 billion in loans.\nThis quarter, it was only $169 million.\nProvisioning decreased substantially.\nIn fact, we had a small net recovery of $1.6 million.\nWe had reported $3.6 billion in loans on deferral during the summer.\nThat number has now decreased to $207 million, or about 1% of total loans.\nWe have $587 million in loans that were modified under the CARES Act.\nThese modifications don't appear as Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) under the CARES Act.\nMost of these modifications are interest-only modifications for 9 to 12 months.\nMany of these modifications are in the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) and hospitality portfolios, particularly hotels.\nWe believe we've identified most borrowers who will need temporary relief or deferral at this point.\nNon-performing loans increased slightly to $244 million, which is about 1.02% of loans.\nExcluding government-guaranteed SBA loans in this category, it's about 80 basis points.\nIn our Commercial and Industrial (C&I) sub-segment, non-performing loans actually decreased.\nThe net charge-off rate remained stable at 26 basis points for the year.\nRegarding Net Interest Margin (NIM), it was 2.33% for the quarter, a slight improvement from 2.32% last quarter.\nTotal loans grew by $87 million, and deposits increased by $899 million, of which $219 million was non-interest-bearing demand deposits.\nThese are end-of-period numbers, whereas earlier I provided average demand deposit figures.\nBook value has increased to $32.05, higher than $31.33 at this time last year.\nOur capital position is strong.\nThe board met yesterday and reinstated our share buyback program.\nWe had about $45 million left in the program, which has now been unfrozen.\nThe board wants us to complete this before discussing additional repurchases.\nOur Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio is 12.6% at the holding company level and 13.9% at the bank level.\nWe declared our usual $0.23 per share dividend.\nRegarding our return-to-work strategy, not much has changed.\nWe're still working remotely and expect to continue doing so for at least the next two or three months before reassessing.\nWe've had more COVID-19 cases in the company this quarter compared to previous quarters, but none severe enough to impact our operations.\nLooking forward, we're eagerly anticipating increased economic activity and our participation in the next business cycle, which seems to be starting now.\nOur focus remains on building a relationship-based commercial bank serving small and middle-market businesses.\nWe'll continue to emphasize building core business through non-interest-bearing demand deposits, identifying niche markets that larger banks overlook, and investing in technology and innovation rather than just branches and locations.\nThe focus has shifted to technology and solving customer pain points through innovation.\nWe haven't forgotten about our 2.0 initiatives.\nIt wasn't just a temporary exercise but aimed at changing our culture, which we'll continue to push forward.\nWe launched a new initiative called iCARE (Inclusive Community of Advocacy Respect and Equality) earlier last year.\nThis has been in development since last summer and was announced internally about two and a half months ago, receiving positive feedback.\nIt represents our organizational effort to build a culture that celebrates and intentionally promotes diversity within the bank.\nThis is not just rhetoric.\nWe are taking concrete actions to back up our words and implement initiatives.\nWe believe that if everyone contributes even a small amount towards positive change, it can collectively make a significant societal impact.\nThis initiative has us very enthusiastic.\nOur staff members are eager about this project and there will be more developments to come.\nAllow me to check something.\nI'll hand it over to Tom now.\nHe will provide more details on the business aspects before Leslie delves into the financial figures.\nLet me begin by discussing deposits and providing more information about our deposit portfolio.\nAs Raj stated, total deposits increased by $899 million this quarter, with non-interest-bearing demand deposits growing by $219 million.\nThe composition of our deposits continues to improve.\nWe allowed higher-cost deposits to decrease this quarter, continuing a trend from previous quarters, as time deposits fell by $1.1 billion.\nLet me provide more details about our funding costs.\nThe total cost of funds plus cost of deposits decreased to 43 basis points this quarter.\nAt the end of December, the annual percentage yield on total deposits was 36 basis points, down from 49 basis points at the end of September and 142 basis points a year ago.\nWe continue to make progress in this area.\nThe rate on interest-bearing deposits was 48 basis points as of December 31, compared to 65 basis points on September 30 and 171 basis points a year ago.\nWe're observing reductions in deposit costs across all business segments and products, which is a widespread trend.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $1 billion in certificates of deposit with an average rate of 1.61% that hadn't been repriced since the last Federal Reserve rate cut in March 2020.\nIn the first quarter of this year, a significant portion of that, just under $800 million, will be repriced.\nAdditionally, some CDs that matured and were repriced early in the cycle will be repriced downward again at their next maturity date.\nThere's a substantial difference between these rates and our current rates, which are around 25 basis points.\nWe currently see strong pipelines and opportunities for core deposit growth across all business lines.\nIt's more challenging to estimate deposit pipelines and the timing of new treasury management relationships, but we expect continued growth in non-interest-bearing demand deposits at current levels.\nWe'll likely see more time deposits decrease while the overall composition of the portfolio continues to improve.\nSome maturing CDs are moving into money market accounts, but at significantly lower rates.\nRegarding loans, as Raj mentioned, total loans grew by $87 million in the fourth quarter, while operating leases decreased by $13 million.\nTo provide more details on specific segments, the residential portfolio increased by $408 million in the fourth quarter, with $330 million of that in the Ginnie Mae EBO segment.\nThe mortgage warehouse sector continued to perform well.\nTotal commitments grew by $90.5 million for the quarter, ending the year at slightly over $2.1 billion in mortgage warehouse commitments, making the entire quarter and year very strong in this area.\nOverall, commercial real estate loans decreased by $89 million for the quarter, with multi-family loans declining by $171 million, of which $151 million was in the New York market.\nBeyond that, we saw expansion in other real estate business segments.\nWhen looking at loans and operating leases in the Business Finance Group, including both franchise and equipment, we saw a decrease of $124 million this quarter due to COVID-19's impact, particularly on the franchise portfolio.\nWe've focused on portfolio management and exposure reduction rather than new production over the last few quarters.\nLooking ahead to 2021 and breaking down our expectations for different business lines:\nWe anticipate continued strong growth in Ginnie Mae EBO and mortgage warehousing businesses.\nWe expect the Commercial and Industrial business to return to more normal growth as the economy improves and vaccines are distributed, projecting high single-digit growth for 2021, mainly in the latter half of the year.\nWe forecast a low single-digit decline in Commercial Real Estate for 2021.\nWe still have concerns about valuations in certain portfolio segments, with hotel and retail sectors likely facing challenges for much of this year.\nWe expect good growth in small business lending in 2021, having invested significantly in technology and time to expand this area.\nIn the franchise sector, we anticipate continued runoff, probably around 20% in 2021, as we work through that portfolio.\nPinnacle is expected to decline slightly, in the mid-single digits, but this could change if corporate tax rates are adjusted, given the current competitive landscape from an interest perspective.\nRegarding the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), the overall process is going well.\nWe're in the forgiveness stage for 3,500 loans made in the first round, which is proceeding smoothly.\nAbout 700 loans have been forgiven so far, and we expect this to continue in the first quarter of 2021.\nWe're participating in the Second Draw program for eligible businesses that received First Draw PPP loans, which recently opened and will be available to clients in that phase.\nWe're expecting about 50% to 60% of clients from the First Draw to request Second Draw loans.\nOverall, the PPP process is progressing well.\nRegarding loans with granted deferrals, I'd direct you to slide 16 in the supplemental deck for more details.\nStarting with commercial loans, only $63 million were still under short-term deferral as of December 31.\n$575 million of commercial loans had been modified under the CARES Act.\nCombined, this totaled $638 million, or approximately 4% of the total commercial portfolio as of December 31.\nAs expected, the Commercial Real Estate Hotel segment was most impacted, with $343 million or 55% of the segment modified as of December 31.\nMost of our hotel exposure is in Florida, primarily in leisure properties, which we expect to rebound sooner.\nWe've seen occupancy rates improve in recent months, and surveys suggest companies are returning to business travel.\nWhile our hotel portfolio isn't focused on business travel, we anticipate overall travel markets improving as we progress through 2021.\nIn the franchise sector, 8% or $46 million of the portfolio was on short-term deferral or had been modified as of December 31, compared to $76 million or 12% on short-term deferrals as of September 30, and 74% that were granted initial 90-day payment deferrals.\n$48 million or 67% of our cruise line exposure has been modified under the CARES Act as of December 31.\nNearly 80% of total commercial deferrals and modifications and almost 60% of loans rated substandard or doubtful are from portfolio segments initially identified as needing heightened monitoring due to potential pandemic impacts.\nThese same segments continue to be the focus of this activity, and we don't currently see significant difficulties arising in other segments.\nFor residential loans, excluding the Ginnie Mae early buyout portfolio, $144 million are on short-term deferral, with an additional $12 million modified under longer-term CARES Act repayment plans as of December 31.\nThis represents about 2% of the residential portfolio.\nOf the $525 million in residential loans initially granted payment deferrals, $144 million or 27% are still on deferral, while $381 million or 73% have rolled off.\nOf those that have rolled off, $362 million or 95% are now making regular payments, with only 5% or $19 million not resuming a regular payment program.\nTo clarify, when we refer to loans modified under the CARES Act, we mean loans excluded from modifications other than short-term deferrals, which would likely be classified as Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) if not for the CARES Act.\nMost of these have taken the form of 9 to 12 months interest-only deferrals.\nAs Raj mentioned, we're still seeing good overall rent collections in the office market.\nDepending on the location, we're seeing about 90% collection rates in New York and 97% in Florida.\nMulti-family collections are at 90% in New York and about 96% in Florida, while larger retail loans are seeing collection rates in the low 90% range.\nRegarding hotel occupancy in the Hospitality segment, all our Florida properties are now open, as are two of the three properties in New York.\nIn Florida, we continue to see improvements in occupancy, with an average rate of about 46% for the quarter.\nDecember is typically a stronger travel month in Florida, and we're entering the peak season.\nIn December, we saw occupancy rates as high as 60% in some areas, but generally in the upper 40s to low 50s range.\nThe Hotel segment is gradually showing some improvement.\nMore details are needed about what's happening in the franchise and fitness spaces.\nConcepts with significant drive-through and delivery capabilities tend to be performing well.\nPopular quick-service restaurant concepts like pizza and chicken are doing very well, with many posting double-digit same-store sales increases.\nIn-dining concepts are still facing challenges and showing weakness.\nSome segments are mixed depending on whether locations have delivery-based economic models or are situated in malls.\nOverall, the franchise area is seeing improvement.\nThe fitness sector has made progress since our previous update.\nNearly all our stores are now open, except for those in California, particularly around Los Angeles.\nApproximately 90% of our stores are currently operational, though not all at full capacity.\nThis is the highest rate of openings we've seen since the pandemic began.\nOut of our 280 stores, 90% are open, with California being the main exception.\nThis provides a good overview of the situation in the restaurant and fitness sectors.\nLet's begin with the popular topic of CECL and the reserve.\nThe provision for credit losses this quarter was a net credit or recovery of $1.6 million, compared to a $29.2 million provision last quarter.\nThis $1.6 million included a $1.2 million provision for funded loans and a $2.9 million recovery related to unfunded commitments.\nThe allowance for credit losses (ACL) decreased from 1.15% to 1.08% of loans this quarter, mainly due to charge-offs, which is expected under CECL.\nSlides 9 through 11 of the supplemental deck provide details on reserve changes and the composition of the provision and allowance.\nCharge-offs totaled $18.8 million for the quarter, reducing the reserve.\n$13.8 million of this was related to marking down loans that were sold or moved to held for sale at quarter-end and sold in January.\nA $34.1 million decrease in the reserve and provision was due to improved economic forecasts.\nThis was offset by a $32.8 million increase related to specific reserve increases and risk rating migration.\nWe reduced qualitative overlays by $11.4 million, which is expected as more information about individual borrowers becomes available and is incorporated into quantitative modeling.\nThere was also a $15.2 million increase due to more conservative modeling assumptions for certain residential borrowers who had been on payment deferrals.\nThe lower reserve percentage also reflects the larger proportion of Ginnie Mae EBO mortgages in total loans, which carry virtually no reserve.\nKey economic forecast assumptions include national unemployment at about 6.7% for Q1 2021, remaining stable through the year and trending down to 5.4% by the end of 2022.\nReal GDP growth is expected to reach 4.1% in 2021 and 4.7% by the end of 2022.\nThe S&P 500 Index is forecast to remain relatively stable around 3,500, with the Fed funds rate staying near zero into 2023.\nThe franchise finance portfolio has the highest reserve level at 6.6%, followed by CRE at 1.5% and C&I at 1.3%.\nThe residential portfolio's reserve remained relatively stable quarter-over-quarter, with reductions from improved economic forecasts offset by changes in modeling assumptions.\nRisk rating migration details are provided on slides 23 through 26 of the deck.\nWe saw additional downward migration this quarter, though at a slower pace, as expected.\nThe largest categories of migration to substandard accrual were in CRE, specifically hotel, multi-family New York, and retail segments, along with some cruise line credits.\nIn franchise, the level of criticized and classified assets actually declined, but some fitness concepts moved from special mention to substandard.\nNon-performing loans increased by about $44 million, with the largest increases in multi-family, residential (as some loans failed to resume regular payments after deferral), and a small amount in franchise finance fitness.\nThe investment portfolio's fair value mark continued to recover, now showing a net unrealized gain of $85.6 million, with no expected credit losses.\nThe net interest margin (NIM) increased by 1 basis point to 2.33%, with the yield on earning assets declining by 12 basis points, a smaller decrease than the previous quarter.\nThe cost of deposits decreased by 14 basis points quarter-over-quarter, with nearly $800 million in time deposits set to mature and reprice lower in Q1.\nWe adjusted variable compensation accruals by $6.6 million due to better-than-expected operating results in the second half of the year.\nA $2.2 million accrual was made for rollover vacation time due to the COVID pandemic.\nThere was also an increase in accruals for RSU and PSU awards resulting from the stock price increase.\nLooking ahead to 2021, we expect mid-single digit loan growth, concentrated in the second half of the year, excluding PPP loan runoff.\nWe anticipate mid-single digit deposit growth, with mid-teens non-interest DDA growth as we continue to optimize the portfolio mix.\nThe NIM is expected to increase for the year, with a boost in Q1 from PPP forgiveness, which should largely be a first-quarter event.\nProvisions should be modest if economic forecasts remain stable, with higher provisions in the second half as loan growth picks up.\nWe expect net charge-offs to exceed provisions for the year, leading to a reduction in reserves.\nNon-interest income is expected to increase in deposit service charges and commercial card revenue, with lease financing income stabilizing after a decline in Q1.\nExpenses are projected to increase by mid-single digits, mainly due to compensation and technology-related costs.\nThe tax rate is expected to be around 25%, excluding discrete items, assuming no change in the corporate tax rate.\nApproximately 3 million dividend equivalent rights will expire in Q1 2021, adding $0.02 to $0.03 per quarter to EPS.\nSummary:

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The current discussion is being streamed on our company website, atimetals.com.\nBob Wetherbee, President and CEO, along with Donald Newman, Senior VP and CFO, are joining us for this call.\nWe won't be using visual aids during Bob and Don's presentation today.\nThey will concentrate on key points and main takeaways.\nAdditional information and specifics about our performance and outlook can be found in the slides available on our website.\nIt's an understatement to call 2020 a difficult year, particularly for those in the commercial aviation sector.\nDespite these obstacles, our dedicated ATI team continues to meet the challenge, guided by the strategic priorities we set at the beginning of the pandemic.\nWe're focusing on controlling what's within our power, thus speeding up cost reductions and improving our position.\nOur robust financial position enables us to withstand upcoming challenges and support our expansion.\nLet's start with our current situation.\nOur close customer relationships continue to provide us with real-time insights into market conditions.\nThis gives us the confidence to make crucial decisions, adjusting our cost structures and inventory levels to match changing demand expectations.\nWe've acted decisively and swiftly to restructure ATI for the future.\nOur third quarter financial performance significantly surpassed our earlier projections due to these proactive measures.\nWe fast-tracked benefits from our cost-cutting initiatives through aggressive implementation.\nThis included reducing capacity, shutting down facilities, and minimizing fixed and variable costs through restructuring programs, aligning expenses with demand declines, and trimming overhead.\nWe've meticulously reviewed all administrative and non-production related expenses, maintaining only what was essential.\nOverall, we've greatly increased the flexibility of our cost structure.\nExpenses previously considered fixed can now be adjusted in line with demand, giving us substantial control over our costs.\nThis will have a lasting impact from the actions we've taken during this crisis.\nThroughout all of this, our employees have been remarkable.\nThey're prioritizing each other's safety while efficiently delivering critical materials and components to our customers.\nThe frequent production adjustments we've made in response to demand shifts and market forecasts have been challenging for them.\nWork schedules and shift patterns have fluctuated as a result.\nI deeply appreciate the entire team's effort, dedication, and personal economic sacrifices.\nTheir ongoing actions demonstrate a shared commitment to ATI's future success.\nThe deliberate steps we've taken and will continue to take are vital to our ability to emerge as a stronger company as the economy recovers.\nLooking ahead, we're confident demand will eventually rebound.\nWe expect these challenging times to persist for several quarters, but we believe we're nearing the bottom with some signs of upcoming stability.\nNow, let's discuss our balance sheet and the strong position it puts us in.\nWe've worked hard to ensure adequate liquidity levels and a manageable debt maturity schedule.\nOur robust financial position gives us confidence to navigate the COVID crisis and fuel our future growth.\nWe're driving growth in three ways: investing capital based on customer commitments to enable strategic market share gains and new business awards starting in 2021, organically expanding our presence in adjacent high-value markets where our expertise is valued, and pursuing acquisitions when the time and economics are right to rapidly build scale, expand capabilities, and capture profitable core market opportunities.\nAs we achieve our growth objectives, we'll strengthen our presence in aerospace and defense materials and components.\nWe'll continue leveraging our material science capabilities and advanced process technologies to generate aerospace-like margins in adjacent markets.\nLooking forward, we're confident that demand for commercial aerospace products will recover.\nWe see it as growth delayed, not lost.\nRegardless of the shape of the economic recovery, whether it's V, U, or L-shaped, it's difficult to predict the timeline when you're at the bottom.\nBut we know we'll get there.\nWe're positioning ATI to emerge stronger, leaner, and more efficient, regardless of how the recovery unfolds.\nHere are some examples of how we're doing this.\nWe're expanding our presence in growth markets like defense.\nWe have strong positions in adjacent markets that are likely to recover faster than commercial aerospace and can generate similar profitability.\nFinally, our efforts to reduce costs and streamline our manufacturing footprint while investing in growth will yield long-term benefits.\nAs expected, our Q3 sales across most markets were negatively impacted by the ongoing pandemic and resulting economic downturn.\nDefense continues to be a notable positive exception.\nLet's provide more details on our expectations for the future.\nWe'll begin with the commercial aerospace sector.\nThere was a significant decrease in both jet engine and airframe compared to the previous year.\nOverall sales dropped by 60% in Q3, due to well-known factors such as quarantines, travel limitations, and reduced 737 MAX production.\nRapid reduction of jet engine customer inventories in the short term will better match future production with demand.\nJet engine product sales in Q4 will remain relatively low as quarantines slowly ease.\nSpecialty materials will likely experience a delay for a couple more quarters.\nAPI sales for airframe applications will remain low for the rest of 2020 and likely throughout 2021 as the effects of announced future wide-body production rate reductions impact the supply chain.\nIn 2021, ATI will benefit from increased engine market share and new airframe contracts.\nThe positive impact of these gains will grow as aerospace industry volumes recover.\nOur second primary market, defense, continues to be a source of strength.\nExcluding titanium armor, ATI's diverse defense sales increased by over 20% year-over-year, led by growth in naval nuclear and military aerospace sectors.\nTitanium armor plate sales decreased significantly due to timing issues for both domestic and international programs.\nWe are investing resources to accelerate growth in the defense market, using our material science capabilities and advanced process technologies to develop and produce materials and components for power and protection.\nIn the short term, we anticipate continued growth in Q4 and into 2021.\nNow, let's discuss my thoughts on three important related end markets.\nQ3 sales decreased significantly in the energy and medical markets but increased in electronics.\nIn the energy sector's oil and gas submarket, we observed a lack of end-customer demand and resulting inventory surplus, reducing exploration and downstream processing activities worldwide.\nWe expect this market to remain weak in Q4.\nA positive aspect within energy is the specialty energy submarket, including solution control, nuclear, and renewables.\nThese sales grew compared to the previous year.\nWe anticipate the specialty energy market to continue outperforming larger hydrocarbon-based markets in Q4, primarily driven by large international pollution control projects.\nOur medical market primarily consists of biomedical implants and MRI materials.\nSales compared to the previous year were lower for customers in both categories, mainly due to challenges presented by COVID.\nPatients postponed elective surgeries and hospitals restricted access for equipment suppliers.\nLooking ahead, we believe medical sales will increase as patients regain confidence to return to medical facilities, either due to an effective COVID vaccine or improved disease treatment protocols.\nLastly, electronic sales increased compared to the previous year.\nThis is primarily due to ongoing consumer goods production supporting new product launches and year-end holiday sales.\nWe anticipate modest growth trends to continue in Q4.\nI will now share highlights in three key areas: our better-than-expected Q3 financial performance, our strong balance sheet and cash position, and our expectations for Q4 and 2021.\nRegarding performance, the adjusted earnings per share loss of $0.38 in Q3 is significantly better than our previous guidance of a loss between $0.62 and $0.72 per share.\nOur Q3 performance reflects accelerated cost reductions and an improved mix in certain parts of our business.\nFirst and foremost, we are managing decisively.\nWe are maximizing external demand despite market challenges, and we're controlling what we can: our costs and capital deployment.\nConsider this: our Q3 revenue decreased by over 40% compared to the previous year, including a 60% decline in our high-value commercial aerospace business.\nThe revenue drop was largely due to market factors beyond our control.\nWhen market declines became apparent earlier this year, we responded quickly, focusing on cost containment.\nThe benefits of these efforts are evident in our Q3 results.\nDespite the 40% drop in revenue, we posted a 25% year-over-year decremental margin in Q3.\nThis is a significant improvement from the 28% decremental margins in Q2, showing clear progress resulting from quick action.\nOur cost-cutting measures are having a meaningful impact and are accelerating.\nAs Bob described, we have significantly variabilized our cost structure.\nCosts once considered fixed are now variable.\nThis means we are better prepared to handle future demand fluctuations.\nAlso, remember that structural cost savings will accelerate profitability during recovery, expanding margins and increasing our cash conversion.\nLooking beyond the income statement, our efforts to preserve free cash flow are also producing results.\nWe expect to be free cash flow positive in 2020.\nThis is made possible through capital spending discipline and our ability to convert working capital into cash.\nSwift measures were implemented to safeguard cash in the short term while maintaining growth potential and readiness for recovery.\nThe quarter concluded with total liquidity of about $950 million, including $572 million in bank cash.\nOur debt maturity schedule further reinforces our financial standing.\nThe next significant debt repayment isn't due until 2023, three fiscal years from now.\nWe're concentrating on three key areas to generate cash: cost structures, inventory levels, and capital expenditure.\nAnticipate ongoing emphasis on these three aspects in 2021 as we adjust our operations to match fluctuating market demand.\nSimultaneously, we'll continue to safeguard our robust balance sheet.\nThese strategies will allow us to navigate the downturn and seize opportunities during the upcoming upturn.\nRegarding future prospects, we foresee increasing stability in commercial aerospace demand for the fourth quarter.\nThis begins with jet engine manufacturers working to better align production with demand.\nAirframe manufacturer inventory reduction is expected to continue in the fourth quarter.\nOutside of aerospace, some industrial markets are showing slight recovery.\nOthers, particularly oil and gas, are likely to remain at low levels.\nConsequently, we predict a fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share loss between $0.36 and $0.44, comparable to our third quarter's adjusted EPS.\nShifting to our free cash flow forecast.\nOur persistent efforts to generate and conserve cash have yielded concrete results.\nWe decreased managed working capital by $115 million in the third quarter during the severe economic downturn.\nWe anticipate further inventory reductions in Q4.\nJust as the team swiftly pivoted to cost reductions, we adjusted our capital expenditure to better match demand.\nTo that end, we're once again lowering our capital spending target for the entire year.\nOur revised capex forecast range is $125 million to $135 million, about 60% of the initial 2020 projections.\nWe're increasing our full year 2020 free cash flow expectations to a range of $135 million to $150 million before pension contributions.\nWe can achieve this due to successful improvements in working capital, capex, and cost structures, a remarkable achievement in a highly challenging environment.\nLooking past the fourth quarter, we will remain vigilant to maintain or even improve upon the gains we made in 2020.\nFirstly, we believe working capital presents an opportunity for additional cash flow improvement.\nAt the end of the third quarter, managed working capital was approximately 50% of revenue.\nThis contrasts with 30% at the end of 2019.\nWe know what's required to return to those 2019 levels, and we intend to make further improvements in 2021.\nNext, we'll continue to closely monitor our capital spending.\nWe'll balance the need to fund growth and enhance manufacturing efficiency with ongoing lower demand levels.\nLastly, we will maintain discipline in cost management.\nWe will carefully preserve our structural reductions and minimize additions as volumes return to the business.\nOur current operational approach differs fundamentally from our previous methods.\nWe will strive to maintain these hard-earned gains.\nYour observations were accurate.\nIt's been a genuine team effort during highly uncertain times, and we greatly appreciate the contributions of everyone at ATI, our customers, and our suppliers.\nOur remarks today focused on what's most important to our shareholders and to us.\nThese priorities are central to our daily leadership approach.\nFirstly, we're managing decisively in times of significant market uncertainty.\nThis includes swiftly and effectively adjusting our cost structures and inventories to match demand, while ensuring our people's safety.\nSecondly, we're conserving cash and maintaining liquidity.\nWe're preserving our ability to deploy cash profitably for our shareholders.\nWe'll be ready for recovery, capitalizing on industry volume growth as well as our strategic share gains and new business awards.\nFinally, we're collaborating with our customers, both new and long-standing, who value our material science capabilities and advanced process technologies.\nOur aim is to be crucial to their success, helping them grow, tackling even greater challenges together, and in doing so, earning an ever-increasing share of their business.\nWe're taking necessary actions to emerge from this crisis as a stronger, leaner, and more focused ATI.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm accompanied by our CEO Scott Santi, Vice Chairman Chris O'Herlihy, and CFO Michael Larsen.\nWe'll discuss ITW's Q1 2020 financial performance and how the global pandemic is affecting our business and our response strategy.\nClearly, the operating environment has changed significantly compared to most of Q1.\nI'll briefly comment on our Q1 results before moving to our pandemic strategy.\nWe often mention that our decentralized entrepreneurial culture is a crucial part of ITW's success.\nThis is fundamental to our identity as a company and proves especially valuable during times of major, rapid change.\nOur team's proactive collaboration, creativity and selflessness in quickly adapting to fast-changing conditions and addressing new daily challenges exemplifies ITW at its best.\nWhile we expected our ITW team to respond this way, their performance is still remarkable.\nRegarding Q1 results, overall revenue fell 9% year-over-year, with organic revenue down 6.6%, currency impact of -1.5%, -1% from divestitures, and 0.4% from price/cost.\nMost of the organic revenue decline occurred in late March, with organic revenue dropping over 20% in the final two weeks.\nGeographically, North America declined 5%, Europe 7%, and China 24% for the quarter, though China seems to have bottomed in February and was flat year-on-year in April.\nWe continued to execute well on factors within our control despite challenging demand.\nThough revenues fell 9%, operating margin held steady at 23.6%, with 5 of 7 segments expanding margins, largely due to enterprise initiatives contributing 120 basis points to operating margin.\nAfter-tax return on invested capital was 27% and free cash flow reached $554 million, converting 98% of net income.\nLet's now discuss how we'll manage ITW through the global pandemic.\nDespite unusual and sometimes unprecedented challenges, we continue to execute at a high level with our typical focus and discipline across the company.\nDue to our work implementing our enterprise strategy over the past 7 years and progress towards our full potential, ITW is well-positioned to handle the pandemic's effects.\nToday's ITW centers on our powerful proprietary business model, with our people more skilled than ever at executing it.\nITW's 80/20 methodology and laser focus on key performance drivers in each business has served us well in good times and bad for many years.\nI'm confident this unique ITW capability will be a major asset as we navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath.\nAs mentioned, we benefit greatly from our long-standing decentralized structure and entrepreneurial culture.\nOur people think and act like owners, take accountability, and deliver results.\nThey are deeply trained in our model, strategy and values. Even in unprecedented times, they don't wait to be told what to do.\nWe've worked hard to shape our portfolio and drive consistent high-quality execution across all businesses, positioning ITW for steady top-tier long-term earnings growth in favorable conditions while building in margin cushion and diversification for resilience in tougher times.\nOur strong margins and unique business model attributes generate robust free cash flow. Combined with disciplined capital allocation, this gives us an extremely strong balance sheet and top credit ratings.\nWith this foundation, our pandemic management strategy focuses on four priorities: 1) Protect our colleagues' health and well-being, 2) Maintain excellent customer service, 3) Preserve financial strength, liquidity and strategic flexibility, and 4) Leverage ITW's strengths to fully participate in the recovery.\nChris will expand on priorities 1 and 2, Michael on priority 3, and I'll cover priority 4.\nThis is a challenging time as the world grapples with the pandemic's impacts. We've all been affected in unimaginable ways. ITW as a company and community is certainly impacted.\nThat said, our divisional leaders' owner mindset allows quick reactions to protect our people and serve customers - a key advantage in major challenges.\nTo protect our colleagues, we implemented practices to minimize COVID-19 exposure and spread, following CDC, WHO and local guidelines.\nOur teams redesigned processes for social distancing, adjusted schedules for those with childcare needs due to school closures, and implemented aggressive cleaning and sanitation.\nWe're fully compensating quarantined employees. Our sourcing team is coordinating PPE procurement to protect all employees.\nOur containment efforts have largely limited infections to isolated cases at a minority of locations, demonstrating our colleagues' commitment to safety practices.\nRegarding customer service, our teams have worked hard to keep factories safely operational. Most ITW businesses are designated as critical/essential where shelter-in-place orders exist.\nSome directly support COVID-19 response: our welding equipment makes hospital beds, structural products build temporary medical facilities, test & measurement products check medical equipment, Polymers & Fluids sanitize workplaces, and food service equipment feeds hospital patients.\nOther businesses are critical for supporting vital industries.\nThey are crucial for the well-being and economic vitality of our societies.\nWhile some facilities face mandatory closures, approximately 95% of our worldwide manufacturing capacity remains operational to serve our clients.\nWe are maintaining full availability of our service networks, especially in food equipment and test and measurement, to ensure support for essential businesses and healthcare facilities.\nAcross all divisions, we continue to deliver industry-leading performance in product and service quality and availability.\nWe are actively managing our supplier relationships to address immediate supply risks for vital materials and components, and to position ourselves for success in various recovery scenarios.\nThe primary goal of our enterprise strategy, developed over the past seven years, has positioned ITW with substantial financial strength to handle highly disruptive events like this global pandemic.\nITW is designed to thrive in challenging times like these.\nThroughout the pandemic, we will maintain our financial strength, liquidity, and strategic flexibility to capitalize on our solid financial foundation and resilient profitability during the recovery phase.\nITW possesses ample financial strength and resilience to endure the economic shock the global economy is experiencing over the coming months.\nWe are ready for this challenge.\nWe will overcome it.\nWe will emerge strongly positioned for the recovery.\nBased on our current assessment one month into the quarter, we anticipate Q2 revenues to decrease by 30% to 40% compared to last year.\nThere is considerable uncertainty about how May and June will unfold, but this is our present outlook.\nThis projection is unsurprising, given that most of our automotive OEM customers in North America and Western Europe have been essentially inactive since mid-March and are only beginning to resume production in early to mid-May.\nOur automotive OEM division will likely be the most severely impacted, with potential revenue declines of 60% to 70% year-over-year.\nSuch a sudden and significant decline in quarterly revenue is almost unheard of.\nDespite the challenging outlook, we expect ITW to generate an operating profit of $200 million to $400 million, produce over $500 million in free cash flow, and conclude Q2 with approximately $1.5 billion in cash on hand.\nWith our financial strength ensuring our ability to weather the coming months, our top priority becomes positioning ourselves to take advantage of the recovery.\nOur robust margin profile gives us a significant advantage in this area.\nThe pace of recovery, whether rapid or gradual, V-shaped or U-shaped, doesn't significantly impact our performance over the next few quarters.\nIn a rapid recovery scenario, we might end the year down 15% with margins of 19% to 21%.\nIn a slower recovery, revenues could be down 25%, but our margins would still be a strong 17% to 19%.\nThis contrasts with many of our competitors who entered the pandemic with margins at half of ours or less.\nConsequently, some may need to make significant cutbacks to survive the pandemic, potentially creating opportunities for us to gain market share during the recovery.\nOur strong margin cushion allows us to be less concerned about the speed of demand recovery in Q3 or Q4.\nWe can be fairly confident it will improve from Q2, but beyond that, it doesn't greatly affect our strategy.\nThis enables us to think long-term and position ourselves for maximum participation in the recovery.\nEnsuring we can fully support our customers as their businesses begin to accelerate and capitalizing on opportunities to take market share from struggling competitors are central to our pandemic response planning across all divisions.\nWe will need to make strategic adjustments to capacity and cost structures in businesses where we anticipate prolonged recovery periods or permanent demand impacts from the pandemic.\nAs always, we will entrust these decisions to our divisional leaders, who are best positioned to assess the recovery trajectory in their respective markets.\nMoving to slide 11.\nThe financial advantages of our enterprise strategy, combined with our efforts to optimize capital efficiency, structure, and allocation over the years, have put ITW in a very strong position entering this crisis.\nAt the end of the quarter, we had over $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand.\nThis remains true as of today.\nWe currently have virtually no short-term debt and have not issued any commercial paper.\nThe reason is simple: we don't need the cash.\nWe have access to a $2.5 billion undrawn credit facility if needed in the future, bringing our total liquidity to around $4 billion at present.\nOur net leverage is only 1.7 times, and our next debt maturity is a relatively small $350 million, not due until September 2021.\nHigh-quality earnings and strong free cash flow are hallmarks of ITW.\nWe consistently generate more cash than needed for internal purposes, with our annual conversion rate from net income consistently exceeding 100%.\nWe expect this trend to continue as we navigate the pandemic.\nOur Tier 1 credit ratings, the highest in our peer group, demonstrate our continued excellent access to credit markets if needed.\nIt's worth noting that our pension plans remain in excellent condition during this period of market volatility.\nWe have consistently funded and de-risked our plans over the years, and our largest U.S. plan is currently funded at 104%.\nMoving to slide 12.\nLet's discuss how we're adjusting our capital allocation approach during the pandemic.\nFirst, regarding the dividend.\nWe acknowledge the significance of ITW's dividend to our long-standing investors.\nOur dividend has a lengthy track record, growing for over 56 years.\nWe're among a select few companies known as dividend aristocrats, one of about 18 firms that have raised their dividend for more than half a century.\nThe dividend is considered a crucial element of ITW's overall shareholder return strategy.\nFrom 2012, we've raised the annual dividend from $1.52 per share to the current $4.28 per share, representing a cumulative yearly growth of 16%.\nTo put it simply, we remain deeply committed to our dividend and currently don't foresee any scenario where we'd need to reduce it.\nRegarding strategic flexibility, we're in a strong position with substantial balance sheet capacity.\nWe're open to potential opportunities that may arise due to the pandemic.\nThese could include more reasonably priced assets we were already interested in, as well as unique chances with quality companies that might struggle financially during the pandemic.\nOur financial strength and ample resources put us in an advantageous position to act on any high-quality strategic opportunities that may emerge.\nWe will continue to fully finance all internal investments and capital expenditure projects meeting our criteria, as always, but the total spending will likely decrease in the short term due to reduced need for capacity expansion in the coming quarters.\nIt's unsurprising that we've halted share repurchases until market conditions stabilize and the recovery path becomes more evident.\nOur fourth priority involves leveraging our strengths to ensure all our businesses are well-positioned to fully participate in the recovery.\nIn essence, we aim to meet all our customers' needs as their businesses start to accelerate and be prepared to seize any market share opportunities that may arise.\nThe food equipment sector performed well with 2% organic growth year-over-year, despite a challenging comparison to 5% organic growth the previous year.\nThe service business showed solid performance, increasing by 4% in the quarter.\nEquipment growth of 1% reflects double-digit growth in retail and a slight decline in institutional and restaurant sectors, compared to strong performance in the previous year.\nOperating margin increased by 90 basis points to 27.5%, primarily due to enterprise initiatives.\nThe test and measurement and electronics sector had a very strong quarter, with test and measurement up 6% and 13% growth in our Instron business.\nThe segment also saw a significant increase in demand from semiconductor customers.\nElectronics grew by 2%.\nThe highlight was the margin, as the team expanded operating margins by 330 basis points to a record 28.1%, the highest in the company this quarter, driven by strong contributions from enterprise initiatives and volume leverage.\nDuring the quarter, we also divested an electronics business with approximately $60 million in 2019 revenues.\nDespite an unprecedented demand contraction in Q2, as Michael mentioned earlier, we will still generate operating income in the hundreds of millions of dollars and over $500 million in free cash flow.\nWe will carefully manage discretionary expenses, but we don't need to immediately start cutting into our core operations.\nWe want to avoid doing so before we have some indication of the recovery pattern and pace in each of our businesses.\nWith this principle in mind, we are currently providing full compensation and benefits support to all ITW colleagues worldwide.\nWe aim to maintain this level of support for all our employees at least through the end of Q2.\nWe're doing this because we're able to support our people during a time of great personal and family stress and uncertainty.\nWe believe it's the right thing to do.\nWe're also doing it to protect the significant investment we've made in training and developing excellent ITW employees and leaders over the past seven years.\nAs Michael mentioned, we may need to make some staffing adjustments to align with prolonged or permanently lower demand in some of our businesses due to the pandemic.\nWe are committed to supporting all our employees during the worst of this crisis, and we will take time to make any necessary long-term adjustments thoughtfully.\nOur second principle is to lean into potential upside by maintaining our investment in structure to capture additional demand.\nGiven the profitability of our core businesses and our strong financial position, we believe the greater risk for ITW would be carrying extra costs for a few months rather than cutting too much and being unable to fully serve our customers' needs and gain market share from competitors as the recovery accelerates.\nWe plan to execute our recovery strategies accordingly.\nThe third principle is to leverage ITW's strengths to protect investments in areas of strategic importance for our long-term strategy.\nWe're in the early stages of planning for these areas.\nAs an example, before the pandemic, we invested over two years in our strategic sales excellence initiative, including significant investments in new sales and sales leadership talent.\nWe have the financial capacity to protect these types of long-term strategic investments.\nDoing so is more valuable to the company in the long term than a few extra percentage points of margin in the short term.\nThat said, decremental margins should likely be in our normal 35% to 40% range in Q4.\nUntil then, we'll focus on ensuring ITW is well-positioned to fully participate in the recovery.\nThis serves as a reminder that our long-term strategic priorities remain unchanged, and we are committed to achieving and sustaining ITW's potential performance, aiming to establish ITW as one of the world's best-performing, highest-quality, and most respected industrial companies.\nAt present, it's impossible to predict the severity or duration of this crisis, or how quickly our customers and markets will recover.\nWhat I can say is that the strength and resilience of ITW's business model and our people put us in as strong a position as an industrial manufacturing company can be to handle whatever unfolds in the coming weeks and months.\nI'm confident that ITW will overcome these challenges, as we have throughout our 108-year history.\nOur strong financial position and margin profile allow us to make strategic moves now to position the company for full participation across various recovery scenarios, and to emerge ready to continue our path towards ITW's full potential performance.\nFor reference, please consult the appendix in today's slide deck for the usual segment details from the first quarter.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These convictions are vulnerable to recognized and unrecognized hazards and ambiguities, many of which may be outside our influence, including those detailed in our regular SEC reports.\nKindly be aware that the company's actual outcomes may diverge substantially from those projected, and we assume no responsibility to revise these declarations.\nHe will offer an overview of our plan and notable events from the previous quarter.\nAnd Karen Holcom, senior vice president and chief financial officer, who will guide us through our earnings results.\nThere will be a chance for questions and answers at the conclusion of the call.\nFor those taking part, please restrict your comments to one inquiry and one follow-up, if needed.\nOur group delivered another robust performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2022.\nFor the second consecutive quarter, we achieved net sales growth of 17%, and we sustained our gross profit margin at 41.7%, in line with the first quarter.\nAnd in comparison to last year, we boosted diluted earnings per share by 22%.\nDespite the cost challenges, we managed to transform our sales growth into operating profit and net income by efficiently leveraging operating expenses.\nThe global situation remains complex.\nWhile our demand environment is robust, costs continue to fluctuate, and we are constantly dealing with the ongoing pressures stemming from the global component shortages.\nDespite this, our team continues to perform well, and this is reflected in our results.\nBoth ABL and Spaces are performing exceptionally well.\nOur decisions to prioritize shipments by investing in electrical components and transportation are yielding higher sales and operating profits, albeit at slightly lower margins.\nNow, I'd like to discuss our progress at both ABL and Spaces.\nFirst, regarding ABL, I'm pleased to report that some things are returning to normal.\nIn March, we hosted our first in-person sales conference in three years, NEXT '22.\nIt was wonderful to reunite with our independent sales network, who have performed remarkably through the ups and downs of the past two years.\nWe have the finest agents in the industry, and it was an excellent opportunity to discuss our strategic vision for Acuity Brands Lighting, introduce many new products, and engage our agency partners around our EarthLIGHT initiative.\nThis was the first time many of our associates and agents had seen each other in person since the pandemic began.\nWhile we have been incredibly productive working virtually with our channel, it was great to spend quality time together face-to-face.\nIt was impossible not to be impressed by the levels of energy and enthusiasm throughout the event and the consistency of the feedback from our agents.\nThey stated, \"Acuity is delivering\".\nOur investments in service have allowed us to prioritize fulfilling our customers' needs when others have been unable to.\nSimultaneously, our investments in product vitality have enabled us to continue creating compelling new products that are both innovative and market-moving.\nAs I mentioned last quarter, we have achieved this by focusing on three main areas.\nFirstly, by concentrating on strategic supplier relationships, the current environment has reminded us all that it truly matters who you do business with.\nAs the largest lighting company, we have certain advantages over our direct competitors.\nHowever, those same components are also used by larger industries.\nAs a result, we are investing in people, time, and resources.\nWe have recruited a new head of strategic sourcing for ABL.\nWe are collaborating with our key suppliers on effective planning and allocation management, and we are investing in inventory.\nSecondly, by empowering our teams to prioritize access and speed over cost on available components, we have been able to ensure continuity of supply across many of our existing product lines, while also supporting our ongoing product vitality efforts across our product portfolio.\nLastly, as I mentioned last quarter, our engineering teams continue their extraordinary efforts to redesign products to work with available components.\nAt the same time, these teams have also managed to introduce around 220 new, or significantly upgraded, lighting and lighting control products over the past two years.\nWe anticipate that the challenges surrounding access to and costs of components will persist into the foreseeable future.\nOur strategy regarding product vitality and the adaptability of our engineering teams in responding to the changing requirements of the component shortages have been a significant factor in why we are leading in this market, and we expect to continue these efforts.\nAnother highlight of the NEXT conference was our focus on EarthLIGHT.\nEarthLIGHT is a crucial part of our strategy.\nOur efforts to enhance product vitality extend beyond merely improving functionality.\nWe're also focused on redesigning products to lower customer energy usage, minimize packaging and waste, and enhance transportation efficiency.\nThis term, we unveiled a new initiative combining technology and sustainability to drastically reduce paper consumption by implementing scannable QR code instructions across our product line.\nAt NEXT, we expanded our community involvement by assembling a thousand food packages for an Atlanta-based organization alongside our agents.\nThis activity was a standout moment of the event.\nTurning to the Intelligence Spaces Group, Spaces experienced another quarter of robust growth.\nBoth Distech and Atrius have a promising product pipeline aimed at making Spaces more intelligent, secure, and environmentally friendly.\nDistech continues to outperform strong competitors in the building controls market.\nWith its ECLYPSE Controller products, Distech is leading technological advancements, maintaining a presence in crucial markets and recognized leadership founded on open-protocol technology.\nDistech secured projects throughout North America and Canada last quarter, with notable wins in key sectors including education, commercial infrastructure, and data centers.\nDistech has now become a primary supplier for two major cloud service providers.\nWe're still developing the Atrius platform, making progress on Atrius Building Insights, and plan to expand the portfolio in the future.\nWe continue to bring new talent to this team.\nI'd like to provide an update on our capital allocation strategy.\nOur priorities for capital allocation remain unchanged.\nWe plan to continue prioritizing investments for growth in our existing businesses, pursue acquisitions, maintain our dividend, and allocate capital to share repurchases when we see an opportunity to create lasting value for our shareholders.\nThis quarter, our board of directors approved additional capacity for share repurchases, increasing our remaining authorization from 3 million to 5 million shares.\nSince May 2020, we've bought back about 13% of our outstanding shares.\nI'm pleased to announce the appointment of Sachin Sankpal as our senior vice president of growth and transformation.\nSach will oversee our technology organization, implement our better, smarter, faster company operating system, and spearhead integration efforts for future acquisitions.\nSach brings distinguished experience from leading companies like Trimble and Honeywell.\nWe're thrilled to have Sach join our team.\nEvery quarter presents new challenges, but our team consistently delivers.\nOur ongoing focus on service and product vitality allows us to capitalize on the strong demand environment.\nI'm consistently impressed by their adaptability and ability to drive results.\nWe achieved strong performance in the second quarter of 2022.\nWe increased net sales.\nWe effectively managed margins despite a volatile cost environment.\nWe also leveraged our operating expenses.\nNet sales reached $909 million, a 17% increase compared to the previous year.\nThis performance was driven by our emphasis on service levels and product vitality, continued recovery in both business segments' end markets, and the benefits of recent price increases and acquisitions.\nGross profit totaled $379 million, an increase of $43 million or 13% over the previous year.\nThis improvement was driven by revenue growth and by offsetting significant input cost increases through price adjustments and product and productivity enhancements.\nGross profit as a percentage of sales was 41.7%, a decrease of 170 basis points from 43.4% in the previous year, but unchanged sequentially from the first quarter of 2022.\nI'll discuss the current cost environment in more detail later in the call.\nReported operating profit was $102 million, an increase of $11 million or 12% over the previous year.\nReported operating profit margin was 11.3% of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, a decrease of 40 basis points compared to the previous year.\nAdjusted operating profit was $123 million, an increase of $14 million or 13% over the previous year.\nAdjusted operating profit margin was 13.5% of net sales, a decrease of 50 basis points compared to the previous year.\nAdjusted operating profit margin was lower than the previous year, as the decline in gross profit margins was partially offset by leveraging operating expenses.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we observed ongoing enhancement in diluted earnings per share.\nThe diluted earnings per share reached $2.13, showing a rise of $0.39 or 22% compared to the previous year.\nThe adjusted diluted earnings per share climbed to $2.57, indicating an increase of $0.45 or 21% from the year before.\nOur program for repurchasing shares positively affected the adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.06.\nLet's now examine our individual segments.\nIn the quarter, sales in our Lighting and Lighting Controls segment rose by 17% to $863 million compared to the previous year.\nThis growth was primarily due to improvements in our independent sales network, which expanded by about 12%, and a 5% increase in our direct sales network.\nFurthermore, the corporate account channel experienced a sales increase of approximately 105% compared to the previous year.\nIt's worth noting that last year, customers had suspended their renovation projects due to the pandemic.\nAs evidenced by this quarter's growth, that activity has now resumed.\nWe also saw an 83% increase in our other channel compared to the previous year, mainly because of the OSRAM acquisition.\nThe retail channel experienced a sales decline of about 2% in the current quarter.\nThis decrease was caused by delays in inventory transit or port holdups, resulting in longer than expected lead times.\nWe anticipate seeing growth in this channel in the coming quarters.\nABL's operating profit for 2022's second quarter reached $117 million, a 14% increase from the previous year, though the operating margin decreased by 30 basis points to 13.5%.\nThe adjusted operating profit of $127 million showed a 13% improvement compared to the previous year, with the adjusted operating profit margin dropping by 50 basis points to 14.7%.\nABL has shown its capability to increase sales while optimizing operating expenses.\nNow, let's look at the performance of our Intelligent Spaces Group.\nIn the second quarter of 2022, Spaces sales grew by about 16% to $50 million, reflecting growth in both Distech and Atrius.\nSpaces operating profit in the second quarter of 2022 increased by approximately $400,000 to $1.2 million.\nThe adjusted operating profit of $6 million rose by about $1 million compared to the previous year, due to strong sales growth and ongoing business investments.\nOur business model continues to be highly efficient, generating $127 million in net cash flow from operating activities in the first half of fiscal 2022.\nThis represents a decrease of $85 million compared to the previous year, primarily due to increased investment in working capital, particularly related to inventory.\nInventory days have increased since the end of our fiscal year, with about half of the increase attributed to longer lead times for sourced finished goods, and slightly less due to increased purchases of electronic components.\nWe are managing our inventory levels to support our growth and protect our production facilities from inconsistent supply availability.\nWe also invested $24 million, or 1.3% of net sales, in capital expenditures during the first six months of fiscal 2022.\nWe have continued to buy back shares in the second quarter.\nSince May 2020, we have repurchased approximately 13% of our company shares at an average price of about $120 per share.\nI'd like to discuss our expectations for the rest of the year.\nWe anticipate the current environment to persist for the foreseeable future, with strong demand but ongoing challenges in component access and cost.\nOur focus will remain on increasing sales and optimizing our operating expenses.\nRegarding the recent instability in Europe, we have no direct sales exposure to Russia or Ukraine.\nHowever, the conflict does exacerbate existing supply chain pressures.\nWe are also experiencing rising transportation costs due to expected increases in oil prices.\nIn the past 15 months, we have strategically implemented six price increases alongside driving product and productivity improvements.\nBefore concluding, I want to emphasize our key points.\nWe have consistently demonstrated strong sales growth and effective management of gross margins in a volatile cost environment.\nWe have optimized our operating expenses.\nLastly, we have continued to allocate capital effectively.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Please limit your questions to one per person, as suggested by the operator.\nThis approach will ensure maximum participation during our allotted time.\nWe're grateful for your interest in Vulcan Materials and hope you and your loved ones remain safe and in good health.\nI'd like to start by noting that our first-quarter performance was an encouraging beginning to the year.\nOur markets are seeing improved demand, and our team performed well, as reflected in our financial outcomes.\nAdjusted EBITDA, not including the profit from selling our reclaimed California quarry, reached $244 million, showing a 22% increase from the previous year.\nThis impressive growth was partially due to a 3% rise in aggregate shipments.\nAlthough weather affected Texas and parts of the Southeast in February, we saw an uptick in shipments, with March being particularly strong.\nHome construction is speeding up, and highway projects have also increased due to improved contract awards in the third and fourth quarters of last year.\nWe've noticed an increase in both the number of projects and the pace of shipping in the heavy nonresidential sector, which uses the most aggregates.\nAdditionally, some projects that were delayed last year have now begun.\nWith improvements across our operating areas, pricing was the second factor in our EBITDA growth.\nFreight-adjusted aggregates pricing grew by 2% during the quarter.\nWhen adjusted for mix, the increase was 1.3%.\nThis was anticipated as we were fulfilling contracts bid during the pandemic when there was uncertainty and limited visibility on demand.\nAs our 2021 price increases take effect, we expect to see pricing improvements throughout the year.\nThe third factor in EBITDA growth, which we have the most control over, was our outstanding cost management during the quarter.\nAggregate total cost of sales per ton was 2% lower than the first quarter of last year.\nCash cost of sales per ton decreased by 3%.\nAchieving such cost control requires significant discipline from our operators.\nThe team focused intensely on operational efficiency.\nConsequently, all of our operational metrics in the quarries improved compared to last year.\nWe were pleased with the significant impact of our four strategic disciplines, which will continue to develop.\nThe most impressive metric remains our strong unit margin gains across all locations.\nAggregates cash gross profit per ton increased by 9%.\nThis demonstrates the attractive operational profitability of our aggregates business when demand is combined with strong execution of our four strategic disciplines.\nOverall, our operational results this quarter helped improve our return on invested capital by 90 basis points.\nSuzanne will provide more details on this and other aspects of our financial performance.\nLet's now discuss our view of the end markets and how that influences our outlook for the full year.\nGenerally speaking, the demand environment has improved significantly over the past few months.\nConstruction starts, as measured by Dodge, improved along with other leading indicators like the Dodge Momentum Index and ABI.\nConstruction employment levels also continue to rise.\nResidential construction remains the strongest end market.\nThere is unmet demand for houses and new subdivisions are being constructed with more planned.\nEconomic conditions, including low interest rates and limited supply, indicate continued market growth.\nVulcan-served markets are experiencing faster growth in housing construction.\nThe future of our nonresidential markets remains uncertain.\nHowever, increased quote requests and improving leading indicators suggest a market turnaround is underway.\nE-commerce and technology-related construction, such as data centers and warehouses, represent the strongest nonresidential sector.\nDodge reports that 90% of this sector's growth will occur in markets served by Vulcan.\nWhile most non-residential projects currently fall into this category, we anticipate that a robust housing market and reopening economy will stimulate demand in other nonresidential areas.\nHighway-related state budgets and project lettings are progressing as expected.\nImproved lettings from late 2020 are now translating into increased shipments.\nCOVID-19 relief funds have safeguarded against potential losses in transportation revenue for highway projects.\nOur national leaders continue to work on developing an infrastructure package.\nBoth major political parties have proposed significant increases in highway funding, making it a priority for Democrats and Republicans alike.\nIn summary, our assessment of end markets indicates improving demand.\nWe're observing this improvement both through our customer interactions and in data from leading indicators.\nConsequently, we've revised our 2021 aggregates volume growth forecast to between 1% and 4% compared to 2020.\nExcluding the California property sale gain, we now anticipate full-year adjusted EBITDA to range from $1.38 billion to $1.46 billion.\nLooking ahead, we have three avenues for growth with higher returns: organic growth, mergers and acquisitions, and greenfield developments.\nOrganic growth is crucial to our strategy, offering the most attractive value proposition when adjusted for risk.\nWe possess the industry's best geographic footprint and operators, but we continually strive for improvement.\nOur four strategic disciplines aim to accelerate this organic growth strategy, with clear benefits in increasing our unit profitability.\nWe consistently evaluate an active list of potential M&A targets.\nThe M&A market, which was largely inactive last year, has become active again this year.\nWe have an extensive track record of successfully completing both large and small acquisitions that align with our strategic goals.\nSince 2014, we've finalized over two dozen value-enhancing acquisitions in some of the nation's fastest-growing markets.\nWe also have a long history of successfully developing and launching new aggregate sites.\nThis strategy allows us to strategically locate aggregate reserves in growing areas where acquisition opportunities are unavailable.\nAdditional advantages include greater control over capital investment timing and avoiding premium payments for assets.\nWe prefer maintaining a balance between organic and inorganic growth.\nThis approach provides significant flexibility and plays a crucial role in our capital allocation process and our ability to improve return on invested capital.\nI'd like to begin by emphasizing four key areas for consideration this quarter.\nOur unit analyzes profitability growth, investment returns, financial stability, and the sale of land in California.\nThe gross profit per ton for our aggregates increased 12% to $4.82.\nEnhancing operational profitability at existing sites typically requires minimal capital investment compared to other growth strategies.\nSubstantial value is generated when improvements are sustainable and widespread across operations.\nOur strategic approach is yielding results, and we have demonstrated consistent execution.\nOur gross profit per ton has grown at a compound annual rate of 7% over the past three years.\nReturn on invested capital is the second crucial area.\nAs mentioned earlier, the 90 basis point improvement this quarter raised our return to 14.8% for the 12-month period ending March 31.\nWhile higher returns are always beneficial, the method of achieving improvement is equally significant.\nFor instance, the first quarter's ROIC gain consisted of a 1% increase in invested capital and a 7% rise in adjusted EBITDA.\nThis further emphasizes the importance of the previously discussed unit profitability.\nOver the past three years, our trailing 12-month ROIC has risen by 280 basis points, driven by a 4% compound annual growth in invested capital and an 11% compound annual growth in adjusted EBITDA.\nThe balance sheet is the third area of focus.\nOur strong financial position provides significant flexibility in considering capital allocation priorities, balancing growth and shareholder returns.\nOur net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 1.4 times, with nearly $900 million in cash reserves.\nOur debt has an average maturity of 15 years, without any major near-term repayments due.\nWe will continue to manage the business with a long-term perspective.\nWe won't make hasty investment decisions simply because additional capital is available.\nThe final key area I wanted to highlight was the sale of the rehabilitated quarry in Southern California.\nThe sale yielded $182 million in net proceeds and a pre-tax profit of $115 million.\nOne of the advantages of our aggregates-focused business is the multiple opportunities for value creation, as demonstrated by this quarry's life cycle.\nUp to this point in the call, we've concentrated solely on the aggregates business.\nLet's briefly discuss non-aggregates.\nGross profit in these segments totaled $5.6 million for the quarter, $2 million less than the previous year.\nThe severe weather mentioned earlier affected asphalt volumes in Alabama, Tennessee, and Texas, as well as concrete volumes in Virginia.\nDiesel costs didn't significantly impact the quarter, as the unit price remained relatively unchanged from the previous year's first quarter.\nFor the full year, we now expect diesel fuel costs to present a challenge of approximately $25 million, reflecting price increases since the beginning of the year.\nDuring our last communication, we anticipated an effective tax rate of 21% for 2021.\nWe now project the full-year rate to be between 23% and 24%, following a 27% rate in the first quarter.\nThe higher rate in Q1 and the revised full-year expectation resulted from Alabama's recent law change, which altered how companies allocate income to the state.\nThis change reduced our ability to fully utilize certain net operating loss carry-forwards in Alabama.\nConsequently, we recorded a $14 million charge in the first quarter.\nWe will continue to manage Vulcan with a long-term perspective.\nThis involves maintaining focus on strong local execution, driving unit margin expansion, preserving a robust financial position, and improving our returns.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Jeff Mezger, Chairman, President and CEO; Matt Mandino, EVP and COO; Jeff Kaminski, EVP and CFO; Bill Hollinger, SVP and Chief Accounting Officer; and Thad Johnson, SVP and Treasurer are participating in the call.\nWe trust you and your loved ones had a pleasant and safe holiday season.\nOur fourth quarter performance was impressive, with notable growth in net orders and expanded gross margins as we concluded 2020 on a high note.\nOur margins are significantly improving as we shift towards higher-quality communities, efficiently manage expenses, and decrease our amortized interest, while our balanced strategy of optimizing price and pace in this strong demand environment provides additional support.\nWe're starting 2021 with positive momentum, as our backlog value has increased by over 60% compared to last year, and we have the potential to generate up to $6 billion in housing revenues this year as we focus on expanding our operations.\nWe're well-positioned for profitable growth focused on returns, given our backlog composition, a robust pipeline of new community openings, and our streamlined cost structure, all contributing to an expected double-digit operating margin this year.\nOur fourth quarter results include total revenues of $1.2 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.12.\nOur year-over-year decrease in deliveries and revenues was anticipated, reflecting the COVID-related disruption in our second quarter net orders and housing starts.\nDespite this, our per-unit earnings improved, with a housing gross margin of 21%, excluding inventory-related charges, representing a 110 basis point increase from the previous year.\nThe robust gross margin was the primary driver of the improvement in our operating income per unit, which rose to over $44,000, a $7,000 increase per home from the previous quarter.\nOur financial position is excellent, putting us in a strong position for expanding our operations.\nOur top priority for utilizing the substantial operating cash flow we're generating is investing in land acquisition and development.\nWe increased our land investments by over 60% year-over-year to $650 million in the fourth quarter.\nThrough disciplined execution, we expanded our lot position by 7,000 lots since the third quarter, ending the year with over 67,000 lots owned and controlled.\nOur lot portfolio is well-diversified across and within our regions, with owned lots representing 3.8 years of supply and a higher proportion of option lots now making up 40% of our total.\nWe own all the lots needed for the significant increase in delivery volume expected in 2021 and own or control all the lots required for further delivery growth in 2022.\nIn addition to investing in our future, we continue to prioritize increasing shareholder returns, implementing another substantial increase in our quarterly cash dividend in the fourth quarter.\nThis marks the second consecutive year we've significantly increased our dividend, which is now six times its level from two years ago.\nOur goal in expanding our scale is to increase our market position in each of our existing markets.\nWhile we anticipate most of our growth to come from existing markets, we're also selectively entering new markets.\nSeattle exemplifies our organic approach to growth.\nWe began with a small start-up operation less than three years ago, which became profitable by the end of its second year.\nThis division is now on track to more than double its profit this year and contribute more significantly to our overall performance.\nEncouraged by our success in Seattle, we're extending our market strategy to the Carolinas, an area we're already familiar with.\nFollowing improved execution in our Raleigh business over the past couple of years, we've now re-entered Charlotte using a similar start-up approach.\nCharlotte is a top 10 homebuilding market, and we've hired an industry veteran with deep local roots and an extensive network to lead this effort, enabling us to quickly secure three land deals.\nWe anticipate our first deliveries in Charlotte in 2022.\nExpanding our community count is our top priority, and we successfully opened 38 new communities in the fourth quarter, including 4 that opened ahead of schedule.\nFor 2021, we expect our ending community count to reach its lowest point in the first quarter, with sequential growth in each subsequent quarter, resulting in year-over-year community count expansion in our third and fourth quarters.\nLooking beyond 2021, we're well-positioned with our owned and controlled lots to sustain growth sequentially throughout 2022, and we're committed to growing our community count by at least 10% next year, a target we believe is achievable given our balance sheet, cash flow, profitability level, and existing infrastructure.\nOur monthly absorption pace per community accelerated to 5.6 net orders during the fourth quarter, representing a 51% increase year-over-year.\nWe achieved this higher pace even as we raised prices in over 90% of our communities, balancing pace and price in each community to optimize our assets and returns.\nOur absorption pace has consistently ranked among the highest in the industry for many years.\nWe believe our success is driven by offering choice and personalization at an affordable price point, which are the foundations of our Built-to-Order model.\nGiven investors' increased focus on affordability in recent months, I'd like to share our thoughts on this topic.\nOur long-standing approach to product positioning is to target the median household income in each submarket and remain flexible in adjusting our product offerings through higher density and slightly smaller footprints to stay close to median income levels.\nBy doing so, we believe we make homeownership attainable for the largest demand segments: millennials and Gen Z. Our divisions are executing well on our product strategy, enabling us to generate solid margins at our targeted absorption rates, with our average selling price in nearly every division below the median new home price and, in many cases, below the median resale price as well.\nThis last point is particularly significant, as resale is our largest competitor.\nGiven these dynamics, we believe our homes remain affordable.\nAs prices continue to rise, we are well-positioned.\nDuring the buyer pause of late 2018 and early 2019, when both rising home prices and rising interest rates hindered affordability, we proactively took steps to reposition our product offerings.\nWe quickly introduced smaller square footage plans from our product series as models.\nWe broadened the range of options for our customers in terms of home size and reduced the level of standard features in most of our developments.\nThese actions collectively lower the base price in many of our communities, making our homes more affordable to a wider range of buyers.\nCurrently, we still provide these more compact home designs, with nearly 60% of our developments offering layouts under 1,500 square feet.\nSlightly above that size range, over 75% of our communities have plans available that are less than 1,600 square feet.\nHomes in the 1,500 to 1,600 square foot range are particularly appealing to the millennial generation.\nOur Built-to-Order model offers flexibility in floor plan size and additional options like extra bedrooms, home offices, or dens, catering to the diverse needs of modern homebuyers.\nThe housing market remains strong, with the pandemic increasing demand for home ownership.\nThe inventory of existing single-family homes continues to decrease, now at just 2.3 months supply and even lower in many of our markets, especially at our price points.\nThe limited availability of resale homes, combined with a decade of underproduction of new houses and favorable demographic trends, particularly for first-time buyers, is expected to sustain demand for the foreseeable future.\nWe consider this trend particularly advantageous for our company, given our expertise in serving first-time buyers, who made up 61% of our sales in the fourth quarter, an increase of eight percentage points from the previous year.\nDuring our last earnings call in September, we reported that our net orders were up 32% for the initial three weeks of our fourth quarter.\nDemand remained high throughout the quarter, resulting in a 42% year-over-year increase in net orders to almost 4,000 homes.\nAlthough we experienced some seasonal fluctuations in the quarter, they were minimal, with November's order activity remaining close to October's levels, which is unusual and demonstrates the strong demand for our homes.\nOur strong performance was consistent across all four of our regions, with healthy year-over-year growth in each area.\nThe underlying buyer data for our fourth quarter orders continued to show positive trends, similar to what we observed in the third quarter.\nMillennial buyers remained our largest customer group, accounting for 57% of our net orders, a six percentage point increase from the previous year.\nCustomers also showed a growing preference for Built-to-Order homes, which represented over 90% of our net orders, compared to just under 70% in the same period last year.\nThe growth in net orders during the fourth quarter led to a 50% year-over-year increase in our net order value, which in turn expanded our backlog value to $3 billion, a 63% increase from the previous year, representing approximately 7,800 units.\nThis larger backlog gives us confidence in our increased revenue projections for this year.\nWe increased our pace of home starts in the fourth quarter by 40% compared to the previous year and have continued this trend in the first quarter, aligning our starts with net orders.\nDue to the strong net order trends throughout the fourth quarter, a larger portion of our backlog is in the early stages of construction, with about 55% either not started or only at the foundation stage, compared to around 44% in the same quarter last year.\nThis will affect our backlog conversion rate compared to typical first quarter levels.\nHowever, we anticipate a sequential increase in deliveries in our first quarter, which is unprecedented in my career at KB Home.\nNet orders for the first six weeks of the first quarter of 2021 are up 44% compared to the same period last year.\nDemand remained strong through the holiday season and into the new year.\nAs a result, we expect our net order growth to moderate by the end of the quarter from its current level.\nOur mortgage joint venture, KBHS Home Loans, had another successful year.\nThe joint venture's capture rate increased to 81% in the fourth quarter, resulting in a 20% year-over-year increase in income, despite fewer deliveries in the quarter, indicating a more profitable operation.\nThe joint venture is steadily increasing its contribution to our overall performance, with full-year income growth of over 70% to $21 million.\nIn conclusion, we ended 2020 on a strong note and are positioned for an excellent 2021, resuming our growth as a larger, more profitable company.\nWhile we remain cautious about the ongoing pandemic and its potential to disrupt our business until it's under control, we are confident in the strength of our position.\nWe expect to expand our operations with our substantial backlog and continued robust market conditions, potentially reaching up to $6 billion in revenues in 2021.\nSeveral factors support our higher gross margin this year, including our backlog composition, overhead leverage from increased revenue, effective cost management, lower amortized interest, and margin enhancements specific to our Built-to-Order model, such as lot premiums and studio revenue.\nAs a result, we anticipate our operating margin to reach double digits, driving our projected return on equity to over 17%, compared to approximately 12% in 2020.\nIn short, we are in our strongest position in over a decade, with an experienced, dedicated team, a solid balance sheet, a healthy lot position, cash flow to invest in community count growth, and a business model that generates high customer satisfaction and has proven appeal to homebuyers.\nWe are enthusiastic about 2021 and look forward to sharing our results as the year progresses.\nI will now discuss the highlights of our financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2020 and provide our outlook for the first quarter and full year of 2021.\nIn the fourth quarter, we continued to show sequential improvement in our key profitability and credit metrics and achieved outstanding growth in our net orders, contributing to a significant year-over-year increase in backlog value to its highest level in 15 years.\nOur housing revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.19 billion, a 23% decrease from the previous year, reflecting a reduction in homes delivered that was partially offset by a 5% increase in the overall average selling price of those homes.\nThe lower delivery volume was due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and public health control measures on our second quarter net orders and housing starts.\nFor the first quarter of 2021, we expect housing revenues to range from $1.14 billion to $1.22 billion.\nFor the full year 2021, we forecast housing revenues between $5.5 billion and $6 billion, an increase of $450 million at the midpoint compared to our previous guidance.\nWith a backlog value of about $3 billion at the end of our 2020 fiscal year, we are confident in our ability to achieve this revenue target.\nOur overall average selling price for homes delivered in the fourth quarter rose to roughly $414,000.\nWe expect the average selling price to be around $390,000 in the first quarter of 2021 due to changes in the regional distribution of homes delivered.\nWe anticipate our overall average selling price for the full year 2021 will fall between $400,000 and $410,000.\nFourth quarter homebuilding operating income was $115.7 million, compared to $162.5 million in the same quarter last year.\nThe current quarter included $11.7 million in inventory-related charges, compared to $4.1 million a year ago.\nOur homebuilding operating income margin decreased by 80 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2019, reaching 9.7%.\nWhen inventory-related charges are excluded, our operating margin remained at 10.7% for both periods, as the improved gross margin in the current year's quarter was completely offset by a higher SG&A expense ratio resulting from reduced operational efficiency due to lower housing revenues.\nWe expect our homebuilding operating income margin for the first quarter of 2021, excluding any inventory-related charges, to be between 9% and 9.3%.\nFor the full year 2021, we project this metric to range from 10.4% to 11%, representing a year-over-year improvement of 230 basis points at the midpoint.\nOur housing gross profit margin in the fourth quarter of 2020 improved by 40 basis points to 20%.\nWhen inventory-related charges are excluded, our gross margin for the quarter increased by 110 basis points to 21%, up from 19.9% in the same quarter of the previous year.\nThis improvement was primarily due to higher selling prices, changes in the geographic and community mix of homes delivered, and reduced amortization of previously capitalized interest.\nAssuming no inventory-related charges, we forecast a housing gross profit margin for the first quarter of 2021 between 20% and 20.3%, an increase of more than 200 basis points compared to the same period last year.\nWe expect our full-year 2021 gross margin, excluding inventory-related charges, to be between 20.5% and 21.1%, with margins of 20% or higher in each quarter.\nOur selling, general, and administrative expense ratio for the fourth quarter was 10.3%, an increase of 120 basis points from a year ago, mainly due to the negative impact of reduced operational efficiency from lower housing revenues, partially offset by our ongoing efforts to reduce overhead costs.\nWe predict our SG&A expense ratio for the first quarter of 2021 to be between 10.8% and 11.2%, as we continue to prioritize controlling overhead costs and expect to benefit from increased operational efficiency due to an anticipated year-over-year rise in housing revenues.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2021 SG&A expense ratio to be approximately 9.9% to 10.3%.\nOur fourth quarter income tax expense of $20 million, which was positively influenced by $8.6 million in federal energy tax credits, represented an effective tax rate of about 16%.\nWe currently expect our effective tax rate for both the first quarter and full year of 2021 to be approximately 24%.\nFederal legislation enacted in December extended the availability of energy tax credits for constructing energy-efficient homes through December 31, 2021.\nGiven our industry leadership in sustainable home building and energy efficiency, the extension of these tax credits will positively impact our 2021 effective tax rate and is reflected in our first quarter and full-year estimates.\nWe reported net income of $106.1 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter, compared to $123.2 million, or $1.31 per diluted share, for the same period last year.\nFor the full year 2020, our net income of $296.2 million, or $3.13 per diluted share, increased by 10% compared to 2019.\nRegarding community count, our fourth-quarter average of 234 was down 8% from 253 in the corresponding 2019 quarter, primarily due to accelerated community closures in the second half of the year, driven by strong net order activity in both the third and fourth quarters.\nWe ended the year with 236 communities, a 6% decrease from a year ago, with about half of this decline due to a reduction in the number of communities previously classified as land held for future development.\nWe expect our community count to decrease sequentially in the first quarter, which we believe will be the low point for 2021, as community closures resulting from anticipated continued strong net orders outpace new openings for the period.\nYear-over-year, we anticipate our average community count for the first quarter of 2021 will decrease by a low double-digit percentage.\nWe expect our quarter-end community count to increase sequentially starting in the second quarter and continuing through the rest of the year.\nWe anticipate ending the year with a mid to high single-digit percentage increase in our community count, supporting additional revenue growth in 2022.\nAs Jeff mentioned, our goal is to increase our community count by at least 10% in 2022 to support further market share gains and growth in housing revenues.\nTo drive future community openings, we invested $651 million in land and land development during the fourth quarter, with $376 million, or 58% of the total, representing land acquisitions.\nIn 2020, we invested nearly $1.7 billion in land acquisition and development and generated $311 million of net operating cash flow.\nAt year-end, our total liquidity was approximately $1.5 billion, including $788 million of available capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nOur debt-to-capital ratio was 39.6% at year-end, and we expect further improvement in 2021 given our anticipated earnings growth.\nWe expect to generate significant cash flow in the current year to fund levels of land investment sufficient to support our targeted growth in community count and housing revenues for 2021 and 2022.\nOur year-end stockholders' equity was $2.67 billion, compared to $2.38 billion at the end of the previous year, and our book value per share increased by nearly 10% to $29.09.\nGiven our current community profile and backlog, along with expected continued strength in the housing market, we are very confident in our ability to significantly improve our profitability, credit, and return metrics in 2021.\nThroughout the year, we plan to continue executing our returns-focused growth strategy, emphasizing significantly increasing our returns by expanding our community count and revenue, while continuing to improve our operating margin.\nIn summary, using the midpoints of our guidance ranges, we expect a 39% year-over-year increase in housing revenues and significant expansion of our operating margin to 10.7%, driven by improvements in both gross margin and our SG&A expense ratio.\nThese anticipated improvements in scale and margin should drive our return on equity to above 17%, an increase of over 500 basis points year-over-year.\nThese expected results reflect our belief that our continued focus on a returns-focused growth strategy will enable us to further enhance long-term stockholder value.\nPlease open the lines for questions, Devin.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The hazards mentioned are detailed in the Risk Factors portion of Hess' SEC-filed annual and quarterly reports\nWe may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures during this conference call\nA comparison between these non-GAAP financial measures and their closest GAAP equivalents can be found in the additional information provided on our website\nI will now discuss our ongoing progress in implementing our strategy\nGreg Hill will then speak about our operations, followed by John Riley who will cover our financial results\nWith COP26 starting this weekend, it's fitting to address the energy transition\nClimate change represents the most significant scientific challenge of the 21st century\nThe world faces two major challenges: increasing global energy supply by about 20% in the next two decades and achieving net zero emissions by 2050\nThe International Energy Agency recently published its World Energy Outlook, offering four scenarios to illuminate these challenges\nIt's crucial to note that these are scenarios, not predictions, designed to guide decision-makers in policy and business\nOil and gas will continue to be necessary in the coming decades according to all four scenarios\nConsiderably more investment will be needed to meet the world's growing energy demands, particularly in renewables and oil and gas\nBased on these IEA scenarios, we estimate global oil and gas investment needs to be at least $400 billion annually over the next decade\nLast year, that figure was $300 billion\nThis year's estimate is $340 billion\nTo ensure a successful and orderly energy transition, we need understanding in climate, energy, and economics\nOur strategy aims to expand our resource base, maintain low supply costs, and sustain cash flow growth\nBy investing only in high-return, low-cost opportunities and delivering top-tier environmental, social, and governance performance and disclosure, we've created a diverse and focused portfolio balancing short-cycle and long-cycle assets\nOur cash-generating assets are in the Bakken, Gulf of Mexico, and Southeast Asia, where we have competitive advantages in assets and operations\nGuyana is our growth driver and is set to become a significant cash generator in the near future as multiple phases of low-cost oil developments come online\nAdditionally, by adding a third rig in the Bakken in September and completing the Tioga Gas Plant's turnaround and expansion, the Bakken is expected to generate substantial free cash flow in the coming years\nBy successfully executing our strategy, our company is positioned to deliver strong and sustained cash flow growth through the end of the decade\nAccording to recent sell-side consensus estimates, our cash flow is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 42% between 2020 and 2023, which is 50% above our peers and places us in the top 5% of the S&P 500\nAs our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we will prioritize debt reduction followed by shareholder returns through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases\nWe have maintained financial strength while managing risk\nAs of September 30th, we had $2.4 billion in cash on our balance sheet\nIn July, we prepaid half of our $1 billion term loan due in March 2023 and plan to repay the remaining $500 million in 2022\nThis debt reduction, combined with the startup of Liza Phase 2 early next year, is expected to bring our debt to EBITDAX ratio below 2% and allow us to consider increasing shareholder returns\nIn August, we sold our interest in Denmark for $150 million, effective January 1, 2021, and received $375 million from Hess Midstream's buyback of Class B units from its sponsors Hess Corporation and Global Infrastructure Partners\nEarlier this month, our company also received $108 million in net proceeds from the public offering of Hess-owned Class A shares of Hess Midstream\nThe Denmark sale and these Midstream transactions brought forward significant value and further improved our cash and liquidity position\nGuyana, one of the industry's best investments, is key to our long-term strategy\nOn the Stabroek Block, where Hess holds a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, we announced the 19th and 20th significant discoveries during the third quarter at Whiptail and Pinktail\nOn October 7th, we announced the 21st significant discovery on the block at Cataback\nThese discoveries will support our future low-cost oil developments\nWe anticipate at least six FPSOs on the Stabroek Block producing over 1 million gross barrels of oil per day by 2027, and up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources on the block\nOn October 7th, we increased the estimated gross discovered recoverable resources for the block to approximately 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent, up from the previous estimate of over 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent\nWe continue to see potential for billions of barrels in future exploration\nRegarding our current Guyana developments, gross production from the Liza Phase 1 complex averaged 124,000 barrels of oil per day in the third quarter\nThe Liza Phase 2 development is on schedule to start up in early 2022 with a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day, and the Liza Unity FPSO arrived in Guyana on Monday\nOur third development on the Stabroek Block at the Payara field is on track for first oil in 2024, also with a gross capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day\nOur three sanctioned oil developments have a breakeven Brent oil price between $25 and $35 per barrel\nThe development plan for our fourth project on the block at Yellowtail was recently submitted to the Guyanese government for approval\nPending government approvals, the project is expected to have a gross capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day with first oil in 2025\nWe are honored to be recognized as an industry leader in environmental, social, and governance performance and disclosure\nOur company recently received a AAA rating in the MSCI ESG ratings for 2021, following A ratings for the previous ten consecutive years\nThe AAA rating identifies Hess as a leader in managing industry-specific ESG risks compared to peers and reflects our strong practices in reducing carbon emissions and top-quartile performance in areas such as biodiversity and land use, reduction of air and water emissions and waste, and positively impacting the communities where we operate\nIn conclusion, we remain committed to executing our strategy and achieving strong operational and ESG performance\nOur company is uniquely positioned to deliver cash flow growth over the next decade that is not only industry-leading but which we believe will rank among the best in the S&P 500\nOnce our term loan is settled and our portfolio generates more free cash flow, we will focus on returning capital to shareholders through increased dividends and strategic share buybacks.\nIn Q3, we maintained strong operational performance, hitting production goals despite hurricane-related delays in the Gulf of Mexico and successfully completing a major overhaul at our North Dakota Tioga Gas Plant.\nExcluding Libya, our company-wide net production averaged 265,000 barrels of oil equivalent daily, aligning with our projections.\nWe anticipate company-wide net production to reach approximately 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, for both Q4 and the entire year of 2021.\nIn the Bakken region, Q3 net production averaged 148,000 barrels of oil equivalent daily.\nThis exceeded our projected 145,000 barrels, mainly due to the efficient execution of the Tioga Gas Plant upgrade and expansion, a challenging task during COVID that required strict safety measures for over 650 workers.\nWe project Bakken net production to range between 155,000 and 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent daily in Q4.\nFor the full year 2021, we expect Bakken net production to average about 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent daily, slightly lower than our previous estimate of 155,000 to 160,000 barrels.\nThis forecast accounts for higher NGL prices, which reduce volumes under our percentage of proceeds contracts but significantly boost this year's earnings and cash flow.\nWe drilled 18 wells and activated 19 new wells in Q3.\nFor Q4, we plan to drill about 19 wells and activate approximately 18 new wells.\nOur full-year 2021 plan remains unchanged: drilling about 65 wells and activating around 50 new wells.\nDespite some cost increases, we're maintaining our projected average drilling and completion cost of $5.8 million per well for 2021.\nWe've been operating with two rigs since February.\nHowever, due to improved oil prices and our large inventory of high-return drilling sites, we added a third rig in September.\nShifting to a three-year, three-rig program will enable us to increase cash flow and production, optimize our local infrastructure, and further reduce our unit cash costs.\nRegarding offshore operations, Q3 net production in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico averaged 32,000 barrels of oil equivalent daily, below our projected 35,000 to 40,000 barrels.\nThis was due to an extended recovery period following Hurricane Ida, which caused power outages at downstream transportation and processing facilities.\nAll our facilities resumed production by the end of September.\nWe forecast Gulf of Mexico net production to average between 40,000 and 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent daily in Q4.\nOur full-year 2021 Gulf of Mexico net production forecast remains at approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent daily.\nIn Southeast Asia, Q3 net production was 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent daily, matching our projection of 50,000 to 55,000 barrels, reflecting planned maintenance shutdowns and reduced demand due to COVID.\nWe project Q4 net production to average about 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent daily, with our full-year 2021 forecast remaining at approximately 60,000 barrels.\nShifting focus to Guyana, Q3 gross production from Liza Phase 1 averaged 124,000 barrels of oil daily, or 32,000 barrels net to Hess.\nThe flash gas compression system on the Liza Destiny will be replaced with an improved design in Q4, and production optimization work is scheduled for Q1 2022.\nThese upgrades are expected to enhance production capacity and reliability.\nWe forecast Liza Phase 1 net production to average about 30,000 barrels of oil daily in Q4 and for the entire year of 2021.\nThe Liza Phase 2 development will use the Unity FPSO, capable of producing 220,000 barrels of oil daily, which arrived in Guyana on Monday evening.\nThe next steps involve mooring line installation and connecting umbilicals and risers.\nInitial oil production remains on schedule for Q1 2022.\nRegarding our third development at Payara, the Prosperity FPSO hull entered the Keppel yard in Singapore on August 1st.\nTopside fabrication and development drilling are in progress.\nThe project is about 60% complete overall.\nThe Prosperity will have a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil daily and is on track to start production in 2024.\nFor our fourth development at Yellowtail, we recently submitted a development plan to the Guyanese government, pending approvals and project sanctioning.\nThe Yellowtail project will use an FPSO with a gross capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil daily.\nInitial production is targeted for 2025.\nWe've announced three new discoveries since July.\nIn July, we reported that the Whiptail 1 and 2 wells found 246 feet and 167 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs, respectively.\nThis discovery is located about four miles southeast of well 1 and three miles west of Yellowtail.\nIn September, we announced that the Pinktail 1 well, situated approximately 22 miles southeast of Liza 1, encountered 220 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs.\nEarlier this month, we reported the Cataback discovery, located about 4 miles east of Turbot 1.\nThe well found 203 feet of high-quality hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs, including approximately 102 feet of oil-bearing rock.\nThese discoveries support future developments and have contributed to increasing the estimated gross discovered recoverable resources on the Stabroek Block to approximately 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent.\nQ4 exploration and appraisal activities will include drilling an exploration well about 11 miles northwest of Liza 1.\nThis well is a significant step-out test targeting deeper Campanian and Santonian aged reservoirs.\nQ4 appraisal activities will include drill-stem tests at Longtail 2 and Whiptail 2, as well as drilling the Tripletail 2 well.\nIn conclusion, we have once again demonstrated strong execution and delivery, positioning ourselves well to provide significant value to our shareholders.\nDuring my presentation today, I will contrast the outcomes from Q3 2021 with those from Q2 2021.\nThe third quarter of 2021 saw a net income of $115 million, a significant improvement from the $73 million net loss in the second quarter.\nAdjusting for factors affecting earnings comparability between periods, our net income in Q3 2021 was $86 million, up from $74 million in Q2 2021.\nThe Q3 earnings include a post-tax profit of $29 million from divesting our Danish interests.\nAdjusted E&P net income rose from $122 million in Q2 to $149 million in Q3 2021.\nThe following details the changes in adjusted E&P results' after-tax components between Q2 and Q3 2021.\nEarnings increased by $110 million due to higher realized prices for crude oil, NGL, and natural gas.\nA decrease in sales volumes led to a $147 million reduction in earnings.\nLower DD&A expenses boosted earnings by $37 million.\nReduced cash costs contributed to a $14 million increase in earnings.\nA decrease in exploration expenses resulted in a $10 million earnings increase.\nVarious other factors collectively improved earnings by $3 million.\nOverall, these changes resulted in a $27 million increase in Q3 earnings.\nQ3 sales volumes were lower than Q2, primarily due to hurricane-related interruptions in the Gulf of Mexico, scheduled maintenance downtime, reduced nominations in Malaysia, and decreased sales in the Bakken due to planned Tioga gas plant maintenance.\nIn Guyana, we sold three 1-million-barrel oil cargoes in Q3, up from two in Q2.\nOur E&P sales volumes in Q3 were approximately 175,000 barrels less than production, which had a negligible impact on our after-tax results.\nThe Midstream segment's net income decreased from $76 million in Q2 to $61 million in Q3 2021.\nQ3 results included expenses related to the successfully completed Tioga Gas Plant maintenance turnaround.\nMidstream EBITDA before noncontrolling interest dropped from $229 million in Q2 to $203 million in Q3 2021.\nAt quarter-end, excluding Midstream, our cash and cash equivalents stood at $2.41 billion, with total liquidity at $6 billion, including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.1 billion.\nWe received $375 million from selling 15.6 million Hess-owned Class B units of Hess Midstream and about $130 million from divesting our Danish interests in Q3.\nIn July, we paid off $500 million of our $1 billion term loan, with plans to settle the remaining $500 million in 2022.\nIn October, we gained approximately $108 million from publicly offering 4.3 million Hess-owned Class A shares of Hess Midstream.\nOur consolidated ownership in Hess Midstream is now about 44%, down from 46% before these recent transactions.\nNet cash from operating activities before working capital changes decreased slightly from $659 million in Q2 to $631 million in Q3.\nAfter accounting for changes in operating assets and liabilities, net cash from operating activities dropped from $785 million in Q2 to $615 million in Q3.\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities reduced net cash from operating activities by $16 million in Q3, contrasting with a $126 million increase in Q2.\nRegarding guidance:\nE&P cash costs, including Libya, were $12.76 per barrel of oil equivalent in Q3 2021, and $13.45 excluding Libya.\nWe anticipate Q4 E&P cash costs, excluding Libya, to range between $12 and $12.50 per barrel of oil equivalent, with full-year costs between $11.75 and $12, up from previous estimates of $11 to $12.\nThis revised guidance reflects the impact of higher realized selling prices in 2021, which improved cash flow but reduced volumes from percentage of proceeds contracts and increased Bakken production taxes.\nQ3 DD&A expense was $11.77 per barrel of oil equivalent including Libya, and $12.38 excluding Libya.\nWe expect Q4 DD&A expense, excluding Libya, to be between $13 and $13.50 per barrel of oil equivalent, with full-year costs ranging from $12.50 to $13.\nTotal E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, are projected to be $25 to $26 per barrel of oil equivalent for Q4 and $24.25 to $25 for the full year 2021.\nQ4 exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be $50 million to $55 million, with full-year expenses around $160 million, at the lower end of our previous $160 million to $170 million estimate.\nThe Midstream tariff is projected to be about $295 million for Q4 and $1.95 billion for the full year.\nE&P income tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be $35 million to $40 million for Q4, with full-year expenses between $135 and $140 million, up from previous estimates of $125 million to $135 million due to higher commodity prices.\nWe anticipate non-cash option premium amortization of approximately $65 million for Q4.\nFor 2022, we've purchased WTI collars for 90,000 barrels of oil per day with a $60 floor and $90 ceiling, and Brent collars for 60,000 barrels per day with a $65 floor and $95 ceiling.\nThe 2022 hedge program costs $161 million, to be amortized evenly throughout the year.\nWe expect to sell two 1-million-barrel oil cargoes from Guyana in Q4.\nQ4 E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are projected to be around $650 million, with full-year guidance unchanged at approximately $1.9 billion.\nFor Midstream, we expect net income attributable to Hess to be about $70 million in Q4, with full-year projections of $280 million, aligning with our previous guidance of $275 million to $285 million.\nRegarding corporate matters, we estimate Q4 expenses to be $30 million to $35 million, with full-year expenses expected to be $125 million to $130 million, down from previous estimates of $130 million to $140 million.\nInterest expense is projected to be $90 million to $95 million for Q4, with full-year expenses expected to be $375 million to $380 million, compared to our previous estimate of about $380 million.\nThis concludes the presentation, and we are ready to address any questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:As the pandemic situation continues to evolve, we remain cautiously optimistic yet vigilant while vaccination efforts progress amid uncertainties surrounding new variants.\nI'm grateful for our organization's adaptability during this challenging period and continue to keep those affected in my thoughts.\nExcluding currency impacts, adjusted earnings per share grew by 24.2% for the quarter and 24.5% for the year.\nWhile first-half earnings have started strongly, it's worth noting they're largely supported by low pandemic-related benefit ratios and better-than-anticipated alternative investment returns.\nFor the first time since the pandemic began, sales improved year-over-year in the second quarter in both the U.S. and Japan.\nOur strategy aims to make insurance available wherever customers prefer to purchase it.\nThis approach applies to both our Japanese and American operations.\nIn-person sales remain our most effective method for conveying the unique financial protection Aflac products offer.\nNevertheless, the pandemic has highlighted the necessity for virtual sales channels.\nThese non-face-to-face options help us reach potential customers and provide them with necessary coverage.\nWe've continued investing in distribution tools in both countries and integrating these investments into our operations.\nGiven the uncertain nature of pandemic recovery, we anticipate stronger performance in the latter half of the year in both countries, particularly if communities and businesses continue reopening, allowing more in-person interactions.\nI communicate with our employees similarly to how I would with family members, keeping them informed through medical experts and encouraging COVID-19 vaccinations to prevent illness or worse outcomes from the virus or its variants.\nRegarding our Japanese operations, Aflac Japan delivered solid financial growth in the second quarter, with a profit margin of 26.5%.\nThis exceeded the outlook range provided at the 2020 Financial Analyst Briefing.\nAflac Japan also maintained strong premium persistency at 94.7%.\nSales improved year-over-year, increasing by 38.4% for the quarter and 15.7% for the first six months.\nThese results reflect easier comparisons, improved pandemic conditions, and a boost from our new medical product launched in the first quarter.\nWhile first-half 2021 sales are approximately 65% of 2019 levels, we continue navigating evolving pandemic conditions in Japan.\nStates of emergency have been declared in specific areas, particularly Tokyo and Okinawa.\nHowever, cases have begun rising in the Tokyo and Osaka metropolitan areas, and we expect the Japanese government to soon decide on expanding the state of emergency to three additional prefectures surrounding Tokyo and Osaka.\nImportantly, these states of emergency are less restrictive and limited in scope compared to lockdowns experienced in other countries.\nThe resumption of proactive sales in Japan since April has contributed to a gradual improvement in Aflac's cancer insurance sales, and we continue strengthening our strategic alliance to create sustained growth for both companies.\nIn June, Aflac and Japan Post Group entities reached agreements to further their strategic alliance, aligning with Japan Post Group's five-year medium-term management plan announced in May.\nWhile we don't anticipate an immediate impact on sales recovery, this will position our company for long-term growth by addressing customer needs, providing customer-centric services, and creating shared value in resolving societal and local community issues.\nIn Aflac U.S., we observed a strong profit margin of 25.4% and very high premium persistency of 80.1%.\nAs anticipated, we saw sequential sales improvement and increased opportunities for face-to-face activities.\nDue to softer sales a year earlier and more in-person opportunities, sales increased 64.1% for the quarter and are at 73% of first-half 2019 levels.\nIn the U.S., small businesses are still recovering, which we expect to continue throughout 2021.\nMeanwhile, larger businesses remain primarily focused on returning employees to worksites.\nAs mentioned earlier, we aim to sell and service customers both in-person and virtually.\nAdditionally, we continue expanding the U.S. product portfolio with previously acquired businesses, Aflac Network Dental and Vision and Premier Life and Disability.\nWhile these acquisitions have a modest near-term impact on revenue, they better position Aflac for future long-term success in the U.S.\nMeanwhile, strong persistency, underwriting profits, and investment income continue driving strong pre-tax margins in both the U.S. and Japan.\nWe consistently prioritize maintaining strong capital ratios in the U.S. and Japan for the benefit of our policyholders and investors.\nWe remain committed to prudent liquidity and capital management.\nWe value our 38-year track record of dividend growth and are committed to extending it, supported by our strong capital position and cash flows.\nSimultaneously, we will continue strategic share repurchases and focus on integrating our platform growth investments.\nWe are well-positioned to work towards long-term growth while ensuring we fulfill our promises to policyholders.\nBy doing so, we aim to emerge from this period in a continued position of strength and leadership, and look forward to sharing more about our strategic and financial priorities at our financial analyst briefing on November 16, 2021.\nI'll now hand the program over to Fred.\nI'll concentrate my remarks on efforts to rebuild our production platform and progress on growth strategies.\nStarting with Aflac Japan, we're focusing on three areas to restore pre-pandemic production levels: product development, online or digitally-assisted sales, and specific sales initiatives within the Japan Post platform.\nRegarding product development, our revised medical product, EVER Prime, continues to receive positive reception.\nMedical product sales for the first half of the year have increased by roughly 48% compared to the same period in 2020 and are approaching pre-pandemic levels, down only 4% from the 2019 period.\nWe're regaining market share in the highly competitive medical market.\nEarlier this year, we launched our first short-term insurance product under a newly formed subsidiary called SUDACHI.\nThis product is a small-amount, substandard medical policy targeting customers who don't qualify for traditional medical coverage.\nIn the second quarter, we registered nearly 600 agencies with SUDACHI and issued about 230 policies.\nWhile this initiative is in its early stages, we plan to add more short-term health and income support products over time.\nWe're currently developing a new care product for supplementary elderly care coverage offered by Japan's government.\nIn the near future, we'll provide details on the strategic context and timing of this product, which we anticipate will become a significant contributor to future third sector sales, given the aging population and expected shift of financial responsibility from the government to individuals.\nWe've implemented technology enabling our agents to switch from in-person to virtual sales.\nWe initiated a nationwide advertising campaign on March 26 to promote this capability.\nIn Q2, we processed over 14,000 online applications, compared to nearly 8,000 in Q1.\nRegarding Japan Post, proposal activity has increased monthly as sales training and promotion spreads across the 20,000 branches selling our insurance.\nThrough June, Aflac Japan has conducted over 35,000 training sessions with Japan Post sales agents nationwide, and provided contact information for nearly 700,000 existing cancer policyholders to inform them about the latest coverage benefits.\nThird quarter activities include meeting with regional office managers in the JP system and visiting post offices to reinforce the sales process.\nIn the U.S., our group voluntary platform is performing well, with sales exceeding pre-pandemic 2019 levels.\nOverall sales recovery is centered on rebuilding our agent-driven small business franchise that was impacted by the pandemic.\nKey investment areas include recruitment, converting recruits to regular producers, and product development.\nWe've refocused our recruitment efforts on brokers over the past year, with new appointments surpassing pre-pandemic levels.\nAppointing small business brokers takes time to generate production but is essential for expanding our reach and gaining a foothold in the dental and vision markets.\nIndividual agent recruitment remains challenging, with weekly producer numbers at 70% of pre-pandemic levels.\nAgent recruitment is affected by onboarding and training restrictions due to COVID, tight labor markets, and employment subsidy programs, which we expect to improve later in the year.\nOur Network Dental product is approved in 43 states and Vision in 42 states, with more states to be added later this year.\nWe're finishing national training programs and about half of our trained agents have quoted our new dental and vision products.\nAlthough it's early, we're seeing monthly increases in volume, and over half of our dental and vision cases include voluntary benefit sales.\nWe believe this supports our strategic goal of increasing access to new accounts and deepening relationships with existing ones.\nAs mentioned last quarter, our 2021 dental and vision strategy can be summarized as a year to launch, learn, and adjust.\nOur Premier Life and Disability platform continues to support key client relationships and is building a pipeline of quoted business.\nOur service model remains excellent.\nSince the acquisition, we haven't lost any significant accounts and have seen early interest from some of our larger voluntary benefit clients.\nThis new business wouldn't have been possible without our recently acquired group capabilities.\nRegarding our e-commerce initiative, Aflac Direct, we offer critical illness, accident, and cancer coverage, now approved in 45 states, including California.\nThis platform aims to reach customers outside the traditional workplace setting.\nLike most digital sales platforms, we see higher conversion rates when a digital lead is transferred to a licensed call center agent.\nCurrently, most of our leads go to third-party call centers, and we're actively developing an Aflac licensed call center.\nOur digital platform overall has a 16% conversion rate on qualified leads, which is generally in line with many digital D2C insurance platforms.\nOur consumer market strategy also includes digital distribution and product partnerships, which, while still in early development, are designed to increase access to protection products and drive traffic to our site.\nIn the first half of 2021, these three new platforms combined for 5% of sales as they are still in early development stages.\nWe continue to predict a strong second half based on increased activity and expect these three growth initiatives will contribute up to 15% of sales in the second half of 2021.\nAflac Global Investments recently announced an investment partnership with Denham Capital.\nAflac has committed $2 billion over multiple years from its general account to launch a new debt platform focused on investing in senior secured debt of sustainable infrastructure projects.\nAflac will hold a 24.9% minority stake in the newly created Denham Sustainable Infrastructure entity.\nWe're also committing $100 million to Denham Equity Fund, which focuses on sustainable infrastructure investments.\nWe're pleased to partner with Denham, a recognized leader in sustainable infrastructure markets.\nUnder Eric's leadership, this transaction advances our strategy of partnering with external managers.\nWe seek partnerships with firms that have strong track records in specialized asset classes that play a crucial role in our portfolio.\nWe then use our capital to take minority stakes to maximize potential benefits.\nCombined with our recent Sound Point capital investment, we're advancing our ESG efforts by investing in sustainable infrastructure and distressed communities across the U.S.\nI'll now hand over to Max to provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance.\nI'll start my comments by reviewing our Q2 performance, focusing on how our core capital and earnings drivers have developed.\nIn Q2, adjusted earnings per share rose 24.2% to $1.59.\nThe slightly weaker yen-dollar exchange rate didn't significantly impact adjusted earnings per diluted share.\nThis strong quarterly performance was mainly driven by lower claims utilization due to the pandemic, particularly in the U.S. Additionally, variable investment income was $112 million above our long-term return expectations.\nAdjusted book value per share, including foreign currency translation gains and losses, grew 20.5%.\nThe adjusted ROE, excluding foreign currency impact, was a robust 17%, representing a significant spread over our cost of capital.\nTurning to our Japan segment, total earned premium for the quarter decreased 3.8%, reflecting the impact of first sector policies reaching paid-up status, while earned premium for our third sector products fell 2.3% due to recent low sales volumes.\nJapan's total benefit ratio was 66.9% for the quarter, down 290 basis points year-over-year.\nThe third sector benefit ratio decreased by 305 basis points year-over-year to 56.5%.\nOur third sector block experienced a slightly higher than usual IBNR release as claims continued to be favorable compared to initial reserve estimates.\nThis quarter's IBNR release was mainly attributed to pandemic conditions limiting healthcare utilization since Q2 2020.\nAlthough claims activity has started to increase, it remains below long-term normal levels.\nIt can take up to a year for auto claim reporting data to fully mature.\nWith over a year of pandemic data now available, our estimates have become more accurate, resulting in larger IBNR releases.\nPersistency declined slightly by 10 basis points but remained robust at 94.7%.\nJapan's adjusted expense ratio increased by 80 basis points year-over-year to 20.8%.\nWe are continuing to invest in technology to make Aflac Japan paperless, which includes higher costs for system maintenance.\nAdditional expenses related to remote work also contributed to the higher expense ratio this quarter.\nAdjusted net investment income in yen terms grew by 27.4%, primarily due to good returns from our expanding alternatives portfolio and reduced hedge costs, partly offset by lower reinvestment yields on fixed-rate investments.\nJapan's pre-tax margin for the quarter rose by 450 basis points year-over-year to 26.5%, which was a very positive outcome.\nBased on this quarter's strong financial performance, we now expect Japan's full-year benefit ratio to be at the lower end of the 68.5% to 71% range provided at Fab.\nWe also expect the pre-tax margin to be at the upper end of the 20.5% to 22.5% range.\nFor U.S. operations, net earned premium decreased by 3.4% due to weaker sales.\nPersistency improved by 180 basis points to 80.1%.\nEmergency orders accounted for 63 basis points of the elevated persistency in both Q2 this year and last year, resulting in no net year-over-year impact for the quarter.\nLower sales contributed 80 basis points to improved persistency, as first-year lapse rates are about twice the total in-force lapse rates.\nConservation efforts accounted for another 30 basis points of improved persistency, with the remainder largely due to better experience.\nOur total benefit ratio was lower than expected at 43.5%, which is 80 basis points below Q2 2020, a quarter heavily impacted by the initial pandemic.\nReduced claims utilization affects our estimates for incurred claims as data matures throughout the year.\nAs our data becomes more mature, we rely more on raw data, and with a year of pandemic data available, we lowered our IBNR to reflect decreased utilization.\nThis quarter, IBNR releases had a 5.6 percentage point impact on the benefit ratio, resulting in an underlying benefit ratio of 49.1% when excluding IBNR releases.\nWe anticipate the benefit ratio will gradually increase for the rest of the year as normal activities resume in our communities and among policyholders.\nFor the full year, we now project our benefit ratio to be between 45% and 48%, compared to our initial guidance of 48% to 51%.\nThe U.S. expense ratio increased by 160 basis points year-over-year to 36.9%, with several contributing factors.\nLower sales negatively impact revenue, but the effect on our expense ratio is balanced by reduced DAC and commission expenses.\nIncreased advertising spending raised the expense ratio by 60 basis points.\nOur ongoing development of growth initiatives in group life and disability, network dental and vision, and direct-to-consumer contributed to a 170 basis point increase in the ratio.\nThese strategic growth investments are largely offset by our efforts to reduce core operating expenses as we aim to be the low-cost provider in the voluntary benefits market.\nOverall, despite many variables, Q2 expenses are in line with our plan.\nWe also incurred $5.5 million in integration and transition expenses related to recent acquisitions, which are not included in adjusted earnings.\nU.S. adjusted net investment income grew by 9.9%, primarily due to favorable variable investment income for the quarter.\nThe U.S. segment showed strong profitability with a pre-tax margin of 25.4%, driven mainly by a low benefit ratio.\nWith the first half of the year complete, we are raising our full-year pre-tax margin expectations.\nInitially, we expected to be near the lower end of the 16% to 19% range.\nWe now anticipate finishing slightly above the range indicated at fab.\nIn our Corporate segment, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $76 million, as adjusted net investment income was $45 million lower than last year due to low short-term interest rates and amortization of certain tax credit investments, which amounted to $30 million this quarter at the corporate level.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, we recognize a negative impact on corporate NII, offset by a lower effective tax rate for the enterprise.\nThis creates some reported volatility in our Corporate segment, but the economic returns on these investments exceed our cost of equity capital.\nTo date, these investments are performing well and meeting expectations.\nOur capital position remains strong, with an SMR above 900% in Japan and an RBC of approximately 600% in Aflac Columbus at the end of the quarter.\nUnencumbered holding company liquidity was $4.4 billion, which is $2 billion above our minimum balance, excluding the $400 million proceeds from the sustainability bond issued in March to support our ESG initiatives.\nLeverage, including our sustainability bond, remains at a comfortable 22.8%, in the middle of our 20% to 25% leverage range.\nWe repurchased $500 million of our own stock and paid $223 million in dividends during the quarter, providing good relative IRR on these capital deployments.\nWe will continue to be flexible and strategic in managing the balance sheet and deploying capital to drive strong risk-adjusted ROE with a significant spread to our cost of capital.\nSummary: ",

    "pred_output": "2021 has been a challenging year, but we're pleased with our progress in navigating the pandemic and adapting to the changing environment. We've made significant strides in rebuilding our production platform, and our financial performance has been strong. We're well-positioned to emerge from this period in a continued position of strength and leadership. We're committed to our long-term growth strategy and will continue to prioritize maintaining strong capital ratios, prudent liquidity, and capital management. We're excited about our growth initiatives and the potential they hold for long-term success. We'll continue to share our progress and insights with you throughout the year. Thank you for your continued support. I'll now hand the program over to Fred. Fred, please proceed. Fred: Thank you, Eric. I'll now focus on our efforts to rebuild our production platform and progress on growth strategies. Starting with Aflac Japan, we're focusing on three areas to restore pre-pandemic production levels: product development, online or digitally-assisted sales, and specific sales initiatives within the Japan Post platform. Regarding product development, our revised medical product, EVER Prime, continues to receive positive reception. Medical product sales for the first half of the year have increased by roughly 48% compared to the same period in 2020 and are approaching pre-pandemic levels, down only 4% from the 2019 period. We're regaining market share in the highly competitive medical market. Earlier this year, we launched our first short-term insurance product under a newly formed subsidiary called SUDACHI. This product is a small-amount, substandard medical policy targeting customers who don't qualify for traditional medical coverage. In the second quarter, we registered nearly 600 agencies with SUDACHI and issued about 230 policies. While this initiative is in its early stages, we plan to add more short-term health and income support products over time. We're currently developing a new care product for supplementary elderly care coverage offered by Japan's government. In the near future, we'll provide details on the strategic context and timing of this product, which we anticipate will become a significant contributor to future third sector sales, given the aging population and expected shift of financial responsibility from the government to individuals. We've implemented technology enabling our agents to switch from in-person to virtual sales. We initiated a nationwide advertising campaign on March 26 to promote this capability. In Q2, we processed over 14,000 online applications, compared to nearly 8,000 in Q1.
