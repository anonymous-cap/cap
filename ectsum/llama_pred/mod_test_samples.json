    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We have prepared visual aids to complement our presentation today.\nI am Pankaj Gupta, the vice president of investor relations at Dow.\nThese statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, as they are forward-looking.\nDetailed discussions of principal risks and uncertainties that may cause differences can be found in Dow's Forms 10-Q and 10-K.\nAll financial information, where applicable, excludes significant items unless otherwise noted.\nWe will also discuss non-GAAP measures.\nOur agenda for the call is shown on Slide 2.\nJim will start by discussing our fourth quarter and full year highlights, as well as the performance of our operating segments.\nHoward will then provide our outlook and modeling guidance.\nJim will conclude by explaining how we will continue to execute our priorities to deliver value growth.\nLet's begin with Slide 3.\nDow achieved year-over-year growth in both top and bottom lines during the fourth quarter, with sales increases and margin expansion across all operating segments.\nOur results demonstrate the strength and resilience of our advantaged portfolio and the exceptional efforts of the Dow team in ensuring the well-being and safety of our employees and communities.\nWe achieved a 34% increase in year-over-year sales, with gains across all operating segments, businesses, and regions.\nAlthough volume decreased by 4% year-over-year due to supply constraints from various factors, including our own maintenance, lingering effects of weather-related outages, and global logistics challenges, we continued to observe strong underlying demand across our end markets, particularly for higher-margin downstream and sustainability-led applications.\nPrices rose by 39% year-over-year, reflecting increases in all operating segments, businesses, and regions.\nOur discipline and adaptability allowed us to navigate supply constraints, logistics challenges, dual control actions in China, and rising energy costs.\nWe achieved operating EBIT growth of $1.2 billion year-over-year with margin expansion in all operating segments.\nEquity earnings also increased year-over-year, with margin expansion at our joint ventures in Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and Kuwait.\nThese results led to significant cash generation for the quarter, with cash flow from operations of $2.6 billion, an increase of $901 million year-over-year, and a cash flow conversion rate of 88%.\nWe returned $912 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $512 million through our industry-leading dividend and $400 million in share repurchases.\nOur fourth quarter performance capped a record year for Dow, as highlighted on Slide 4.\nIn 2021, Team Dow capitalized on the economic recovery, achieving record sales and earnings performance despite pandemic-driven uncertainty and industrywide weather-related challenges.\nOur focus on cash flow and disciplined capital allocation allowed us to continue delivering on our financial priorities.\nWe generated $7.1 billion of cash flow from operations, bringing our total cash flow from operations since spin to $18 billion.\nWe improved our balance sheet by reducing gross debt by an additional $2.4 billion during the year, bringing down gross debt by more than $5 billion since spin.\nWe have no substantial debt maturities until 2026.\nWe proactively funded our U.S. pension plans and successfully executed Sadara's debt reprofiling, reducing Dow's guarantees by over $2 billion.\nSince spin, Dow has returned a total of $7.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including $3.1 billion in 2021.\nWe kept capital expenditures well within depreciation and amortization as we continue to invest in higher-return and faster-payback growth opportunities.\nIn 2021, we achieved a return on invested capital of over 22% due to strong earnings growth.\nAs we move past the pandemic, we do so with a strong balance sheet and a deliberate, disciplined strategy to decarbonize and grow.\nWe achieved this record financial performance in 2021 while advancing our ESG leadership.\nNotably, we announced our disciplined strategy to decarbonize our assets while improving underlying EBITDA by more than $3 billion as we capitalize on our participation in attractive, high-growth end markets and sustainability-driven solutions.\nOur ESG efforts continue to receive external recognition, as we were recently acknowledged by JUST Capital for the third year.\nDow earned the top position in the chemicals sector overall, as well as the number one ranking in the workers and stakeholders in governance categories within the industry.\nI am extremely proud of Team Dow's dedication to delivering for our customers and creating value for all of our stakeholders.\nWe will build upon these achievements in 2022 as we advance our ambition.\nLet's move to our operating segment performance for the fourth quarter on Slide 5.\nThe packaging and specialty plastics segment reported operating EBIT of $1.4 billion, an increase of $662 million year-over-year, primarily due to margin improvement and partially offset by lower supply volumes.\nSequentially, operating EBIT decreased by $512 million, and operating EBIT margins declined by 520 basis points due to lower olefin and co-product pricing, combined with higher raw material and energy costs.\nThe packaging and specialty plastics business reported higher net sales year-over-year, driven by price gains in all regions, as well as in key applications such as flexible food, industrial, and consumer packaging.\nVolume declined year-over-year, primarily in Asia-Pacific, due to supply constraints.\nIn the industrial intermediates and infrastructure segment, operating EBIT was $595 million, an increase of $299 million year-over-year, primarily due to continued price strength.\nSequentially, operating EBIT decreased by $118 million, and operating EBIT margins declined by 280 basis points, primarily driven by higher energy costs in Europe and our planned maintenance turnaround activity.\nThe polyurethanes and construction chemicals business increased net sales compared to the year-ago period, with broad-based price gains in all regions.\nVolume declines were primarily due to a planned transition away from a low-margin co-producer contract and our planned maintenance turnaround activity.\nThe industrial solutions business delivered improved net sales compared to the year-ago period, with local price gains in all regions.\nSales volume remained unchanged compared to the previous year, as increased sales from a renewable energy agreement were balanced out by reduced licensing and catalyst transactions.\nThe performance materials and coatings division reported an operating EBIT of $295 million, up from $50 million in the same period last year, with margins rising by 900 basis points due to strong pricing for silicones and coatings products.\nOperating EBID increased by $11 million from the previous quarter, as price increases were partially offset by planned maintenance activities.\nThe consumer solutions division saw higher net sales compared to the previous year, with local price increases across all regions and product applications.\nSales volume decreased as high demand, especially for industrial, electronics, and personal care products, was counterbalanced by reduced supply availability due to the company's decision to advance maintenance work to coincide with dual-control measures in China.\nThe coatings and performance monomers division achieved higher net sales year-over-year, as increased raw material costs and strong industry demand led to price increases in all regions.\nSales growth in architectural coatings in the United States and Canada was more than offset by lower merchant sales of acrylic monomers, partly due to Dow's increased internal use.\nOur diverse portfolio continues to allow us to take advantage of attractive market trends with higher-margin downstream products.\nOur four main market sectors are each expanding at rates of 1.3 to 1.5 times GDP and benefiting from sustainability trends.\nWe are meeting this demand with higher-margin solutions, including functional polymers, alkoxylates, surfactants, polyurethane systems, sustainable coatings, and performance silicones.\nIn the packaging sector, demand for materials with lower carbon emissions, recyclability, and circularity is driving demand for Dow's leading plastics portfolio and in-house application design capabilities.\nDow's wide range of products and hybrid innovations for infrastructure will continue to benefit from government investments and incentives, with particularly resilient demand in the Americas, Europe, as well as in the Middle East, Africa, and India.\nWe observe global demand across the diverse consumer market sector remaining high, especially for applications such as electronics, 5G, appliances, pharmaceuticals, and home care, where several of Dow's growth investments are focused.\nIn the mobility sector, Dow's portfolio of specialty silicones, polyurethanes, and elastomers is uniquely positioned to benefit from growing electric and autonomous vehicle trends.\nThese attractive market sectors are supported by favorable balances across our key value chains, with continued strength in consumer and industrial end markets.\nEconomic recovery is expected to continue, with forecasts predicting above-average global GDP growth in 2022.\nWhile the omicron variant has caused some short-term disruption, we do not expect it to significantly alter the current recovery trajectory, especially as global vaccination rates and treatment options continue to improve.\nSeveral factors support continued strength across our end markets.\nConsumer finances remain healthy, with significant pent-up demand driven by more than $5 trillion in additional savings accumulated during the pandemic.\nManufacturing growth is expected to remain strong, supported by increasing investments in infrastructure and accelerated adoption of 5G, electric vehicles, and sustainability trends.\nWith retail inventories remaining low and backlogs high, easing supply chain issues should lead to additional volume growth in 2022, as manufacturing activity increases to meet strong consumer demand.\nThis will be a focus for Dow as we work closely with our customers to fulfill order backlogs and replenish inventories to meet robust demand and increased service levels.\nIn the first quarter, we expect these demand trends to drive growth, particularly following the Chinese Lunar New Year.\nDemand remains strong in packaging and specialty plastics.\nAlthough domestic polyethylene supply improved through the fourth quarter, comonomer supply remains limited.\nTrade sources predict another year of higher-than-average turnaround activity.\nThese factors, combined with improvements in shipping logistics that will help meet demand in the export market, are leading to more favorable supply and demand balances domestically.\nEquity earnings are expected to be lower sequentially due to rising feedstock costs impacting Asian olefin margins.\nWe anticipate higher raw material and energy costs, particularly in Europe and Asia.\nOverall, we expect an approximately $200 million impact compared to the prior quarter for this segment.\nUsing our best-in-class feedstock flexibility and differentiated portfolio, Dow will continue to be adaptable to mitigate potential volatility and meet demand.\nIn industrial intermediates and infrastructure, strong demand for our high-value materials in appliances, construction, pharmaceuticals, home care, and energy applications, combined with tight supply and increased global infrastructure investment, are supporting a positive demand outlook.\nWe anticipate approximately a $100 million benefit in this segment from completed turnarounds in the fourth quarter, including Sadara's isocyanate facility and several in our core polyurethane business.\nWe expect the elevated energy costs in Europe will have a $75 million impact compared to the prior quarter for this segment.\nIn performance materials and coatings, increasing industrial activity and consumer demand for electronics and construction continues to outpace supply for our differentiated silicone products.\nThe industry also anticipates resilient demand for architectural coatings as rebuilding from low inventory levels in preparation for the Northern Hemisphere spring and summer months.\nThe completion of our turnaround in the fourth quarter at our siloxane facility in China will allow us to take advantage of tight global market conditions as silicon metal supplies improve and energy curtailments in China continue to ease.\nWe will also be executing a turnaround at our methacrylates facility in Deer Park.\nOverall, we expect a $25 million net benefit compared to the prior quarter from turnarounds for this segment.\nFor the full year, we continue to provide our best estimates of several income statement and cash flow drivers.\nWe expect lower equity earnings sequentially due to margin compression compared to the tighter conditions in 2021, particularly in Asia as oil remains strong, putting upward pressure on naphtha-based feedstock costs in the region.\nTotal turnaround spending for the year will be up approximately $100 million compared to 2021 as we have another heavy turnaround year with three crackers scheduled for maintenance activity and increased inflationary pressure on materials and labor.\nNet interest expense is expected to be approximately $600 million, benefiting from our proactive deleveraging actions since the spin-off.\nFor cash flow, we anticipate higher joint venture dividends from increased earnings in 2021 and a $1 billion benefit related to pension items following our actions last year.\nContinued investment in our digital initiatives will drive efficiency and enable us to achieve our $300 million EBITDA run rate on the program by 2025.\nWe will also complete the spending portion of our restructuring program which is now delivering a full $300 million EBITDA run rate as we enter 2022.\nAs highlighted at our investor day, we anticipate increasing our capital expenditures to $2.2 billion, well within our DNA target, as we continue to advance our higher return, faster payback projects, and execute on our decarbonize and grow strategy.\nThe macroeconomic environment remains positive in 2022.\nDow is in a strong position due to its global presence, adaptable raw material sourcing, efficiency initiatives, and eco-friendly solutions for clients.\nWe will continue to utilize these strengths as we deal with higher oil prices and ongoing inflation and logistics issues.\nAs the year progresses, we plan to increase production rates and improve service levels, expecting wider differences between oil and gas prices.\nMoving to the next slide.\nAt our October investor meeting, we outlined our focused strategy to reduce carbon emissions and expand the company, backed by ongoing earnings growth initiatives that will generate over $3 billion in underlying EBITDA growth.\nThis year, our investments in capital and operations are set to yield $200 million to $300 million in annual EBITDA and will cater to higher-margin, specialized applications where demand is growing as clients seek to lower their carbon footprint.\nIn the packaging and specialty plastics division, our recently completed Fort Saskatchewan expansion will contribute a full year of earnings growth to meet rising polyethylene demand.\nOur FCDh pilot facility in Louisiana will begin operations this year, producing propylene for coatings, electronics, and durable goods markets.\nNotably, this technology offers lower capital expenses, operating costs, and carbon emissions compared to traditional PDH methods.\nThese projects serve rapidly expanding, more sustainable market segments, such as renewable energy, to help reduce our customers' carbon emissions.\nFor instance, our endurance compounds for cable systems support next-generation, longer-lasting, and lower-emission infrastructure, including onshore and offshore wind farms, by cutting cable manufacturing carbon emissions by 80%.\nOur ENGAGE elastomers provide 35% better performance and efficiency for solar photovoltaic applications.\nIn the industrial intermediates and infrastructure sector, our alkoxylates and PU systems expansion projects are closely tied to brand owners' demand for higher-value, differentiated downstream applications across home and consumer care, agricultural, and infrastructure markets.\nFor example, our surfactants offer improved environmental benefits for leading brand owners' laundry and home care products.\nOur polyurethane system, PASCAL technology, enables up to 10% greater energy efficiency in appliances without increasing manufacturing costs.\nIn performance materials and coatings, we're increasing capacity in formulated solutions for coatings and silicones through incremental debottlenecking projects.\nOur products enable higher-performing, more sustainable solutions, targeting mobility, consumer, and infrastructure markets.\nFor instance, FASTRACK coatings support autonomous mobility infrastructure and have approximately 45% lower greenhouse gas emissions.\nOur DOWSIL technology enables higher-density, lower-cost battery packs for the rapidly growing electric vehicle market.\nLastly, as Howard mentioned, our restructuring program and digital investment will continue to support our low-cost operating model and top-quartile cost structure.\nMoving to the next slide.\nThe growing demand for sustainable products presents a significant growth opportunity for Dow with attractive pricing that will support longer-term, higher-quality earnings.\nOur clients are seeking ways to enhance their sustainability.\nWe are meeting these needs with lower-carbon emissions solutions starting with our own operations.\nOur Alberta project will reduce carbon emissions from approximately 20% of Dow's global ethylene capacity while increasing our global polyethylene supply by about 15%.\nWe are also collaborating with our suppliers to reduce our Scope 3 carbon emissions.\nTo date, we have established over 150 supplier agreements and have adopted third-party frameworks such as CDP, Together for Sustainability, and EcoVadis to drive concrete improvements in environmental performance throughout the value chain.\nWe continue to promote a circular economy for plastics and observe a consistent trend among our brand owner customers towards redesigning packages to be recyclable and incorporating 30% post-consumer recycled content in their packaging by 2030.\nSix of our largest facilities have now received International Sustainability and Carbon Certification PLUS recognition for tracking the use of sustainable raw materials.\nWe're advancing our partnership with Mura Technology to expand advanced recycling solutions and secure circular product supply.\nMura has begun construction on the new plant, which is expected to start operations around the end of the year.\nRecently, we announced an investment in Mr. Green Africa, the first recycling company in Africa to be a Certified B Corporation, which includes socially responsible waste collection and plans to jointly develop new flexible plastic packaging that will enable more sustainable packaging solutions.\nThis pioneering investment for Dow in Africa will serve as a model to be replicated in other developing regions worldwide.\nWe continue to expand our recyclable offerings, recently doubling sales with Chinese laundry brand, Liby, and increasing our addressable market opportunities.\nSimilar to the partnerships Dow recently announced to source pyrolysis oil from Gunvor and New Hope Energy, these investments in circularity demonstrate our progress and solid foundation as we grow and scale circular solutions.\nTo conclude, on the final slide, 2021 was an exceptional year for Team Dow.\nWe achieved record financial results and continued to execute our strategic priorities with discipline.\nBuilding on this foundation, we're focused on advancing our plan to decarbonize our assets and grow earnings.\nOur competitive advantage allows us to meet the increasing needs of our customers and consumers who are demanding more circular and sustainable products while we work to achieve zero carbon emissions in our own operations.\nLooking ahead, our priorities remain consistent.\nOur focus on profitable growth, while maintaining a low-cost position and best-owner mindset, will enable us to deliver on our earnings growth targets.\nWe'll continue to maintain our balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation, driving higher returns for the company and our shareholders while retaining the financial flexibility that has served us well.\nWe'll continue to advance our leadership in ESG with a clear path to achieve our zero carbon circularity and sustainability targets.\nThe world and our customers are demanding a more sustainable future.\nAs we execute our ambition, I am confident that we will create significant, long-term value for all of our stakeholders.\nOperator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Prior to starting, I want to note that we'll be discussing future projections and expectations in today's call.\nJoining us for today's call are Textron's CEO and chairman Scott Donnelly, along with our CFO Frank Connor.\nThe quarter's revenue was $3.3 billion, a decrease from $3.7 billion in the same quarter last year.\nWe reported $0.93 per share in income from continuing operations for this year's fourth quarter.\nWe recorded $5 million in pre-tax special charges during the quarter, related to our 2020 restructuring plan, which equates to $0.01 per share after tax.\nWhen excluding these special charges, our adjusted income from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.94 per share for Q4 2021, compared to $1.06 per share in Q4 2020.\nThe quarter's segment profit was $310 million, a $14 million decrease from Q4 2020.\nManufacturing cash flow before pension contributions amounted to $298 million in the quarter.\nFor the entire year, revenues reached $12.4 billion, an increase of $731 million from the previous year.\nAdjusted income from continuing operations was $3.30 per share, up from $2.07 per share in 2020.\nManufacturing cash flow before pension contributions reached $1.1 billion, an increase from $596 million in 2020.\nOur company concluded the year with another robust quarter.\nIn the aviation sector, we continue to observe favorable market conditions, including better aircraft usage, low levels of pre-owned inventory, and strong customer interest.\nOrder activity remained robust with backlog growth of $655 million in the quarter and $2.5 billion for the entire year, resulting in a $4.1 billion backlog at year's end.\nConsequently, we delivered aircraft more consistently throughout the year, which enhanced manufacturing efficiency and cash flow generation.\nReflecting this improved operating environment and strong performance by our teams, aviation achieved a segment margin of 10.1% in Q4.\nThroughout the year, we delivered 167 jets, an increase from 132 last year, and 125 commercial turboprops, up from 113 in 2020.\nAdditionally, we observed sequentially higher aftermarket revenue on a quarterly basis, driven by increased aircraft usage.\nTurning to defense, aviation secured a $143 million contract for eight AT-6 aircraft, ground support equipment, spare parts, and training from the Royal Thai Air Force.\nThis contract establishes Thailand as the first international customer for the U.S. Air Force's newest light attack aircraft.\nRegarding new products, the Beechcraft Denali completed its maiden flight in November, initiating the flight test program.\nTotal revenues decreased slightly in the quarter, primarily due to lower military revenues as anticipated, reflecting the ongoing wind-down of the H-1 production program, partially offset by higher commercial revenues.\nIn December, Bell finished the first assault improvement modifications of an Air Force CV-22 Osprey.\nThis effort is part of an ongoing initiative to upgrade the Air Force Osprey fleet.\nOn the commercial side of Bell, we delivered 156 helicopters in 2021, an increase from 140 in 2020.\nWe also witnessed strong commercial order activity for the year, indicative of broad-based demand.\nShifting focus to Textron Systems.\nWe observed another quarter of strong performance that contributed to a full-year margin of 14.8%, a 320 basis point increase from 2020.\nDuring the quarter, we delivered the fourth Ship-to-Shore Connector to the U.S. Navy following its successful completion of acceptance trials.\nFor the Shadow program, Systems was awarded an $82 million logistics support contract for 2022.\nRegarding our common unmanned surface vessel platform, we completed file testing related to the unmanned influenced sweep system program, setting the stage for a potential production contract award in Q1 2022.\nRevenues decreased in the quarter as we continued to face supply chain challenges, including order disruptions in Kautex related to global auto OEM production schedules.\nAt Textron's specialized vehicle division, we are experiencing robust pricing conditions and consistent retail demand.\nBoth businesses witnessed sequential revenue growth in the quarter, despite ongoing supply chain issues.\nThere were numerous noteworthy achievements across our segments in 2021.\nStrong customer demand and order activity throughout the year in aviation led to a $2.5 billion increase in backlog.\nWe continued our product update strategy by introducing the Citation M2 XLS and CJ4 Gen2 aircraft.\nThe Sky Courier completed its flight test program with 2,100 hours of activity, and we anticipate FAA certification in the first half of 2022.\nAt Bell, we continued our work on the Future Vertical Lift programs.\nWe submitted our proposal for the FLRAA program in September, and the U.S. Army is expected to award the contract in 2022.\nSignificant progress has been made on the 360 Invictus prototype for FARA, with 75% of the work completed by year-end.\nWe launched the Bell Manufacturing Technology Center, an innovative facility for testing and refining technologies and processes across Bell's core production capabilities.\nAt Textron Systems, ATAC expanded its fleet of certified F1 aircraft to meet increased demand for U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps tactical air programs.\nWe continued our innovation efforts with the introduction of the Ripsaw M5 prototype vehicle for the U.S. Army and the Cottonmouth ARV for the Marine Corps.\nAt Textron specialized vehicles, we formed a strategic partnership with GM to support our ground support equipment business and the electrification of airport vehicles globally.\nWe also launched the Liberty, the first Personal Transportation Vehicle in the industry to offer four forward-facing seats in a compact, golf cart-sized platform powered by a lithium-ion battery.\nKautex secured eight contracts for new vehicle programs featuring our hybrid electric fuel systems in 2021.\nFor 2022, we anticipate growth in aviation driven by increased deliveries across all product lines and higher aftermarket volume.\nAt Bell, 2022 marks the beginning of a transitional period with expected lower revenues from military production programs while awaiting the FLRAA program decision and award.\nWe expect flat revenue at Systems, with growth in ship-to-shore and tactical air programs offset by lower fee-for-service volume.\nIn the industrial segment, we anticipate revenue growth and margin improvement.\nWe expect increasing volumes from improving OEM auto production at Kautex.\nFor specialized vehicles, we anticipate improving supply chain conditions and increasing volumes across our product lines.\nWe launched our eAviation initiative in early 2021 to leverage resources and expertise across our aviation businesses for developing new opportunities in aircraft using electric propulsion systems.\nIn 2022, we plan to expand these efforts and increase investment in developing technologies to accelerate the shift to sustainable flight, including eVTOL and fixed-wing aircraft.\nWith this background, we project revenues of approximately $13.3 billion for Textron's 2022 financial guidance.\nWe forecast earnings per share in the range of $3.80 to $4 per share.\nManufacturing cash flow before pension contributions is expected to be between $700 million and $800 million.\nLet's examine each segment's contribution, beginning with Textron Aviation, where revenues of $1.4 billion were $201 million lower than the previous year, primarily due to reduced aircraft volume, partially offset by higher aftermarket volume.\nThe segment's profit in the fourth quarter was $137 million, an increase of $29 million from the same period last year, mainly due to favorable pricing net of inflation of $21 million and enhanced manufacturing performance.\nThe segment's backlog at the end of the quarter stood at $4.1 billion.\nRevenues totaled $858 million, a decrease of $13 million from the previous year, reflecting lower military revenues, partially offset by higher commercial revenues.\nSegment profit of $88 million was $22 million lower, primarily due to reduced military volume and mix.\nThe segment's backlog at the end of the quarter was $3.9 billion.\nTextron Systems experienced a revenue decrease of $44 million, totaling $313 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to reduced volume influenced by the U.S. Army's Afghanistan withdrawal affecting fee-for-service contracts.\nThe segment's profit declined by $4 million to $45 million, mainly attributed to lower volume.\nThe segment concluded the quarter with a backlog of $2.1 billion.\nIndustrial revenues decreased by $85 million to $781 million, reflecting reduced volume and mix of $133 million, mostly in fuel systems and functional components, due to global auto OEM supply chain shortages, partly offset by a $50 million favorable pricing impact in specialized vehicles.\nThe segment's profit dropped by $17 million to $38 million compared to the previous year's fourth quarter, primarily due to lower volume and mix, partially mitigated by improved performance.\nThe Finance segment generated $11 million in revenue and $2 million in profit.\nCorporate expenses and interest expense each amounted to $29 million.\nManufacturing cash flow before pension contributions reached $298 million for the quarter and $1.1 billion for the entire year.\nThe company repurchased about 4.5 million shares in the quarter, returning $335 million to shareholders.\nThroughout the year, approximately 13.5 million shares were repurchased, returning $921 million to shareholders.\nNow focusing on the 2022 outlook.\nTextron Aviation anticipates revenues of roughly $5.5 billion, with increased deliveries across all product lines and higher aftermarket volume.\nThe segment's margin is projected to be between 10% and 11%, reflecting higher volume, favorable pricing, and improved operating leverage.\nBell expects revenues of about $3 billion, with lower military volume, mainly due to decreased H-1 production.\nThe margin forecast is between 10% and 11%, largely due to reduced military volumes and ongoing high R&D investment.\nSystems estimates revenues of approximately $1.3 billion with a margin range of 13.5% to 14.5%.\nIndustrial segment anticipates revenues of about $3.5 billion, driven by higher

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:During today's management presentation, we will be covering non-GAAP financial measures.\nIn the second quarter, patient numbers across our entire range of services have now surpassed levels seen before the pandemic.\nComparing the same units, overall volume increased by 1.3% compared to the second quarter of 2019, with hospital-based services growing by 0.1% and office-based services rising by 5.2%.\nI should mention that other crucial indicators which were particularly unstable during the previous winter continued to show steady improvement as we entered the summer months.\nFor the second quarter in a row, the payer mix remained favorable compared to the previous year, and the rate of admissions to our NICU also followed this trend.\nConsequently, our quarterly revenue of $473 million and adjusted EBITDA of $66 million both exceeded our internal projections.\nWe face certain challenges, with the most significant being the recent surge in COVID-19 cases due to the Delta variant.\nHowever, our updated outlook for the entire year takes into account our experiences thus far.\nLooking ahead to 2022 and beyond, while considering the same risks, several factors increase my confidence that we'll see further growth in adjusted EBITDA, surpassing the $270 million run rate we achieved before COVID.\nI'll elaborate on these factors in three areas.\nWe're gaining momentum in our core business.\nWhile demand has bounced back more quickly than we expected earlier in the year, we're also driving additional growth across our practices.\nI mentioned earlier this year the investments we've made in enhancing patient access, improving scheduling, and increasing pace and efficiency.\nThe second quarter is the first time we can estimate the impact of these initiatives, and we believe we've only just begun by adding approximately $2 million to the top line in the quarter.\nI'm very optimistic that this is just the start of a long-term payoff.\nPlease remember that we call this initiative patient access because that's exactly what it is.\nWe aim to ensure that patients who need our care receive it as quickly as possible.\nOur redesigned and focused sales efforts are accelerating our pipeline of organic growth.\nWe have an exceptional, focused, and organized team that makes this a reality.\nHalfway through this year, our new business bookings, meaning new contract sales, have already approached our total bookings for 2020.\nOur success rate has improved.\nOur time to close deals has decreased, and our pipeline remains strong and diverse across multiple specialties.\nOur M&A pipeline continues to grow, with several acquisitions of important specialty groups completed so far this year.\nFor instance, Child Neurology Consultants of Austin recently joined the MEDNAX family.\nThis group of 12 physicians and three nurse practitioners is among the top neurology groups in the country.\nThe absence of local neurology coverage is a major reason for transferring patients away from the birth hospital.\nThis is the most recent example of investing to further support our hospital-based practices with subspecialty consultation, allowing infants to stay close to their homes.\nWe believe this is also a plan for growth, both geographically and through telehealth.\nWe're still in the early stages of establishing our presence in children's primary and urgent care.\nFollowing our acquisition of NightLight, we're now planning to open new clinics outside of NightLight's home base in Houston.\nWe're also working on additional investments and initiatives for primary and urgent care that we believe will significantly accelerate this expansion.\nWe also believe that our extensive experience in women's and children's health will enable us to make meaningful changes to many aspects of pediatric care nationwide.\nI look forward to updating you on our progress during future calls.\nWe're making significant progress in improving the efficiency of our practice support infrastructure.\nMark Richards will discuss some of this advancement, but I'll emphasize our previously announced deal with R1 to shift our RCM operations to them, which provides immediate administrative cost reductions and enables enhanced profitability that I'm sure would have been unattainable if we had continued independently.\nIt's important to understand that our projections for 2021 should be considered as works in progress, far from finalized.\nIn the coming years, we anticipate that the complete advantages of our efficiency enhancements will be combined with our ongoing and accumulating growth initiatives, which are currently just beginning to show incremental results.\nThese combined elements reinforce our belief that we can achieve adjusted EBITDA exceeding $270 million in 2022, as I mentioned earlier.\nNaturally, none of this would be possible without the robustness of our core operations and an unwavering focus on our primary objective: providing exceptional care to our patients.\nI find it particularly relevant to reiterate this point to you today.\nAs the nation continues to navigate through the pandemic, conversations with our medical professionals and clinical leaders reveal an increasing demand for many of the specialized services our physicians provide, emphasizing the importance of these doctors operating within a highly integrated, collaborative network to ensure patients receive necessary services at the precise moment they're needed.\nI'll request Mack, an experienced neonatologist and pediatrician, to explain the reasons behind the resurgence in patient volumes across various specialties and the significance of having access to a complete spectrum of care for expectant parents, newborns, and children.\nI'll begin by describing what we're observing across the country at present.\nFor the benefit of all our stakeholders, I'll then provide some insights into our identity as a national medical group and how MEDNAX is uniquely positioned to address both current and future healthcare environments.\nThe market trends we're currently observing can be described as twofold.\nAs lockdown measures have eased, our pediatric specialists are witnessing a surge in respiratory illnesses during summer, which typically occur in winter months.\nWe've also noticed a significant increase in behavioral health issues leading to admissions in both pediatric intensive care and pediatric hospital services.\nFurthermore, the American Academy of Pediatrics now recommends cardiac evaluations for any child with COVID before they return to sports activities.\nOur various pediatric specialists, including cardiologists, hospitalists, critical care physicians, surgeons, urgent care physicians, and others, are all dealing with the immediate and long-term consequences of COVID-19.\nWe believe that regardless of the current infection rates in our communities, the effects of isolation and delayed healthcare will continue to necessitate access to our full range of pediatric specialty services.\nThese services represent scarce national resources, and access to them is crucial for the health of children and our communities.\nAlong with the significant increases in total births and NICU admissions reported this quarter, our maternal-fetal medicine volumes have now considerably exceeded pre-pandemic levels.\nIt's evident that, at least in the short term, trends in pregnancies and deliveries have turned upward.\nAcross the nation, access to highly trained obstetrical specialists is vital for the health of expectant parents facing high-risk pregnancies.\nSeveral states have highlighted the risk of increased childbirth complications that can result from insufficient access to proper care.\nAll the insurance providers we work with, both private and public, emphasize the importance of access to high-quality maternal care.\nTo provide some statistical context for these two phenomena, I'll note that compared to the second quarter of 2019, on a same-unit basis, volumes in our pediatric intensive care units increased by 11.5% and pediatric hospitalist volumes rose by 4%.\nIn outpatient services, pediatric surgery volumes grew by 8% and maternal-fetal medicine increased by 9%.\nPediatric cardiology volume is still slightly down by 2%, but we anticipate this could increase as we move into autumn.\nThese statistics demonstrate the wide range of specialty services provided across our organization nationwide, and the increasing demand for these services in this rapidly evolving environment.\nBeyond these numbers, I'll speak to you now as a physician who has had the privilege of being a leader at MEDNAX for many years.\nThere's a comprehensive spectrum of care that is absolutely essential for prenatal, newborn, and pediatric populations.\nThis is precisely what our pediatrics and Obstetrix medical groups provide every day, throughout the year.\nWe are much more than a collection of practices and clinicians entrusted with the lives of thousands of women and children annually.\nMoreover, we are a highly integrated group of affiliated maternal and pediatric practices that collaborate to deliver care across the entire spectrum of pregnancy, childhood, and in some cases, even adulthood.\nThis includes maternal-fetal medicine doctors, obstetricians, hospitalists, and neonatologists, all working closely to provide diagnostic care to mothers at risk of complicated pregnancies and to offer routine and emergency triage evaluation and care to pregnant patients presenting at hospitals, as well as to provide a complete inpatient spectrum of maternal and neonatal care.\nIt includes pediatric hospitalists covering services ranging from smaller community pediatric units to large tertiary referral services, emergency medicine physicians who treat patients in dedicated pediatric emergency departments, and pediatric critical care physicians who care for severely ill children and adolescents with a wide range of medical and surgical problems, including patients requiring cardiac surgery.\nWith the addition of NightLight Urgent Care, it now includes pediatric urgent care clinicians who see pediatric patients at times and places convenient for parents, in an environment that's appropriate for their child.\nMark previously mentioned the vast potential at MEDNAX to revolutionize pediatric primary and urgent care practices nationwide, which aligns perfectly with our main business focus.\nThe organization incorporates specialists in developmental medicine who assess and manage developmental disorders, often treating patients who were previously in our NICU.\nPediatric cardiologists within the organization evaluate and treat a wide range of childhood heart conditions and adult congenital heart issues, while also supporting neonatology and hospitalized pediatric patients, including those in intensive and cardiac intensive care.\nWe are expanding our services by incorporating various pediatric specialties such as neurology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, and infectious disease to provide better care for our patients and their families.\nOur pediatric surgical services are rapidly growing, encompassing general surgery, urology, ophthalmology, orthopedics, E&T, and plastic surgery.\nThese specialized surgical services are not only crucial for our pediatric communities individually but also support our inpatient services.\nI hope this helps you understand how interconnected our organization is.\nOur network of care, spanning from pregnancy through childhood and sometimes beyond, is what makes our services unique and essential.\nWe work closely with our hospital partners to deliver these services.\nHospitals typically maintain long-term relationships with us due to our shared commitment to patients, efforts to maintain strategic alignment, and our ability to provide extensive resources to affiliated clinicians.\nInstead of discussing each aspect of our P&L, I'll focus on our G&A restructuring and stabilization efforts during the quarter and our expectations for the latter half of this year.\nI'll also briefly touch on our current financial position.\nWe undertook numerous activities this quarter to refine our support services and improve efficiency while prioritizing service to our practices.\nIn May, we finalized an agreement with R1 to transfer our RCM functions to them, following a thorough evaluation process.\nWe determined that R1's scale, technology investments, and focus on revenue cycle management would provide our affiliated clinicians with capabilities we couldn't match internally.\nThe agreement results in immediate G&A savings and is expected to yield future improvements in RCM performance and revenue enhancements.\nThe transition to R1 resulted in net G&A savings for the second quarter, though we did record some one-time expenses related to terminating existing third-party RCM contracts.\nWe also achieved two significant milestones in IT and infrastructure modernization: completing a major data center consolidation and implementing an advanced Oracle ERP solution.\nThese long-planned projects led to increased IT spending in the second quarter, approximately $3 million to $4 million more than the previous year's total G&A increase.\nWe've largely completed support services related to the PSA arrangement from last year's anesthesia organization sale and plan to wind down remaining services through Q3.\nWe sold a secondary corporate office building in Florida, receiving $25 million in cash and recording a $7 million gain, which will lead to annual G&A savings of $2 million to $3 million.\nWith these actions behind us, we anticipate our G&A spending for the second half of this year to be less than the $137 million incurred in the first half.\nWe generated $70 million in operating cash flow for the second quarter, ending with $338 million in cash and net debt of $662 million, implying leverage of less than three times.\nOur balance sheet shows a $29 million income tax receivable, primarily related to tax elections from last year's Anesthesiology Medical group sale, expected to be received in late 2021 or early 2022.\nBased on our projected second-half adjusted EBITDA, cash flow, tax receivable, and normal cash uses for capex and M&A, we expect to end the year with leverage below 2.5 times.\nWe are prepared to answer any questions you may have.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The company has no obligation to provide updates on this information.\nThe Investor Relations section can be found at whitestonereit.com.\nI will now hand the call over to Jim Mastandrea.\nWe continue to wish you, your loved ones, and your enterprises good health as we face these unprecedented circumstances.\nI'm happy to report our robust operational and financial performance that has weathered the economic challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur operations have bounced back swiftly, yielding industry-leading results in the shopping center sector.\nOur Chief Financial Officer, Dave Holeman, will provide a more comprehensive analysis of the factors driving our operational and financial success.\nWe credit our success to owning properties in high-income neighborhoods and rapidly growing metropolitan areas in business-friendly states.\nWe operate a consumer-oriented business model that uses demographic and psychographic data to curate a tenant mix that encourages customer visits and experiences.\nOur customer-centric approach sets Whitestone apart from other real estate owners who focus on traditional retail offerings.\nWe aim to increase our inherent value through redevelopment and expansion, which grows our real estate footprint and rental income, while maintaining a balanced capital structure to boost revenues, net operating income, and funds from operations.\nWith this context, I'd like to elaborate on our current position, our plans for the coming months and quarters to enhance long-term shareholder value, and our progress towards the long-term goals we set in February 2018.\nLet me start by discussing our current situation.\nSince the COVID-19 outbreak, which introduced significant economic uncertainty, particularly in the real estate sector, we've maintained industry-leading rental collection rates throughout the pandemic, recently reporting 90% cash collections for Q3 2020.\nThese outcomes align with our expectations and show improvement from the first half of the year.\nOur rental collection success, robust leasing spreads, and effective business model implementation are deeply ingrained in Whitestone's team culture.\nSince Q1, we've concentrated on improving our dividend payout ratio, increasing our cash reserves, reducing our debt, and strengthening our balance sheet.\nThese measures have positioned us for future growth and provided greater financial flexibility.\nOur prudent and disciplined capital allocation has yielded positive Q3 operating results, including 88.9% occupancy at quarter-end, quarterly revenue approaching $30 million (up 8% from Q2), property net operating income of $21.3 million (up 6% from Q2), strong leasing spreads with an 11% increase for the quarter, cash collections reaching 90% for the quarter (up from 81% in Q2), and solid funds from operations core at $0.23 per share (up $0.01 or 5% from Q2).\nDave will provide more detailed information on these results and year-over-year comparisons in his upcoming remarks.\nOverall, I'm very satisfied with how our management team has navigated the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus, quickly stabilizing our business and allowing us to refocus on unlocking the inherent value in our properties while targeting accretive acquisitions to further scale our platform.\nLooking ahead to the coming months, we plan to maintain our disciplined capital allocation approach, as we have in the past.\nOur growth track record from 2010 to 2019 demonstrates our strategy.\nOur long-term plan involves expanding in our strategically chosen markets of Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio, and Phoenix through redevelopment and development opportunities within our portfolio, as well as external growth through targeted acquisitions in our existing markets and beyond.\nThe key to Whitestone's success is building a portfolio of prime properties in desirable markets, managed by a team of well-trained professionals who continue to apply our proven strategies.\nWhitestone is seen as a unique and distinct company, focusing on tenants resistant to e-commerce and creating an ideal mix to meet local consumer demands.\nOur diverse tenant base offers essential services that are typically unavailable online.\nOur open-air centers provide community-oriented experiences tailored to the surrounding neighborhoods' lifestyles.\nAlthough we operate in retail real estate, our unique approach and unconventional business model have enabled us to grow our assets profitably despite industry challenges.\nSince our 2010 IPO, we've maintained steady and careful growth, which we plan to continue.\nWe're making progress on our 2018 goals of reducing debt leverage and optimizing our G&A costs.\nIn Q3, we reduced our real estate debt by $9.5 million in cash, lowering our net debt by $11 million year-over-year and improving our debt-to-gross book value ratio from 58% to 55%.\nWe're also making strides in optimizing our G&A expenses.\nSince the start of the year, we've reduced headcount by 21%, from 105 to 85 employees, through increased automation, improved processes, and enhanced team efficiency.\nOur total G&A costs for 2020 are about $900,000 or 6% lower than the same period last year.\nOur dedicated team works daily to foster local community connections, and we believe we're well-positioned to overcome current challenges and thrive in the future.\nDespite the severe economic pressures caused by the coronavirus, our portfolio has performed remarkably well.\nAlthough many of our tenant businesses were affected, we only had a few permanent closures, maintaining a strong portfolio occupancy rate of 88.9% at quarter-end, down just 0.3% or 13,000 leased square feet from Q2.\nOur annualized base rent per square foot at quarter-end was $19.43 and $19.38 on a cash and straight-line basis, respectively.\nThis represents a 0.5% increase on a cash basis and a 1.3% decrease on a straight-line basis year-over-year.\nThe straight-line decrease is mainly due to converting 84 tenants to cash basis accounting and writing off accrued straight-line rents.\nOur square foot leasing activity increased 43% from Q2 2020 and 46% from Q3 2019.\nWe're pleased with positive blended leasing spreads on new and renewal leases of 3.3% and 11% on a cash and GAAP basis for the quarter.\nAs mentioned, we collected 90% of our rents for the quarter, including base rent and monthly triple net charges.\nWe've also agreed to rent deferrals on 3% of our Q3 rents.\nIn exchange for these deferrals, we've negotiated beneficial terms such as online payment portal enrollment, increased tenant sales reporting, suspension of co-tenancy requirements, relaxation of exclusivity restrictions allowing further development, and stronger guarantees.\nWhile we're encouraged by our progress, the pandemic continues to impact our financial results.\nQ3 core funds from operations were $10.1 million or $0.23 per share, compared to $10.9 million or $0.26 per share for the same quarter last year, and our same-store net operating income decreased by 4.5%.\nThese declines are primarily due to the pandemic's impact, resulting in a $1.3 million charge to bad debt expense and $100,000 in straight-line receivables write-offs in Q3.\nThis charge was $900,000 or $0.02 per share higher than the bad debt expense and straight-line revenue recorded in the previous year.\nRegarding our collectability analysis related to the pandemic and receivable balances, we had $23.6 million in accrued rents and accounts receivable at quarter-end.\nThis includes $21.1 million in billed receivables, $1.9 million in deferred receivables, $16.1 million in accrued rents and other receivables, and a $15.5 million bad debt reserve.\nSince the year's start, our billed receivable balance has increased by $4.4 million and our deferred receivables by $1.9 million, totaling a $6.3 million increase in billed and deferred receivables.\nWe recorded a $6.3 million increase, offset by a $4.5 million uncollectible reserve in 2020, representing 71%.\nOur accrued rents and other receivables declined by $1.1 million, mainly due to writing off accrued straight-line rent receivables for tenants switched to cash basis accounting, while our bad debt reserve grew by $4.3 million.\nIf a company determines that collecting a tenant's future lease payments is unlikely, accounting principles require changing that tenant's revenue recognition from accrual to cash basis.\nDue to COVID-19's financial impact on many tenants, we reassessed all tenants in Q2 and Q3, resulting in 84 tenants being moved to cash basis accounting.\nThese 84 tenants account for 3.6% of our annualized base rent and 3.4% of our leasable square footage.\nThis shift to cash basis accounting led to a $1.1 million write-off of accrued straight-line rents for the year, though we aim to recover all unpaid rents from tenants where possible.\nTenants on cash basis accounting paid 63% of contractual rents in Q3, an improvement from 41% in Q2.\nAdditional collection details can be found on Page 27 of the supplemental information.\nLet's discuss our balance sheet.\nWe've implemented various cash conservation measures since March, including staff reductions.\nOur cash reserves have grown to approximately $39 million, a 6% increase since March 31st.\nWe paid off $9.5 million of real estate debt in Q3 and have no debt maturities in 2021.\nOur total net real estate debt has decreased by $11 million since Q3

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I trust everyone is doing well and keeping safe.\nAlthough most of our production staff continue to work remotely, we have numerous committed employees at our manufacturing locations and with clients, all following multiple layers of health and safety measures.\nIn fact, we achieved a record-breaking quarter in terms of earnings per share and matched our highest quarterly sales figure.\nWe enhanced our manufacturing productivity and saw more stable order demand following the low point in activity last quarter, which resulted from the sudden implementation of widespread pandemic lockdowns.\nAs expected, and not surprisingly, most flow instrumentation end markets continue to face difficulties.\nRobert will provide you with the quarter's specifics, after which I'll return to discuss the market outlook further and share what we're hearing from customers in the current climate.\nAs shown on slide 4, total sales for the third quarter were $113.6 million, a 5% increase compared to $108.6 million in the same period last year.\nAs mentioned in our previous quarterly report, activity levels began to improve as lockdowns started easing in mid-May and June, and this stabilization in activity persisted throughout the third quarter.\nIn the municipal water sector, overall sales grew by 11%, driven equally by improved order rates and recovery of the backlog accumulated in Q2, which, as we mentioned last quarter, resulted from lockdown-induced manufacturing disruptions that limited our output.\nPositive revenue mix trends continued, with increased adoption of smart metering solutions including ORION Cellular radios and BEACON software-as-a-service revenue, along with greater uptake of ultrasonic meters.\nAs anticipated and previously mentioned, flow instrumentation sales decreased by 18% year-over-year, reflecting the broadly challenging markets and applications served globally.\nOperating profit as a percentage of sales reached 17.2%, a 210 basis point increase from the previous year's 15.1%, with improved gross profit margins and SEA leverage contributing to the strong results.\nThe quarter's gross margin was 39.6%, an increase of 120 basis points year-over-year.\nMargins benefited from higher sales volumes and a favorable sales mix.\nNotably, the overall trends of increased ultrasonic meter adoption and AMI implementations, including higher sales of BEACON software-as-a-service and ORION Cellular radios.\nAlthough copper prices, which serve as a proxy for brass, have been rising.\nOur average price cost in the third quarter was effectively neutral compared to the previous year, due in part to the normal lag between purchasing and production.\nLastly, it's worth noting that the previous year's results included a non-recurring discrete warranty provision associated with products sold exclusively outside North America.\nSEA expenses for the third quarter amounted to $25.5 million, a $300,000 decrease year-over-year, with higher personnel costs mostly offset by reduced travel, trade show, and other ongoing pandemic-impacted expenses.\nThe expense run rate was $2.3 million higher than the second quarter's $23.2 million, reflecting the lifting of temporary cost-cutting measures implemented in the second quarter in response to the sudden onset of the pandemic.\nThe tax rate for income in the third quarter of 2020 was 23.9%, marginally higher than the previous year's rate of 22.1%\nThe third quarter of 2020 saw earnings per share reach $0.51, representing a 16% growth from the previous year's $0.44\nWorking capital as a percentage of sales remained relatively stable at 23%, similar to the preceding two quarters\nWe maintained strong free cash flow at $19.1 million, matching the same quarter last year, despite postponing our federal income tax quarterly payment from the second to the third quarter under the CARES Act\nOur free cash flow for the year to date, totaling $67.8 million, exceeded the previous year's $55.6 million by 22% and is currently converting to net earnings at a rate of 187%\nWe concluded the quarter with roughly $94 million in cash on our balance sheet after using excess funds to pay off the small euro line of credit\nWe maintain full access to our unused $125 million credit facility\nBadger Meter's robust balance sheet and sufficient liquidity continue to be a significant advantage\nRegrettably, many parts of the world, including most US states, are experiencing a new surge in COVID cases\nWhile this situation creates uncertainty, we are hopeful that extensive lockdowns will not be necessary again, but we remain prepared to safely support our customers in the essential water sector regardless\nThe municipal water customer base is extensive and varied\nSome customers may face budgetary difficulties due to various factors\nHowever, our ongoing discussions with a wide range of customers reveal that their activities are essential and often regulated\nSome are implementing temporary cost-cutting measures like hiring freezes and travel restrictions\nNevertheless, spending on critical activities, including metering solutions for billing and managing non-revenue water, largely continues\nOur large and diverse customer base means responses will vary, as each municipal operation has unique needs and priorities\nMunicipal water bid tenders and awards are generally proceeding as planned, with a few experiencing extended timelines or postponements\nThere have been no widespread or significant cancellations, and most daily order activity has returned to near-normal levels\nOur supply chain and logistics partners continue to operate with new safety protocols to meet customer needs without any critical shortages at present\nDespite various challenges and uncertainties, I am very satisfied with our team's performance as demonstrated by our operational and financial results\nThe initial three quarters of 2020 have passed.\nFor the majority of this financial year, we've been operating in a pandemic-affected environment with numerous alterations to business practices and severe economic disruption worldwide.\nIn spite of these challenging circumstances, we have achieved growth in municipal water sales, significant improvement in EBITDA margins, efficient management of working capital and cash flow, and an increase in per-share earnings.\nThis demonstrates the vital nature of the water industry and the outstanding performance of the Badger Meter team.\nLet's now consider the future outlook.\nI'd like to begin by highlighting a few specific points regarding the near-term forecast.\nFirstly, the advantage of converting backlog into sales that we observed in the third quarter.\nOver the year to date, it balances out, having been created in Q2 and recovered in Q3.\nWhen analyzing the municipal water growth rate for the quarter, order activity alone resulted in a solid mid-single-digit increase in sales.\nSecondly, as Bob mentioned, copper prices have generally risen, and with our usual delay, this will impact Q4.\nI remind you that while still significant, the effect of Brass on our cost structure has been decreasing over time as we sell more software and radios rather than primarily meters.\nLastly, you may remember we had an unusually strong fourth quarter of municipal water sales last year, which creates a more challenging comparison for the remainder of 2020.\nLooking at more crucial long-term trends, it's evident that COVID-19 will significantly impact the global water sector, and we believe it will accelerate the adoption of smart water solutions.\nOur clients require comprehensive, integrated solutions that utilize real-time data effectively.\nThese digitally-enhanced solutions, such as our smart meter AMI offering, reduce overall costs and provide safer remote options.\nThese factors are in addition to the ongoing secular trends such as the need to minimize non-revenue water, promote conservation, address the aging utility workforce, and improve communication with end-users.\nWith our strong cash flow and sufficient liquidity, we are actively investing in and developing products and solutions to address these challenges.\nThis includes both organic growth and acquisitions aimed at enhancing our offerings in attractive related markets and applications serving the water industry.\nFor instance, we're adding sensors and instruments for complementary data elements like pressure and temperature, which are used to assess system health.\nWe're also expanding the capabilities of our ion water software application to improve consumer engagement.\nWe will remain attentive to the rapidly evolving implications of the pandemic on both short-term operations and long-term trends, and are ready to effectively manage all aspects within our control.\nSummary: ",

financial metrics\nCore refers to the main financial indicators without considering the recent s::can and ATI acquisitions\nWe consider this benchmark crucial for comparing results from year to year\nI anticipate an unprecedented number of mentions of supply chain issues and inflation during the upcoming monthly earnings reports\nDespite facing numerous challenges, I'd like to highlight the exceptional performance of our Badger Meter teams worldwide in their proactive customer communication, product redesign flexibility, supplier and logistics management, and cross-functional collaboration to maximize deliveries\nThese strategic and operational efforts by our outstanding team enabled us to achieve record sales and profits this quarter while also increasing our already record-breaking backlog\nLet's move to Slide 4\nOur overall sales for the third quarter reached $128.7 million, representing a 13.3% increase from $113.6 million in the same period last year\nSales of utility water products grew by 12.2%\nExcluding about $10 million in sales from the s::can and ATI acquisitions, core utility water revenue increased by 1.7% compared to the previous year\nThis is an impressive outcome considering the challenging year-over-year comparison and current supply chain difficulties\nIn addition to the tough comparison, our production output this quarter continued to be constrained by shortages of certain electronic components and other materials, as well as logistical challenges\nWe saw growth in mechanical meters, cellular radios, and BEACON software as a service subscriptions, and we continue to benefit from strategic value-based pricing initiatives\nOrder intake remained strong in the third quarter of 2021, and we ended the quarter with another record-high backlog\nOur water quality solution sales were also affected by supply chain issues to a lesser extent, but still met our expectations\nThe flow instrumentation product line was not immune to production limitations due to component shortages, but still achieved a robust 18.5% year-over-year increase in sales\nImproved demand across most global end markets and applications, along with an easier comparison, contributed to the year-over-year increase\nWe are very satisfied with our margin performance this quarter, given widespread inflation, challenging comparisons, and the dynamic impact of supply chain issues on manufacturing operations\nOur gross profit increased by $6.2 million, and gross margins improved from 39.6% to 39.8%, a 20 basis point rise as a percentage of sales.\nThe margin enhancement was due to favorable acquisition mix, increased volumes, positive product sales mix (particularly higher SaaS revenues), and successful value-based pricing strategies.\nThese positive factors outweighed the rising cost pressures in purchase components, including higher prices for brass, resin, and other materials, as well as increased freight and logistics expenses.\nOur margin performance demonstrates effective execution and proactive pricing strategies to counter existing cost increases, but the scope and speed of inflationary pressures are escalating, as widely reported.\nWe will continually evaluate pricing in response to these conditions, acknowledging that there will be leading and lagging effects in this changing environment.\nThird quarter SEA expenses were $31.7 million, consistent with the first two quarters in dollar terms, showing improved leverage at 24.7% of sales.\nSEA expenses rose $6.2 million year-over-year due to the inclusion of water quality acquisitions and the normalization of pandemic-affected expenses like travel.\nConsequently, the overall operating profit margin was 15.1%, compared to the previous year's record 17.2%.\nThe third quarter 2021 income tax provision was 18.3%, lower than the previous year's 23.9% and our typical mid-20% range, due to a one-time favorable income tax benefit related to equity compensation transactions.\nIn conclusion, earnings per share in the third quarter of 2021 were $0.54, a 6% increase from the prior year's $0.51.\nWorking capital as a percentage of sales was 25.6%, up 140 basis points from the previous quarter-end.\nThe slight increase in accounts receivable and inventory is a temporary result of the current supply chain situation.\nFor instance, we are strategically maintaining higher levels of certain inventory components and work in progress, taking advantage of spot availability and capacity.\nAdditionally, some customers are understandably delaying payment on partial shipments.\nWe consider these to be temporary consequences of the current economic climate.\nFree cash flow of $13.9 million was lower than the previous year due to increased working capital.\nYear-to-date free cash flow conversion of net earnings stands at 125%.\nLet's move on to Slide 5.\nWe have revised the quarterly sales comparison chart that emphasizes the primary factors influencing inconsistent year-over-year revenue trends.\nThis quarter's growth rate, excluding acquisitions, was driven by robust customer demand, which was tempered by challenges from various supply chain issues and difficult comparisons to last year's core utility water performance.\nAs we approach the fourth quarter and look ahead to 2022, our backlog indicates continued sales growth, with quarterly sales levels largely dependent on the extent of supply chain disruptions.\nWhile this may cause variability in sales patterns, it's crucial to note two points.\nRegarding our performance.\nFirst, we are achieving overall sales growth despite the severely challenged supply environment.\nSecond, our orders and contracts are not being canceled or delayed, but rather shifted to future dates.\nWe are confident about our competitive standing and the fundamental factors supporting our markets.\nTo summarize on Slide 6, we believe our strong order momentum and backlog confirm the underlying market demand for our solutions, which integrate data, communications, and analytics into customizable offerings that enable customers to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability across the water ecosystem.\nThe water quality acquisitions are performing well, and ongoing integration efforts, including customer discussions, affirm the growing need and acceptance of online, low-maintenance, and reagent-free solutions for real-time water quality monitoring.\nThese distributed solutions will revolutionize operations for utilities, wastewater, and industrial customers alike.\nWe remain positive about our future prospects as we continue to implement our growth strategy, but we are also keenly aware of the challenges posed by current supply chain disruptions, global shortages of electronics and other components, widespread inflation acceleration, and potential further impacts from the pandemic.\nAlthough these challenges are not exclusive to Badger Meter or our industry, the ongoing headwinds could affect top-line growth rates and increase margin pressures.\nThe scope of these challenges is broader than what we've faced before, but the approach to addressing them is not unfamiliar.\nLastly, I'd like to mention our collaboration with AT&T on the connected climate initiative they introduced in August.\nWe are among several partners that AT&T highlighted for our efforts to mitigate climate change through water and energy savings associated with our smart water offerings.\nUtilizing infrastructure-free cellular technology in our ORION LTE-M radio enables our AMI solutions to provide more resilient, efficient, and sustainable water solutions.\nSummary: ",

today.\nWe will discuss certain non-GAAP metrics that we believe offer insight into the company's operations.\nThe second quarter showed excellent results, demonstrating ongoing improvement in both our term life and Investment and Savings divisions.\nWe are well-positioned to address the middle market's growing need for financial security, which has been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, by utilizing our business model's core strengths.\nLet's begin with slide three.\nAdjusted operating revenues grew by 25% to $654 million compared to the second quarter of 2020, while diluted adjusted operating income per share increased by 33% to $3.25.\nROAE also improved to 27.8% from 25.6% in the same quarter of the previous year.\nMoving on to slide Four.\nWe welcomed nearly 90,000 new recruits in the quarter.\nYear-over-year comparisons are challenging due to the pandemic's varying impact in each period and the specific recruiting incentives we implemented each quarter.\nDespite these fluctuations, we believe we are employing the right combination of messaging and incentives to sustain recruiting efforts and enhance the appeal of our business proposition.\nOver 10,000 people acquired a new life insurance license during the quarter, which we find encouraging.\nThe licensing process has shown some improvement in recent months.\nTesting opportunities are generally available now, and many states have addressed processing backlogs, though some areas still experience longer-than-usual processing times.\nLicense candidates now have more options for accessing pre-licensing classes, with both in-person and remote alternatives widely available.\nWe continue to observe higher success rates for candidates who choose in-person classes, but there is some reluctance to gather in classrooms.\nAs COVID-related social distancing measures relaxed, we noticed increased distractions among our licensing candidates.\nFollowing an extended lockdown period, some individuals are prioritizing social activities and travel over pursuing their life insurance license.\nSince the year's start, we have focused our message to the field on engaging and licensing new recruits.\nWe offer resources and coaching to guide new recruits through the most effective licensing path.\nWe also provide incentive credits and consistent messaging about the importance of new licenses and sales force growth.\nWe believe our prioritization and support will help overcome recent licensing process obstacles in the coming months.\nWe concluded the quarter with approximately 132,000 life-licensed representatives, including 2,400 individuals with either COVID temporary licenses or licenses with extended renewal dates.\nAs time passes, we expect most of these licenses will phase out.\nExcluding all 2,400 of these licenses from our total sales force provides a more accurate and conservative understanding of our sales force's underlying size and the foundation for future growth.\nThe pandemic presented numerous unique challenges over the past year, but we navigated these obstacles by quickly adapting to a remote work environment and embracing web conferencing tools that will provide lasting benefits to our sales force.\nWe remain committed to growing our sales force and expect to end the year with around 131,000 life-licensed representatives after all COVID-temp licenses and extended renewals expire, compared to a normalized count of 130,700 at the end of 2020.\nMoving to slide five.\nConsumer sentiment regarding the value of life insurance remains strong, as evidenced by our persistency levels.\nSales are also robust.\nHowever, we find that some individuals, both clients and representatives, are also focused on resuming normal everyday activities, which competes with their urgency to obtain insurance coverage.\nNevertheless, we issued nearly 90,000 new life insurance policies during the quarter, slightly below last year's second quarter record levels but outstanding by historical standards.\nProductivity remains above our historical range at 0.23 policies per life-licensed representative per month, and total face amount grew to $887 billion in force at quarter-end.\nLooking ahead, as trends normalize, we project full-year life sales to decline approximately 5% compared to last year's elevated levels.\nMoving to slide six for a review of our Investment and Savings Products segment results.\nSales surpassed $3 billion for the first time in history, with strong demand from both U.S. and Canadian clients across all product lines, including mutual funds, annuities, and managed accounts.\nRobust equity markets continue to boost investor confidence and drive sales.\nQuarterly net inflows of $1.2 billion doubled from the previous year and slightly surpassed the $1.1 billion recorded in Q1 2021.\nConsistent high net inflows result from robust sales and investors maintaining their positions.\nOur redemption rates are believed to be significantly lower than industry averages.\nClient asset values reached $92 billion at quarter's end, showing a 34% year-over-year increase due to strong equity markets and nearly $3.5 billion in net new inflows over the past year.\nWe anticipate third-quarter investment sales to increase by 30% to 40% compared to last year's Q3, barring unexpected market instability that could negatively affect investor confidence.\nOur U.S. mortgage distribution business is progressing steadily as we continue our calculated expansion efforts.\nWe are currently operating in fifteen states with approximately 1,000 licensed representatives.\nWe project the mortgage business to generate around $4 million in pre-tax earnings in the latter half of 2021, totaling $7 million for the full year.\nThe mortgage business positively impacts recruitment, life and ISP sales, and client satisfaction.\nWe have introduced a mortgage referral program in Canada.\nWhile offering similar positive business dynamics, the Canadian referral program doesn't require representative licensing and provides smaller financial benefits for the company.\nOur representatives and clients are responding well to this offering, which enhances the comprehensive client experience.\nWe finalized the acquisition of e-TeleQuote on July 1st and are enthusiastic about incorporating senior health offerings into Primerica's financial solutions for middle-income households.\nBesides e-TeleQuote's existing distribution model, we're launching a pilot referral program that leverages Primerica's strong relationships between our sales force and clients.\nI'm eager to provide updates on our progress in upcoming quarters.\nWe'll begin with our Term Life segment on slide seven.\nThis quarter is the first where COVID impacted both the current and previous year periods.\nSegment performance was exceptional, with operating revenues of $384 million increasing 17% and pre-tax operating income of $117 million rising 23% year-over-year.\nAs Glenn mentioned, term life sales slightly decreased from last year's exceptionally high levels.\nConsumer interest in protection products remains strong, as evidenced by record-high policy retention rates.\nPersistency improved across all durations compared to the prior year period, which was already at historically high levels.\nFor context, the lapse rate in Q2 of last year was 50% lower than 2019 levels, while this quarter's lapses were approximately 25% lower than 2019.\nThe cumulative effect of sustained higher sales and policy retention over the past five quarters led to 16% growth in adjusted direct premiums year-over-year.\nThis added $11 million to pre-tax income compared to 2019 baseline levels.\nThe similar contribution in 2020 was $3 million.\nHigher persistency reduced DAC amortization by $14 million, partially offset by $6 million in increased benefit reserves, resulting in a net $8 million contribution to pre-tax income for the quarter.\nThe net contribution in the prior year period was $4 million.\nCurrent period claims remained high compared to our historical experience.\nWe incurred about $6 million in COVID claims and an additional $3 million in unidentified claims, totaling $9 million in excess claims for the quarter.\nThis compares to $10 million of excess claims in the prior year quarter, all attributed to COVID deaths.\nThe $6 million in COVID claims met our expectations but increased our experience from $10 million to $13 million per 100,000 population deaths.\nThis increase was due to higher COVID-related deaths in Canada, which historically had lower reinsurance coverage and thus a higher average retained face amount.\nIt's not uncommon for us to experience normal claims volatility of around $3 million in a quarter, which we believe is the case here.\nHowever, there has been considerable discussion about the impact of delayed medical care and the behavioral health crisis, which may have affected recent claims activity.\nWe continue to monitor our experience for any emerging trends.\nThe extent of vaccinations and their effectiveness against virus variants are crucial in determining the ongoing level of COVID-related deaths.\nFor the third quarter, we project $6 million in COVID-related claims based on an estimated 57,000 deaths, including 500 in Canada.\nWe anticipate lapses will start to normalize in late 2021.\nCurrently, we haven't observed any changes in that direction, and it remains challenging to forecast the degree to which persistency will permanently improve from pre-COVID levels.\nAny such persistency improvement would positively impact margins, with a higher benefit ratio and lower DAC ratio compared to pre-COVID levels.\nA 10% improvement could potentially increase margins by 80 to 100 basis points from pre-pandemic levels.\nThe insurance expense ratio remained lower than its pre-COVID average at 6.6% during the quarter, compared to 6.8% in the previous year, due to increased fixed cost absorption from higher adjusted direct premiums.\nLet's examine the ISP segment on slide eight.\nOperating revenues grew by 45% to $238 million, while pre-tax income increased by 52% to $71 million.\nThese year-over-year comparisons show continued strong sales, as Glenn mentioned earlier, and significant asset appreciation over the past year.\nThe 67% increase in sales-based revenues was slightly lower than the growth in revenue-generating sales due to an increase in large dollar trades, which have lower commission rates.\nMany large dollar trades are coming from retirement plan rollovers, with increased job turnover and more baby boomers choosing to retire.\nAsset-based revenues rose by 39%, largely in line with the higher average client asset value.\nOur sales and asset-based commission expenses increased proportionally with the associated revenue.\nOther operating expenses grew by 11%, primarily driven by fees based on client asset value.\nCanadian segregated fund DAC amortization for the quarter was at a normal rate but was $1.7 million higher than the previous year due to a significant market correction in the second quarter of 2020.\nNow, let's look at our Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment on slide nine.\nThe adjusted operating loss increased by $5.2 million compared to the previous year, excluding $2.1 million in transaction-related expenses incurred during the quarter due to the e-TeleQuote acquisition.\nThe year-over-year change reflects approximately $3 million in higher employee and technology-related costs, as well as $1.6 million in higher reserves on a block of discontinued business due to the low interest rate environment and improved persistency.\nAllocated net investment income in the segment declined by $2 million, largely due to a higher allocation to the Term Life segment to support growth in that business, along with lower overall yield on the invested asset portfolio.\nOur growing mortgage business contributed a net $1.6 million to pre-tax income during the quarter year-over-year.\nConsolidated insurance and other operating expenses on slide 10 were in line with expectations at $113 million during the second quarter, increasing 13% or $13 million over the previous year.\nThe increase was primarily driven by growth in our businesses.\nWe expect third quarter insurance and other operating expenses in our three existing segments to be approximately $119 million or 12% higher than the prior year period.\nStarting next quarter, our disclosures will expand to include four segments: senior health, which will capture revenues and expenses associated with the distribution of Medicare-related insurance policies by e-TeleQuote, including earnings generated from sales force by Primerica labs.\nWe intend to continue removing transaction-related costs specific to the e-TeleQuote purchase that we consider one-time in nature from our operating results.\nThese costs include fees necessary to close the transaction, other one-time costs that help us integrate e-TeleQuote into our organization, and adjustments to certain items recognized for purchase accounting.\nOther ongoing integration-related costs will be shown as operating expenses in the Senior Health segment.\nMoving to slide 11.\nThe unrealized gain on our invested asset portfolio at the end of June was $123 million, up from $98 million at the end of March as rates declined and credit spreads tightened.\nThe portfolio remains high quality and well diversified across sectors and issuers.\nThe NAIC recently adopted new bond factors for RBC calculation, effective for 2021 year-end reporting.\nModeling our June 30 RBC ratio using these factors, we estimate our ratio will decrease by approximately ten to fifteen basis points.\nWe believe this change is small enough not to require significant alterations to our invested asset portfolio.\nWith the new bond factors, Primerica Life's estimated risk-based capital ratio is about 410% at the end of the second quarter, and we plan to remain above 400% for the rest of the year as we continue to fund business growth and take ordinary dividends to the holding company.\nOn slide 12, holding company liquidity at June 30 was $656 million, reflecting the buildup in anticipation of the e-TeleQuote acquisition and includes the $125 million draw against our revolving credit facility.\nImmediately following the closing on July 1, holding company liquidity was approximately $169 million.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Don Kimble, our chief financial officer, and Mark Midkiff, our chief risk officer, are accompanying me on the call today.\nWe're now moving to Slide 3.\nWe had a robust beginning to the year in the first quarter, implementing our plan and achieving positive operating leverage compared to the same period last year.\nWe saw an increase in clients across our business.\nThe first quarter saw the most significant growth in consumer households in five years.\nFurthermore, we're expanding our commercial client base and strengthening existing relationships.\nWe utilized our business model's strength by raising over $13 billion for our commercial clients, keeping about 19% on our balance sheet.\nThis is precisely how our model is intended to function, capitalizing on favorable markets for our clients' benefit while maintaining credit discipline with what we place on our balance sheet.\nWe also introduced our National Digital Bank, Laurel Road for doctors, at the end of March.\nI'll provide more details on that soon.\nWe also announced the purchase of AQN Strategies, a customer-focused analytics company with extensive experience in the financial services sector.\nThe acquisition aligns with Key's relationship strategy and emphasizes our commitment to a data-driven approach to business growth.\nWe identified 70 branches for consolidation, representing about 7% of our network.\nWe're continuing to embrace digital technology.\nMost of these closures will occur in the second quarter.\nLet's move on to our financial results for the quarter.\nWe reported a net income of $591 million or $0.61 per share for the first quarter.\nThis represents a 9% increase from the fourth-quarter results on a per-share basis and a significant improvement from the same period last year.\nWe achieved record first-quarter revenue, reflecting broad-based growth across our company, driven by our fee-based businesses.\nOur investment banking business reached record first-quarter revenues with growth across the platform.\nWe've invested in our team members and made strategic acquisitions to enhance our capabilities in this area, including sectors like healthcare and technology.\nWe've grown this business in eight of the last nine years, including a record year in 2020, and we expect further growth in 2021.\nWe reached a new milestone in our consumer mortgage business with record loan originations of $3 billion for the quarter.\nIn addition to adding high-quality loans to our balance sheet, consumer mortgage fees increased by 135% compared to the same period last year.\nWe remain optimistic about this business as we continue to grow and gain market share.\nWe reported a record $8.3 billion of originations in 2020, and we anticipate surpassing that level this year.\nOther contributors to fee income this quarter were trust and investment services and cards and payments income.\nCredit quality remains strong.\nNon-performing loans, net charge-offs, and criticized loans all decreased from the previous quarter.\nWe continue to support our clients while maintaining our moderate risk profile, which has and will continue to position the company to perform well throughout the business cycle.\nLastly, we've maintained our strong capital position while continuing to return capital to our shareholders.\nOur common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.8%, which is above our targeted range of nine to nine and a half percent.\nOur strong capital position allows us to execute our capital priorities: organic growth, dividends, and share repurchases.\nThis quarter, we repurchased $135 million of common shares.\nOur board of directors also approved our first-quarter common stock dividend of 18 and a half cents a share.\nNow let's move to Slide 4.\nWe acquired Laurel Road, a born-digital company, in April 2019.\nThe acquisition has surpassed all of our expectations.\nIt has accelerated our digital transformation and has been an excellent complement to our existing healthcare platform.\nSince our acquisition, Laurel Road has generated over $4.6 billion in high-quality loan originations, adding high-value digital relationships with healthcare professionals.\nWe also have the opportunity to continue expanding this business.\nAt the end of March, we took the next step on this journey by launching our Digital Bank, Laurel Road for Doctors, serving the healthcare segment and expanding our consumer franchise nationally.\nImportantly, our approach to our Digital Bank is unique.\nHistorically, many offerings have been product-centric or focused on deposit gathering.\nOur strategy for relationships fully aligns with our approach.\nWe expanded our services for Laurel Road customers, adding deposit options, more lending products, and specialized offerings tailored to healthcare professionals' financial needs.\nThis expansion marks a significant step in our digital evolution, combining key aspects of our strategy: targeted growth, digital capabilities, healthcare focus, and customer primacy.\nCurrently, we're concentrating on doctors and dentists, with plans to include other medical professions soon.\nThis launch is just the beginning of our journey, not the final destination.\nI'd like to reiterate my satisfaction with our quarterly performance and strong start to 2021.\nI'm proud of our team's accomplishments and remain optimistic about our future as we move past the pandemic and the economy recovers.\nKey is in a strong position to grow and fulfill our commitments to all stakeholders.\nLet's move to Slide 6.\nAs Chris mentioned, we've had a robust start to the year, with net income from continuing operations reaching $0.61 per common share, a 9% increase from last quarter and more than quadrupling from the same period last year.\nThis quarter saw a net benefit from our credit loss provisions.\nThe reduction in reserves was primarily due to anticipated improvements in economic conditions.\nNotably, we achieved record first-quarter revenue, driven by strong performance in our fee-based business segments.\nMoving to Slide 7.\nAverage total loans were $101 billion, a 5% increase from the first quarter of last year, with growth in both commercial and consumer lending.\nCommercial loans reflected Key's involvement in PPP, partially offset by decreased utilization.\nPPP loans contributed $7 billion to average balances in the first quarter of 2021.\nConsumer loans benefited from continued growth at Laurel Road and, as Chris noted, record performance in our consumer mortgage business, with $3 billion in consumer mortgage loans this quarter.\nOur investments in these areas continue to yield results and importantly, add high-quality loans and relationships.\nCompared to the previous quarter, average loan balances decreased by 1%, reflecting lower commercial utilization rates and a reduction in average PPP balances.\nWe processed just under $1 billion in PPP loan forgiveness during the current quarter.\nConsumer loans increased by 1% from the previous quarter, again due to continued production from consumer mortgages and Laurel Road.\nMoving on to Slide 8.\nAverage deposits totaled $138 billion for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $28 billion or 25% compared to the same period last year, and up 1.5% from the previous quarter.\nThe quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year comparisons show growth in both commercial and consumer balances, which benefited from government stimulus.\nThis growth was offset by an expected and continued decline in time deposits.\nInterest-bearing deposit costs decreased by another 3 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020, following an 8-basis-point reduction in the previous quarter.\nWe maintain a strong, stable core deposit base, with consumer deposits accounting for over 60% of our total deposit mix.\nLet's look at Slide 9.\nTaxable equivalent net interest income was $1.012 billion for the first quarter of 2021, compared to $989 million a year ago and $1.043 billion for the previous quarter.\nOur net interest margin was 2.61% for the first quarter of 2021, compared to 3.01% for the same period last year and 2.7% from the previous quarter.\nBoth net interest income and net interest margin were significantly impacted by substantial growth in our balance sheet compared to the same period last year.\nThe larger balance sheet benefited net interest income but reduced the net interest margin due to a significant increase in liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows.\nCompared to the previous quarter, net interest income decreased by $31 million and the margin declined by 9 basis points.\nThe decrease in net interest income was attributed to the day count (approximately $14 million), lower loan fees ($8 million), and lower loan balances resulting in an additional $8 million reduction in NII.\nThe net interest margin also reflected a 4-basis-point reduction due to increases in our liquidity position.\nMoving to Slide 10.\nWe've continued to see growth in our fee-based businesses.\nNon-interest income was $738 million for the first quarter of 2021, compared to $477 million for the same period last year and $802 million in the fourth quarter.\nCompared to the same period last year, non-interest income increased by 55%.\nWe had a record first quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees, reaching $162 million, driven by broad-based strength across the platform.\nThis quarter, both debt and equity markets were particularly strong.\nRecord mortgage originations drove consumer mortgage fees this quarter, which increased by $27 million or 135% from the first quarter of 2020.\nCards and payments income also rose by $39 million, related to higher prepaid card activity from state government support programs and growth in the core platform.\nIn the previous year's corresponding period, other income included $92 million in market-related valuation adjustments.\nNon-interest income dropped by $64 million when compared to the fourth quarter.\nThe primary cause of the quarterly decline was seasonality in our investment banking sector, following an unprecedented record-breaking quarter.\nThis decline was partly counterbalanced by robust performance in trust and investment services income, as well as cards and payments income.\nLet's move on to Slide 11.\nThe total non-interest expense for the quarter amounted to $1.071 billion, in contrast to $931 million last year and $1.1 billion in the preceding quarter.\nThe increase from the previous year is mainly due to personnel expenses related to higher production-based incentive compensation, which rose by $58 million, and a $36 million increase resulting from the rise in our stock price compared to last year.\nEmployee benefit expenses also saw a $15 million increase.\nYear-over-year, payments-related costs reported in other expenses were $32 million higher, primarily due to increased prepaid activity.\nThis quarter's computer processing expense was elevated due to software investments across the platform, accounting changes, and timing differences.\nNon-interest expense decreased by $57 million compared to the previous quarter.\nThe reduction was primarily due to lower production-related incentives and severance costs.\nLet's now examine Slide 12.\nCredit quality continues to exceed expectations overall.\nNet charge-offs for the first quarter were $114 million, or 46 basis points of average loans.\nWe recorded a net benefit of $93 million for our provision for credit losses.\nThis was determined based on our consistently strong credit metrics, our economic outlook, and loan production.\nNon-performing loans this quarter totaled $728 million, or 72 basis points of period-end loans, decreasing by nearly $60 million from the previous quarter.\nFurthermore, criticized loans decreased, and 30- to 90-day delinquencies also improved quarter-over-quarter with a 5-basis-point reduction, while the 90-day plus category remained relatively stable.\nLet's proceed to Slide 13.\nKey's capital position remains robust.\nWe concluded the first quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.8%, placing us above our target range of nine to nine and a half percent.\nThis provides us with ample capacity to continue supporting our customers' borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders.\nNotably, we continue to return capital to our shareholders in line with our capital priorities.\nOur board of directors approved a first-quarter dividend of $0.185 per common share.\nWe also bought back $135 million of common shares under the share repurchase authorization we announced in January, which allows for up to $900 million.\nThis leaves us with a capacity of up to $765 million for the next two quarters.\nOn Slide 14, we present our full-year 2021 outlook, which has been adjusted to reflect our strong start to the year, positive business momentum, and a more favorable revenue outlook.\nIn line with our previous guidance, we anticipate delivering positive operating leverage for the year.\nAverage loans are expected to remain relatively stable, reflecting continued momentum in our consumer areas, the impact of PPP, and stronger commercial growth in the second half of the year.\nThe first quarter should be the low point of the year, with expected growth from here.\nWe anticipate deposits to increase by mid-single digits and that we will continue to benefit from our low-cost deposit base.\nNet interest income is projected to rise by low single digits.\nOur net interest income will benefit from higher loan fees related to PPP forgiveness and continued deployment of some excess liquidity, offset by the ongoing impact of low rates.\nNon-interest income is expected to increase by mid-single digits, reflecting growth in most of our core fee-based businesses.\nNon-interest expense should remain relatively stable, reflecting higher production-based incentives related to our improved revenue outlook.\nOur continuous improvement efforts and branch consolidation plans remain on track and will support our ongoing investments in talent and maintaining our position at the forefront of digital offerings.\nRegarding credit quality, we have reduced our net charge-off guidance, which is now expected to be in the 35 to 45-basis-point range for the year.\nThis reflects the quality of our portfolio and our current outlook.\nOur guidance for our GAAP tax rate remains unchanged at approximately 19% for the year.\nLastly, shown at the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets, which remain unchanged.\nWe expect to continue making progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile and improving our productivity and efficiency, which will drive returns.\nOverall, we had a good start to the year, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Aaron Hunt here, I lead Investor Relations.\nWe're encouraged by the signs of recovery in global air traffic.\nThe recovery of air travel in the U.S. has been robust and quicker than anticipated by some.\nOver the past two months, TSA passenger screenings have surpassed two million on several occasions, with some days in July even exceeding 2019 levels.\nA recent report from the International Air Transport Association shows improvement in domestic passenger markets, though demand is still 22% lower than June 2019.\nThe situation remains fluid.\nWe're keeping a close eye on recent reports of increasing COVID-19 cases and their potential impact on air traffic recovery.\nNevertheless, the upward trend in domestic air traffic over recent months is a positive sign for our industry.\nWe're glad to see the resurgence in demand for the MAX and the announcement of substantial orders from United, Southwest, Alaska Air, and Ryanair.\nRyanair received its first 737 MAX 8200 and provided positive feedback.\nWith 85% of Spirit's backlog tied to narrow-body aircraft, we believe we're in a good position to benefit from the recovery in domestic air traffic and narrow-body demand.\nIn the first six months of this year, we delivered 64 737 shipsets, up 73% from 37 in the same period last year.\nWe're on track to deliver about 160 shipsets this year, a 125% increase from the 71 delivered in 2020.\nAs previously mentioned, our 737 production rate lags behind Boeing's to reduce the inventory of stored shipsets in Wichita and Tulsa.\nThis quarter, we delivered 35 units but shipped 42 to Boeing.\nWe currently have about 125 units in storage, all owned by Boeing.\nWe expect stored units to decrease to around 100 shipsets by year-end.\nOur plan is to reach 20 stored units by the end of next year, which will serve as a permanent buffer for the production system.\nRegarding the 787 program.\nThrough our ongoing discussions with Boeing, we identified another fit and finish issue in the forward fuselage section.\nThis issue relates to a part we receive from a Tier two supplier, and we're working with Boeing and the supplier to resolve it.\nWe're continuing to coordinate with Boeing to ensure we complete all necessary rework.\nPrimarily due to this issue, we've recognized a $46 million forward loss on the 787 program.\nDespite this forward loss, we're maintaining our free cash flow target of negative $200 million to $300 million, as stated in our previous earnings call.\nThis amount is net of the $300 million cash tax benefit we expect to receive in the second half of this year.\nI'd like to highlight that we released our first sustainability report in June, outlining Spirit's environmental, social, and governance strategy.\nThe report also includes some of our notable achievements from 2020.\nFor instance, by the end of this year, we aim to power our Wichita facility entirely with wind energy.\nOur Chief Operating Officer, Sam Marnick, will now provide updates on our acquisition integrations.\nThe integration processes for our recent acquisitions are moving forward well.\nWe recently acquired Applied Aerodynamics' assets and have already completed about 60% of the 323 identified integration tasks.\nThe integration of our other acquisition from Bombardier is also progressing smoothly.\nWe've completed roughly 90% of the tasks needed to integrate the Belfast, Morocco, and Dallas sites.\nThe remaining tasks are mainly related to the information technology transition services agreement, which we expect to finish before year-end.\nThe expected synergies from the deal are in line with our plans.\nWe've seen good progress in A220 wing costs, supply chain improvements, and infrastructure optimization.\nAirbus maintains confidence in this aircraft, and we anticipate production rates will continue to improve over time.\nRegarding the Belfast pension plan.\nWe've concluded our formal consultation with employees and unions.\nSubject to completing the process, we'll close the plan to future benefit accrual and introduce a defined contribution benefit plan before year-end.\nThe purchase of Bombardier's assets considerably expanded our work in the business jet sector.\nWe also won the contract for the engine nacelle on the latest Falcon 10X.\nThis expansion has positioned Spirit as a major supplier of business jet structures, a sector that's quickly recovering post-pandemic.\nThe inventory of business aircraft has decreased by about 40% compared to last year, indicating strong demand.\nMoreover, business jet flights in the U.S. are approximately 6% higher than pre-pandemic levels, further suggesting a resurgence in this market segment.\nWe anticipate our capabilities and programs will enable us to generate $500 million in revenue with improved margins by 2023.\nWe're closely monitoring the urban air mobility sector, also known as electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft or eVTOL.\nWe believe our expertise in designing and manufacturing composite aircraft structures offers unique advantages in this emerging transportation mode.\nWe've been investigating opportunities with several companies in this exciting new field and have signed agreements that are already producing income.\nThese two purchases have assisted in expanding our aftermarket and business jet operations.\nWe're also ramping up our efforts to diversify our revenue in the defense sector, which we anticipate will grow by about 20% in 2021.\nI trust everyone is doing well.\nWe continue to view 2021 as a transitional year for Spirit and the commercial aviation industry.\nDomestic air travel in the U.S. and many other parts of the world is beginning to recover, which is promising, particularly for narrow-body aircraft production rates.\nWe're cautiously watching the COVID variant and its effect on this recovery, especially regarding international travel.\nWe anticipate international air travel will recover more slowly, and consequently, wide-body programs will remain challenging for the next few years.\nAs we progress through the latter half of the year, we're starting to observe the advantages of increased narrow-body production rates.\nLet's now examine our results for the second quarter of 2021.\nThe quarter's revenue was $1 billion, a 55% increase from the same period last year and roughly 11% higher than the first quarter of 2021.\nThe revenue growth was mainly due to production on the 737 and A320 programs, as well as increased revenue from the recently acquired A220 wing and Bombardier business jet programs.\nThese increases were somewhat offset by lower wide-body production rates due to the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on international air travel.\nTotal deliveries rose to 243 shipsets compared to 159 shipsets in the same quarter of 2020.\nSecond quarter 737 deliveries increased to 35 compared to 19 shipsets delivered in the second quarter of the previous year.\nWe still anticipate delivering around 160 shipsets this year.\nFurthermore, second quarter A320 deliveries increased to 96 compared to 69 shipsets delivered in the same period last year.\nLet's now look at earnings per share on slide four.\nWe reported earnings per share of negative $1.30 compared to negative $2.46 per share in the same period of 2020.\nAdjusted earnings per share was negative $0.31 compared to earnings per share of $2.28 in the second quarter of 2020.\nAdjusted earnings per share excludes acquisition costs, restructuring costs, noncash voluntary retirement plan charges and deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nExamining the operating margin, we saw improvement in the second quarter to negative 10% compared to negative 57% in the second quarter of 2020.\nThe cost-cutting measures we've implemented over the past year, along with increasing production rates, have contributed to the improved results with lower costs and expenses, including excess capacity, restructuring and abnormal COVID-19 costs.\nWe also recognized lower forward loss charges compared to the same period last year.\nIn the second quarter, we recognized forward loss charges of $52 million, primarily driven by engineering analysis and rework on the 787 program compared to forward loss charges of $194 million in the same period of 2020.\nAdditionally, the increase in other income is mainly related to the Belfast pension plan and the absence of voluntary retirement expenses recognized in the second quarter of 2020.\nI should mention that there was a revaluation of deferred tax assets during the second quarter of 2021 due to a future increase in the United Kingdom's corporate tax rate.\nThis resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately $55 million.\nThis benefit is included in both GAAP and adjusted EPS.\nThe revaluation of deferred tax assets, along with adjustments related to tax law changes and other state tax impacts, resulted in additional adjustments to the valuation allowance.\nAs a reminder, the valuation allowance is a noncash item.\nEarlier this week, Spirit received the latest 787 program demand from Boeing.\nOur initial evaluation indicates we anticipate an additional forward loss of roughly $40 million to $60 million in Q3 2021 due to decreased production volumes and the related fixed overhead absorption applied to fewer deliveries.\nThis event is considered subsequent and not reflected in our Q2 financial reports due to its timing.\nLet's now examine free cash flow on the fifth slide.\nThe quarter's free cash flow was negative $53 million, an improvement from negative $249 million in the same period last year.\nThis year-on-year improvement is mainly attributed to cost-cutting measures, increased production volume, and effective working capital management.\nThe Q2 cash from operations also shows a $142 million improvement compared to Q1 2021.\nExcluding approximately $80 million in cash interest payments made during Q2, cash from operations was positive at $51 million.\nWe anticipate improvement in the second half of this year as single-aisle production rates continue to rise.\nDespite the additional challenge with the 787 program, we still expect the year's free cash flow to be between negative $200 million and $300 million.\nNow let's examine our cash and debt balances on slide six.\nWe concluded Q2 with $1.3 billion in cash and $3.6 billion in debt.\nWe paid off $300 million in floating rate notes early in February and are on track to repay $1 billion in debt over the next three years.\nThe repayment schedule will align with air traffic recovery and narrow-body production rate improvements.\nThe pace of global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic may cause fluctuations in our cash flows from period to period.\nLet's now review our segment performance on slide seven.\nIn Q2, fuselage segment revenues were $492 million, a 51% increase compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to higher production volumes for the 737 and Bombardier business jet programs, partially offset by lower production volumes for the 787 program.\nThe quarter's operating margin was negative 7%, an improvement from negative 77% in the same period last year, mainly due to increased 737 production volumes and the resulting decrease in excess capacity costs, as well as fewer net forward losses and the absence of loss on disposal charges.\nThe fuselage segment recorded $4 million in favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments and $36 million in net forward losses during the quarter, primarily related to the 787 program.\nQ2 propulsion revenue improved to $242 million, a 43% increase compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to higher revenue from the 737 program and aftermarket sales, partially offset by decreased volume on the 777 program.\nDespite the challenging environment, the quarter's operating margin was positive 12%, compared to negative 10% in Q2 2020.\nIncreased 737 production and the resulting decrease in excess capacity costs, as well as fewer forward loss charges, were the main factors contributing to the improvement in segment profitability.\nThe segment recorded $6 million in favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments and $9 million in forward losses.\nHigher production volumes on the 737, A220, and A320 programs were the main contributors to the increase in wing revenue to $259 million.\nThe quarter's operating margin was negative 6%, compared to negative 35% in Q2 2020.\nThe improvements in segment profitability and operating margin were primarily due to increased A320 production volume and fewer forward losses compared to the same period in 2020.\nThe segment recorded $8 million in net forward losses.\nTo conclude, we are encouraged by the recovery in domestic air traffic demand.\nWe expect improved performance in the second half of the year as narrow-body production rates continue to increase.\nRising narrow-body rates should also create positive momentum going into 2022.\nAdditionally, we are pleased with the progress made in our aftermarket business jet and defense diversification efforts.\nIntegrating our acquisitions and expanding our diversification continue to drive long-term growth potential.\nCash flows remain a top priority for our team, and we are actively working on implementing our cost and working capital initiatives.\nWe are also monitoring the remaining regulatory approvals needed for the 737 MAX to return to service.\nFurthermore, we are encouraged by the domestic aerospace recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe continue to observe improvement in domestic air traffic, which has led to increased production rates for our narrow-body aircraft compared to 2020.\nFor the year, we expect to deliver 160 737 shipsets, up from just 71 in 2020.\nThis quarter, we also continued working with Boeing to address fit and finish issues on the 787 program, and we will continue to coordinate with them to complete all necessary rework.\nThe recovery in narrow-body production is supporting better overall performance.\nWe are also encouraged by the continued growth in our aftermarket, business jet, and defense programs.\nWe are maintaining our 2021 free cash flow guidance of negative $200 million to $300 million.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Today, we will examine the financial outcomes for the second quarter of 2021 and offer insights into significant business trends for Bio-Rad.\nJoining me on this call are several key executives from our company, including our CEO, CFO, COO, and the presidents of our Life Science and Clinical Diagnostics divisions.\nOur actual outcomes may significantly differ from these projections and expectations, and we cannot predict the full impact or duration of the COVID-19 crisis.\nIn our discussion today, we will refer to non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share, which are financial metrics not defined by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\nI'd like to spend a few moments discussing our current operational status worldwide.\nBio-Rad has successfully adapted to the work restrictions imposed by COVID, enabling us to effectively respond to daily operational changes and demands.\nWe are making steady progress on our core strategies, customer support, and ensuring employee safety.\nAs our end markets recover from last year's significant downturn, we are effectively meeting increased demand.\nLike other life sciences manufacturers, we are working hard to source raw materials in challenging areas such as plastics and electronic components, while also managing increased raw material costs.\nWe continue to face higher than usual logistics costs, as mentioned in our first quarter call.\nDue to the emergence of the COVID-19 delta variant, we are maintaining our work-from-home policies for now while developing return-to-workplace plans for later this quarter, and we are closely monitoring the evolving global pandemic situation.\nEnsuring employee safety remains a top priority, and we are satisfied with our safety record and the increasing vaccination rates within our organization.\nAs we begin the third quarter, we anticipate that the delta variant will continue to pose challenges, and we are maintaining vigilance and flexibility in response.\nOverall, we expect our end markets to continue improving throughout the second half of the year as our customers adapt, though the new delta variant introduces some uncertainty moving forward.\nI will now review the second quarter results.\nSecond quarter 2021 net sales were $715.9 million, representing a 33.4% increase compared to $536.9 million in the same quarter of 2020.\nSales increased by 27.5% when adjusted for currency fluctuations.\nWe experienced currency-neutral growth across all three geographic regions.\nOur core product sales in the second quarter of last year were negatively impacted by the pandemic.\nWe are observing a gradual increase in capacity at both academic and diagnostic labs, which we estimate to be between 90% and 95% of pre-COVID levels.\nWe estimate that COVID-19-related sales amounted to approximately $68 million this quarter.\nThe Life Science group's sales for the second quarter of 2021 were $334.2 million, compared to $252.1 million in the same quarter of 2020, representing a 32.6% increase on a reported basis and a 27.1% increase when adjusted for currency fluctuations.\nThe year-over-year sales growth in the second quarter was primarily driven by increased sales of western blotting, Droplet Digital PCR, and qPCR products.\nWe have observed strong growth in the biopharma market for our Droplet Digital PCR platform.\nWe are also seeing healthy adoption of ddPCR in wastewater testing solutions.\nGovernment funding for public health labs is driving increased demand for our ddPCR products, which offer automated solutions with high accuracy and sensitivity.\nProcess Media sales, which can vary quarterly, experienced double-digit growth compared to the same quarter last year.\nExcluding Process Media sales, the core Life Science business grew by 29.1% on a currency-neutral basis compared to the second quarter of 2020.\nThe Life Science segment experienced currency-neutral year-over-year sales growth across all geographic regions.\nBefore moving on, I'd like to highlight the comprehensive legal settlement with 10x Genomics announced earlier this week.\nThis settlement resolves the multi-year global litigation with 10x regarding outstanding issues in the single-cell field and includes a global cross-license agreement.\nBesides receiving past and future royalties, Bio-Rad gained extensive operational freedom in the single-cell market and kept exclusive rights to our microwell single-cell intellectual property\nThe projected future royalty payments from this legal resolution could reach between $110 million and $140 million throughout the agreement's duration, which extends to 2030\nThis sum incorporates $32 million paid in the third quarter for overdue royalties owed to Bio-Rad from November 2018 to December 2020, along with settlement fees and interest\nThe Clinical Diagnostics division's sales in the second quarter reached $380.2 million, up from $283.2 million in Q2 2020, representing a 34.3% increase as reported and a 28% rise when adjusted for currency fluctuations\nIn the second quarter, all product lines within the diagnostics division experienced growth exceeding 10%\nThe growth compared to the previous year was primarily due to a resurgence in routine testing\nThe recovery of elective surgeries is ongoing but at a slower rate\nWhen adjusted for currency changes, the diagnostics division's sales increased across all geographic regions compared to the same period last year\nLast month, our diagnostics division announced a collaboration with Seegene, a global leader in multiplex molecular diagnostics\nBio-Rad will be the exclusive marketer of Seegene's tests in the United States, pending regulatory approval\nSeegene's diagnostic products offer high sensitivity and specificity, and are designed to work optimally with Bio-Rad's CFX Real-Time PCR Systems\nThe reported gross margin for 2021's second quarter was 56.1% on a GAAP basis, compared to 54.6% in Q2 2020\nIt's worth noting that the Q2 2020 gross margin included an $8 million customs duty charge\nExcluding that charge, this quarter's gross margin showed further improvement due to our productivity and efficiency initiatives\nHowever, we are currently experiencing increased pressure on raw material costs and higher logistics expenses\nThe amortization related to previous acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.6 million, compared to $5 million in Q2 2020\nSG&A expenses for Q2 2021 were $213.4 million or 29.8% of sales, compared to $189.3 million or 35.3% in Q2 2020\nThe rise in SG&A expenses was primarily due to employee-related performance compensation costs\nThe total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.4 million, versus $2.3 million in Q2 2020\nResearch and development expenses in Q2 were $63.4 million or 8.9% of sales, compared to $52 million or 9.7% of sales in Q2 2020\nQ2 operating income was $124.8 million or 17.4% of sales, compared to $51.7 million or 9.6% of sales in Q2 2020\nExamining below the operating line, the change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $1.031 billion of income to the reported results, largely related to the holdings of Sartorius AG shares\nAdditionally, during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in net other income of $1.3 million, mainly due to foreign exchange, compared to $10.7 million of income last year\nQ2 2020 included an $8.9 million dividend from Sartorius, which was declared in June and paid in July\nIn 2021, the Sartorius dividend was declared in the first quarter\nThe effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 21%, compared to 22.4% for the same period in 2020\nThe tax rates for both periods were influenced by the substantial unrealized gain in equity securities\nMoreover, the second quarter of 2021 effective tax rate was lower due to the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax reserves\nReported net income for the second quarter was $914.1 million, with diluted earnings per share of $30.32\nThis represents a decrease from the previous year and is related to changes in the valuation of Sartorius holdings\nTurning our attention to the non-GAAP results\nWhen examining the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain unusual and unique items that affected both the gross and operating margins, as well as other income\nExamining the non-GAAP outcomes for the second quarter\nWe've omitted $4.6 million in amortization of acquired intangibles and $1.2 million in restructuring-related costs from the cost of goods sold\nThese exclusions resulted in a non-GAAP gross margin of 56.9% for the second quarter of 2021, compared to 55.5% in Q2 of 2020\nNon-GAAP SG&A expenses in the second quarter of 2021 were 29.2%, down from 33.9% in Q2 of 2020\nIn our non-GAAP SG&A calculations, we've excluded $2.4 million in amortization of acquired intangibles, $8.8 million in legal expenses, and $7 million in restructuring and acquisition-related gains\nNon-GAAP R&D expenses in the second quarter of 2021 were 9.1%, compared to 9.8% in Q2 of 2020\nWe've excluded $2.1 million in restructuring benefits from our non-GAAP R&D calculations\nThese non-GAAP adjustments collectively increase the quarterly operating margin from 17.4% on a GAAP basis to 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis\nThis non-GAAP operating margin is an improvement from the 11.8% non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 of 2020\nWe've also excluded certain items below the operating line, including a $1.031 billion increase in Sartorius equity holdings value and a $1.8 million loss from venture investments\nThe non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 21.5%, down from 23.8% in the same period of 2020\nThe lower 2021 rate was due to the geographical distribution of earnings\nNon-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2021 reached $106.6 million, or $3.54 diluted earnings per share, up from $48.3 million or $1.61 per share in Q2 of 2020\nTurning to the balance sheet\nTotal cash and short-term investments at the end of Q2 were $1.167 billion, an increase from $1.025 billion at the end of Q1 2021\nWe did not repurchase any shares during the second quarter\nNet cash generated from operating activities in the second quarter of 2021 was $154.6 million, compared to $92.1 million in Q2 of 2020\nThis increase primarily reflects higher operating profits\nThe adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2021 was 22.3% of sales\nIn Q2 of 2020, the adjusted EBITDA was 18.6%, or 16.9% excluding the Sartorius dividend\nNet capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2021 were $23.4 million, with depreciation and amortization at $33.7 million\nMoving on to the guidance\nAndy previously mentioned ongoing uncertainties related to the pandemic, which could pose challenges as we look towards the latter half of this year\nNevertheless, assuming customers continue to adapt to the current environment, we anticipate a gradual return to pre-pandemic activity and a more normalized business mix in the second half of 2021\nWe now project non-GAAP currency-neutral revenue growth to be between 10% and 10.5% for 2021, up from our previous guidance of 5.5% to 6%\nThis updated outlook assumes full-year COVID-related sales to be between $200 million and $210 million, with approximately $40 million to $50 million projected for the second half of 2021\nExcluding COVID-related sales, the non-GAAP year-over-year currency-neutral sales growth in the second half is expected to be between 13% and 14%\nThis

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These assertions should not be overly relied upon as they do not guarantee future results.\nOur conversation today may include mentions of certain non-standard financial metrics.\nOur chief financial officer, Harp Rana, is here with me today.\nThe team performed exceptionally well and achieved impressive outcomes in Q4.\nWe achieved $14.3 million in net income or $1.28 per diluted share due to sustained quality growth in our loan portfolio, robust credit profile, careful expense control, and low borrowing costs.\nWe capitalized on our new growth strategies to benefit from increased consumer demand during the quarter.\nIn Q4, we issued $359 million in loans, which was similar to the previous year and increased by nearly $51 million or 16% from Q3.\nThis resulted in a sequential increase of $77 million or 7% in our total portfolio.\nOur primary small and large loan portfolio expanded by $80 million or 8% compared to the previous quarter.\nYear-over-year, our core loan portfolio grew by $19 million or 2%, an impressive achievement considering the challenges of 2020.\nThe fourth quarter saw stable credit quality, and we maintained a robust balance sheet.\nOur net credit loss rate for the quarter was 6.9%, an improvement of 210 basis points from the previous year, and we concluded the quarter with a 30-plus day delinquency rate of 5.3%, down from 7% last year.\nAs of December 31, our $150 million allowance for credit losses compares favorably to our 30-plus day contractual delinquency of $60.5 million and includes a $30.4 million reserve for potential COVID-19 related credit losses.\nThis reserve is based on an assumed unemployment rate of 9% by the end of 2021.\nWe remain confident that we have sufficient coverage to handle future credit losses.\nFurthermore, with $452 million of unused credit facility capacity and $203 million of available liquidity as of February 5, we have ample capital to invest in our business and fund our ambitious growth plans.\nToday, we also modified our ABL facility to provide an additional $20 million of flexibility for future capital returns to shareholders, either through dividends or share buybacks.\nAdditionally, we recently priced our latest securitization transaction, set to close on February 18.\nThe approximately $250 million securitization attracted substantial investor interest and was priced at a record-low average-weighted coupon of 2.08%, nearly 80 basis points better than our previous securitization.\nThe securitization proceeds will be used to pay off our RMIT 2018-2 securitization, significantly reducing our capital costs and further strengthening our balance sheet.\nBefore discussing our outlook for 2021 and beyond, I'd like to reflect on our achievements over the past year.\nThroughout the pandemic, we remained committed to serving our customers, supporting our team members, assisting our communities, and creating value for our shareholders.\nWe provided our customers with effective means to access our valuable loan products.\nWe introduced curbside service for payments, loan closings, and other servicing activities, and quickly developed and implemented electronic remote loan closing capabilities, allowing customers to extend and expand their relationship with us from home.\nIn December, 20% of our branch originations were completed through the remote loan closing process.\nWe offered borrower assistance programs as a necessary support for those most affected by the pandemic.\nCombined with government stimulus, we experienced historically low delinquencies for most of the year.\nCrucially, we ensured customer safety while maintaining top-tier service.\nFor our employees, we expanded our paid time off policy to provide flexibility in addressing personal obligations and to assist those unable to work remotely.\nWe implemented enhanced safety measures in all branches, covered virtual health visit costs for team members, and offered paid leave for those exposed to the virus.\nAt year-end, we announced significantly improved benefit programs.\nFor our communities, we launched Retail Reach, an employee-led initiative focused on creating positive social change and goodwill through community service, charitable giving, and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.\nIn spring, we partnered with the American Heart Association and led all upstate South Carolina companies in Heart Walk fundraising.\nRecently, we collaborated with local food banks across our footprint, raising tens of thousands of dollars and collecting substantial amounts of food for distribution in local communities.\nFor our shareholders, we expanded our loan portfolio, maintained a stable credit profile, effectively managed operating expenses, and reduced funding costs, resulting in excellent bottom-line results.\nWe strengthened our balance sheet and maintained access to significant borrowing capacity and liquidity.\nWe made substantial progress on our digital investments and initiatives, including migrating our technology infrastructure to the cloud by year-end.\nThe resilience of our omnichannel operating model was clearly demonstrated in 2020.\nAs we move past a challenging year for everyone, I'm extremely proud of our team's success in navigating the crisis.\nWe enter 2021 in a position of considerable strength and ready to begin our next chapter.\nLooking forward, we're enthusiastic about the opportunities for sustainable growth.\nWe remain focused on increasing our market share, maintaining our loan portfolio's credit quality, and enhancing our competitive advantages.\nOver the next 18 months, we will attract new customers through innovation and geographic expansion.\nWe will continue to prioritize investment in digital capabilities to support our growth and ensure we're always accessible to our customers.\nIn the first half of 2021, we plan to introduce an improved digital prequalification experience for our customers, including expanded integration with existing and new digital affiliates and lead generators.\nWe are progressing with our trial of a new program offering guaranteed loans.\nThis program will serve as an alternative to our current convenience check loan product and may be completed online with direct deposit funding to a customer's bank account.\nIn late 2021 and early 2022, we plan to evaluate a digital origination product and platform for both new and existing customers.\nConcurrently, we will finalize the development of our mobile application and upgrades to our customer portal, providing our clients with convenient access to payment features and additional functionalities.\nAlongside our digital investments, we aim to expand our operations into four or five additional states within the next year and a half.\nThis expansion will make our valuable product lineup, including an improved auto-secured offering, accessible to millions of potential new customers.\nWe intend to launch between 15 and 20 new branches in 2021.\nWe anticipate that this branch expansion strategy, coupled with our digital initiatives, will allow our branches to cover a broader geographic area and achieve higher average receivables per location.\nThis strategy is expected to ultimately increase our revenue and operational efficiencies, leading to stronger profit growth.\nOur accelerated state expansion will commence with Illinois in the second quarter.\nDespite Illinois recently implementing legislation to limit the all-in APR to 36%, we believe it presents an excellent opportunity to enter a new market with our digitally-enabled business model and capitalize on the competitive disruptions resulting from the recent legislation.\nAs of the end of 2020, 80% of our loan portfolio had an APR of 36% or lower.\nWhile we have substantial plans for growth investment in 2021 and beyond, we will not compromise the credit quality of our portfolio, which remains our top priority.\nBy the end of the year, 61% of our total portfolio had been underwritten using the enhanced credit criteria we implemented during the pandemic.\nOur credit performance and underwriting capabilities give us confidence in pursuing our long-term growth strategies.\nWe will continue to enhance our underwriting capabilities over time, including the use of advanced machine learning tools to ensure sustainable growth.\nAs previously mentioned, any additional stimulus, such as the recent $600 payments, will delay COVID-related losses until the second half of 2021.\nFurther stimulus will continue to positively impact credit but will reduce loan demand in the early part of this year.\nSimilar to our experience in 2020, we anticipate a strong rebound in loan demand during the second half of the year as vaccinations become more widespread and the economy begins to reopen more fully.\nIn conclusion, we had an outstanding end to a year that was challenging for everyone.\nWe performed well across all aspects of our business and have positioned ourselves for improved results in both revenue and profit for 2021.\nOur team continues to excel in ensuring our customers receive the best possible experience.\nWe are enthusiastic about and confident in the sustainability of our omnichannel operating model, the resilience of our customers, and our team's ability to execute our growth plans.\nAllow me to provide more detailed information about our fourth-quarter performance.\nWe achieved net income of $14.3 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.28, resulting from quality growth in our portfolio, strong credit performance, disciplined expense management, and low funding costs.\nPage 4 illustrates our robust portfolio growth in the latter half of 2020, driven by increased loan demand and our new growth initiatives.\nWe experienced growth of $114 million from June to December 2020, with $77 million of this growth occurring in the fourth quarter.\nAdditionally, we increased our core finance receivables by $120 million from June to December 2020, with $80 million of this growth in the fourth quarter.\nPage 5 shows our portfolio growth and mix trends through the end of 2020.\nWe ended the quarter with net finance receivables of $1.1 billion, representing a $77 million or 7% increase sequentially and a $3 million increase year over year.\nOur new growth initiatives contributed $36 million of the $77 million sequential growth.\nOur core loan portfolio grew by $80 million or 8% sequentially and $19 million year over year.\nWe continued to shift our mix towards large loans, which now represent 63% of our portfolio as of the fourth quarter of 2020.\nTurning to Page 6, as Rob mentioned earlier, originations continued to recover in the fourth quarter.\nBranch originations increased from $233 million in the third quarter of 2020 to $272 million in the fourth quarter, a 17% improvement.\nConcurrently, direct mail and digital originations rose from $75 million in the third quarter to $87 million in the fourth quarter, a 16% improvement.\nTotal originations in December increased by 7% compared to the previous year.\nFor the first quarter, we anticipate our usual seasonal patterns, with lower originations and higher runoff as customers receive tax refunds and utilize their most recent stimulus payments.\nAs in previous years, we expect our net finance receivables to decrease quarter over quarter, with the timing of any new government stimulus temporarily reducing loan demand.\nPage 7 displays our digitally sourced originations, which accounted for 29% of our new borrower volume in the fourth quarter, the highest percentage we've observed.\nThis demonstrates our commitment to meeting our customers' needs and serving them through our omnichannel strategy.\nDuring the fourth quarter, large loans comprised 60% of our digitally sourced originations.\nMoving to Page 8.\nTotal revenue declined by 1% due to the ongoing product mix shift toward large loans and the portfolio composition shift toward higher-credit quality customers.\nOn a year-over-year basis, total revenue yield and interest and fee yield remained relatively stable.\nWe anticipate total revenue yield to decrease by 180 basis points and interest and fee yield to drop by 140 basis points in the first quarter compared to the fourth, due to our typical seasonal patterns.\nLet's move on to the next page.\nOur fourth quarter 2020 net credit loss rate was 6.9%, showing a year-over-year improvement of 210 basis points and a quarter-over-quarter improvement of 90 basis points.\nAs illustrated on the following page, our portfolio's credit quality remains consistent.\nOur December 30-plus day delinquency rate of 5.3% continued to hover near record lows, even though the use of borrower assistance programs stayed at pre-pandemic levels of 2.2%.\nThe 5.3% delinquency rate is 60 basis points higher than the third quarter, mainly due to normal seasonal fluctuations, but it's a 170-basis-point improvement compared to last year.\nWe anticipate that the recent government stimulus will keep delinquencies low for at least the first quarter of 2021, possibly longer depending on additional stimulus amounts.\nOn the next page, we see that we concluded the third quarter with a $144 million allowance for credit losses, representing 13.6% of net finance receivables.\nThe allowance increased by $6 million to $150 million, or 13.2% of net finance receivables, during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nThe base reserve grew by $7.5 million due to portfolio expansion, partially offset by a $1.5 million reduction in COVID-specific reserves, resulting in $30.4 million of COVID-specific reserves at quarter-end.\nThe severity and duration of our macroeconomic assumptions remained relatively consistent with our third-quarter model, including a projected 9% unemployment rate at the end of 2021.\nOur $150 million allowance for credit losses as of December 31 compares favorably to our 30-plus day contractual delinquency of $60.5 million.\nWe are confident that our current reserve levels are sufficient if the pandemic persists for an extended period.\nLet's move to the next page.\nFourth quarter 2020 G&A expenses were $44.8 million, a year-over-year increase of $3.9 million but $0.7 million better than our sequential guidance.\nThe G&A expense increase was primarily due to $3 million in higher marketing expenses and digital investments to support our growth initiatives.\nAs mentioned earlier, we will continue to focus on investing in our digital capabilities and marketing efforts in 2021 to drive new revenue opportunities, enhance our customers' omnichannel experience, and create long-term operating leverage.\nWe expect first quarter G&A expenses to be approximately $1 million higher than the fourth quarter, encompassing investments in increased marketing, digital capabilities, and state expansion plans.\nWe will maintain our investments in new growth initiatives throughout 2021 to drive receivable growth and improve long-term operating leverage.\nOn the following page, we see that interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $9.3 million, $1 million lower than the same period last year due to the lower interest rate environment.\nOur fourth-quarter annualized interest expense as a percentage of average net receivables was 3.3%, a 40-basis-point improvement year over year.\nWe purchased $50 million of interest rate caps in the fourth quarter to capitalize on the favorable rate environment.\nWe anticipate interest expense to be approximately $9 million in the first quarter.\nAs mentioned earlier, we recently priced an approximately $250 million securitization at a record low average-weighted coupon of 2.08%.\nThe securitization proceeds will be used to retire our RMIT 2018-2 securitization, which had a weighted average coupon of 4.87%.\nIn the fourth quarter, we accelerated $0.8 million for the amortization of debt issuance costs related to the RMIT 2018-2 transaction in anticipation of the expected repayment this quarter.\nThe new securitization will further reduce our cost of capital and strengthen our balance sheet going forward.\nOur effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 23.3%, compared to 24.5% in the prior-year period, better than expected due to tax benefits on share-based compensation.\nWe anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 25.5% for 2021.\nThe next page serves as a reminder of our strong funding profile.\nOur fourth-quarter funded debt-to-equity ratio remained at a very conservative 2.8:1.\nLow leverage, combined with $150 million in loan loss reserves, provides a strong balance sheet.\nAs of February 5, we had $452 million of unused capacity on our credit facilities and $203 million of available liquidity, consisting of unrestricted cash on hand and immediate availability to draw down cash from our revolving credit facilities.\nIn summary, we have more than adequate capacity to support our fundamental business operations and ambitious growth initiatives.\nWe repurchased 435,116 shares at a weighted average share price of $27.58 during the fourth quarter.\nAt the beginning of the year, we still had $18 million of availability remaining under our $30 million share repurchase program announced in the third quarter of 2020.\nAdditionally, our board of directors recently declared a $0.20 per common share dividend for the first quarter of 2021.\nThe dividend will be paid on March 12, 2021, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 23, 2021.\nWe are pleased that our strong balance sheet allows us to return excess capital to our shareholders.\nThat concludes my remarks.\nIn summary, 2020 was a challenging year for everyone, but our team rose to the occasion when times were toughest.\nAs a result, we enter 2021 particularly well-positioned to grow our market share while maintaining a very strong balance sheet and excellent credit profile.\nWe're excited about the future as we continue to provide our customers with a best-in-class experience and deliver additional value to our shareholders.\nOperator, please open the line for questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, and Zach Davis, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will be presenting.\nThe actual outcomes may differ significantly from the statements made.\nWe may refer to some non-GAAP financial measures, including consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow.\nToday's discussion of Cheniere's results may include some financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP (CQP), but we won't be covering CQP's results separately from Cheniere Energy, Inc.\nThe agenda for the call is displayed on the third slide.\nJack will start by discussing operational and financial highlights, followed by Anatol providing an update on the LNG market, and Zach reviewing our financial results and guidance.\nBefore delving into our results and outlook, I'd like to briefly address winter storm Uri and its effects on Cheniere.\nAs we mentioned in February, the widespread power outages in Texas impacted us, causing our Corpus Christi facility to shut down for a few days.\nI'm very proud of how our operating staff at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi handled yet another weather challenge, working tirelessly to manage our operations effectively during the freeze.\nFrom hurricanes to fog to unprecedented freezes, the Cheniere platform has proven resilient against nature's challenges, and our commitment to safe and reliable operations continues to benefit our customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\nThe winter storm did not significantly impact our assets or operations, and we were able to load some cargoes at Sabine Pass and quickly restore Corpus Christi to normal operations to minimize disruptions to our delivery commitments.\nWe saw some financial benefit from optimization activities leading up to the storm, but the impact is not substantial relative to our expected full-year 2021 financial results.\nMore importantly, the global LNG market has seen significant improvement for 2021 and beyond, with demand outpacing supply, leading to higher prices even during shoulder and summer months.\nI remain confident in the long-term viability and sustainability of LNG as a crucial fuel source in a low-carbon future.\nAfter meeting our 2020 guidance despite numerous challenges, we've maintained our momentum into the first quarter and are off to a strong start.\nOur outlook for full-year 2021 is even more positive now than it was during our last call in February.\nIn the first quarter, we generated about $1.5 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA, roughly $750 million in distributable cash flow, and nearly $400 million in net income on revenue of approximately $3.1 billion.\nWe've often described 2021 as Cheniere's cash flow inflection point, and our first-quarter financial results demonstrate early progress towards this goal.\nZach will provide more detailed information on these figures shortly.\nDuring the first quarter, we exported a record 133 LNG cargoes from our two facilities, driven by strong global LNG margins and the addition of Corpus Christi Train 3 commissioning volumes.\nThis record production was achieved despite Corpus being offline for a few days due to the February winter storm.\nThe sustained stronger LNG market environment, combined with our first-quarter results, has enabled us to raise our full-year 2021 financial guidance for the second consecutive quarter.\nOur outlook for the rest of the year has improved since our February call, with a slightly higher production forecast enhancing the impact of improved LNG margins we anticipate for the remainder of the year.\nWe now project consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $4.30 to $4.6 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.60 to $1.9 billion for the full year 2021.\nNear the end of the quarter, Train 3 at Corpus Christi achieved substantial completion within budget and in line with the accelerated timeline we previously communicated.\nWith the completion of Train 3, the Cheniere and Bechtel partnership has now delivered eight LNG trains ahead of schedule and within project budgets, demonstrating truly world-class execution.\nThis excellent execution continues with our ninth train, as construction on Train 6 at Sabine Pass progresses ahead of accelerated schedules.\nThe estimated substantial completion timeline has been further accelerated, with substantial completion now projected for the first half of next year.\nThe carbon offsets covered full lifecycle emissions, from the wellhead through consumption, with Cheniere delivering the cargo to Shell FOB at Sabine Pass and Shell delivering the cargo to a European regasification facility.\nThis first carbon-neutral cargo represents another step in Cheniere's environmental initiatives that I've discussed in recent months.\nOur efforts emphasize enhanced transparency as a crucial step towards improving environmental performance and maximizing the benefits of our LNG for Cheniere, our customers, and our value chain partners.\nToday's carbon-neutral cargo announcement follows our February announcement of Cargo Emissions Tags development.\nThe response to our CE Tags from current and prospective customers has been extremely positive and has sparked further engagement.\nOur goal is to ensure the long-term benefits of natural gas as an affordable, reliable, and clean energy source for the world.\nLet's move to slide six, where I'll discuss current market conditions and why I'm so optimistic about Cheniere's future prospects.\nIn the short-term market, we're beginning to see the impact of the structural shift towards natural gas as a primary energy source globally, as evidenced by the growth in global LNG demand we observed in 2020 despite the pandemic.\nEarlier this year, there was constructive LNG demand tension between Europe and Asia that left some countries short of natural gas.\nAdditionally, South America is entering its winter demand months and is contributing to the tightness in the global LNG market.\nWith natural gas storage below normal levels in Europe and limited new supply entering the market this year, we also have a positive outlook for the LNG market for the remainder of this year and into 2022 and 2023.\nWith Corpus Christi Train 3 completed very early and the completion timeline for Sabine Pass Train 6 recently accelerated again to the first half of next year, we are ideally positioned to benefit from these near-term market dynamics.\nIn the longer term, the supply and demand fundamentals in the global LNG market are even stronger, reinforcing our confidence in the value of our existing platform and in our ability to commercialize our Corpus Christi Stage III expansion project.\nIn the four-year period from 2017 to 2020, the global LNG market added almost 120 million tons of capacity, an average of nearly 30 million tons per year.\nIn the subsequent four-year period, that average is expected to drop to approximately 11 million tons a year, a significant slowdown in supply growth, which will be amplified by output declines from older legacy projects.\nOn the demand side, the structural shift to gas globally is evidenced by the near-doubling of LNG-importing nations in the last decade, and hundreds of billions of dollars of natural gas-oriented infrastructure being built worldwide today.\nLNG consumers recognize and value LNG's flexibility, reliability, affordability, and the critical role natural gas plays in improving environmental performance and achieving decarbonization goals.\nWe forecast that global LNG trade will approximately double, expanding by around 350 million tons per annum to over 700 million tonnes per annum by 2040, which would support an additional approximately 225 million tons per annum of incremental global supply.\nOur positive long-term view on the LNG market was recently reinforced by the results of a comprehensive climate scenario analysis we conducted with a leading global management consulting firm.\nWe released this report on our website last month.\nThe analysis examined Cheniere's long-term prospects under various energy transition scenarios, concluding that even in the most aggressive case studied, demand for natural gas and LNG is projected to increase for decades.\nLNG and natural gas consumption is anticipated to grow substantially in the coming years.\nNot only are Cheniere's current assets well-positioned to benefit from this trend, but additional LNG capacity will be required to meet the rising demand.\nCheniere's achievements and growth over the past five years of LNG operations have been remarkable, positioning the company to fully capitalize on the favorable market conditions ahead.\nWe have established ourselves as a leading LNG operator, demonstrating to buyers worldwide the reliability and security associated with long-term supply agreements from Cheniere.\nOur ongoing improvement efforts have resulted in efficiency gains, and debottlenecking has unlocked a significant amount of cost-effective volume across our projects, further enhancing our competitive position and increasing financial returns.\nAs construction activities wind down, the long-anticipated financial results of our multi-year capital programs are becoming evident, as shown by today's report.\nWe anticipate generating over $1 billion in free cash flow this year and are rapidly approaching our projected run rate metrics.\nOur forecast run rate of $11 per share in distributable cash flow is highly visible and allows us to pursue a comprehensive capital allocation strategy, including achieving investment-grade credit metrics, funding a significant portion of Corpus Christi Stage Three with cash flow after commercialization, and returning substantial capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\nZach, his team, and I are collaborating closely with the Board and management to develop detailed capital allocation plans, which we will share with you later this year.\nI'm optimistic about the LNG market outlook, Cheniere's position to capitalize on it with our portfolio volumes, a shovel-ready brownfield expansion project, tailored commercial offerings, and an improving credit and cash flow profile.\nThe global LNG market ended 2020 on a positive note as cold weather across Asia and continued economic growth in China contributed to increased Asian LNG imports in Q4.\nAs non-U.S. supply was slow to respond, markets tightened when Asia drew cargoes from Europe, a trend that persisted into Q1 of 2021.\nIn the first quarter, global LNG supply showed positive year-on-year growth for the first time since Q1 2020, but net growth was modest as healthy 17% growth in U.S. exports was largely offset by declines at several LNG facilities worldwide, which were either shut down or underperforming, including sites in Norway, Nigeria, Australia, Trinidad, Tobago, and Russia.\nExtreme cold weather in Asia and then Europe during Q1, combined with supply constraints and a tight shipping market, led to unprecedented price spikes in JKM to all-time highs exceeding $30 in January.\nSince then, extreme temperature conditions have subsided and JKM prices have moderated.\nHowever, price levels remain significantly higher than a year ago, with March JKM settling at $8.26 and June trading above $9 currently.\nThese prices are well above the $2 per MMBtu level seen a year ago, indicating an underlying structural tightening of the market supported by strengthening demand fundamentals.\nAs mentioned earlier, Asian LNG imports were robust in Q1, increasing by over seven million tons or 11% year-on-year.\nChina added nearly five million tons of LNG demand despite strong domestic gas production and increased Russian pipeline gas imports.\nPreliminary reports show total gas demand in China increased by approximately 15% year-on-year in Q1.\nWeather conditions, continued coal-to-gas switching, and a remarkable 18% increase in Q1 GDP drove the demand increase.\nIn the Japan, Korea, and Taiwan region, LNG imports rose by 8% or three million tons year-on-year, partly due to scheduled nuclear and coal outages.\nFrom a structural demand perspective, a decade after the Fukushima earthquake, most Japanese nuclear plants remain offline, with only nine units totaling 9.1 gigawatts resuming operation as of Q1 2021, compared to 42 gigawatts in 2010, solidifying LNG as a crucial fuel for energy system stability in Japan and the region as a whole.\nIn Europe, gas demand in major markets increased by 9% year-on-year during Q1 due to stronger heating and gas-fired power demand.\nSignificant drawdowns from storage through winter and into April have left European storage approximately 34 bcm or around 50% lower than the previous year by the end of April, and approximately 11 bcm or about 375 Bcf below the five-year average.\nTo attract LNG volumes away from Asia to help replenish storage, TTF prices remain elevated.\nApril TTF settled higher than JKM at $6.46 per MMBtu, 13% higher on the month and up almost 200% year-on-year.\nCurrent prop margins are in the $3 range, including a dramatic upward shift in charter rates from the $30,000 a day range to well above $80,000 a day today.\nBased on these demand fundamentals, although specific conditions during Q1 led to some dramatic LNG price volatility, we believe we have also seen indications that the structural tightening we've been predicting for some time is now underway.\nAs such, we have continued to transact incremental volumes aligned with our midterm strategy.\nThe team has secured an additional approximately 1.7 million tons, locking in over $200 million in fixed fees across 2022 and 2023.\nWe see strong appetite for midterm agreements as both intermediaries and end users add diversity, security, and flexibility to their portfolios.\nTurning to slide nine, I will discuss some longer-term aspects of the market.\nWe've discussed over the last few years that we viewed 2021 as a transition year to a tight market, and as we just described, that has played out much faster than we expected.\nForward margins today during the Northern Hemisphere Spring shoulder season are higher than they have been at any point for this season since we began operating just over five years ago.\nA number of market conditions that have been headwinds to entering into long-term commitments have more recently become tailwinds, such as oil price, prompt margins, and forward supply growth, just to name a few.\nWe remain quite optimistic about the long-term contracting market for our products over the coming quarters and years as the demand for LNG will continue to increase over time with many current markets expanding and new markets continuing to be added.\nSpecifically in Asia, along with China and India, markets in South and Southeast Asia have shown keen interest in expanding their natural gas infrastructure, from pipelines to power plants, to support their rapidly growing economies.\nIn power generation, forecasts suggest that gas is expected to be the second-highest growth segment after renewables in terms of capacity additions.\nThe need to expand access to reliable energy across the region means that natural gas is expected to play a crucial role in ensuring sustainable economic growth while reducing emissions intensity.\nOf the roughly 3,000 gigawatts of forecast incremental power generation capacity in Asia by 2040, over 300 gigawatts is expected to be gas-fired.\nFor reference, a gigawatt of combined cycle natural gas generation operated as baseload requires approximately one million tons of LNG per annum.\nA significant portion of that sum will be in China, but almost half of it is expected to satisfy growth in South and Southeast Asian countries, such as India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and the Philippines.\nSome of these countries are already well-established gas users with indigenous resources, which are mature and declining.\nData from Wood Mackenzie suggest that the region could lose more than 20 Bcf a day of domestic output by 2040, and current upstream developments are considered unlikely to offset more than just a small fraction of that decline.\nAdditionally, gas demand in the region is currently expected to grow by at least 18 Bcf a day during the period to 2040, creating a gap of more than 35 Bcf a day of gas, which we expect to be satisfied largely by LNG.\nFor reference, 35 Bcf a day is equivalent to approximately 250 million tons per annum of LNG.\nThe combined demand for LNG in South and Southeast Asia is projected to grow substantially.\nProjections indicate LNG demand in South and Southeast Asia could increase fivefold by 2040, potentially adding 160 to 200 million tons to global trade.\nOver the next 20 years, we anticipate China will account for over 20% of Asian demand growth, while South and Southeast Asia will contribute roughly 70% as these nations prioritize gas over coal for economic growth and climate objectives.\nThis area consumed more than 17% of global coal and was responsible for over a third of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions in 2019.\nAlthough most net zero commitments originated outside the region, we believe South and Southeast Asian countries are increasingly committed to enhancing environmental performance and finding more sustainable ways to fuel growth.\nWe view Cheniere's LNG as a dependable, reliable, and cost-effective fuel source for the region that, alongside renewable energy, will replace more polluting alternatives.\nJack has already mentioned our ESG leadership and initiatives, and I'll add that we're noticing growing interest and engagement from both current and potential customers regarding the environmental opportunities we're developing.\nCheniere is prepared to collaborate with customers globally to create practical solutions that meet their commercial needs and fulfill global environmental imperatives.\nWe believe our low-emission LNG standards will contribute to supporting the region's environmental goals and energy priorities.\nI'm glad to be here today to discuss our first quarter financial results, key financial updates, and our increased 2021 guidance.\nLet's move to slide 12.\nIn the first quarter, we generated $393 million in net income, approximately $1.5 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA, and about $750 million in distributable cash flow.\nOur first quarter financial results benefited from higher global LNG prices and margins, particularly those realized on spot and short-term cargoes sold through our marketing affiliate, and an unusually high contribution from LNG and natural gas portfolio optimization activities due to significant market volatility during the quarter.\nAs discussed previously, our IPM agreements, certain gas supply agreements, and some forward LNG sales qualify as derivatives and require mark-to-market accounting, resulting in periodic noncash gains and losses as underlying forward commodity curves shift.\nThe impact of these curve shifts on our commodity and FX derivatives' fair value in the first quarter of 2021 was a net loss of about $120 million, which was almost entirely noncash.\nIn the first quarter, we recognized income from 456 TBtu of physical LNG, including 442 TBtu from our projects and 14 TBtu from third parties.\n84% of the LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements.\nDuring and after the winter storm, we coordinated with our long-term customers on cargo schedules and shifted some volumes from Corpus to Sabine, resulting in no significant impact on our quarterly production.\nWe received no cargo cancellation notices and had no revenue related to cargo cancellations in the first quarter.\nHowever, we previously recognized $38 million in revenues during the fourth quarter of 2020 related to canceled cargoes that would have been lifted in the first quarter.\nCommissioning activities for Corpus Train three proceeded smoothly, as Jack mentioned, and we received $191 million from commissioning cargo sales in the first quarter, corresponding to 25 TBtu of LNG.\nRemember that proceeds from commissioning cargo sales are offset against LNG terminal construction and process, minus the costs associated with producing and delivering those cargoes.\nSix TBtu of LNG related to commissioning activities was in transit at the end of the first quarter and will be recorded as an offset to construction in process upon delivery.\nLet's look at the balance sheet.\nWe've prioritized debt reduction since securing the Cheniere loan to refinance convertible notes last year and have committed to paying down at least another $500 million of outstanding debt in 2021.\nWe made good progress toward this goal in the first quarter by paying down $148 million in outstanding borrowings under the Cheniere term loan.\nI'll provide more details shortly, but we're in an excellent position to meet and likely exceed our minimum debt reduction target this year.\nIn February, we secured an approximately $150 million private placement of long-term amortizing fixed-rate notes at SBL, set to fund in late 2021 at a 2.95% rate, the lowest-yielding bond ever secured across the Cheniere complex.\nIn March, CQP opportunistically issued $1.5 billion of 4% senior notes due 2031, using the proceeds and cash on hand to extend the maturity and refinance all of CQP's 5.25% senior notes due 2025 accretively.\nOur efforts in execution, performance, and prudent balance sheet management throughout the Cheniere structure continue to be recognized by credit rating agencies.\nAs mentioned in our last call, Fitch revised the outlook of SPL's senior secured notes rating to positive from stable in February, while reaffirming its existing BBB- investment-grade rating.\nIn April, S&P revised the outlook of both Cheniere and CQP's BB ratings to positive from negative, suggesting potential ratings upgrades.\nS&P's commentary also indicated that a leverage level of 4.5 to 5 times on a debt-to-EBITDA basis in the next couple of years could be consistent with an investment-grade rating, aligning with and supporting our deleveraging plan and goal of investment-grade credit metrics throughout the structure.\nNow, let's turn to slide 13.\nAs Jack mentioned, we're again increasing our guidance ranges for full-year 2021 consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow by $200 million, bringing total increases to $400 million above the original ranges provided last November.\nOur revised guidance ranges are $4.30 to $4.6 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $1.6 to $1.9 billion in distributable cash flow.\nToday's guidance increase is largely driven by our strong first-quarter results, continued improvement in global LNG market pricing, and our ability to execute additional higher-margin forward sales into the stronger pricing environment.\nSince our last call, we've continued to secure additional volumes for the remainder of the year, though these sales have been offset by an upwardly revised production forecast due to maintenance optimization, favorable weather, and a much faster than expected ramp-up to steady Train three volumes.\nWe currently estimate that a $1 change in market margin would impact EBITDA by approximately $4 for full-year 2021.\nAs we've now sold almost all of our production for the rest of the year and have completed and placed Corpus Train III into service as previously forecasted, our remaining exposure this year is not significant, and we only plan to provide another update if that changes.\nWe're confident in our ability to deliver results within these upwardly revised guidance ranges for the full year.\nWith Train three now operational, we've passed the free cash flow inflection point we've long discussed with our stakeholders.\nWe expect to generate significant free cash flow this year for the first time in Cheniere's history, well over $1 billion.\nWe initially committed to $500 million in debt reduction this year, but we now believe $500 million is conservative due to our strong performance and cash flow generation year-to-date, as well as the forward LNG sales we've executed in a robust LNG market.\nWe're continuing to work on our long-term capital allocation strategy with our Board and anticipate communicating this multi-year plan to you in the second half of the year, including more comprehensive plans for the remaining free cash flow this year after meeting our initial 2021 debt reduction goal of $500 million.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These declarations are contingent on management's present expectations and may change due to uncertain circumstances.\nResults could significantly deviate from these projections due to shifts in economic, business, competitive, market, political, and regulatory environments.\nI will also address our recently announced intention to purchase Midwest Warehouse & Distribution System.\nJohn will present our third quarter results, which once again surpassed our expectations, and review our focused capital allocation strategy aimed at maximizing returns.\nI will then present our revised outlook for 2021.\nAllow me to begin with some crucial observations about the market and our performance.\nOngoing trends in transportation and logistics outsourcing continue to bolster our growth strategy and investments.\nSince the pandemic's onset, trends in warehousing, distribution, e-commerce fulfillment, and last-mile delivery of large items have continued to accelerate.\nOur strategic investments remain centered on capitalizing on these favorable outsourcing trends.\nUnprecedented challenges affecting labor, supply chains, and truck production are creating additional growth opportunities by prompting companies to make long-term outsourcing decisions.\nWe are experiencing record new contract wins in supply chain and dedicated services, which we anticipate will contribute to long-term profitable growth.\nFMS is also benefiting as companies seek truck capacity in this extremely tight market.\nIn line with our disciplined capital allocation strategy, we are investing in our higher-return logistics businesses through our planned acquisition of Midwest Warehouse & Distribution System, which enhances multi-client warehousing capabilities in supply chain and accelerates growth.\nWe also revealed plans to return capital to shareholders over time through discretionary and anti-dilutive share repurchase programs.\nThe new discretionary program is expected to be utilized over time, depending on factors such as balance sheet leverage, the availability of quality acquisitions, and the stock price.\nWe now anticipate achieving an ROE in the range of 18% to 19% for the full year.\nThe team has excellently capitalized on favorable pricing trends in used vehicle sales and rental, resulting in outperformance in both areas.\nAdditionally, we have continued to increase lease pricing, leading to improved portfolio returns and a 4% rise in revenue per average active lease vehicle.\nWe expect further benefits as leases are renewed and repriced, and as we employ data analytics to further segment customer pricing based on application, equipment type, and other key drivers of lease returns.\nTurning to cash flow.\nWe generated robust year-to-date free cash flow exceeding $800 million and have increased our full-year free cash flow forecast to $1 billion to $1.1 billion, up from our previous projection of $650 million to $750 million.\nOur full-year forecast incorporates an estimated cash flow benefit of $400 million from deferred capital expenditures due to OEM delivery delays, as well as record proceeds from the sale of our used vehicles.\nWith balance sheet leverage currently well below our target range, we have additional capacity to enhance shareholder value by deploying capital in line with our disciplined allocation strategy.\nSlide five provides an overview of the investments we're making to drive accelerated growth in supply chain and dedicated services, a key component of our strategy to generate higher returns.\nDeveloping new and enhanced products such as Ryder Last Mile, e-commerce fulfillment, and freight brokerage creates opportunities to leverage profitable growth areas.\nInnovative technology enables us to deliver value-added logistics solutions that are in high demand.\nLast quarter, I highlighted our Ryder Last Mile offering.\nThis quarter, I'll discuss RyderShare, our real-time freight visibility and collaboration tool that has proven to be a key differentiator in winning new business.\nSales and marketing are crucial for our brand awareness and ensuring customers are aware of our full range of supply chain capabilities.\nOur Ever better campaign and increased digital marketing presence have driven a significant increase in qualified sales leads.\nWe're also expanding our sales force and investing in their capabilities to drive additional growth opportunities.\nStrategic M&A opportunities, such as our planned acquisition of Midwest, focus on adding new capabilities, geographies, and/or industry verticals.\nThese opportunities are an important way to accelerate growth, especially in Supply Chain and Dedicated services.\nRyder Ventures, our corporate venture capital fund, aims to invest $50 million over five years through direct investment in start-ups.\nOur investments here advance strategic relationships where we typically work together to develop new products and capabilities that benefit our customers and solidify our position as an industry leader.\nWe've made investments in numerous exciting areas such as e-commerce micro-fulfillment and digital driver staffing, and are working with these start-ups to address important customer needs.\nWe also recently announced strategic alliances with several autonomous technology firms, which enables us to leverage our expertise in asset management, maintenance, and transportation, positioning us as an innovative leader in this emerging space.\nSlide six takes a closer look at RyderShare, an innovative digital product that combines Ryder's nearly 90 years of logistics experience with best-in-class technology.\nRyderShare provides users with real-time freight visibility throughout an order's lifecycle, as well as the opportunity to share information between suppliers, carriers, and shippers on one platform, with Ryder's team of supply chain experts managing exceptions.\nRyderShare users benefit from improved service for their customers, increased employee productivity, and the ability to readily access information from one source for decision-making.\nAlmost 70% of Ryder's transportation volume in supply chain and dedicated services now runs through RyderShare.\nThe platform has processed over 4.4 million transactions and has over 5,300 users to date.\nWe're also excited about our recent launch of RyderShare for warehousing.\nThis enhancement makes RyderShare the only visibility platform that connects transportation with warehousing.\nWe expect this will be a key differentiator in winning new business.\nTotal company results for the third quarter are shown on page seven.\nOperating revenue of $2 billion in the third quarter increased 11% from the prior year, reflecting revenue growth across all three of our business segments.\nThe company's earnings per share from ongoing operations in the third quarter reached $2.55, up from $1.21 in the previous year.\nEnhanced earnings stem from better performance in aftermath activities, including higher rental income, increased used vehicle sales, improved lease outcomes, and a reduced depreciation expense impact linked to earlier residual value estimate modifications.\nFor the preceding 12-month period, return on equity, the company's main financial indicator, hit 15.7%.\nThe improved ROE reflects higher profits from rentals, used vehicle sales, and reduced depreciation expense impact.\nBetter lease performance also contributed to the increased ROE and showcases the effect of the company's pricing strategies.\nDespite being lower than the previous year when capital expenditures were unusually low due to COVID, the year-to-date free cash flow remained robust at $829 million.\nLet's examine the FMS results on page eight.\nFleet Management Solutions' operating revenue grew by 8%, with rental revenue surging 37% due to high demand and increased pricing.\nRental pricing rose by 9%, primarily because of higher rates across all vehicle categories.\nFMS achieved pre-tax earnings of $186 million, a $170 million increase from the previous year.\n$93 million of this improvement came from higher profits on used vehicle sales and reduced depreciation expense related to previous residual value estimate changes.\nBetter rental and lease results also significantly boosted FMS earnings.\nThe power fleet's rental utilization reached a record 83% in the quarter, considerably higher than the previous year's 71%.\nResults also benefited from ongoing momentum in lease pricing initiatives, partially offset by a 3% reduction in the average active lease fleet.\nFMS EBT as a percentage of operating revenue was 14.9% in the third quarter, surpassing the company's long-term goal of high single digits.\nFor the trailing 12-month period, it aligned with the target at 9.7%.\nPage nine showcases the global used vehicle sales results for the quarter.\nUsed vehicle market conditions remain strong due to robust freight activity and limited supply from truck production constraints.\nHigher sales proceeds reflect significantly improved market pricing.\nGlobally, year-over-year proceeds more than doubled for both tractors and trucks.\nSequentially, tractor proceeds increased by 32% and truck proceeds rose by 27% compared to the second quarter of 2021.\nAs a reminder, last year we provided a sensitivity analysis indicating that a 10% price increase for trucks and a 30% price increase for tractors in the U.S. would be necessary by 2022 to maintain current residual value estimates.\nOur current tractor and truck proceeds significantly exceed these levels.\nThe average current pricing for tractors and trucks in the U.S. is well above our residual value estimates used for depreciation purposes.\nAs a result, we are comfortable with our residual value estimates and do not anticipate the need for any significant adjustments at this time.\nDuring the quarter, we sold 4,900 used vehicles, a 44% decrease from the previous year and an 18% drop sequentially, reflecting lower inventory levels.\nUsed vehicle inventory stood at 3,500 vehicles at quarter-end, below our target range of 7,000 to 9,000 vehicles.\nLet's examine the supply chain results on page 10.\nOperating revenue increased by 14% compared to the previous year due to new business, higher volumes, and increased pricing.\nGrowth was partially offset by the impact of supply chain disruptions and automotive production activity.\nWe expect this disruption to continue affecting our automotive customers until global supply chains normalize, and we are working with our customers to mitigate the impact.\nWe have included an estimated impact from potential shutdowns in our forecast for the rest of the year, as the situation remains uncertain.\nSCS pre-tax earnings decreased by 62%, and the trailing SCS EBT as a percentage of operating revenue of 6.2% was below target.\nThis reflects lower automotive earnings, higher labor costs, and strategic investments, partially offset by positive earnings from new business.\nWe anticipate that the pricing adjustments we're implementing will improve SCS EBT percentages in the first half of 2022 and bring them close to the target range in the second half of next year.\nMoving to dedicated on page 11.\nOperating revenue increased by 16% due to new business, higher volumes, and increased pricing.\nNew contract wins in DTS continue to be robust, with year-to-date sales results already reaching full-year record levels.\nNew contract wins are driven by ongoing secular outsourcing trends as well as current labor and supply chain challenges that are prompting companies to make long-term outsourcing decisions.\nWe're signing larger deals across a diversified industry base, and new contract wins are also benefiting from cross-selling opportunities from FMS and SCS.\nDTS pre-tax earnings decreased by 54%, and trailing DTS EBT as a percentage of operating revenue was below target at 5.3%.\nThis reflects increased labor and insurance costs, partially offset by positive earnings from new business.\nAlthough unprecedented labor challenges are affecting current results in DTS and SCS, we are increasing our recruiting efforts and successfully working with our customers to implement price adjustments to address higher market costs.\nWe're encouraged by the early progress we're making on these price adjustments as we continue to deliver the superior service our customers expect.\nWe're confident that our new and expanded customer base and pricing adjustments will improve DTS EBT percentages in the first half of 2022, with it moving close to our target range in the second half.\nTurning to slide 12.\nLease capital spending of $807 million was above the previous year's plan due to increased lease sales activity during the year.\nPricing strategies for lease returns are proving advantageous and enable a more standard lease capital investment.\nYear-over-year rental capital expenditure of $583 million rose considerably, indicating a higher planned investment in the rental fleet.\nWe aim to expand the rental fleet by roughly 15% in 2021 to meet the increased demand driven by strong e-commerce and overall freight activity.\nOur revised full year 2021 forecast for gross capital expenditures of $1.9 billion to $2 billion is lower than our initial projection.\nThis adjustment accounts for an estimated $400 million impact from delayed vehicle purchases due to OEM delivery issues mentioned earlier by Robert.\nMoving to the next slide.\nWe've increased our 2021 free cash flow forecast to between $1 billion and $1.1 billion, up from our previous estimate of $650 million to $750 million.\nThe full year projection aligns with our strategy of balancing moderate growth in the capital-intensive FMS business while generating positive free cash flow throughout the cycle.\nIt also takes into account the impact of delayed OEM deliveries and record proceeds from used vehicle sales, as previously mentioned.\nBalance sheet leverage decreased due to higher earnings and cash flow, and is anticipated to remain below the lower end of our target range this year.\nNotably, we now expect to achieve an ROE of 18% to 19% this year, driven by stronger than anticipated performance in FMS and a decreasing depreciation impact.\nHigher year-to-date comparable EBITDA, which excludes the impact of gains and losses on used vehicle sales, reflects revenue growth and improved operational efficiency.\nMoving to the next slide.\nI'd like to discuss our capital allocation priorities, which focus on creating long-term shareholder value by investing in high-return opportunities that generate positive free cash flow over time.\nOur primary focus for capital is investing in high-return organic growth opportunities, including moderate FMS lease fleet expansion and accelerating growth in SCS and DTS.\nIn our FMS business, we estimate annual investments of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion to replace leased vehicles as contracts are renewed and to update the existing rental fleet.\nWe also plan to invest between $200 million to $500 million annually in fleet growth, representing lease fleet expansion of approximately 2,000 to 4,000 vehicles with corresponding growth in rental.\nBoth lease and rental returns are expected to continue benefiting from ongoing pricing initiatives.\nInvestments to accelerate growth in our higher-return and less capital-intensive supply chain and dedicated businesses, as well as technology investments that expand or enhance our capabilities, are also key priorities for organic growth capital.\nStrategic acquisitions, such as our planned purchase of Midwest, aim to add new service capabilities or industry verticals and provide important opportunities for long-term profitable growth.\nAccretive tuck-in acquisitions that complement our core business and investments through RyderVentures offer additional growth prospects.\nOur capital allocation strategy also emphasizes returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nRyder has consistently paid quarterly dividends for over 45 years.\nOur dividend growth rate over the past decade is 7%, with a current dividend yield of approximately 3%.\nThe newly announced share repurchase programs allow for both anti-dilutive and discretionary share buybacks.\nWe remain committed to offsetting dilution through the anti-dilutive program.\nThe discretionary program will be used over time to manage leverage, with its usage dependent on factors such as balance sheet leverage, availability of quality acquisitions, and stock price.\nOur capital allocation priorities aim to achieve an ROE of 15% or higher over the cycle while generating positive free cash flow and maintaining target leverage.\nTurning to our earnings per share outlook on the next page.\nWe're raising our full year comparable earnings per share forecast to $8.40 to $8.50, up from our previous projection of $7.20 to $7.50 and significantly above the prior year's loss of $0.27.\nWe're also providing a fourth quarter comparable earnings per share forecast of $2.36 to $2.46, considerably higher than the prior year's $0.83.\nUsed vehicle sales, rental, and lease are the main drivers of the expected increase in full year results.\nGains are anticipated to decrease slightly in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, reflecting strong pricing partially offset by fewer vehicles sold due to low inventory levels.\nLooking ahead to 2022, we expect both higher revenue and earnings.\nRecord new contract wins in 2021 in supply chain and dedicated are expected to boost 2022 revenue growth.\nSupply chain and dedicated margins are projected to improve in the first half of next year and approach the target range in the second half, reflecting price increases to address higher labor costs, barring any further market disruptions.\nWe anticipate strong freight conditions and truck production challenges to persist into 2022, benefiting FMS results.\nThe declining depreciation expense impact is expected to benefit year-over-year earnings comparisons by $85 million.\nHowever, this is likely to be fully offset by higher book values on vehicles being sold next year.\nUsed vehicle sales volumes are projected to be flat to slightly higher.\nUsed truck pricing for the year is anticipated to be flat to modestly higher in 2022, remaining strong through at least mid-year and potentially declining in the second half if new truck production increases and used vehicle inventories in the overall market begin to normalize.\nFree cash flow next year is expected to decrease, primarily due to the $400 million capital expenditure deferral from 2021 to 2022 resulting from OEM delivery delays.\nGiven the unusual OEM production situation, it would be appropriate to consider combined free cash flows for 2021 and 2022.\nOverall, we're encouraged by trends favoring outsourcing and our efforts in sales, marketing, and new product development.\nWe're confident in our actions to increase returns, including higher pricing to offset labor challenges, positioning us favorably for 2022.\nBefore we move to questions, please note that we plan to file our 10-Q later today.\nSummary: ",

the company's chief financial officer, participated in today's conference call\nThe presentation materials for today's discussion can be accessed on CIRCOR's website at www\nThese projections are contingent on various known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and additional factors\nFor a comprehensive overview of these factors, the company recommends reviewing CIRCOR's Form 10-K, 10-Q, and other SEC filings\nThe company's documents are accessible on their website at circor.com\nThe actual outcomes may deviate significantly from what is suggested or implied in today's discussion\nThese alternative financial measures exclude certain extraordinary charges and recoveries\nThe CIRCOR team has made exceptional efforts to supply crucial products to customers while ensuring employee safety and maintaining operational continuity\nDespite unprecedented global challenges, CIRCOR achieved strong results in the second quarter\nI take pride in the portfolio restructuring we've implemented over the past few years\nWe've completed our transition away from upstream Oil & Gas and other commodity-based operations with the recent sale of distributed valves\nThis transformation has allowed us to concentrate on our primary Mission Critical flow control platforms and position CIRCOR for robust future expansion\nOur current portfolio of Mission Critical operations is more diverse and less cyclical, mitigating the impact of broader economic conditions\nFurthermore, our product range features distinctive technology and a strong market position, enabling us to increase prices during the current downturn\nAll of our production facilities are functioning in accordance with customer demand\nCurrently, we're managing some inefficiencies related to safety measures implemented to protect our employees\nWe continue to address some COVID-19 related supply chain challenges\nApart from these issues, we're experiencing minimal direct operational disruption from COVID-19\nDespite these obstacles, the CIRCOR operating system is yielding improved performance across most metrics\nLastly, we're preparing CIRCOR to capitalize on a market recovery\nWe remain on schedule to fulfill our commitment of introducing 45 new products this year\nWe persist in investing in front-end resources and strategic growth initiatives\nWe're working closely with suppliers and customers to ensure alignment as market conditions evolve\nFinally, we maintain our focus on reducing the balance sheet leverage\nI'd now like to present some key points from the second quarter\nPlease refer to Page 4\nWe received orders totaling $193 million, with a book-to-bill ratio slightly exceeding 1.0, and a backlog increase of $7 million\nRevenue amounted to $186 million, a 14% organic decrease, primarily due to industrial sector performance\nThe Aerospace & Defense segment maintained robust top-line performance throughout the quarter\nThe adjusted operating margin was 8.5%, a 210-basis-point reduction from the previous year\nThe margin decline was mainly attributed to lower industrial volume\nDespite reduced revenue, we managed company-wide detrimental to 22%, owing to aggressive cost and pricing measures implemented earlier this year\nOur cost-cutting initiatives remain consistent with the targets outlined in our first-quarter earnings call, and our pricing strategies across the company are meeting expectations\nLet's examine our segment results\nAll figures pertain to continuing operations and exclude divestitures\nBeginning with the industrial segment on Slide 5\nIn Q2, Industrial segment orders decreased by 16% organically, due to COVID-19 impacts on most industrial end markets\nThe Industrial segment reported sales of $124 million, a 19% organic decline\nMost of our industrial end markets faced challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic\nWe observed delays in capital projects and customer maintenance throughout the quarter\nOur EOM margin was 10%, representing a 350-basis-point decrease compared to the previous year\nThis was primarily caused by lower sales volume and inefficiencies related to maintaining social distancing on the factory floor and other COVID-19 safety measures\nThe cost-cutting measures initiated at the end of 2019, along with additional actions taken during the pandemic, resulted in a 27% drop-through, significantly lower than our contribution margin\nDuring the second quarter of the Aerospace & Defense division, we received orders totaling $77 million, which represents an 18% organic decrease, primarily due to a challenging comparison.\nIn the previous year, we secured a substantial $17 million order for the Joint Strike Fighter program.\nThis year, we experienced the effects of COVID-19 on commercial aerospace, though this was somewhat counterbalanced by a $9 million order for the Virginia Class Submarine.\nThe Aerospace & Defense segment reported sales of $62 million, showing a 3% organic decline due to COVID-19's impact on commercial aerospace and ongoing delays with the 737MAX.\nThis decrease was partly offset by robust defense shipments, particularly for the Virginia Class Submarine and Joint Strike Fighter programs.\nThe operating margin for Aerospace & Defense reached 21.1%, an increase of 500 basis points.\nDespite a $2 million reduction in revenue, the Aerospace & Defense division generated an additional $3 million in operating income, attributed to pricing strategies, improved productivity, and cost-cutting measures.\nLet's move on to Slide 7.\nThe adjusted tax rate for Q2 was 14.8%, influenced by foreign tax rate differences and increased R&D tax credits.\nRegarding special items and restructuring charges, we recorded a total pre-tax charge of $17 million for the quarter.\nAcquisition-related amortization and depreciation amounted to a $12 million charge.\nProfessional fees resulted in a $4.6 million charge, related to the previous year's unsolicited tender offer, corporate governance actions, and other proxy-related matters.\nInterest expenses for the quarter totaled $8 million, a $5 million decrease compared to the previous year.\nThis reduction was due to lower debt balances and a federal interest rate of 25 basis points.\nOther income showed a $2 million charge in the quarter, mainly due to foreign exchange losses, partially offset by pension income.\nCorporate costs for the quarter were $9.7 million, higher than usual, primarily due to a $1.8 million write-off against an asset from a previously divested business.\nWe anticipate corporate costs to be approximately $7 million per quarter for Q3 and Q4.\nLet's proceed to Slide 8.\nOur free cash flow from operations was negative $28 million in the second quarter, aligning with the guidance provided during our first-quarter earnings call.\nWe sold our Distributor Valves business during the quarter for a negative cash amount of $8.25 million.\nThe company also spent about $10 million on cash disbursements related to last year's unsolicited tender offer, support for corporate governance changes, restructuring, investment banking fees, and other professional services.\nAt the end of Q2, our net debt stood at $467 million, which is $205 million lower than Q2 2019.\nAs mentioned in our Q1 call, we expect our Q3 free cash flow to be around break-even or slightly negative.\nWe anticipate completing the final disbursements related to the exit of Distributed Valves and other restructuring expenses.\nQ4 is expected to generate strong positive cash flow, largely free of transition and restructuring expenses.\nI'll now hand it back to Scott to provide insights on our end markets and outlook.\nI'll now offer an overview of our end market conditions and the actions we're taking to navigate the pandemic.\nPlease refer to Page 9.\nLet me begin by summarizing our market exposure.\nWe've completely withdrawn from upstream Oil & Gas.\nOur current portfolio consists of approximately 46% General Industrial, 27% Aerospace & Defense (with defense being about twice the size of commercial), and 27% aftermarket sales and support.\nI'd like to highlight a few aspects of our current portfolio.\nOur Aftermarket business is primarily driven by Industrial and defense sectors.\nAftermarket margins are higher than those of OEM.\nOrders from our extensive global installed base are helping to mitigate the impact of the broader economic downturn.\nAftermarket is a strategic growth area for CIRCOR, and we will continue to invest in its growth throughout 2020 and beyond.\nWe anticipate that defense will remain strong.\nOur Defense team is securing new programs, and next year's U.S. defense budget appears to be maintaining 2020 levels or slightly improving.\nAdditionally, we're seeing robust support for many of our major defense platforms.\nOur Commercial business accounts for 8% of revenue, with less than half of that driven by Boeing and Airbus commercial aircraft platforms.\nThe majority of the remaining commercial sales come from a diverse range of OEM platforms across business and regional aviation, Civil Helicopters, and Space programs.\nOur Industrial business is highly diversified across end markets.\nApart from downstream Oil & Gas, which represents 10% of revenue, no single end-market accounts for more than 6% of revenue.\nThis provides substantial diversification, lessening cyclical effects and our reliance on any single end market.\nWe'll begin with the industrial sector.\nOverall orders in the second quarter decreased by 16% organically.\nThe Industrial business experienced the effects of COVID-19 across most major end markets during Q2.\nMarket orders declined by 23%, affected by a general slowdown in global manufacturing and postponements of large projects due to worldwide reductions in capital expenditure.\nWe observed delays in capital projects within Commercial Marine, Machinery Manufacturing, Chemical Processing, and Building & Construction sectors.\nThe water and wastewater sector was less affected compared to other markets.\nThe consumer goods manufacturing industry experienced a moderate increase in orders due to the COVID-19 situation and some customers relocating production from China to the United States.\nAftermarket orders saw an organic decline of 8% in Q2.\nOur extensive global presence and dedicated Aftermarket Commercial team are helping to mitigate the impact of steeper declines in market capital projects.\nThe aftermarket experienced the most significant weakness in Commercial Marine, due to reduced usage of cruise ships and offshore service vessels.\nWe're observing growth in certain areas such as nuclear power in Asia and midstream Oil & Gas in Latin America.\nDownstream order intake was relatively low in the quarter due to postponed capital projects and maintenance turnarounds.\nRefineries are minimizing short-term expenses and scaling back activities planned for the fall turnaround period.\nThe aftermarket backlog is anticipated to grow as we end the year, preparing for delayed maintenance activities from 2020 and adding to the already scheduled repair and maintenance work for 2021.\nBoating activity remains robust for long-term capital projects in growth markets.\nFor the Industrial sector overall in Q3, the end-market outlook is comparable to Q2 market levels.\nWe anticipate COVID-19 will cause a year-over-year revenue decline of 18% to 28%.\nMost OEM end markets in Q3 are expected to remain at Q2 levels due to ongoing reductions in capital expenditure and delays in capital projects.\nIn the aftermarket, we're beginning to see some sequential improvements in Europe and Asia as these markets recover from the COVID-related downturn.\nWe expect Q3 revenue in North America to be consistent with Q2.\nRegionally, the general industrial market is projected to decrease in Q3 compared to the previous year in North America, Europe, and India.\nHowever, we anticipate growth in China.\nOur Aerospace & Defense segment received orders totaling $77 million in the quarter, driven by ongoing strength in Defense programs such as the Joint Strike Fighter.\nThe US Naval Virginia Class Submarine, the CVN-80 aircraft carrier, and various missile programs contributed to the strong Defense orders, offsetting weakness in commercial Aerospace orders.\nCommercial Aerospace orders declined from the previous quarter due to COVID-19's impact on production rates at Boeing and Airbus, and the 737MAX.\nOverall, we expect Q3 orders to decrease sequentially due to the timing of Defense Program orders and COVID-related challenges in the Commercial business.\nFor Aerospace & Defense as a whole, we anticipate Q3 revenue to increase sequentially but decrease by 3% to 5% compared to last year.\nCommercial revenue is expected to decline by approximately 30% to 40% compared to last year, while Defense should increase by 12% to 17%.\nIt's worth noting that we're raising prices in both Defense and Commercial Aerospace sectors.\nWith carryover pricing from 2019 and new increases this year, we expect a net 4% price increase in Q3.\nThe price increases are primarily concentrated in the aftermarket.\nBefore concluding, I want to mention that we've made significant progress on the plans we announced last summer.\nAlthough the pandemic has significantly impacted our end markets, we've responded by accelerating and expanding many aspects of the plan, particularly in reducing structural costs and streamlining the company.\nWe've increased our commitment to new product launches in 2020 to 45, up from 40 in the original plan.\nPricing remains an important part of our strategy; due to the critical nature of our products, we've been able to raise prices this year in line with our original plan, despite recent market disruptions.\nIn summary, we're taking appropriate measures to navigate the current environment while continuing to execute our strategic plan.\nAs the market evolves, we'll continue to adapt to ensure we're positioned for success.\nI'd like to conclude by once again acknowledging our employees' unwavering dedication to our customers.\nWe remain committed to positioning CIRCOR for long-term growth, expanding margins, generating strong free cash flow, and reducing the company's debt.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Details about non-GAAP financial measures required by Regulation G can be found on WESCO's website at wesco.com.\nThis conference call recording will be available for replay over the next week.\nWESCO hopes everyone has been keeping safe and well during these difficult times.\nWe have prepared a comprehensive update to share with you today.\nI will begin with some opening comments, then Dave will review our Q2 results, followed by an update on the excellent progress of the Anixter integration and the tremendous value creation from combining WESCO and Anixter.\nLet me start by providing an update on our second quarter performance.\nOur results surpassed expectations across all key metrics including sales, margins, profits, EPS and free cash flow.\nBusiness momentum improved throughout the quarter as we outperformed the market and built a record backlog for WESCO's legacy business.\nSales increased sequentially each month, with continued growth in our utility segment.\nAnixter also delivered strong results to finish Q2.\nThis positive momentum has carried into Q3.\nWe're encouraged that quarter-to-date sales through day 28 are down 8% year-over-year but up 11% sequentially, with a book-to-bill above 1.0.\nAs in past economic cycles, we aggressively managed costs and cash, achieving a 10% decremental margin and generating exceptionally strong free cash flow of $140 million, 250% of adjusted net income.\nWhile we took on debt to acquire Anixter, we expect our consistently strong counter-cyclical free cash flow to enable rapid deleveraging back to target levels within 3-6 months.\nRegarding Anixter, Q2 was a pivotal period as we successfully closed our industry-transforming merger.\nBy combining two leading Fortune 500 companies with proven track records, we are creating the premier global electrical, communications and utility distribution and supply chain solutions provider.\nIn May, we completed a very successful $5 billion capital raise through bonds and bank debt on favorable terms.\nWe satisfied the final closing condition when the Canadian Competition Bureau waiting period expired on June 18th, allowing us to close the Anixter transaction on June 22nd.\nThis met our commitment to close in Q2 or Q3.\nDespite challenges from the pandemic, the extraordinary efforts of WESCO and Anixter associates to execute a flawless day one closing just 5 months after signing was very impressive.\nI'm extremely proud and appreciative of the entire team's extraordinary work in achieving this milestone.\nAs mentioned previously, we've been executing detailed integration planning for several months.\nNow our focus shifts to execution and realizing synergies.\nI'm pleased to report we're off to an excellent start integrating the businesses in our first 6 weeks, having already completed actions to deliver over 50% of our $68 million year one cost synergy target.\nWe've also begun realizing initial sales synergies by leveraging our expanded global footprint and cross-selling our broader portfolio.\nThe strong cultural alignment between WESCO and Anixter is proving key to our early success.\nWe're building on these initial wins and remain highly confident in capturing the significant upside potential and exceeding our 3-year targets for cost savings, sales growth, margin expansion and cash generation synergies.\nDave will now review our Q2 results and discuss our integration execution and synergy capture plans in more detail.\nI'll start with an overview of Q2 results on page 4.\nThis slide shows our Q2 results, walking from reported GAAP numbers to legacy WESCO results.\nThe left column shows reported GAAP figures. The next columns show adjustments to remove transaction impacts.\nThe third column subtracts merger-related adjustments to show underlying results adjusted for all deal costs and activities.\nThe right columns break out the Anixter and WESCO components of the adjusted results.\nReported sales fell 3% and organic sales fell 12% due to lower COVID-19 related demand.\nI'll review sales in more detail shortly.\nLegacy WESCO generated about $70 million in operating profit, down $28 million year-over-year on a $285 million sales decline, representing a 10% decremental margin.\nSG&A decreased $33 million year-over-year due to COVID cost actions and lower volume.\nLegacy WESCO adjusted operating margin was 3.8% and adjusted EPS was $1.04.\nLegacy Anixter's adjusted results for the period after closing had 20.3% gross margin and 8.3% operating margin.\nThis exceptional performance was driven by strong Anixter sales in the 9 days of Q2 ownership, continued gross margin expansion, and Anixter's COVID-19 cost reduction efforts.\nOn an adjusted basis, the combined WESCO-Anixter business achieved 4.2% operating margin and $1.36 diluted EPS.\nBriefly on merger adjustments - the $73 million of SG&A primarily represents banking, legal and integration management fees.\nWe also recognized a one-time expense for change of control provisions.\nBelow operating profit, there was $45 million in interest expense from the new bonds and unamortized financing fees.\nWe also recognized just over $1 million in preferred dividend expense related to the preferred stock consideration for Anixter shareholders.\nWe'll provide a detailed Anixter acquisition update later, as we've made substantial integration and synergy progress.\nTurning to slide 5, this shows organic sales growth by end market and geography for legacy WESCO, excluding Anixter.\nOn the right, monthly organic sales in Q2 were down 16%, 10% and 13% year-over-year in April, May and June respectively.\nAs John noted, sales improved sequentially through Q2 on a same workday basis, with April down 13%, followed by 9% and 5% increases in May and June.\nCurrency effects reduced growth by 90 basis points, mainly due to unfavorable Canadian dollar rates.\nBy geography, the U.S. (75% of legacy WESCO revenue) was down 12% organically.\nCanada was down 17% organically.\nBoth U.S. and Canada declines were driven by industrial and construction weakness, as many projects were delayed starting in March.\nU.S. industrial sales fell 21% organically and Canada fell 22%, reflecting broad COVID-19 impacts across verticals we serve.\nHowever, bidding and project activity remained strong, with several industrial markets improving sequentially from Q1.\nU.S. construction sales decreased 16% and Canada fell 21%, reflecting COVID-19 project delays.\nLegacy WESCO backlog reached a new company record, up 17% year-over-year and 4% sequentially from Q1.\nConsistent with April trends, construction projects have been delayed rather than canceled.\nUtility sales remained exceptionally strong, with U.S. up 6% organically and Canada up 36%.\nSequentially, U.S. utility sales rose 8% and Canada utility sales rose 27% versus Q1.\nThis marks our 12th straight quarter of organic growth in the U.S. utility business.\nCommercial, institutional and government (CIG) organic sales ended down about 5% for the quarter.\nThe market segment demonstrated positive growth during the quarter, with sales increasing 13% and 11% consecutively from Q1 in the United States and Canada, respectively.\nData center construction, security, and cloud computing initiatives with major technology clients continue to offer substantial opportunities for sales expansion.\nLet me briefly remind you about our liquidity and some aspects of our new credit facilities that we finalized in June, as they enable us to address challenges related to the economic impact of COVID-19.\nOur liquidity, consisting of invested cash and available credit from our bank facilities, remains robust at $819 million.\nWe've kept an adequate cash balance of $265 million on our books.\nRevenue collection throughout the quarter and into August has met or surpassed historical patterns.\nBad debt provisions are also in line with historical norms.\nAs part of closing the Anixter merger, we issued new senior unsecured notes totaling about $2.8 billion, partly used to refinance Anixter's 2021, 2023, and 2025 notes.\nWe also established a new $1.1 billion ABL facility and increased the AR facility commitment to $1.025 billion in June.\nOur bank credit facilities are low-cost LIBOR-based agreements maturing in June 2023 and 2025.\nWe anticipated our fixed-to-variable rate debt ratio to be roughly 70% at closing, and it ended up at 72% by the end of June.\nOur credit facilities have minimal operating covenants, and we easily surpassed certain liquidity thresholds used to measure compliance by a significant margin.\nHaving finalized the Anixter merger, our capital allocation priority will be to support integration, organic sales growth opportunities, and rapidly reduce debt.\nWe don't plan to use any remaining amounts available under our Board-authorized share repurchase program expiring on December 31st this year.\nAllow me to summarize our priorities for the second half.\nOur primary focus is to build upon the improving sales momentum we experienced this quarter.\nDespite challenges in certain markets during Q2, we capitalized on growing momentum within our business and are well-positioned to leverage our extensive portfolio of products and services to drive sales ahead of the market.\nWe will maintain our cost discipline to meet or exceed the $50 million in cost savings generated by the actions we took in April in response to COVID-19.\nWe plan to reinstate full compensation on October 1st for legacy WESCO employees that was temporarily reduced between 12% and 25% effective May 1st.\nWe will implement Anixter's gross margin improvement programs across the legacy WESCO business, which enabled Anixter to achieve seven consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement.\nWe will continue to swiftly execute our integration plan and deliver the year-one merger synergies with high confidence of achieving substantial upside.\nAs we generate cash, our priority will be to reduce debt in line with our goal of returning to our target leverage of 2 to 3.5 times debt to adjusted EBITDA within 36 months after closing the transaction.\nStarting in the third quarter, we will begin reporting results for the three strategic business units announced as part of our new organizational structure in early June.\nI'd like to emphasize again the exceptional value creation that our transformational combination of WESCO and Anixter will produce.\nThere are seven key points regarding this industry-shaping merger.\nFirst, the merger is a transformational combination that establishes the industry leader in electrical, communications, and utility distribution and supply chain services.\nSecond, the combined company benefits from a significant increase in scale and capabilities in what remains a highly fragmented electrical and communications distribution sector.\nTogether, we're the industry leader in North America with approximately $17 billion in sales revenues and over $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA on a pro forma basis, including the identified cost synergies.\nThird, the two businesses complement each other well in terms of products, industries, and geographies, allowing us to offer more products to more customers in more locations globally, and more importantly, accelerate our sales growth by over 100 basis points compared to standalone projections.\nThis is an extraordinary combination of two successful companies, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\nFourth, we're implementing an integration plan to deliver well over $200 million in cost synergies.\nAs mentioned earlier, we're off to an excellent start, just six weeks after closing this acquisition in late June.\nDave will provide more details on our notable progress shortly.\nFifth, the financial benefits of this combination will be exceptional.\nWe expect our earnings per share growth rate to double and adjusted EBITDA margins to expand by more than 100 basis points through the cost synergies I just mentioned.\nSixth, both companies have highly resilient business models that generate substantial free cash flow throughout all phases of the economic cycle.\nThe combined company is projected to generate free cash flow exceeding $600 million annually by year three, which we expect will enable rapid deleveraging to within our target range within 36 months, as well as provide future capital deployment options to drive value creation.\nLastly, the collective WESCO and Anixter management teams are results-oriented and intensely focused on driving an efficient integration and generating these synergies to create substantial value.\nIn conclusion, with Anixter, the new WESCO will capitalize on the accelerating trends of electrification, increased bandwidth demand driven by higher voice, data, video, and mobile usage, and the digitization of our B2B value chain.\nWe are more optimistic than ever about the substantial value creation that this transformational combination will bring for our customers, supplier partners, employees, investors, and the communities we serve.\nNow, I'll hand it back to Dave to provide additional details on the excellent progress we're making on the Anixter integration.\nThe increased scale that this merger creates is evident.\nIt combines two highly complementary companies.\nMerging them benefits our customers and creates value through significant cross-selling opportunities, premier supply chain services, acceleration of our digital initiatives, and improved operational and supply chain efficiencies.\nOn a trailing 12-month basis through June 30th, the business generated revenue of approximately $17 billion and adjusted EBITDA of over $1 billion on a pro forma basis, including the $200 million of cost synergies we are confident we will deliver.\nThe North American electrical distribution industry is vast and highly fragmented, with an estimated total size of $114 billion per year.\nFollowing the merger, the Company has a market share of approximately 13%.\nEven after this merger, the market remains highly fragmented and offers substantial opportunities for accelerated organic growth.\nBoth WESCO and Anixter have invested in supply chain services to differentiate our overall customer value proposition.\nThe combination of these two companies not only increases our overall scale but also enhances our ability to better serve our customers through an expanded product and services portfolio.\nAs we look to the future of the combined enterprise, there are numerous ongoing and attractive secular trends and growth opportunities.\nThe demand for increased bandwidth driven by higher voice, data, video, and mobile usage, greater connectivity needs for remote work, home, and school applications, and the increasing electrification of our infrastructure are just a few of the growing secular trends that align directly with the core capabilities of our combined business.\nThe financial benefits of this transformational combination are outlined on the right side of this page.\nWe are highly confident in exceeding our three-year cost savings, sales growth, and cash generation synergy targets communicated earlier this year.\nDespite the challenging economic cycle we're facing in the near term, this strategic combination remains compelling, as we're doubling the size of our Company and will transform the new enterprise through execution of the integration plan and delivery of these synergies.\nWe are focused on leading and exceeding the commitments we made to our investors when we announced the merger in mid-January.\nWe raised approximately $5 billion in bank and bond debt with favorable terms, and the bond offerings were substantially oversubscribed.\nWe closed the transaction near the end of Q2, in line with our initial commitments to close in Q2 or Q3.\nWe increased our liquidity to more than $800 million as of the end of Q2.\nWe are rapidly executing our integration plan and have already completed actions to deliver over 50% of our year one cost savings target of $68 million.\nWe're already generating sales synergies from the merger that are in addition to the minimum $200 million of cost synergies that we expect to generate.\nOur primary objective is to implement a meticulous and systematic integration process that achieves our promised synergies and potential benefits, while incorporating the strongest aspects of each organization.\nOur planning has focused on three main goals: ensuring a smooth transition on Day 1 and the initial 100 days after closing, realizing the benefits of the merger through cost savings and revenue growth, and establishing an innovative operating model for the new company.\nTeams consisting of about 150 employees from both original companies have identified over 500 initiatives and 2,500 milestones to merge the best elements of our two organizations.\nWe are working on six key areas in our integration planning and execution: commercial, digital and IT, supply chain, operations, marketing, and corporate functions.\nWe recognize the crucial role that corporate culture plays in the success of this merger.\nWe conducted a comprehensive survey of all employees to identify the key cultural attributes and are developing a strategy to combine the best aspects of both companies.\nThe high level of cooperation among these teams has been remarkable and highlights the strong cultural alignment between the two organizations.\nWe are seizing the opportunity to leverage the best talent and ideas from two successful companies as we create a new world-class enterprise.\nThis slide showcases our progress towards the three main integration objectives outlined previously.\nWe successfully achieved our first priority of executing a flawless Day 1.\nOur teams have spent months preparing for Day 1, which I'm pleased to report was highly successful.\nWe implemented a detailed plan to communicate with our customers and suppliers, update our 18,900 colleagues, and held multiple town hall events for employees to meet our new management team.\nOur second critical goal is to complete all of our master planning and value capture initiatives.\nHaving already achieved more than half of our year one target of $68 million in run rate synergies, we're on track to surpass this goal.\nWe have set commercial targets for sales growth, margin improvement, and cash flow, and are already seeing success with our initial cross-sell pilot programs.\nOur final critical objective is to build a new world-class company.\nWe have announced our three strategic business units and the top two levels of our senior management team.\nThis page details the breakdown and expected timing of our synergies.\nOf the 45% that is corporate and administrative, about two-thirds will come from eliminating redundant general and administrative costs, and one-third from corporate overhead.\nOf the 55% that will be generated from supply chain and field operations, the majority will come from supply chain efficiencies.\nThe field operations estimate includes consolidating both companies' branch networks.\nApproximately two-thirds of WESCO and Anixter facilities in the U.S. are within 20 miles of each other.\nAdditionally, with the combined $14 billion in total cost of goods, we have identified over $70 million in supply chain-related synergies.\nBoth the supply chain and field operation synergies are expected to begin in year one, but most of these opportunities will be realized in years two and three.\nWe are confident in achieving these synergies and believe they can be realized efficiently with minimal disruption to our day-to-day operations.\nTo date, we have already implemented more than 30 unique initiatives across the four synergy types, resulting in over $35 million of run rate synergies.\nWe have eliminated redundant public company related expenses of about $7 million, as well as C-suite and other duplicate roles that provide an additional $20 million in savings.\nBoth WESCO and Anixter have strong track records of generating free cash flow throughout economic cycles.\nOver the past five years, the combined business has generated an average of $370 million in free cash flow.\nWith earnings growth and cost synergies, we expect the annual cash generation of the combined company to increase to over $600 million per year by year three.\nThis includes $75 million in free cash flow through the release of working capital.\nThe strong free cash flow and earnings growth will enable us to rapidly reduce our debt.\nOur debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5.7 times as of June 30th, 2020.\nIncluding year one synergies of $68 million, our leverage ratio was 5.3 times.\nWe expect to return to our target leverage range of 2 to 3.5 times net debt to EBITDA within 36 months.\nBoth WESCO and Anixter benefit from several factors that make our Company highly resilient to economic cycles.\nFirst, our cash flow is counter-cyclical as we release working capital during downturns.\nSecond, our cost structure allows for quick adjustments in response to changing demand levels.\nThird, we have minimal required capital expenditures given the nature of our business model.\nOver the past 10 years, WESCO and Anixter's capital expenditures have averaged less than 0.5% of sales.\nIn the current environment, this resilience is enhanced by WESCO and Anixter's high degree of diversification by customer, supplier, end market, and geography.\nBoth WESCO and Anixter have proven abilities to reduce debt through economic cycles, as they both did from 2007 to 2011, when their net leverage was reduced to below two turns as a combined $1.9 billion of free cash flow was generated.\nAdditionally, both companies have demonstrated the ability to use their cash flow to rapidly pay down debt following major acquisitions.\nWESCO reduced leverage from 4.5 turns to 2.7 turns following the acquisition of EECOL in 2012.\nAnixter reduced leverage from 4.1 turns to 2.8 turns in the two years following its acquisition of HD Power Solutions in 2015.\nThis quarter exemplified our strong counter-cyclical free cash flow, as the combined company generated $142 million in free cash flow, or approximately 248% of adjusted net income.\nWe closed the merger on June 22, 2020, as the waiting period for the Competition Bureau expired on June 18, 2020.\nUnder the agreement terms, WESCO agreed to divest its legacy Utility and Datacom businesses in Canada.\nThis includes the utility businesses of Brews, Trydor, and LaPrairie acquired previously.\nCombined, the WESCO Canadian Utility and Datacom businesses represent about $150 million in sales, or less than 1% of the combined organization's revenue.\nThe divestitures will not impact the overall value creation opportunity of this merger.\nWe took quick and decisive actions in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe will continue to aggressively manage our business, as we have done in previous economic cycles, and respond to this crisis as needed.\nJust five months after announcing the Anixter agreement in January, we completed a very successful and oversubscribed capital raise in May, and then successfully closed the Anixter merger on June 22nd.\nNotably, all of this was accomplished against the COVID-19 backdrop.\nAs mentioned earlier, integration is off to an excellent start and execution is accelerating.\nWe expect to exceed our targets for cost savings, sales growth, margin expansion, and cash generation synergies, and deliver substantial value creation associated with this transformational combination.\nThis marks the beginning of a new era for WESCO.\nAs an industry leader, we are now larger and more diversified with differentiated scale and capabilities in a highly fragmented industry.\nAs a result, we are exceptionally well positioned to lead not only a digital transformation of our business, but also of our industry.\nOverall, we are doing what we said we would do, and we will continue to provide transparent updates on our progress versus our plan and commitments.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Ocwen's CEO Glen Messina and CFO June Campbell will be speaking during the conference call.\nIt's important to keep this uncertainty in mind when evaluating these statements and not place excessive trust in them.\nWe think these alternative financial measures offer a valuable complement to discussions about our financial status and provide a different perspective on certain aspects of our operations that is informative.\nAlternative financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a replacement for, the company's reported results under standard U.S. accounting principles.\nLet's begin by reviewing some key points from the third quarter.\nI'm very impressed with our team's achievements and greatly appreciate their dedication.\nWe reported robust GAAP net income and adjusted pre-tax income, with our ROE surpassing projections primarily due to strong revenue performance.\nThis demonstrates the significant operational leverage within our business model.\nWe've now had positive adjusted pre-tax income for eight consecutive quarters.\nOur team continues to perform well in meeting our operational goals, with strong growth in originations and servicing additions, along with solid operational execution and performance.\nWe're ahead of schedule in our cost reduction efforts.\nWe completed our planned call rights transaction for the third quarter and have utilized over half of MAM's investment commitment.\nWe reached some important milestones in October as well.\nIn October, we finalized our acquisition of the RMS reverse mortgage servicing platform.\nAdditionally in October, I'm happy to report that we exceeded our recapture rate target.\nWe're making steady progress on our initiatives to broaden our addressable market.\nWe're expanding into higher-margin channels, services, and products, giving us strong momentum, and the RMS platform acquisition provides access to a potential $86 billion reverse mortgage subservicing market, presenting an exciting new growth opportunity for us.\nLastly, we continue to navigate a changeable and unpredictable environment, which I'll discuss further later.\nOur originations division once again delivered strong performance in meeting our operational objectives.\nWe closed $20 billion in total servicing additions during the third quarter, with particularly strong performance in subservicing additions.\nFollowing the TCB acquisition, our correspondent volume doubled compared to the previous quarter.\nThe TCB team has made an excellent start, and I'm delighted to have them on board and appreciate their contributions to the business.\nWe're seeing great outcomes from our efforts to expand subservicing.\nWe secured $20 billion in new contracts and expect this volume to start boarding in the fourth quarter.\nOur subservicing pipeline is at an all-time high.\nOur top 10 prospects represent about $63 billion in potential business, and our total prospect pipeline has grown to slightly over $200 billion.\nWe're excited about this level of activity and believe we offer a very compelling value proposition.\nI'll elaborate on our subservicing value proposition a bit later.\nOur enterprise sales approach and the TCP acquisition have enabled us to expand our seller base to 700 by the end of Q3.\nThis is approximately 2.5 times higher than the third quarter of last year, and we continue to grow.\nWe launched our Nondelegated and Best Efforts delivery services as planned, and we're seeing steady adoption.\nOur Ginnie Mae product mix is improving, now accounting for about 10% of total originations, excluding co-issue, though we're still well below the industry average for Ginnie Mae.\nI believe we have room for improvement in this area.\nWe recently attended the Mortgage Bankers Association Annual Convention, where client attendance at our meeting room exceeded our expectations, and the response to our team's quality and operational execution was very positive.\nWe look forward to serving these clients and supporting new ones as we expand our addressable market.\nOur Consumer Direct team continues to improve recapture performance.\nWe saw a slight decline in the third quarter compared to the second quarter due to accelerated runoff in select client portfolios.\nHowever, we saw a strong recovery in October with a refinance recapture rate of 36%, which is a milestone for us and a huge congratulations to our recapture team.\nWe believe we're on track to meet our 30% refinance recapture rate objectives in the fourth quarter.\nOverall, our originations team is making excellent progress towards their objectives for this year, and they're energized for the fourth quarter and for 2022.\nThe team continues to make strong progress in growing higher-margin products, channels, and services.\nThese actions help us expand our addressable market and mitigate margin pressure as industry buying volumes contract.\nYear-over-year, consumer direct volume in both forward and reverse mortgages is up 61%, with both segments achieving record retail funding and lock volumes in October.\nThe marketing eligible population for our forward recapture business increased by about 43% from the second to the third quarter.\nWe now have approximately 174,000 loans where borrowers could save $100 or more per month by refinancing, and our team will focus on helping these borrowers.\nTotal reverse originations were up 86% year-over-year.\nThe team is executing very well.\nOur reverse market share has increased from 6.5% in the third quarter of 2020 to 7% in the third quarter of 2021, compared to about 4.2% in the third quarter of 2019.\nThis represents great progress by the team in growing our share and our business.\nIn forward correspondent lending, we have significant opportunity to grow our best efforts and non-delegated delivery services.\nOur team is focused on this area, and we've recently launched these services.\nCurrently, these services represent just a fraction of the levels seen across the industry generally.\nOur long-term goal is to increase best efforts and non-delegated services to roughly 25% to 30% of volume and about 40% to 50% of our gain on sale revenues.\nIn servicing, our key objectives are to continue improving cost efficiency and customer experience, and the team is performing exceptionally well.\nTo achieve these objectives, we're focusing on four key areas: technology, process simplification, scale, and portfolio composition.\nThe results so far have been positive.\nOverall, servicing operating costs have decreased by approximately 25% from third quarter 2020 levels, and we've already achieved our full year target for 2021.\nTechnology is a major driver for us, and our technology agenda focuses on three main areas: reducing costs, improving execution, and enhancing the customer experience.\nWe consider our efforts to enhance the experience of client borrowers and investors as vital components for achieving our long-term growth and retention objectives.\nLeveraging technology enables us to simultaneously reduce expenses and enhance operational efficiency.\nOur total servicing unpaid principal balance has grown by approximately 33% compared to the third quarter of 2020.\nPrime servicing now constitutes 70% of our total servicing unpaid principal balance.\nIncreasing the proportion of agency loans in our portfolio is leading to higher average loan balances and lower delinquency rates, both of which will improve our ratio of operating expenses to unpaid principal balance.\nWe believe our servicing platform offers significant operational leverage, and we're concentrating on expanding our scale by growing both our own servicing and subservicing operations.\nThe team continues to excel in multiple areas.\nOur average response time and call abandonment rate continue to surpass industry standards as reported by the Mortgage Bankers Association.\nOur average response time is significantly faster than the MBA average, and our abandonment rates are approximately half the industry norm.\nWe remain intensely focused on assisting borrowers who are exiting forbearance and helping them understand their options.\nWe believe the optimal outcome for both homeowners and investors is to find a solution within investor guidelines that allows the consumer to retain their home.\nIn this respect, we have outperformed the industry, as reported by the MBA, in terms of the percentage of borrowers with an agency loan who exit forbearance with either a reinstatement or loss mitigation plan in place.\nFrom September 2020 to June 2021, approximately 93% of our borrowers who exited forbearance had either reinstated their loan or implemented a loss mitigation plan, compared to the industry average of 83%.\nThis means that only about 7% of our borrowers on forbearance have exited without a reinstatement plan or loss mitigation solution, compared to over 17% for the industry.\nAccording to MBA data, we're providing 20% more loss mitigation solutions for homeowners compared to the industry average.\nThis performance demonstrates how our servicing capabilities deliver superior results for both homeowners and investors.\nOur Net Promoter Score has increased by 6 points compared to the third quarter of 2020, despite onboarding over 280,000 loans onto our servicing platform and helping more than 4,700 borrowers exit forbearance during the third quarter.\nIt's noteworthy that Moody's and S&P upgraded our servicer quality assessment as Master servicer, and along with Fitch, all three agencies affirmed our servicer ratings.\nThe rating agencies highlighted several key strengths, including our reporting and remitting processes, proactive servicer oversight in master servicing, management and organization, industry experience, multiple levels of internal controls, our diligent response to the pandemic, and our comprehensive risk and compliance management framework.\nWe've made significant efforts to diversify our servicing revenue streams over the past two years.\nWe've focused on expanding our own servicing, growing our subservicing business, and capitalizing on ancillary or intrinsic revenue streams in our operations, such as Ginnie Mae EBO gains and call right opportunities.\nThese efforts have been successful, as the percentage of our servicing revenue derived from the NRZ subservicing agreement has been reduced by more than half.\nThis agreement now accounts for just 17% of our revenues.\nIn terms of loan count, NRZ loans now represent 33% of the total, down from 54% in the third quarter of last year, and these loans comprise about two-thirds (67%) of our total non-performing loans as of the third quarter of 2021.\nEBOs and call rights continue to present opportunities for us.\nWe completed our planned call rights transaction in the third quarter, involving seven deals, and we're satisfied with the results.\nAs of the third quarter of 2021, we owned call rights on approximately 121 deals.\nWe estimate that the near-term opportunity for potentially actionable call rights is about 30 to 40 deals.\nThe market demand for seasoned non-agency loans remains strong, with sustained activity from other legacy non-agency servicers.\nRegarding our previously announced fourth quarter transaction, we received a request from the trustee Deutsche Bank to pause the cleanup calls.\nThey wanted to verify that the call price met the requirements of the underlying Pooling and Servicing Agreements (PSAs).\nWe believe our calculated call price aligns with the applicable PSAs, our historical interactions with Deutsche Bank and relevant third parties, and established industry practices.\nWe plan to cooperate with Deutsche Bank in their analysis, including if they choose to seek input from a court of competent jurisdiction.\nIn the meantime, we have agreed to pause our calls to allow this analysis to proceed.\nConcerning EBOs, we've realized $12.3 million in EBO gains year-to-date through the third quarter.\nAs loans emerge from forbearance, we anticipate an increase in EBO activity as loans are modified throughout 2022.\nWe believe we've developed a top-tier servicing platform for both performing and special servicing, with capacity for growth that can offer compelling value to existing and potential clients.\nDuring 2020 and 2021, we conducted a comprehensive review of our platform and capabilities against what we believe are client expectations.\nBased on this assessment, we believe our platform delivers best-practice performance levels for clients across six key areas of performance.\nThese include competency, prioritizing the client, customer-centricity, technology-enabled capabilities, a well-staffed bank-grade risk and compliance model, and a strong value-based culture that underpins all our activities.\nWe've invested in various borrower and client-facing technologies to address the needs of clients and consumers, streamline our operations, and enhance the ability for consumer and client self-service.\nWe can offer rapid onboarding and responsive service to our clients and consumers.\nAs we discussed on Pages 7 and 8, we deliver industry-leading operational performance.\nWe believe our operations can provide superior total cost and service-level performance compared to our competitors.\nOur investments in our platform have been rewarded.\nWe've secured $28 billion of subservicing additions in the past 12 months.\nWe obtained $20 billion in new awards in the third quarter, and we have a $63 billion opportunity with our top 10 prospects and a potential prospect pipeline of $200 billion and growing.\nWith the acquisition of RMS, we are positioned to enter the $86 billion reverse mortgage servicing market once the integration is complete.\nWhile these opportunities typically have a longer sales cycle, I'm very optimistic about our prospects in this area.\nOverall, this year's industry volume levels continue to be robust compared to historical levels for both forward and reverse mortgages.\nWe've experienced significant interest rate volatility in August.\nThe 10-year Treasury rate was trading at 117 basis points.\nBy the end of the quarter, it had risen to 153 basis points.\nIt's now in the high 140s, demonstrating continued volatility.\nWe're observing non-parallel interest rate movements, mortgage to Treasury spread compression, and discount margin volatility in reverse mortgages as well.\nOur hedging program doesn't cover these risks, and we felt the effects of this in the third quarter.\nJune will provide more details on this later.\nThe consensus industry forecast predicts rising rates and approximately a 28% average reduction in industry origination volumes.\nThis forecast is based on the combined projections of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Mortgage Bankers Association.\nHowever, the projected volume levels for 2022 are still relatively high compared to historical levels, especially when considering the 2018-2019 period.\nEndorsement volume for reverse mortgages remained robust and is predicted to stay strong compared to the previous year.\nIn a shrinking market, we anticipate ongoing pressure on origination margins until excess industry capacity can be eliminated.\nHowever, margins remained relatively stable during the third quarter.\nAs interest rates rise, we expect increased profitability in servicing and higher MSR values due to decreased payoffs and portfolio runoff.\nWe also anticipate potential M&A and bulk purchase opportunities may arise as market participants consider exiting the contracting origination market.\nAdditionally, we expect the agencies to expand their buy box slightly with higher loan limits and increased support for first-time and low to moderate-income buyers.\nTo navigate the changing environment, we're concentrating on several straightforward strategies: responsible growth by expanding our client base, products, services, and addressable markets.\nWe aim to continue delivering top-tier operating performance to provide superior value to clients, investors, and consumers, offering a service experience that fulfills our commitments, enhancing our competitiveness through scale and low costs, aggressively pursuing subservicing opportunities, and expanding into reverse subservicing.\nFinally, we'll continue to be cautious with bulk purchases through MAV and M&A opportunities to increase scale and capabilities.\nYou're now familiar with our primary operating goals for 2021, and we're making good progress towards achieving our targets.\nWe believe we have strong momentum in all five categories.\nOur key operating objective framework will remain unchanged for 2022.\nWe're aiming to add over $100 billion in total owned servicing and subservicing.\nOur goal is to maintain recapture rates above 30% with the long-term objective of reaching industry-best practice levels by investor type.\nOngoing cost and process improvement is integral to our approach, and we're working on improving base cost and variable cost productivity to maintain our competitiveness.\nWe're targeting approximately another 1-basis-point reduction in servicing and overhead operating expenses as a percentage of UPB from third quarter 2021 levels.\nDelivering industry-leading operational execution and fulfilling our commitments to clients, borrowers, and investors is a crucial part of our value proposition.\nThis will continue to be a priority for us in 2022 and beyond.\nFor 2022, we're targeting about 50% growth in subservicing additions and capitalizing on embedded EBO and call rights income to diversify and increase our revenue.\nIn line with our operating objectives this year, we continue to target low double-digit to mid-teen after-tax operating ROEs in 2022.\nWe reported $37 million in adjusted pre-tax income and a 32% adjusted pre-tax ROE.\nThis marks the eighth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted pre-tax income.\nNet income for the quarter was $22 million, including $27 million in unfavorable notables, primarily due to MSR fair value changes from higher actual prepayments than modeled, negative effects of basis risk, partially offset by higher market interest rates net of hedging.\nWe achieved a 19% after-tax GAAP ROE, surpassing our low double-digit to mid-teen guidance.\nOur earnings per share was $2.35, more than doubling analyst consensus.\nThe top right bar chart shows that we're meeting our growth objectives and cost leadership goals.\nRevenue increased by 38% year over year, mainly due to higher servicing fees on an additional $66 billion in UPB and executing call right transactions.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of average UPB improved year over year, despite absorbing costs to maintain capacity for new bulk volume reported in August and September, incurring temporary interim subservicing expenses on MSR bulk acquisitions, and carrying excess costs during the foreclosure moratorium and in anticipation of borrower needs.\nEquity rose to $470 million, and book value per share increased by $2 to $51 per share.\nThis slide demonstrates that our balanced business model is performing well, with originations growth replenishing our servicing portfolio more than offsetting runoff.\nThe replenishment rate for the quarter was 170%.\nThe left side of the slide shows that volume has increased across all channels, approximately 77% compared to the same quarter last year.\nAdjusted pre-tax income was affected by lower revaluation gains on MSR cash window and flow purchases, as well as expected margin normalization.\nThe margins graph shows that Consumer Direct margins increased slightly compared to last quarter but were lower than this time last year.\nMix-adjusted correspondent lending margins remained relatively stable compared to last quarter.\nThe adjustment in second quarter correspondent margins is attributed to gains recognized on certain loans acquired under favorable circumstances, resulting in higher than average market margins for these loans.\nAfter adjusting for these loans, second quarter margins were consistent with the first quarter at approximately 12 basis points.\nAs Glen mentioned, we're expanding higher-margin products, channels, and services, which we believe will help mitigate margin pressure as industry volume levels contract.\nThe right side of the slide shows the results of building scale in our Servicing segment.\nThird quarter total servicing UPB is $248 billion, a $62 billion increase over the third quarter of 2020.\nThe Subservicing plus NAV UPB doubled year over year, largely replacing the NRZ UPB decline.\nNRZ UPB concentration decreased from 46% to 24% year over year.\nWe expect this trend to accelerate as we grow subservicing for other clients in NAV.\nServicing adjusted pre-tax income of $41 million was primarily driven by higher servicing fees from increased UPB, expanding servicing revenue with approximately $23 million in call right gains, and cost leadership.\nAs shown earlier, servicing operating costs have decreased by 3 basis points year over year, and we anticipate continued improvement, which will be illustrated on the next slide.\nThis is our road map page.\nWe stated last quarter that we were positioned for a significant improvement in profitability in the second half of the year, and we delivered on this in the third quarter with GAAP earnings and a 19% ROE.\nThis is our operating framework for 2022, assuming a stable interest rate environment and no adverse changes in market conditions or the legal and regulatory environment.\nThe page is organized by our operating objectives in the origination, servicing, and corporate segments.\nI'll provide a few highlights, but please let me know if any of you want to review in more detail separately, and I'd be happy to do so.\nWe reflect the full quarterly impact from the bulk transactions closed in June that we discussed last quarter.\nFlow MSR volume was redirected to MAV in the third quarter, and we continue to grow performing subservicing, resulting in a mix shift to higher-margin consumer direct and reverse channels.\nWe expect EBO, call rights, and other revenue diversification in the range of $20 million to $25 million, and the segments continue to achieve productivity targets.\nTo conclude, we had an excellent quarter and delivered strong financial performance.\nI'm proud of the team's execution, and we're excited about the opportunities ahead.\nWe're demonstrating a solid track record of delivering on our operational and financial commitments and continued development of our balanced and diversified business model.\nWe're focused on a few straightforward strategies to navigate this dynamic market environment: prudent growth by expanding our client base, products, and services to expand addressable markets.\nWe aim to provide superior value to clients, investors, and consumers through best-in-class operating performance, delivering a service experience that fulfills our commitments, and enhancing our competitiveness through scale and low costs.\nI'm proud of our team's accomplishments in the third quarter and very appreciative of all their efforts.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Accompanying me on the call are George Oliver, Johnson Controls' Chairman and CEO, and Olivier Leonetti, our CFO.\nWhen discussing our results, adjusted earnings per share, EBITA and EBIT figures exclude restructuring, integration and other special costs.\nAll year-over-year comparisons are based on continuing operations.\nI'll begin with a brief review of 2021 and update on our long-term strategic goals.\nOlivier will provide a detailed analysis of our Q4 performance and outline our fiscal 2022 guidance.\nLet's begin with slide three.\nWe concluded fiscal 2021 with another quarter of strong financial results, fulfilling or surpassing all of our initial commitments for the year, despite a much more challenging environment than anticipated.\nOur ability to achieve these results while managing unprecedented inflation and supply chain issues demonstrates the operational discipline and flexibility shown across the organization.\nI'm deeply appreciative of the entire Johnson Controls team's efforts.\nDespite external challenges, demand in our end markets remains robust.\nStrong retrofit activity and increasing new nonresidential construction signal positive future demand trends.\nThis is reflected in our growing order books and record backlog.\nWe maintain focus on the bigger picture, advancing with bold new initiatives, redoubling our efforts with ambitious ESG goals set earlier this year, and launching a major new productivity program aimed at significantly improving profitability.\nRecently, at our September Investor Day, we announced new three-year financial targets.\nWe made significant strides in advancing our growth strategy, expanding our OpenBlue digital platform, introducing eight major new offerings, and greatly broadening our partner ecosystem, investing in refreshing our product line, concentrating on accelerating service growth and improving our attachment rate.\nWe're capitalizing on strong trends in healthy buildings, decarbonization, and smart connected equipment and buildings.\nAs markets continue to recover and these trends expand globally, I'm confident we're uniquely positioned competitively to continue outperforming.\nBeyond strong financial results and strategic progress, we've maintained ESG leadership, including advancements toward our 2025 sustainability goals and new ESG commitments.\nWhile not exhaustive, I'm extremely proud of our team's accomplishments this past year.\nWe're committed to net zero, pledging to reduce emissions in our operations and those of our customers.\nOur science-based targets have received approval.\nOur leadership team is aligned on governance, and we're extending our sustainable financing leadership.\nI'm heading to COP26 in Glasgow tomorrow.\nWe've made significant progress in highlighting that buildings account for about 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions, emphasizing that addressing climate change requires substantial investment in buildings.\nGovernments are now acting on this, allocating billions for building upgrades.\nJohnson Controls is ideally positioned to provide these solutions.\nAt COP26, I'll meet with government and business leaders to build momentum and ensure action.\nMoving to slide five, I'd like to highlight several new strategic developments from the quarter.\nWe recently signed an MOU with technology leaders Accenture and Alibaba to address sustainable infrastructure needs.\nThis collaboration targets an estimated multi-billion dollar market for digital solutions in China's data centers.\nWe also signed a key technology agreement with Tempered Networks, building on recent cybersecurity partnerships with Pelion and DigiCert.\nThese partnerships embed crucial trust, security, and operational capabilities into our OpenBlue platform and connected devices.\nThese elements differentiate our offerings and help safeguard our customers' operations and data.\nTempered brings industry-leading zero-trust secure network capabilities, boosting customer confidence and accelerating OpenBlue services adoption.\nOur partnerships with UL, Safe Traces, and Phylagen exemplify our innovation in extending Healthy Buildings leadership, offering new indoor environmental quality solutions for our customers' pressing challenges.\nWe're currently focusing on the education sector, where there's a clear need to help customers optimize investments.\nWith an estimated $195 billion in government stimulus for K-12 spending, this presents a significant opportunity.\nWe also entered an exclusive joint development agreement and investment with Phylagen, a biotech leader in indoor bacteria and virus identification.\nOur work with Phylagen demonstrates our commitment to developing cutting-edge capabilities for healthy buildings.\nAt our Investor Day, we outlined three pillars for above-market growth over the next three years and beyond.\nOne pillar involves gaining market share through innovative product development centered on digital and sustainability.\nAs planned, we launched over 150 new products in fiscal 2021 across most business units, resulting in continued market share gains in Q4 and the full year.\nFor 2022, we're well-positioned to gain share with 175 new products across four main categories: sustainability, smart buildings, digital, and residential, with heat pumps central to our product strategy.\nThese represent just a sample of expected launches in the next 90 days, with a robust pipeline to follow.\nTurning to slide seven, service is central to our operations.\nOver the past 18 months, we've strengthened our market-leading capabilities to position ourselves for changing industry demographics and evolving digital technologies enabling outcome-based solution models.\nLast year, we began outlining plans to accelerate service growth to a couple points above market levels, partly by increasing our attachment rate through our large installed base and digital business transformation.\nIn fiscal 2021, we saw early benefits from these efforts.\nWe ended the year with Q4 service revenues up 8%, showing high single-digit growth across all three regions in most business domains.\nFor the full year, service revenue grew 4%, which is 2-3 points higher than 2019 levels, despite a slow start due to lingering site access restrictions and unusual customer budget pressures.\nLooking forward, we anticipate service growth to accelerate throughout fiscal 2022, aligning with our objective to outperform the market.\nThe robust order activity observed in the latter half of the year reinforces this outlook.\nService orders increased by 7% in Q4 and, notably, showed low single-digit organic growth compared to 2019 levels.\nFurthermore, we enhanced our attach rate to roughly 40%.\nLet's move on to slide eight.\nOur growth vectors constitute the third pillar, which we estimate represents an additional market opportunity of $250 billion over the next ten years.\nWe possess a competitive edge across all three areas due to our unique portfolio.\nFrom a financial standpoint, we have considerably increased both revenue and orders in fiscal 2021.\nThis sets us up favorably for continued strong performance as we progress.\nOn slide nine, I'd like to showcase a significant customer win related to one of our key growth vectors.\nWe secured a Buildings as a Service project from a long-standing client, the University of North Dakota, in Q4.\nThis marks the second long-term Performance Infrastructure contract we've been awarded by this university in the past two years.\nIt utilizes not only our expertise in Performance Contracting but also incorporates the OpenBlue Enterprise Manager software.\nThe project's total contract value was nearly $220 million over its lifespan, with a smaller portion booked during the quarter.\nBefore handing over to Olivier, allow me to share some concluding thoughts.\nI remain highly optimistic about the demand patterns we're observing across most of our end markets and our teams' ability to capture more than our fair share of that demand.\nWe view this decade as one of the most promising for the smart building industry, which Johnson Controls is poised to lead.\nUnderlying momentum in our short-cycle businesses continues to improve despite challenges from ongoing supply chain and component availability constraints.\nOur longer-cycle install business, driven by the new buildings market, also shows signs of recovery, though extended lead times and inflation are causing delays in some investment decisions, particularly for larger projects.\nRetrofit activity remains a crucial driver of our business, and we see ample opportunity to capitalize on this activity going forward.\nThat being said, we are keenly aware of the macroeconomic backdrop, and our outlook does not assume any significant near-term improvements in supply chain conditions or inflation over the next couple of quarters.\nRegarding price/cost, given the progressive increase in inflation for almost all input costs throughout the year, we took decisive pricing and cost measures to stay ahead of the curve.\nI am confident we will continue to navigate these challenges effectively.\nAs we look towards fiscal 2022, our focus shifts to accelerating and demonstrating our growth capabilities.\nOur proven product technology leadership, now combined with OpenBlue, truly sets our customer solutions apart.\nIn fact, we believe we are best positioned to spearhead the smart buildings revolution, and we are fully committed to creating healthier, safer, and more sustainable buildings.\nLet's begin with a brief financial overview on slide 10.\nOrganic sales growth in the quarter was 5%, led by Global Products, which truly reflects the team's strong execution.\nThis business showed continued improvement in underlying momentum, as evidenced by mid-single digit growth on a two-year stack basis.\nOur longer-cycle field business continued to recover, led by strong growth in services, up 8% in the quarter.\nSegment EBITA increased by 10% compared to the previous year, with margins expanding by 30 basis points to 15.9%.\nImproved leverage on higher volumes, favorable mix, and the incremental benefit of our SG&A actions more than offset the headwind from reversing temporary cost reductions and price/cost challenges, including significant supply chain disruptions.\nEPS of $0.88 was at the high end of our guidance range and increased 16% year-over-year, benefiting from higher profitability and lower share count.\nFree cash flow in the quarter was approximately $300 million, reflecting the expected reversal of timing benefits experienced in the first three quarters of the year.\nFor the full year, we achieved 105% free cash flow conversion.\nOrders for our field businesses increased by 9%, led by low double-digit growth in install on strong double-digit growth in retrofit activity.\nWe are also seeing continued strength in our service business, with orders up 7%, driven by strong growth in North America and EMEALA.\nBacklog grew 10% to over $10 billion, with service backlog up 5% and install backlog up 11%.\nThe sequential improvement was led by strong retrofit activity as new construction continues to recover from depressed levels in fiscal '20, particularly in North America.\nTurning to our earnings per share bridge on slide 12, let me highlight a few key items.\nOverall, operations contributed $0.09 versus the prior year, including a $0.04 benefit from our SG&A productivity program, achieving our targeted savings in fiscal '21.\nWe are well on track to achieve our SG&A and COGS savings in fiscal '22 and beyond.\nSimilar to last quarter, excluding the headwind from the prior year temporary actions, underlying incrementals in Q4 were approximately 30%.\nCorporate expenses were a $0.03 headwind year-over-year, and other items netted to a $0.06 tailwind, primarily related to lower share count, reduced net financing charges, and favorable foreign exchange rates.\nLet's examine our segment results in more detail on slide 13.\nMy commentary will also refer to the segment end-market performance included on slide 14.\nNorth America revenue grew 4% organically, led by strength in services, which was higher across all domains.\nInstall revenue increased by low single digits, primarily due to strong demand for shorter-cycle retrofit and upgrade projects, and positive growth in new construction.\nBoth our internal and customer supply chain restrictions negatively impacted our North America install business.\nBy domain, Commercial Applied HVAC revenue grew mid-single digits, while Fire & Security increased low single digits in the quarter.\nWe had another strong quarter in Performance Infrastructure, which grew revenue by low double digits, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, reflecting strong customer demand for decarbonization solutions.\nThe segment margin fell by 20 basis points compared to the previous year, reaching 15.2%, mainly due to reversing temporary cost-saving measures from the year before.\nNorth American orders increased by 11% compared to the prior year, with Commercial HVAC and Fire & Security both showing high single-digit growth.\nPerformance Infrastructure orders saw a growth of nearly 40%.\nApplied HVAC orders grew by 10% overall, primarily driven by strong retrofit activity, with equipment orders rising over 20% in the fourth quarter.\nThe backlog increased by 10% year-over-year, reaching $6.5 billion.\nEMEALA revenue grew organically by 3%, led by strong performance in the service business, particularly in Applied HVAC and Industrial Refrigeration.\nFire & Security, comprising nearly 60% of segment revenues, experienced mid-single digit growth in Q4, with strong performance in enterprise accounts and residential security businesses, including a recovery in the retail platform.\nIndustrial Refrigeration also saw mid-single digit growth, while Commercial HVAC & Controls experienced a slight decline.\nRevenue growth was widespread across regions, with Europe and Latin America showing strength, partially offset by a low double-digit decline in the Middle East.\nSegment EBITA margins decreased by 30 basis points, primarily due to a gain on sales in the previous year.\nUnderlying margin performance improved as favorable mix, positive price/cost, and SG&A savings outweighed the impact of temporary cost-saving measures from the prior year.\nEMEALA orders continued to accelerate, increasing by 7% in the quarter, with strong mid-teens growth in Commercial HVAC and high single-digit growth in Fire & Security.\nAPAC revenue grew organically by 7%, led by low double-digit growth in Commercial HVAC & Controls.\nEBITA margins in APAC expanded by 80 basis points year-over-year to 15.5%, driven by a favorable reserve adjustment.\nAPAC's underlying margin declined year-over-year as volume leverage and net productivity were offset by unfavorable mix and negative price/cost.\nAPAC orders increased by 4%, driven by continued strength in Commercial HVAC.\nGlobal Products revenue experienced organic growth of 7% in the quarter, with broad-based strength across the portfolio.\nThe Global Residential HVAC business grew by 5% in the quarter.\nNorth America Residential HVAC increased by 4% in the quarter, benefiting from both higher volume and pricing.\nOutside North America, the Residential HVAC business grew at mid-single digits, led by strong double-digit growth in Europe, partly due to the successful launch of the new Hitachi air-to-water residential heat pump.\nIn APAC, Residential HVAC declined slightly due to softer industry demand in Japan, given the COVID-related state of emergency for much of the quarter.\nWe continued to gain market share in Japan, increasing by more than 100 basis points in the quarter, as we introduced new premium products with indoor air quality technologies.\nAlthough not reflected in our revenue growth, our Hisense JV revenue grew by over 40% year-over-year in Q4, strengthening our leading position in China.\nCommercial HVAC product sales increased by low double digits overall, led by mid-teens growth in the indirect Applied business, including strong chiller demand in the data center end market.\nLight Commercial grew by high single digits overall, with North America unitary equipment down 2% and VRF up high single digits.\nOur Light Commercial business in Asia grew by low double digits, including a significant win in Taiwan to supply high-efficiency ductless units with indoor air quality technology to all schools across the country.\nFire & Security products grew by high single digits in aggregate, led by our access and control and video solutions business, with parts of our fire suppression business returning to pre-pandemic levels.\nEBITA margin expanded by 90 basis points year-over-year to 18.7% as volume leverage, higher equity income, and the benefit of SG&A actions more than offset the temporary cost actions in the prior year and price/cost, including significant supply chain disruptions.\nMoving to slide 15.\nCorporate expense increased significantly year-over-year from an abnormally low level to $83 million.\nFor modeling purposes, we have included an outlook for some of our below-the-line items in financial year '22.\nIt's worth noting that amortization expense reflects the full-year run rate impact of Silent-Aire as well as additional software R&D.\nNet financing charges returned to a more normal level as fiscal '21 benefited from significant FX gain.\nNoncontrolling interest reflects continued growth in our Hitachi JV.\nTurning to our balance sheet and cash flow on slide 16.\nOur balance sheet remains strong.\nWe ended the year with $1.3 billion in available cash and net debt at 1.8 times, still below our targeted range of two to 2.5 times.\nRegarding cash, we generated slightly over $300 million in free cash flow in the quarter, bringing us to nearly $2 billion year-to-date and achieving our target of 105% conversion for the year.\nAs mentioned in our guidance last quarter, we expected a reversal in some of the timing benefits we experienced earlier in the year.\nI am very pleased with our cash performance and remain confident that we will maintain 100% conversion over the next several years.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we repurchased slightly over four million shares for approximately $300 million, which brings us to around 23 million shares or $1.3 billion for the full year.\nAs you can see, Q1 typically represents less than 15% of our full year earnings per share given our normal seasonality.\nFor Q1 of fiscal '22, we expect to be above that level, with Q1 guidance representing about 16% of our full year at the midpoint.\nAdditionally, we anticipate an improving first half, second half versus historical seasonality.\nLooking at fiscal '22 overall, on slide 18, we are entering the year with record backlog, and underlying markets continue to improve.\nHowever, we expect supply chain constraints and the inflationary environment to persist, at least over the next couple of quarters.\nFor the full year, we anticipate high single-digit organic revenue growth, with 70 to 80 basis points of segment EBITA margin expansion.\nAlthough we expect to remain price/cost positive on an earnings per share basis, the inflated level of pricing will result in margin headwinds of approximately 40 basis points for the year.\nUnderlying margins are expanding to 110 to 120 basis points.\nAdditionally, we expect another year of strong earnings growth, with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.22 to $3.32, representing year-over-year growth of 22% to 25%.\nTurning to slide 19.\nWe can see that our expectations for fiscal '22 are very much in line with the growth expectations we provided at our recent Investor Day, and we are accelerating growth in each area.\nLastly, on slide 20, I want to emphasize that we are well on our way to achieving our '24 targets.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The state of local and global economies, as well as the financial status and operational outcomes of the business and its lessees.\nIn attendance for this meeting are the CEO Tom O'Hern, CFO Scott Kingsmore, and Doug Healey, who oversees leasing as a senior executive vice president.\nWe achieved rental rate increases of 5% and an occupancy rate of almost 91%.\nBy the conclusion of the third quarter, most of our shopping centers were operational, with only three locations in Los Angeles remaining closed due to government orders.\nThese centers resumed operations in early October.\nAs of now, all our locations are open and our tenants are enthusiastically preparing for a bustling holiday season.\nWhile most metrics showed improvement from the second quarter, we undoubtedly experienced negative effects during this period due to COVID-19 in general, and particularly because of the extended closures in California and New York City.\nI'm extremely grateful to the entire Macerich team for their outstanding effort in safely reopening our centers, in some instances for a second time.\nWe implemented health and safety measures that exceeded CDC recommendations, including significantly enhancing our air filtration systems to incorporate hospital-grade filtration with specialized filters, consulting with the head of Infectious Disease at UCLA Medical Center to review our protocols, and hiring a renowned engineering firm to advise on advanced HVAC systems.\nWe adjusted operating hours, increased cleaning and sanitizing protocols, adhered to CDC guidelines, and used approved products as the standard for our services.\nRegarding rent collection, we saw significant improvement in the third quarter compared to the second.\nOur average rent collection rate for the third quarter was 80%.\nThe collection rate for October is trending above 80%.\nFor most tenants who didn't pay rent during the closure period, we generally reached agreements with them.\nTypically, we agreed to rent relief, usually in the form of deferred rent for the closure months with repayment scheduled for 2021, often in exchange for lease amendments favorable to the landlord.\nThere were substantial reserves set aside for uncollectible rents in the quarter, which Scott will elaborate on.\nCash flow is continuing to improve monthly as we enter the fourth quarter, and I anticipate this trend to persist.\nCurrently, we have substantial liquidity with approximately $675 million in cash on our balance sheet.\nTenant response to reopening has been positive, with almost all eager to resume operations.\nFor centers open for at least eight weeks by October, sales had reached 90% of pre-COVID levels.\nConsumers are shopping purposefully, and there has been pent-up demand.\nOur focus in the second quarter was primarily on reopening centers and tenants safely, with less emphasis on leasing.\nIn the third quarter, we shifted our focus to collecting overdue rents and began to refocus on leasing.\nRegarding foot traffic, it's generally around 80% compared to last year.\nThis is partly due to capacity limits, especially for restaurants and the absence of food court seating.\nHowever, sales are averaging 90% of last year's levels, indicating a higher conversion rate.\nThis holiday season will be different from previous years.\nWe anticipate an earlier start, shorter operating hours, and capacity limits.\nWith consumers spending less on travel and entertainment during the pandemic, many in our markets have more disposable income for holiday shopping.\nTop-performing categories are expected to be fitness and wellness, home furnishings, electronics, and athletic leisurewear.\nThere will be holiday activities, but with extensive social distancing measures in place.\nWe've received numerous inquiries about potential property tax increases in California, which, while minor in the broader political context, is significant for our business.\nA proposition in California, known as Proposition 15, would have increased property taxes on commercial properties by removing the protections of Prop 13.\nGenerally, our lease structures allow us to pass through taxes to tenants as a recoverable expense, which would have had a significant impact on our bottom line if Prop 15 had passed.\nAs of now, the proposition is trailing, with 48.7% in favor and 51.3% opposed, suggesting that commercial property taxes in California may not increase.\nLooking ahead to the remainder of 2020, the pandemic has demonstrated that quality retail, especially in top-tier centers, remains resilient.\nOnline-native brands have gained a greater appreciation for the profitability of their physical stores.\nLarge-format retailers became more active in the third quarter, and Doug will provide more details on this.\nAlthough we're still navigating the COVID-19 pandemic, our centers are operating at 90% capacity and achieving sales levels at 90% of pre-COVID figures.\nEven considering one of the more difficult categories, restaurants, in our portfolio, we have 247 eateries and 94% of them are currently operating.\nThe second quarter was exceptionally unusual and some of its challenges persisted into the third quarter and may even extend partially into the fourth quarter.\nHowever, numerous metrics improved in the third quarter, particularly collections.\nAlso, the quantity of tenants open and the advancements we're making in leasing activity have improved.\nThe effect on reserves for adoption accounts was less than the second quarter of 2020, but still considerably higher than usual.\nWe anticipate a gradual return to more typical levels in the first quarter of 2021.\nWhile there are still too many uncertainties to provide guidance, we expect the fourth quarter of 2020 and the year 2021 to perform significantly better than the second and third quarters of 2020.\nThe ongoing impact of COVID-19 continued to negatively affect 2020 results in the third quarter.\nThe third quarter's funds from operations were $0.52 per share, a decrease from $0.88 per share in the third quarter of 2019.\nSame-center net operating income for the quarter decreased by 29%, and year-to-date, it fell by 17%.\nThe differences between the third quarter of 2020 and the same period in 2019 were primarily due to these factors: $21 million in bad debt allowance, including $14 million in increased net debt expense and $7 million in reversed lease revenue; over $20 million in short-term, non-recurring rental assistance; a $9 million reduction in common area, ancillary revenue, and percentage rents; a $4 million decrease in parking income; a $4 million increase in interest expense; a $2 million decline in net operating income from the Hyatt Regency Hotel; and a negative $0.03 per share impact from shares issued in the second quarter dividend.\nThese factors were partially offset by a $7 million increase in lease termination income and $11 million in net land sale gains.\nRevenue decreases from occupancy loss also contributed to declines in both net operating income and FFO for the third quarter.\nAs mentioned, we are not providing updated 2020 earnings guidance due to ongoing uncertainties.\nWe anticipate continued volatility in operating results for the fourth quarter.\nWhile we're not offering guidance for 2021, we still believe that 2020 will be the low point in the company's operating results, primarily due to these factors: The pandemic has accelerated financial troubles for numerous retailers, leading to a wave of bankruptcy filings concentrated in 2020.\nWe don't expect this volume of bankruptcies to recur in 2021.\nMost of the filings have resulted in reorganizations rather than complete liquidations.\nWe anticipate approximately a 3% cumulative drop in occupancy from lease rejections, with about half already reflected in the 90.8% occupancy reported for the third quarter, and the remaining stores closing in the fourth quarter.\nYear-to-date, we've reported $57 million in additional bad debt reserves compared to 2019, including $50 million in bad debt expenses and $7 million in lease revenue reversals for tenants on a cash basis.\nSimilar levels of reserves are not expected going forward.\nWe've recorded over $20 million in non-recurring short-term rental assistance year-to-date and expect this to continue into the fourth quarter of 2020.\nLastly, we anticipate increases in various revenue streams going into 2021, including percentage rent, temporary tenant income, parking garage revenue, advertising, sponsorship, vending, and other ancillary property-driven revenue.\nWe look forward to providing 2021 guidance in our usual timeframe next quarter.\nWith continued improvement in rent collections, reaching 80% in the third quarter and over 80% in October, liquidity continues to improve.\nCash on hand increased from $573 million on June 30 to $630 million on September 30.\nAs noted, liquidity continues to improve to this day.\nThis improved liquidity is solely due to improved operating cash flow and is a testament to our team's efforts to secure the reopening of all our properties and negotiate thousands of agreements with our retailers.\nWith ongoing progress in these negotiations, we anticipate further improvement in operating cash flow throughout the year.\nWe are finalizing a 10-year $95 million financing on Tysons Vita, the residential tower at Tysons Corner.\nThe loan will have a fixed rate of 3.3% with interest-only payments for the entire term.\nThis will provide approximately $47 million in liquidity to the company, and we expect the loan to close within the next few weeks.\nWe secured a short-term extension on Danbury Fair through April 1, 2021, with the loan amount and interest rate remaining unchanged.\nWe've agreed to terms with the loan servicer for a three-year extension on Fashion Outlets of Niagara, extending the loan maturity to October 2023.\nWe expect the loan amount and interest rate to remain unchanged following this extension.\nLastly, we're working with our lenders to secure loan extensions for the non-recourse mortgages on FlatIron Crossing, Green Acres Mall, and the adjacent Green Acres Commons power center, and anticipate securing extended terms within the coming weeks.\nAs in the second quarter, our primary focus in the third quarter was on reopening our retail partners as quickly and safely as possible once our centers were allowed to reopen.\nCurrently, all our properties are open, and 93% of the square footage that was open pre-COVID is now operating.\nAs discussed in our last call, much of our time and energy in the third quarter was spent working with retailers unable to pay rent while closed.\nWe've made significant progress in this area.\nLooking at our top 200 rent-paying retailers, we've either received full rent payment or secured executed documents with 147 and are in LOI with another 23, totaling approximately 93% of the rent these top 200 pay.\nAs a result, collections continue to improve.\nThe third quarter saw an average collection rate of 80%, compared to 61% in the second quarter.\nAs of today, our collection rate for October stands at about 81%.\nHowever, the third quarter wasn't solely focused on collections.\nAs our centers reopened and retailers resumed operations with some consistency, the leasing climate began to improve.\nRetailers started executing leases that had been pending since before COVID.\nMost importantly, retailers began committing to new deals again.\nFor the first time in months, we're now focusing on the future instead of dwelling on the past.\nLet's examine some key metrics from the third quarter before I elaborate further.\nThird-quarter portfolio-related sales were $718 per square foot, excluding COVID closure periods for each tenant.\nThis figure is a decrease from $800 per square foot at the end of the third quarter in 2019.\nIn September, sales at centers open for the entire month reached 92% of last year's levels, excluding Apple and Tesla.\nThe occupancy rate at the third quarter's end was 90.8%.\nThis represents a 50 basis point decrease from the previous quarter and a 3% drop from the same period last year.\nThe decline is mainly attributed to store closures resulting from bankruptcies and local businesses unable to survive the pandemic.\nTemporary occupancy stood at 5.7%, down 70 basis points compared to the same time last year.\nTrailing 12-month leasing spreads were 4.9%, down from 5.1% in the previous quarter and 8.3% in Q3 2019.\nThe portfolio's average rent was $62.29, slightly lower than $62.48 last quarter but up 1.8% from $61.16 a year ago.\nAs previously mentioned, the leasing market continues to show signs of improvement.\nWe finalized 120 leases covering 342,000 square feet in the third quarter.\nThis represents more than triple the number of deals and square footage signed in the second quarter, excluding COVID-related adjustments.\nSeveral notable leases were signed in the third quarter, including high-end brands and new additions to our portfolio.\nOur current focus is on securing as much of the expiring square footage for 2021 as possible as we approach year-end.\nAt present, we have commitments for 26% of our 2021 expiring square footage, with an additional 67% in the Letter of Intent stage.\nThis brings our total leasing activity for 2021 expiring square footage to just over 90%.\nIn the third quarter, we welcomed 44 new tenants across 276,000 square feet, generating $11.3 million in total annual rent.\nWhile this represents 65% of the openings from the same quarter last year, it covers 15% more square footage with nearly identical total annual rent.\nGiven the recent challenges faced by our industry, this demonstrates the strength of our pre-pandemic leasing pipeline.\nWe saw several notable store openings across our properties in the third quarter, including popular brands and large-format retailers.\nIn October, we continued to repurpose former retail spaces and open new stores.\nDigitally native and emerging brands continued to expand their physical presence in the third quarter.\nOur future pipeline remains robust, with 190 retailers scheduled to open throughout the remainder of 2020 and into 2021.\nThese openings will cover 1.7 million square feet and generate $63 million in total annual rent.\nSince the pandemic began, only nine retailers with signed commitments have canceled their plans to open.\nI'd like to address the issue of reduced foot traffic in our properties.\nWhile traffic is indeed down compared to last year, I believe we should focus on other metrics like conversion rates and sales.\nDespite lower foot traffic, many retailers in our portfolio are experiencing significant success since reopening.\nNumerous stores are outperforming their sales targets, even with capacity limitations.\nThese success stories are often overshadowed by the focus on short-term traffic declines during the pandemic.\nWhile foot traffic is undoubtedly important, we should consider other metrics to gain a more comprehensive understanding of our performance.\nWhen we examine these additional factors, we may find that our situation is more favorable than many believe.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We began the year positively and are enthusiastic about our progress.\nWe gained market share in contact lenses, particularly with our silicone hydrogel products led by MyDay and Biofinity.\nOur myopia management line continued to improve, with MiSight growing 82% to 3 million, while CooperSurgical had an excellent quarter with Paragard increasing 16% and fertility 10%.\nBoth divisions outperformed, resulting in strong earnings and cash flow, and we anticipate continued robust performance in the future.\nFor the quarter, reporting all percentages in constant currency, despite ongoing COVID challenges, we achieved consolidated revenues of 681 million, with CooperVision revenues of 507 million, up 1%, and CooperSurgical revenues of 174 million, up 7%.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share were $3.17.\nCooperVision saw growth in daily silicone hydrogel products and the Biofinity line, as well as general strength in torics and multifocals.\nRegionally, the Americas grew 6%, driven by Biofinity and daily silicones, including notable growth from both Clariti and MyDay.\nEMEA decreased 4% as several countries continued to manage strict COVID-related restrictions.\nWe observed growth in our daily silicones and Biofinity, which is promising for the future.\nAsia Pacific increased 3%, led by MyDay's strength, especially in Japan.\nOverall, sales surpassed expectations, and we're well-positioned to continue growing and gaining market share with current and upcoming product launches driving momentum.\nTurning to additional quarterly figures.\nOur silicone hydrogel dailies grew 8% with both MyDay and Clariti showing growth.\nMyDay, particularly MyDay toric, showed notable strength as we continue its global rollout.\nOverall, daily silicones are currently leading the market as health and wellness trends drive adoption, and we expect this to continue as there's still 2.4 billion in annual global sales of older hydrogels that need upgrading.\nRegarding our FRP portfolio, Biofinity grew 6% with notable performance in Biofinity Energys and Biofinity toric multifocal.\nI've mentioned these products before, but as a reminder, Energys is a unique and innovative lens using digital zone optics to help reduce eye fatigue from excessive screen time.\nIn today's world, this product has the potential to perform well, and we're seeing that.\nOur Biofinity toric multifocal, launched last year, is performing exceptionally well.\nThis is a made-to-order product and part of our extensive range of unique products that set our business apart.\nConcerning product launches, we remain very active.\nWe've received regulatory approval to launch Clariti in Japan and will do so shortly.\nThis is in addition to our ongoing successful launch of a second base curve for MyDay sphere in that market.\nWe're also continuing to launch and relaunch MyDay sphere and toric in many other markets worldwide.\nWe're proceeding with the rollout of Biofinity toric multifocal, including launching in Europe soon, and we're introducing extended toric ranges for Clariti and Biofinity.\nFurthermore, our pipeline is strong, and we expect to remain very active going forward.\nLastly, we're extremely busy with our myopia management portfolio of MiSight and Ortho-k lenses, which grew 46% for the quarter to 12 million.\nWithin this, MiSight grew 82% to 3 million and Ortho-k grew 37%, including 1 million of revenue from our acquisition of GP Specialists in August last year.\nRegarding MiSight, we now have over 30,000 children worldwide wearing the lens, including over 2,000 in the U.S., and our momentum is accelerating.\nOur launch activities continue to be highly successful, and we anticipate similar success in new markets such as South Korea, where we'll be launching in the coming months.\nWe've also made progress in discussions with several large retailers and buying groups regarding MiSight and even entered a test phase with one large retailer for approximately 70 stores.\nWe've recently received several awards, including from Contact Lens Spectrum and Popular Science, and we're making advancements with multiple professional associations, helping to establish myopia management as the standard of care.\nWe've also made significant progress with several universities, supporting the training and education of their optometry students as many schools are now adding myopia management training courses to their curricula.\nWhen examining U.S. data from a fitting standpoint, the typical age for new MiSight wearers remains 11, with a positive trend towards younger users.\nThe fact that new MiSight users are significantly younger than regular contact lens wearers, who average 17 years old, demonstrates our success in introducing children to contacts earlier, which is remarkable.\nThis progress is highly encouraging and aligns with our objective of achieving or surpassing 25 million in MiSight sales this fiscal year and over 50 million in the following year.\nRegarding myopia management eyewear, I'd like to discuss our recent acquisition of SightGlass Vision and our collaboration with EssilorLuxottica.\nSightGlass Vision has created innovative glasses to slow myopia progression in children, and our joint venture with EssilorLuxottica will combine our shared expertise and global leadership in myopia management to expedite the worldwide commercialization of these glasses.\nWe are currently addressing the usual regulatory requirements to establish the joint venture and have begun developing launch strategies for certain markets as we anticipate the two-year clinical data, which will be available in the coming months.\nThe SightGlass technology serves as an excellent addition to our existing portfolio of contact lenses for myopia management.\nCollaborating with an outstanding partner like EssilorLuxottica will boost growth in the entire pediatric vision market.\nWe will provide more updates on this exciting opportunity as we continue to make progress.\nTo summarize our myopia management efforts, we are leading an extremely promising global pediatric initiative.\nAlthough this market is in its early stages, the growth is impressive, and having MiSight as the only FDA-approved product has been transformative.\nWe continue to invest in sales and marketing programs, new product launches, regulatory approvals, and R&D to promote global adoption.\nActively addressing myopia progression in pediatric patients offers immediate vision correction and long-term health benefits, such as reducing the risk of serious eye conditions later in life, including retinal detachment, cataracts, and glaucoma.\nThis endeavor is crucial, which is why many eye care professionals are becoming involved and strongly supporting this initiative.\nTo conclude the vision segment, I'd like to add that the ongoing vaccine rollout will undoubtedly benefit us, given the consumer-oriented nature of our business.\nIn the short term, we anticipate improved foot traffic in retail outlets, particularly malls, along with increased service capacity and better staff attendance in optometry offices.\nWe also expect a strong back-to-school season as in-person learning resumes worldwide.\nIn the long term, our growth drivers remain robust and are likely improving due to the macro trend of people spending more time on electronic devices.\nIt is estimated that approximately one-third of the world's population is currently myopic, and this is expected to increase to 50% by 2050.\nCombining this trend with the ongoing shift to daily silicone hydrogel lenses, geographic expansion, and growth in toric and multifocal lenses, our industry has a very promising future.\nFor CooperVision, our comprehensive product portfolio, active product launch activities, momentum in myopia management, and strong new fit data position us well for long-term sustainable growth.\nWe experienced a very successful quarter, led by Paragard and fertility products.\nOverall revenues reached 174 million, showing a healthy 7% increase as markets recovered and we gained market share.\nI'm extremely enthusiastic about CooperSurgical's current state under Holly's outstanding leadership and our team, and the future looks incredibly promising.\nRevenues grew by 10% year-over-year to 70 million, with positive trends observed globally and across our product range.\nWe are gaining market share and are well-positioned for future gains with improving traction in our key accounts.\nOne of the strengths of our fertility business is our diverse product portfolio, which covers nearly all the needs of fertility clinics, except for pharmaceutical products.\nWe've excelled at cross-selling and building relationships with larger clinics worldwide, resulting in solid growth across various areas, from consumable products like pipettes, media, and RI Witness (our RFID lab-based management system discussed last quarter) to equipment such as incubators and workstations, as well as genetic testing.\nFrom a market perspective, COVID-19 continues to negatively impact patient flow, and some important countries like India are still significantly affected, but we're definitely seeing an increase in activity.\nIn the meantime, we're gaining market share and expect this trend to continue.\nOverall, the fertility market has extremely positive long-term macro growth trends, and we're well-positioned to capitalize on these trends to drive growth.\nWithin our office and surgical unit, we saw a 5% increase, led by Paragard's growth of 16%.\nAs the only 100% hormone-free IUD in the U.S. market, Paragard offers an excellent, long-lasting birth control option that meets the needs and interests of women seeking a healthy alternative.\nWe're very optimistic about Paragard at present and believe we'll continue to see solid growth this year.\nIn other areas, we've observed a steady rescheduling of deferred elective procedures, and our medical device sales have improved.\nDuring the quarter, several of our key products experienced growth, including our direct visualization system for endometrial evaluation, our proprietary surgical skin closure device, and our range of uterine manipulators.\nWe've made significant advancements in recent years and currently have numerous exciting developments underway.\nWe recently finished an ESG materiality assessment to maintain our focus on crucial areas, and I remain deeply committed and enthusiastic about this type of work.\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or are interested in our ESG initiatives.\nOur total revenue for the fourth quarter rose by 5% compared to the same period last year, or 3% when adjusted for currency fluctuations, reaching $681 million.\nThe overall gross margin increased by 50 basis points year-over-year to 67.8%.\nThis enhancement was attributed to CooperSurgical's strong performance, particularly with high-margin Paragard and fertility consumable products, as well as favorable currency exchange rates.\nLooking ahead, we are well-positioned to continue delivering robust gross margins.\nWe finished our manufacturing restructuring efforts in Q1, putting us in a good position for the current market conditions and ready to efficiently increase production as demand continues to recover.\nWe still face some inefficiencies related to absorption, but we anticipate these will diminish as sales grow.\nOperating expenses increased by only 2.1% compared to last year as we maintained tight cost control.\nThis resulted in consolidated operating margins of 26.9%, a significant improvement from 25% in the previous year.\nThis performance exceeded expectations, and we anticipate continuing to deliver strong results, balancing cost management with investment opportunities within our business, especially in myopia management.\nInterest expenses for the quarter amounted to $6.4 million, driven by lower interest rates and reduced average debt, while the effective tax rate was 11.3%.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share were $3.17, with approximately 49.7 million average shares outstanding.\nFree cash flow was robust at $92 million, consisting of $148 million in operating cash flow, offset by $56 million in capital expenditures.\nNet debt increased slightly to $1.7 billion, while our adjusted leverage ratio decreased to 2.1 times due to improving EBITDA.\nLastly, we bought back $25 million worth of stock this past quarter at an average price of $357 per share.\nIn addition to our strong operational performance, we recently completed several small acquisitions.\nDuring the quarter, we acquired Embryo Options to add a cryo storage software solution to our fertility portfolio, enabling clinics to automate the management of cryopreserved embryos, eggs, and sperm.\nThe business generated $4.7 million in sales last year and contributed $500,000 in revenue in our Q1.\nWithin CooperVision, as Al mentioned, we acquired the remaining 80% stake in SightGlass Vision in January for $41 million in cash, plus potential earn-outs of up to $139 million based on revenue milestones and regulatory approvals.\nAfter the quarter ended, we entered into an agreement to form a 50-50 joint venture with EssilorLuxottica, which we hope to finalize soon.\nAlso following the end of the quarter, we closed two more small acquisitions at CooperSurgical.\nThe first was GA Medical, a pre-revenue manufacturer of an in-office water vapor ablation system that will launch shortly, and Safe Obstetric Systems, owner of Fetal Pillow, a balloon device used during c-sections to make delivery less traumatic for the mother and baby.\nThe business generated $4.4 million in sales last year.\nWe purchased it for $52 million in cash plus a potential earn-out of up to $14 million.\nThis is directly related to the tax item I discussed last quarter where CooperVision's intellectual property and related assets were transferred to the U.K. in November 2020.\nFor non-GAAP purposes, we adjusted for this activity and will continue to do so moving forward.\nWe continue to monitor and evaluate the scope, duration, and impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results.\nWhile we still consider resurgences a significant risk factor, our visibility has improved.\nTherefore, we're now providing full-year 2021 guidance to offer a better understanding of our expected upcoming performance, including our anticipated myopia management investments.\nThe guidance includes consolidated revenues of 2.8 to 2.845 billion, representing a 15 to 17% increase, or 12 to 14% in constant currency, with CooperVision revenues of 2.090 to 2.120 billion, up 13 to 15%, or 9 to 11% in constant currency, and CooperSurgical revenues of 710 to 725 million, up 21 to 23%, or 19 to 22% in constant currency.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share are expected to range from $12.90 to $13.10.\nFinally, regarding free cash flow, we now anticipate approaching 500 million this year as operating cash flow improves and capital expenditures decrease.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Management may discuss certain non-historical topics during our conversation.\nWe might reference specific non-GAAP financial metrics that management employs to assess the business and believes will offer insights into the company's ongoing operations.\nBrinker's fourth quarter was among our most lucrative periods in recent times, concluding a successful yet unconventional year.\nOur fiscal '21 results are founded on a consistent strategy that sets us apart in the market and an exceptional team that delivers daily in our establishments.\nWe were expanding sales and gaining market share before the pandemic, and we chose to further invest in our strategy of offering convenience, value, and excellent customer experience by increasing third-party delivery and enhancing our takeout systems.\nIn a year of social restrictions, our teams united safely to lead the industry in customer traffic and regained positive sales momentum.\nDuring a period of closures and shutdowns, we launched our first virtual brand in over 1,000 restaurants by utilizing our technological infrastructure, with It's Just Wings surpassing our $150 million target in company-owned establishments.\nWith the support of our franchise partners, It's Just Wings became a $170 million business in the U.S., with many international franchisees also operating the brand.\nIn a year that began with near-record high unemployment, we maintained employment for all our management teams and provided them with substantial bonuses.\nWe implemented a retention plan for our most valuable team members to encourage their continued employment as the staffing situation evolved through spring and summer.\nDuring a year when gatherings and special events at Maggiano's were limited, Steve and the team restructured the value proposition, takeout options, and redesigned the Heart of House.\nThe brand is already generating more profitable sales as customer numbers increase, and guests have responded positively to the changes.\nIn a year when we anticipated needing to borrow more money to survive the pandemic, we reduced our debt by over $300 million and are committed to continuing this trend this year.\nDuring a year when we worried about maintaining support for our charitable partners, our team set a record by raising more than $10 million for St. Jude during a particularly crucial time for their patients and families.\nOur teams have collected nearly $90 million for St. Jude's patients throughout our partnership.\nWe've positioned ourselves to invest aggressively in growing this business during fiscal '22 and beyond while maintaining a strong balance sheet.\nThe ability to make such investments begins with owning our restaurants, providing the opportunity to leverage our fleet and realize the full profitability of our efforts.\nThe pandemic reinforced our commitment to corporate ownership.\nDespite the challenges of owning restaurants, such as dealing with labor issues and commodity cycles, ownership provides us with the scale to effectively manage these issues, allows us to consistently guide our brands, and control the investments we make to grow the business.\nThis year, our investments will focus on more ways to offer convenience, value, and an excellent guest experience.\nWe plan to double our pipeline of new restaurant openings, reimagine our existing locations to keep them strong and vibrant, accelerate our technological advantages, and expand our portfolio of brands.\nWe are currently in the process of launching our second virtual brand, Maggiano's Italian Classics.\nIt is now available in over 250 restaurants and performing well.\nThis rollout will be slower for a couple of reasons.\nIt is slightly more complex.\nSince our dining rooms are now fully operational, we are being very careful about the experience for our operators and guests.\nWe are enthusiastic about it.\nWe are receiving positive guest feedback and expect to be in 900 restaurants by the end of the fiscal year.\nWe are expanding our investment in takeout and delivery services by seeking ways to enhance visibility and boost awareness of these options across our four brands.\nWe have recently upgraded our curbside takeout technology, which is already streamlining operations and enhancing customer satisfaction metrics.\nIt's Just Wings has launched a website enabling online ordering for both pickup and delivery, and we are optimistic about the brand's potential for growth.\nThese technological advancements are helping us better manage the increase in off-premise business from pre-pandemic levels of mid-teens to now over 30%, while also maximizing our asset capacity with minimal additional capital.\nIt's uncommon to see your off-premise business more than double and add new brands to your portfolio simultaneously.\nSuch success is only possible with top-tier systems and a capable team to implement them.\nOur staff is vital to our achievements, and we are taking the current labor market conditions very seriously.\nWe have launched an aggressive campaign to recruit, educate, and retain our talented employees.\nAlthough March brought rapid and numerous challenges for everyone, we are satisfied with the progress we've achieved.\nSome issues remain, but they are limited to specific areas, and we are confident in resolving these staffing difficulties soon.\nTo further assist our operators, we are deploying a new service system with handheld devices that we've refined over three years.\nImplementing such a system is more complex than some might suggest.\nThe goal is to create a system that operators can use during peak hours, saving labor while still providing an excellent customer experience.\nOur system also increases our team members' earnings, encouraging them to stay with us longer, which is essential in the current climate.\nThe system is currently in use in over 250 restaurants, and we expect full implementation by November.\nLastly, since we chose not to increase prices at Chili's during fiscal year 2021, we have the flexibility to do so this year as consumers return to work and income levels normalize.\nWe are considering how to address these opportunities, particularly in areas like delivery, while maintaining our industry-leading value proposition.\nLast year, we learned to operate a more efficient and lucrative business model.\nThis year and beyond, we are focusing on capitalizing on growth opportunities that are not only available but achievable for Brinker.\nNo one is executing this strategy better than our team, and I'm proud to be part of their journey.\nAs Wyman mentioned, we concluded fiscal year 2021 with a strong fourth quarter.\nIn the fourth quarter, Brinker reported total revenues of $1.009 billion, with consolidated comparable sales growth of 65%.\nConsistent with our ongoing strategy, the majority of these sales were driven by customer traffic, which increased by 53% for the quarter, outperforming the industry by 10% on a two-year basis.\nThese sales resulted in robust earnings per share, with fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.68.\nAt the brand level, Chili's comparable restaurant sales increased by 8.5% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, which we consider a more appropriate comparison for the quarter.\nFurthermore, in terms of absolute dollar value, the fourth quarter was Chili's highest-grossing sales quarter ever, surpassing $900 million in total revenue.\nMaggiano's, while down 18% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, made significant progress in its recovery and built positive momentum heading into the current fiscal year.\nLet's now examine the profit and loss statement.\nOur restaurant operating margin in the fourth quarter was 16.9%.\nEven when accounting for the extra week, the 16% operating margin shows significant improvement from the previous year and a 110-basis-point increase compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, before COVID-19.\nThe food and beverage costs for the fourth quarter were 20 basis points higher than the previous year as a percentage of company sales.\nThis difference was mainly due to higher commodity prices, especially for chicken and pork.\nLabor costs for the quarter were 240 basis points lower than the previous year as a percentage of company sales, primarily because of the extra week's sales leverage against fixed labor expenses and the slower reopening in some high-wage states like California.\nDuring this period, our managers put substantial effort into staffing our restaurants to meet the strong demand for our brands.\nOur size is advantageous in this area, as our experienced HR teams effectively supported managers by providing hiring tools and organizing events to assist in the process.\nDue to the challenging hiring environment, the process of hiring, training, and keeping team members led to a mid-single-digit increase in labor inflation, which we expect to continue in the short term.\nTo recognize our operators' strong performance throughout the fiscal year, we decided to invest further in our hourly team members and managers through various additional bonus structures, totaling about $4 million for the quarter beyond our usual payout formulas.\nThis extra investment reduced quarterly earnings per share by approximately $0.06 and increased labor expense margin by about 40 basis points, which we believe is worth the benefits it will bring.\nRestaurant expenses were 830 basis points lower year-over-year as we fully leveraged many of our fixed costs, particularly benefiting from the additional week in the quarter.\nThe continued positive operating performance resulted in a significant increase in our quarterly tax rate, 15% for the quarter, which includes an adjustment to increase the annual income tax accrual.\nThis increase negatively impacted fourth-quarter earnings per share by approximately $0.06.\nOur operating cash flow remained strong, with $101 million for the fourth quarter and $370 million for the fiscal year.\nEBITDA for the quarter was $144 million, bringing the fiscal-year EBITDA total to $368 million.\nIn the fourth quarter, we continued to use a large portion of our cash flow to further reduce our revolver borrowings.\nBy the end of the year, we had reduced our revolver balance to $171 million.\nThis reduced our total funded debt leverage to 2.5 times and our lease-adjusted leverage to 3.6 times at year-end.\nRegarding the revolver, we have agreed on terms and conditions for a new revolving credit facility with our bank group.\nThe new $800 million five-year revolver offers better pricing, allows the return of restricted payments, and provides sufficient liquidity and flexibility to support our growth strategies.\nOur board of directors has also reactivated the share repurchase authorization that was suspended early in the pandemic, with an authorized amount of $300 million.\nLooking ahead to fiscal year 2022, given the current volatile operating environment, we can only provide some general insights for certain annual metrics.\nWe anticipate commodity and labor inflation percentages each in the mid-single digits, with commodity inflation toward the lower end of the range.\nWe expect capital expenditures of $155 million to $165 million, an annual effective tax rate of 14% to 15%, and a weighted annual share count of 45 million to 47 million shares.\nAs we begin fiscal 2022, the reality of the pandemic and its uncertainties remains part of our daily operations.\nNevertheless, all four of our brands are well-prepared and positioned to perform in whatever conditions they encounter throughout the year.\nWe are very proud of their efforts during the past fiscal year and are confident that their experiences, growth, and strong business models will continue to deliver quality results as we move forward.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Review the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides as it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.\nLinde staff delivered another strong quarter, maintaining Q2's record-breaking earnings per share despite increasingly difficult market conditions.\nCash flow from operations and return on capital hit new highs, while our project backlog nearly doubled, establishing a robust foundation for high-quality, sustained growth.\nWe also increased our commitment to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, and Sanjiv will present that plan to you.\nHowever, this isn't a new development.\nIt's what we promised our shareholders since the merger and have been fulfilling consistently, regardless of the economic climate.\nMost of you are aware, but it's worth restating: our operational culture is deeply ingrained at Linde, and our employees take great satisfaction in showing continuous improvement across key performance metrics in their operations.\nOur management team's favorite day of the month is when we examine the operational performance of each of our regional business units.\nThis is how we entertain ourselves in Danbury, among other activities.\nYou've likely seen the announcement earlier this week that I will become the Board Chairman, and Sanjiv will assume the role of CEO starting March first.\nHis appointment is the result of a thorough three-year succession planning process, during which Sanjiv clearly proved he was the ideal candidate to lead this company moving forward.\nI will continue to offer guidance, both as a Director and a major shareholder.\nHowever, my main duty shifts to leading the Board of Directors, while Sanjiv takes charge of the company's daily operations.\nA highly skilled and experienced leadership team supports Sanjiv.\nIn my 15 years as CEO, I've never felt more confident about the company's position.\nClearly, our strategy is proving effective and the team is performing at a high standard.\nSome describe us as a well-functioning organization.\nWe are adaptable to all circumstances, and I'm certain Linde's best days are yet to come.\nI'll now pass the call to Sanjiv.\nI'm privileged to have the chance to guide this exceptional company into the future.\nI value your trust and backing over the years.\nBefore delving into the slides, I wanted to expand on Steve's mention of a smooth leadership transition.\nAt Linde, we take pride in our industry-leading performance, which begins with embodying our core values while maintaining a disciplined execution culture.\nAs CEO, I fully plan to build upon our established foundation.\nI will concentrate on areas that align with our shareholders' interests: profitable growth, business optimization, cash generation, and of course, the crucial metric for our industry, ROC.\nLinde will maintain its focus on elements that create value for Linde owners, such as a strong pricing and productivity culture, an active commitment to sustainability, a disciplined investment approach, a shareholder-friendly capital policy, and naturally, pursuing high-quality and sustainable growth initiatives with an emphasis on ROC.\nUltimately, it's about being the top-performing industrial gases and engineering company globally.\nIn other words, you can anticipate a seamless transition with minimal changes.\nNow, let's move on to slide three for an update on our growth initiatives.\nLast quarter, I mentioned some key growth drivers, including the secured project backlog, profitable base capex investments, and the strength of our growth in low capital intensity areas such as healthcare, food and beverage, engineering, and our packaged gas business.\nToday, I'm pleased to report that our project backlog has grown from $7.5 billion to $13.4 billion, an 81% increase from the previous quarter.\nRemember, this backlog only includes contractually secured incremental growth with fixed payments to ensure targeted returns.\nWe're also starting to see a revival of the capital cycle, particularly in upstream operations like natural gas production, which bodes well for our overall pipeline of opportunities.\nAdditionally, the electronics sector remains very active.\nWe recently announced a $600 million sale of gas investment to supply a world-class fab in Phoenix, Arizona.\nThis will supply only the initial phase of this project, and we anticipate further opportunities as that area expands.\nI'm impressed by how the entire Linde team has united and is utilizing our combined strengths to capture high-quality growth opportunities through our advanced high-density industrial gas network paired with world-class engineering capabilities.\nThis backlog, along with our dense supply network, ensures profitable and secure growth for the foreseeable future.\nBefore discussing the quarterly results, I'd like to provide an update on Linde's new and more ambitious greenhouse gas emission targets.\nAn effective approach to address this is to begin by clarifying the significance of our products in people's daily lives and the broader economy.\nThis information can be found on the fourth slide.\nWe produce essential products for society, such as medical oxygen for healthcare facilities, extremely pure nitrogen for semiconductor manufacturing, liquid nitrogen for food preservation, krypton for window insulation, and hydrogen for cleaner fuel production, to name a few examples.\nWe anticipate generating a total of 39 million metric tons of Scope one and Scope two emissions this year in the process of manufacturing these products.\nAs you're aware, gas production requires substantial amounts of electricity.\nWhen this electricity is generated using fossil fuels, we're held accountable for those indirect emissions, known as Scope two emissions.\nWe also generate Scope one emissions, which, while significantly lower than our Scope two emissions, are still considerable.\nThese emissions are primarily the result of using natural gas to produce hydrogen, which refineries use to create cleaner fuels.\nOur gases are vital to the economy.\nBesides saving lives, improving energy efficiency, and extending shelf life, our products also assist our customers in eliminating or reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn 2020, we produced a total of 37 million metric tons of emissions to create products that helped our customers avoid more than double our emissions, or 85 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent.\nIn essence, without Linde's products, our world would have significantly higher net carbon emissions.\nAt Linde, we've been contributing to the well-being of our planet for many years, but we recognize the need to do more.\nIn 2019, we established a goal to decrease Linde's carbon intensity by 35% by 2028.\nWe're well ahead of schedule and expect to surpass this goal, which is certainly positive news.\nHowever, an intensity goal doesn't fully address the absolute Scope one and Scope two emissions.\nTherefore, we're committed to continuing our mission of increasing global productivity, enabling our customers to decarbonize, and reducing our own carbon footprint.\nWith this in mind, I'm pleased to announce Linde's new medium and long-term emission goals, which are presented on slide five.\nThe first objective is to achieve a 35% reduction in our Scope one and Scope two emissions by the year 2035, or simply 35 by 35.\nTo reach this goal, we must significantly reduce our Scope one emissions, which are primarily caused by hydrogen production.\nWe will accomplish this by concentrating our efforts on carbon capture and sequestration, developing blue and green hydrogen production, and gradually transitioning to a zero-emission fleet.\nOur Scope two emissions are associated with electricity consumption.\nCurrently, we use approximately 45 terawatt hours of power, one-third of which comes from renewable and low-carbon sources.\nTo achieve the 35 by 35 goal, we will triple our renewable and low-carbon power sourcing by 2035 through new PPAs, supporting renewable energy projects with offtake agreements, and even co-investment.\nTo put this goal into perspective, the amount of renewable energy we plan to purchase is equivalent to all the power consumed annually in New York City.\nThat's a substantial figure.\nOf course, we will also continue to improve the energy efficiency of our plants.\nThese goals are being integrated across the entire global organization, reviewed as part of our operating rhythm, and will be incorporated into our annual variable compensation.\nThis approach gives me confidence in our ability to achieve these goals, which is consistent with how we address any important matter in our company.\nIn addition to the 35 by 35 goal, we are also committed to pursuing our objective of becoming climate-neutral by 2050.\nWe will do our part to achieve this goal, but we also require strong policy and regulatory support.\nLet me summarize this journey on slide six.\nWe have outlined a roadmap to achieve climate neutrality.\nThe strategic plan is supported by various initiatives and goals, which will be integrated into our operational framework, maximizing our chances of success.\nWe will maintain transparency and accountability by regularly updating our stakeholders on our progress.\nRevenue reached $7.7 billion, showing a 12% increase from the previous year and a 1% rise from the last quarter.\nCost pass through, which involves billing energy cost variations to customers, primarily in on-site operations, increased by 3% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter.\nIt's important to note that cost pass-through doesn't affect profit amounts, but it can impact profit margins as we adjust sales and variable costs accordingly.\nCurrency exchange rates provided a 2% boost compared to last year, but created a 1% drag sequentially, as most currencies have recently depreciated against the U.S. dollar.\nAfter accounting for these factors, core sales increased by 11% year-over-year and 1% sequentially.\nThe 8% volume growth compared to last year was widespread across all regions and industries, reflecting ongoing recovery from the pandemic.\nQuarter-over-quarter volumes remained stable, with new project contributions largely offset by reduced volumes in China.\nPrices have risen 3% from last year and 1% from the previous quarter, as we continue to adjust merchant and packaged gas product pricing to match local inflation rates.\nSome contracts have delayed recovery mechanisms, which may take two to six months to come into effect, depending on the specific terms.\nThe operating margin of 23.6% is 150 basis points higher than in 2020, but 60 basis points lower than the peak set in the second quarter.\nExcluding the impact of cost pass-through, the operating margin would have increased by 220 basis points compared to last year and shown a negligible decline sequentially.\nAs mentioned earlier, merchant and package cost recovery can take one to two quarters to fully materialize.\nTherefore, I anticipate continued momentum in pricing going forward.\nEarnings per share of $2.73 represents a 27% increase over last year, driven by higher volumes and prices against a relatively stable cost structure.\nAs both Steve and Sanjiv highlighted, Linde's strong culture of productivity enables consistent profit growth, regardless of economic conditions.\nThis is further evidenced by the 16.7% return on capital, setting another record as profits continue to grow at double-digit rates while maintaining a stable capital base.\nWe've managed to keep a steady capital base through a combination of disciplined capital management and robust cash generation, which I'll discuss on slide eight.\nThe left side of the slide shows our operating cash flow progression, reaching a record level of $2.6 billion in the third quarter.\nThe main factors contributing to this are improved earnings, timing benefits from the previous quarter, and advance payments for engineering contracts.\nGiven the record sale of plant backlog, I expect to see further project prepayments in the coming quarters.\nRegarding our year-to-date cash allocation, the pie chart on the right shows $2.3 billion invested in the business and $4.8 billion returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.\nIt's worth noting that investments exclude sale of plant figures, as we receive advance payments for engineering projects, meaning we're committing much larger amounts to contractually secured growth than what's shown on this chart.\nIn addition to generating substantial surplus cash, we have access to very favorable capital through the debt markets.\nIn September, we issued nearly EUR two billion in bonds with maturities of five, 12, and 30 years, at impressively low all-in coupon rates of 0%, 0.38%, and 1%, respectively.\nOverall, the combination of excess cash generation and low-cost incremental debt gives us great confidence in maintaining shareholder-friendly allocation policies over the long term.\nI'll conclude with guidance on slide nine.\nOur fourth quarter earnings per share guidance range of $2.60 to $2.70 represents a 13% to 17% increase over last year and a 38% to 43% increase over 2019.\nAs in previous quarters, we believe it's important to distinguish true multi-year growth from mere recovery of 2020 recessionary conditions.\nCompared to the third quarter, this range indicates a sequential decrease due to normal seasonal declines and an estimated 1% foreign currency headwind.\nWe assume underlying volumes will be roughly in line with the third quarter, but if current conditions persist, we expect to be at the upper end of this range.\nThis quarterly update results in a revised full-year guidance of $10.52 to $10.62, representing growth of 28% to 29% over 2020 and 43% to 45% over 2019.\nTo sum up, we've had another strong quarter despite some challenging conditions.\nRegardless of the macroeconomic environment, we remain confident in Linde's ability to continue delivering industry-leading performance.\nSummary: ",

projections and anticipations during our discussion today\nJoining us for this call are Scott Donnelly, Textron's CEO and chairman, along with Frank Connor, our CFO\nThe quarter's revenue reached $2.9 billion, an increase from $2.8 billion in the same period last year\nWe reported earnings of $0.75 per share for the first quarter of this year\nThe adjusted net income, a non-GAAP metric, was $0.70 per share for Q1 2021, compared to $0.35 per share in Q1 2020\nThe 2021 adjusted net income excludes $6 million in pre-tax special charges ($0.02 per share after tax) related to the 2020 restructuring plan, and a $15 million pre-tax gain ($0.07 per share after tax) from selling TRU Canada\nProfit across segments in the quarter amounted to $256 million, up from $156 million in Q1 2020\nCash flow from manufacturing before pension contributions totaled $71 million, a $501 million increase from the same quarter last year\nTextron experienced a robust first quarter overall\nSegment margins increased by 330 basis points this quarter, due to strong performance across all our divisions\nBell's revenues increased this quarter, with higher commercial revenues offsetting lower military sales\nIn Bell's commercial sector, we delivered 17 helicopters, up from 15 in the same quarter last year\nWe observed strong order activity across our commercial models in the quarter, both domestically and internationally, spanning various markets including corporate, private, utility, and emergency medical services\nRegarding future vertical lift, a contract modification of $293 million was awarded for the second phase of the competitive demonstration and reduction program for FLRAA\nAs we finish the final flight activities for the V-280, it's crucial to highlight the impressive performance milestones the aircraft has achieved in over 215 flight hours across more than three years\nThese achievements included reaching 305 knots of true airspeed, demonstrating level 1 handling qualities, and performing autonomous flight\nFor FLRAA, Bell is progressing with the construction of the Invictus 360 prototype, with approximately one-third of the manufacturing process completed, aiming for the first flight in Q4 of next year\nLet's discuss Textron Systems\nWhile revenues remained steady for the quarter, the business continued to perform well with improved operating margins\nDuring the quarter, Systems secured a contract worth up to $607 million from the U.S. Army to sustain and modernize existing shadow systems to the upgraded Block III configuration\nDuring the quarter, Systems successfully took part in the U.S. Army's Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Systems event at Fort Benning and finished direct soldier flight demonstrations of their Aerosonde HQ platform.\nSystems is presently addressing the FTUAS Request for Information, which will assist in shaping the program's next stage.\nSystems also provided the initial RCV medium prototype to the Army client as they seek to evaluate these vehicles and establish requirements for future robotic combat vehicle initiatives.\nAt ATAC, we are steadily increasing F1 flight hours at the operational sites associated with the three U.S. Air Force CAPCAS program awards.\nBy the end of the quarter, we had 16 F1 aircraft certified and deployed across our client locations.\nIn Aviation, revenues remained essentially unchanged in the quarter with slightly reduced volume, indicating lower aftermarket earnings, partially counterbalanced by increased pricing.\nWe supplied 28 jets, an increase from 23 the previous year, and 14 commercial turboprops, a decrease from 16 in last year's first quarter.\nOrder activity was robust in the quarter, leading to a backlog increase of $450 million to $2.1 billion at the quarter's end.\nDuring the quarter, we delivered our 1,560th XL-based Citation jet.\nThis significant delivery demonstrates the value and performance of this platform, as well as Textron Aviation's dedication to ongoing fleet support.\nWe also introduced the new CJ4 Gen2 and delivered five aircraft in the quarter.\nThis model upgrade exemplifies our continued investment in our existing aircraft portfolio.\nRegarding new products, the Cessna SkyCourier aircraft certification program is progressing well as we work towards entry into service planned for the latter half of this year.\nRevenues increased compared to last year's first quarter, mainly due to higher volume and pricing in our specialized vehicle product line.\nIn specialized vehicles, we continue to observe strong retail demand across our customer end markets.\nAt Kautex, we witnessed our production volume of fuel systems for hybrid electric vehicles more than double to approximately 9% of our total production volume in the quarter, with the launch of four new models.\nAlthough retail demand in industrial-owned markets has been improving, channel inventory remains below target levels as we manage supply shortages and disruptions, which we anticipate will improve throughout the year.\nIn conclusion, it was an excellent beginning to the year.\nWe have observed improving customer demand in our end markets, increased commercial order flow at Aviation and Bell, and continued solid performance in our military businesses with strong cash generation in the quarter.\nLet's examine how each segment contributed, beginning with Textron Aviation.\nTextron Aviation's income of $865 million decreased by $7 million compared to the previous year, mainly due to reduced aftermarket sales, partly counterbalanced by increased pricing.\nThe segment's profit rose to $47 million in Q1, up from $3 million last year, primarily because of improved performance and a favorable product mix.\nThe segment's order backlog stood at $2.1 billion at the quarter's end.\nIncome increased by $23 million to $846 million compared to last year, driven by higher commercial sales, partially offset by decreased military revenue.\nThe segment's profit dropped by $10 million to $105 million, mainly due to increased research and development expenses, particularly for future vertical lift projects.\nThe segment's backlog reached $5.2 billion at the quarter's close.\nTextron Systems' revenue remained steady at $328 million compared to the previous year.\nThe segment's profit increased by $25 million to $51 million, largely due to a $27 million positive impact from performance and other factors.\nThe segment's backlog stood at $2.4 billion at the end of the quarter.\nIndustrial revenue grew by $85 million to $825 million compared to last year, primarily due to increased volume and mix, as well as pricing in specialized vehicles and currency exchange fluctuations.\nThe segment's profit rose by $38 million to $47 million compared to Q1 2020, mainly because of higher volume and mix, pricing offsetting inflation, and improved performance in specialized vehicles.\nThe Finance segment generated $15 million in revenue and $6 million in profit.\nCorporate expenses amounted to $40 million, while interest expenses totaled $35 million.\nThe company recorded $6 million in pre-tax charges related to the 2020 restructuring plan on the special charges line.\nThe sale of TRU Canada was completed during the quarter, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $15 million.\nCash performance was strong, with $71 million in manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions, a $501 million improvement over Q1 of the previous year, due to continued focus on inventory and working capital management.\nThe company repurchased 1.8 million shares, returning $91 million to shareholders.\nThe company has raised its expected adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $2.80 to $3 per share, an increase of $0.10 from the previous outlook.\nThe outlook for manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions remains at $600 million to $700 million, with planned pension contributions of $50 million.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm Monica Vinay, serving as the Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer at Myers Industries.\nYou can find the release on our company website, www.MyersIndustries.com, under the Investor Relations section if you haven't received a copy yet.\nThese statements are made in accordance with the Safe Harbor provisions outlined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThe statements are based on the management's current outlook and involve various risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to differ significantly from what is expressed or implied.\nAdditional information about these risks, uncertainties, and other factors can be found in the company's regular SEC filings, particularly in the 10-K and 10-Q reports.\nI'd like to express my pride in our employees, particularly for their unified effort in delivering strong results during a difficult quarter while maintaining safety.\nThanks to our teams' focus and commitment, we were able to achieve sales and operating results that exceeded our initial expectations.\nAs mentioned in today's announcement, our business units performed admirably during the quarter.\nWe continued to satisfy our customers' requirements and achieved higher-than-expected sales despite the complications arising from the COVID-19 crisis.\nOur consumer end market experienced a significant year-over-year increase in sales due to higher demand for our fuel containers.\nWe were also pleased to see increased demand in our auto aftermarket sector once stay-at-home restrictions were eased and more vehicles returned to the roads.\nOur business units once again achieved gross margin expansion this quarter.\nThe adjusted gross profit margin rose to 36% in the second quarter of 2020, up from 35% in the same period last year.\nThis improvement was attributed to strong operational execution and favorable price-cost margin, which more than compensated for the lower sales volume during the quarter.\nDue to the expansion in gross margin and reductions in SG&A costs, our operating margin remained stable during the quarter despite a 12% decrease in sales.\nWe're also glad to report that we generated positive free cash flow of $3.7 million during the quarter.\nConsequently, our balance sheet remains robust, and we continue to have substantial liquidity to support our operations and growth initiatives.\nOur entire team remains committed to maintaining safety while meeting customer needs and growing our businesses profitably.\nWe are confident that our company possesses the financial strength, high-quality products, and appropriate growth strategies to emerge as a stronger organization in the future, once this crisis subsides.\nMost importantly, our second-quarter performance demonstrates that we have a leading industry team capable of producing strong results even in the most challenging circumstances.\nNet sales for the second quarter amounted to $118 million, representing a 12% decrease compared to the second quarter of 2019.\nThe growth we experienced from fuel container sales in the consumer end market and the Tuffy acquisition in the distribution segment was outweighed by sales declines across our other end markets.\nThe gross profit margin increased by 100 basis points to 36%, primarily due to favorable price-cost margin and reduced operating costs.\nOur adjusted operating income fell by 14% to $12.3 million for the quarter\nThe adjusted operating income margin remained stable despite decreased sales volume\nThis resulted from the increased gross profit margin and reduced adjusted SG&A expenses year-over-year, mainly due to lower variable compensation and cost cuts\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.23, down from $0.27 in the second quarter of 2019\nThe Material Handling segment experienced a 15.7% decrease in net sales\nAs expected, the difficult business climate led to sales reductions in the Food and Beverage, vehicle, and industrial markets\nThese reductions outweighed the significant sales increase in the consumer market\nHowever, the overall lower sales volume was somewhat offset by favorable price-cost margin, positive sales mix, and reduced operating costs\nConsequently, the segment's adjusted operating income margin rose to 19.5% from 18.3% in the second quarter of the previous year\nThe Distribution segment saw a 2.2% sales decrease, as additional sales from the August 2019 Tuffy Manufacturing acquisition partially balanced out a decline in sales across the rest of the segment\nAs Mike mentioned earlier, demand in this market improved throughout the quarter as stay-at-home orders were lifted, closures eased, and more vehicles returned to the roads\nAs a result, sales during the quarter exceeded our expectations\nDistribution's adjusted operating income decreased to $1.6 million for this year's second quarter, compared to $3.3 million a year ago, primarily due to unfavorable sales mix\nThis was caused by two factors\nFirst, an unfavorable product mix due to higher equipment sales versus consumables during the quarter\nSecond, an unfavorable mix of acquisition versus base sales volume\nConsequently, the segment's adjusted operating income margin was 4.4%, down from 8.7% in the second quarter of 2019\nMoving to slide six, I'll discuss our balance sheet and cash flow\nIn the second quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow of $3.7 million, compared to $9.4 million last year\nWorking capital as a percentage of sales at the end of the second quarter was 9.9%, higher than in previous quarters\nThe increase in working capital was mainly due to higher accounts receivable and inventory balances resulting from strong June sales and strategic inventory investments to safeguard our supply chain during the crisis\nWe anticipate working capital will return to normal levels by year-end\nThe balance sheet showed $72 million in cash at the end of the second quarter, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.2 times, consistent with previous quarters\nIt's worth noting that this outlook is based on current and projected market conditions, and there remains significant uncertainty surrounding these projections\nWe now expect a year-over-year sales decrease in the mid to high single-digit range for the entire year, which is slightly better than our earlier projection of about a 10% decline.\nLet's examine our current outlook for each market segment.\nIn our consumer sector, the second quarter's demand surge exceeded our expectations.\nConsequently, we've revised our annual sales forecast for this market to a mid-single-digit increase, up from our previous estimate of a low single-digit rise.\nWe still anticipate a mid-single-digit revenue growth in our Food and Beverage sector for the full year.\nThe previous year's seedbox demand was negatively affected by a delayed spring season and customer mergers.\nWe expect improved demand in the upcoming season, which will occur in Q4 2020 and Q1 2021.\nAlthough RV market demand has started to recover, we don't expect the second-half improvement to fully offset the sales decline experienced in the first half of the year.\nFurthermore, automotive market demand remains weak, so we still predict vehicle sector sales to decrease by double digits for the entire year 2020.\nWe continue to anticipate a weak demand environment in industrial manufacturing for the rest of the year in our industrial sector.\nTherefore, we've maintained our industrial market outlook of a percentage decline in the low teens for the full year.\nIn the auto aftermarket, demand improved faster than expected once stay-at-home orders were lifted, leading us to now forecast a low single-digit sales decline, compared to our previous prediction of a high single-digit decrease.\nSlide eight displays our 2020 guidance.\nAs mentioned, we expect full-year sales to drop by mid to high single digits, a slight improvement from our previous forecast of about a 10% decline.\nWe still anticipate depreciation and amortization of approximately $21 million, net interest expense of $4 million, roughly 36 million diluted shares, and capital expenditures of about $15 million.\nWe now project an effective tax rate of 26%, slightly lower than our previous estimate of 27%.\nTo conclude, I'd like to make a few remarks.\nIn the coming months, we'll concentrate on driving profitable growth and increasing shareholder value.\nIn our Material Handling division, we plan to use a disciplined M&A approach to acquire companies that complement our expertise in plastics manufacturing.\nBesides M&A, we aim to grow organically by enhancing our commercial, sales, and marketing capabilities.\nWe're strengthening our teams and focus in these areas and expect positive outcomes in the future.\nIn Distribution, we'll continue implementing our transformation and improvement initiatives.\nThese include securing new business, expanding key accounts, enhancing our e-commerce platform, and optimizing our supply chain to reduce costs while improving service quality.\nBy focusing on our strategy and emphasizing execution, we'll continue to deliver strong results in the future.\nI'm enthusiastic about this journey and believe our teams are well-positioned for

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The provided information is preliminary and subject to change based on new data.\nWe disclaim any obligation to update previous statements with new information, except as required by law.\nHilltop's net income for Q4 2020 was $116 million or $1.35 per diluted share, an increase from $67 million or $0.81 per diluted share in Q4 2019.\nA final settlement of $3.7 million or $0.05 per diluted share from the National Lloyds sale was included.\nThe period's return on average assets was 2.8% and return on average equity was 21%.\nNet income for the full year 2020 was $448 million or $5 per diluted share.\nThis represented an increase from $225 million or $2.44 per diluted share in 2019.\nThe full-year results include $38 million from discontinued operations of National Lloyds.\nThe fourth quarter concluded an exceptional year of growth for the company.\nWe took advantage of a strong mortgage market, with quarterly originations reaching $6.8 billion, a $2.4 billion increase from the previous year.\nThe Bank's average loans for Q4 increased 8% year-over-year, driven by PPP loan balances, while average deposits grew by $2.3 billion or 26%.\nThe broker-dealer's net revenues increased by $37 million or 33% for the same period, mainly due to high volumes in Structured Finance, Public Finance, and Fixed Income businesses.\nOur robust capital position in 2020 allowed us to distribute $241 million in dividends and share repurchases.\nThis includes the Q4 Dutch auction tender, where Hilltop spent $193 million to buy back about 8 million common stock shares.\nOur Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per common share, a 33% increase from the previous quarter.\nThe dividend will be paid on February 26th, 2021.\nWe continued to assist our affected banking clients by approving COVID-related loan modifications during this period.\nThe total active deferrals balance as of December 31 was $240 million, down from $968 million at the end of Q2.\nOur allowance for credit losses as of December 31 was $149 million, or 2% of the Bank's loan portfolio.\nThis represents a $6.2 million decrease in the reserve balance from Q3, due to Q4 payoffs, lower-than-anticipated charge-offs, and a shift in economic outlook.\n2020 was a challenging year for everyone, but I believe it made our company stronger and better.\nI'm proud of how our team members across the company responded to support each other, our clients, and our communities.\nWhen the pandemic began, our treasury and capital markets teams quickly collaborated to manage the volatility and ensure our businesses had sufficient liquidity to meet client needs.\nOur technology, property management, and human resources groups worked together to efficiently transition 90% of our employees to remote work in less than a month.\nDespite the pandemic altering our work methods, Hilltop continued to make progress on major, complex initiatives.\nNotably, PlainsCapital Bank's team originated 2,800 PPP loans and deferred loan payments for commercial and consumer clients most affected by the pandemic in a short time.\nTheir efforts in supporting our banking clients highlight PlainsCapital's culture and the quality of our bankers.\n2020 was also a record-breaking year for the company.\nPrimeLending funded a record $23 billion in mortgage loans, Hilltop Securities generated record net revenues of $530 million, and Hilltop achieved record earnings.\nIt's important to note that we don't expect these favorable market conditions to persist indefinitely.\nAs we enter 2021, we believe Hilltop is well-positioned with established businesses, aligned leadership, and substantial capital.\nTurning to Slide 4.\nPlainsCapital Bank had a solid quarter, with pre-tax income of $59 million, including a negative provision of $3.6 million.\nNet interest income rose by $11 million from Q4 2019, driven by fees and interest income from PPP loans.\nThe net interest margin was 3.37% during the period, a 35 basis point increase from the previous quarter, as the Bank used cash from PPP loan payoffs to reduce sweep deposits from Hilltop Securities.\nPrimeLending had an exceptional fourth quarter, generating pre-tax income of $84 million, a $76 million increase from Q4 2019.\nThis was driven by a 54% increase in origination volumes and a gain on sale margin of 448 basis points, concluding an incredible year for the PrimeLending team.\nHilltopSecurities also had an outstanding quarter with pre-tax income of $34 million, a $10 million or 42% increase from Q4 2019.\nStructured Finance grew net revenue by 92% from Q4 2019, driven by a 57% increase in TBA lock volume.\nPublic Finance Services increased net revenue by 32% and Fixed Income Services grew net revenue by 45%, both due to high volumes, improved capabilities, and key talent additions.\nMoving to Slide 5.\nIn late 2017, we announced a comprehensive set of initiatives to enhance our platform and streamline operations, aiming to reduce operating costs and build a foundation for future growth.\nOur target was to achieve $84 million in run-rate PPNR benefit by the end of 2021.\nBy the end of 2020, we completed projects resulting in $90 million in revenue and cost benefits.\nThis program focused on three main areas: Enhanced Business Operations, Strategic Sourcing, and Shared Services.\nIn Enhanced Business Operations, we streamlined front-end operations by replacing legacy core systems with the Blue Sage loan origination system at PrimeLending and the FIS platform at HilltopSecurities.\nWe improved leadership alignment through succession planning and major organizational changes, such as PrimeLending's staff reorganization in 2018 and Hilltop's organizational restructuring in 2019.\nWe also established an agency MBS group at HilltopSecurities, complementing our mortgage origination businesses.\nIn Strategic Sourcing, we leveraged our organization's size to improve pricing and discounts with vendors.\nWe implemented an enterprise contract and procurement platform to manage contracts and vendors more effectively.\nWe introduced a single travel and entertainment platform to aggregate data and secure better rates and discounts.\nWe consolidated supplier sourcing for IT hardware and software, janitorial services, and office supplies.\nStrategic Sourcing has been a major initiative yielding positive outcomes, which we will continue to utilize in contract negotiations\nThe third and final focus area involved establishing a Shared Services unit to support the entire company\nThere was duplication across the organization in most functional areas\nBy centralizing certain responsibilities, we've improved controls, communication, and ongoing costs\nCrucially, our Shared Services unit has set us up to better scale and support both organic and acquisition-driven growth\nLet's begin with Page 6\nAs Jeremy mentioned, Hilltop reported Q4 2020 consolidated income of $116 million for common stockholders, or $1.35 per diluted share\nHilltop generated $113 million in income from continuing operations in Q4, equaling $1.30 per diluted share\nFor the full 2020 year, Hilltop reported $448 million in consolidated income for common stockholders, or $5.01 per diluted share\nIncome from continuing operations available to common stockholders was $409 million, or $4.59 per diluted share\nContinuing operations earnings per share doubled from $2.30 in 2019\nQ4 purchase accounting revenue was $5.7 million with $1.4 million in expenses, resulting in a $4.3 million net pre-tax impact\nCurrent period purchase accounting expenses mainly represent amortization of deposit and other intangible assets from previous acquisitions\nQ4 loan loss provisions showed a $3.5 million net recovery, including $2.7 million in net charge-offs\nImprovements in macroeconomic assumptions and client debt reductions led to a decrease in the loan loss allowance for the quarter\nHilltop's year-end capital ratios remain strong due to 2020 earnings and capital actions, with 18.97% common equity Tier 1 and 12.64% Tier 1 leverage ratio\nNow moving to Page 7\nHilltop's credit loss allowance decreased $6 million from Q3 2020, due to a slightly improved economic outlook and lower specific reserves from debt refinancing\nThe $149 million year-end credit loss allowance resulted in a 2.05% ACL to bank loans HFI ratio for 2020 year-end\nWe anticipate the credit loss allowance may fluctuate, with changes driven by loan growth, credit shifts, and economic outlook changes over time\nTurning to Page 8\nQ4 net interest income was $107 million, including $6.3 million in PPP fees and purchase accounting accretion\nNet interest income fell $3.4 million or 3% versus the prior year quarter\nNet interest margin increased 15 basis points from Q3 2020 due to PPP fee recognition and $500 million lower cash balances, though it declined year-over-year\nLoan yields face pressure while deposit costs remain somewhat high due to brokered deposits and CE balances\nQ4 loan originations averaged a 3.97% book yield, 7 basis points lower than Q3 2020\nInterest-bearing deposit costs decreased 5 basis points as customer rates were lowered and some brokered deposits were returned\nWe expect continued pressure on net interest income and margin due to low market rates impacting loan yields, with potentially aggressive competition ahead\nMoving to Page 9\nQ4 2020 non-interest income totaled $448 million\nMortgage-related income increased $140 million from Q4 2019\nQ4 2020 saw strong mortgage banking performance, exceeding expectations in origination volumes due to low rates driving refinance and purchase demand\nPurchase mortgages rose $725 million or 25% year-over-year, while refinances surged $1.7 billion or 116%\nGain on sale margins improved 8 basis points to 448 basis points from Q3 2020\nWe expect 2021 full-year average margins between 360-385 basis points, depending on market conditions\nOther income grew $31.5 million, mainly from improved sales and trading at Hilltop Securities' Capital Markets and Structured Finance units\nTBA lock volumes increased 57% year-over-year due to favorable market conditions\nThese businesses benefit from investments since Q3 2018, but can be volatile period-to-period due to rates, market liquidity, and production trends\nTurning to Page 10\nNon-interest expenses rose $94 million year-over-year to $402 million\nThe increase was primarily due to $79 million higher variable compensation at HilltopSecurities and PrimeLending, linked to strong fee revenue growth\nWe anticipate 2021 revenues declining from 2020's record levels, pressuring our efficiency ratio\nWe remain focused on improvement, leveraging investments to manage fixed costs while streamlining operations and accelerating digital transformation\nMoving to Page 11\nAverage HFI loans grew 7% from Q4 2019, mainly from Q2 PPP loan growth\nPeriod-end banking loans were stable year-over-year, with weak commercial loan demand during the pandemic\nWe plan to retain $30-50 million monthly in PrimeLending-originated consumer mortgages to offset commercial client demand, subject to market conditions\nIn Q4 2020, PrimeLending locked about $145 million in loans for PlainsCapital delivery, averaging 2.79% yield, 780 FICO, and 62% LTV\nLet's go to Page 12\nThis webpage emphasizes the ongoing efforts of our banking and credit teams to assist clients during the pandemic\nAs of December 31, 2020, Hilltop had roughly $240 million in loans under active deferral programs\nThis amount represents a 75% decrease from the previous active deferrals of $630 million\nThis loan portfolio has an allowance for credit losses of 17.3% and is primarily concentrated in Hotel and Restaurant sectors\nIt's crucial to note that we're managing this client portfolio and exposure in line with our existing credit policies, which led to credit rating reviews and adjustments in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 to reflect each borrower's current financial situation\nAs a result, out of the $240 million in loans with active deferrals, $202 million are currently classified as criticized loans\nWe remain committed to supporting our clients through difficult times while safeguarding the Bank's capital\nMoving to Page 13\nDuring the quarter, net charge-offs amounted to $2.7 million or 15 basis points of total HFI loans\nAs illustrated in the bottom right graph, the bank's allowance for credit loss coverage ended 2020 at 2.05%, including both mortgage warehouse lending and PPP loans\nWe maintain our belief that both mortgage warehouse lending and PPP loans will have lower loss content over time\nExcluding mortgage warehouse and PPP loans, the Bank's allowance for credit loss to loans HFI ratio is 2.48%\nProceeding to Page 14\nFourth quarter average total deposits were approximately $11.2 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion or 26% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019\nThroughout the pandemic, we've experienced unusually strong deposit inflows from our customers, driven by government stimulus efforts and changing client behaviors as customers remain cautious during these challenging times\nCustomer deposits grew by approximately $392 million from September 30, 2020, during the fourth quarter\nThis growth was offset by the return of an additional $200 million in HilltopSecurities sweep deposits and the maturity of $272 million in broker deposits, which we will continue to allow to roll off in the coming quarters\nAs of December 31, Hilltop held $731 million in broker deposits with a blended yield of 44 basis points\nOf these broker deposits, $469 million will mature by June 30, 2021, with an average yield of 40 basis points\nWhile deposit levels remain high, we continue to focus on expanding our client base and increasing wallet share through our treasury products and services\nThese efforts have been successful in 2020 and are expected to accelerate in 2021\nShifting to Page 15\nPlainsCapital Bank generated solid profitability in the fourth quarter of 2020, producing $59 million in pre-tax income\nThe Bank benefited from a $3.5 million provision for credit losses recapture and $6.3 million in PPP fees\nNon-interest expenses in the quarter reflect $3.8 million in writedowns on certain OREO assets, causing the efficiency ratio to increase this period\nDespite the challenges presented this year, we're pleased with the resilience of our clients and teammates across the business\nAs Jeremy mentioned, the team supported our clients by providing approximately 2,800 PPP loans in 2020 and deferring payments for customers most impacted by the pandemic\nThis year's work demonstrates a balance between customer support and protecting the Bank and Hilltop's principles\nIn 2021, the team remains focused on providing excellent service to our clients and achieving profitable growth while maintaining a moderate risk profile\nMoving to Page 16\nPrimeLending generated $84 million in pre-tax profit for the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by strong origination volumes that increased by $2.4 billion or 54% from the previous year\nAs mentioned earlier, gain on sale margins expanded during the fourth quarter\nWe continued retaining MSRs during the fourth quarter, with the MSR asset ending the year at a value of $144 million\nThroughout the second half of 2020, we reduced our retention percentage of servicing rights on sold loans to 57%\nWe plan to continue retaining servicing assets at these levels during the first half of 2021, subject to market conditions, and may execute bulk sales throughout the year if market participation is strong\n2020 was a record year for PrimeLending by almost all measures\nWe appreciate the teamwork and effort across Hilltop and PrimeLending in delivering these outstanding results for our customers and company\nIn 2021, PrimeLending will focus on generating profitable mortgage volume and continue to implement operational efficiencies across the business\nAdvancing to Page 17\nHilltopSecurities delivered $34 million in pre-tax profit for the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by strong performance in Structured Finance, Capital Markets, and Public Finance businesses\nThese areas have benefited from our ongoing investments in talent and infrastructure over the past few years, as well as a favorable market environment\nWhile activity was strong in the quarter, we continued to execute our growth plan by investing in bankers and sales professionals across the business\nThis strategy aims to support additional product delivery, enhance our offerings, and provide differentiated solutions to municipalities nationwide\nThis is evident in the fourth quarter Public Finance Services results, which saw net revenue growth of $8 million or 32% compared to the same period last year, despite overall market issuance volumes declining\nThe HilltopSecurities team is focused on delivering profitable revenue growth, optimizing operating expenses, and managing market and liquidity risk within a moderate risk profile\nProceeding to Page 17\nOur work over the past few years has positioned us well to capitalize on market opportunities by leveraging our franchise and enhanced infrastructure to serve customers while prioritizing the safety of our teams and clients during the challenging circumstances of 2020\nIn 2021, we remain committed to staying adaptable as the pandemic evolves, ensuring the safety of our teammates and clients\nOur financial priorities for 2021 continue to focus on delivering excellent customer service, attracting new customers, supporting our communities, maintaining a moderate risk profile, and creating long-term shareholder value\nDue to current market uncertainties, we are not providing specific financial guidance, but we will continue to offer commentary on our most current outlook for 2021\nWe acknowledge that the business environment, including the pandemic's impact, may remain volatile throughout the year\nWe will provide further updates during future quarterly calls\nSummary:

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:A recording of today's discussion will be available on our Investor Relations webpage at investors.dicks.com for roughly one year.\nLet's address some administrative matters.\nTo begin, we'll explain our approach to reporting same-store sales.\nOur overall same-store sales calculations include stores that were temporarily shut down last year due to COVID-19.\nDifferent retailers use various methods to calculate comparable sales, including how they handle temporary store closures caused by COVID-19.\nAs a result, our calculation method may differ from other retailers.\nAdditionally, due to the irregular nature of 2020, we based our 2021 plans on 2019 figures.\nTherefore, we will compare 2021 sales and earnings to both 2019 and 2020.\nLastly, for planning purposes, we intend to release our fourth quarter 2021 earnings report before the market opens on March 8, 2022, followed by an earnings call at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.\nWe're delighted to report another exceptional quarter with substantial sales and earnings growth compared to both last year and 2019.\nOur strategies continue to be effective as we reimagine the athlete experience in our core business and with new concepts.\nWe have generated strong profitable growth at DICK's.\nEarlier this year, we introduced two DICK'S House of Sport stores, highly interactive destinations that are transforming sports retail.\nThe changes we've implemented in our Golf Galaxy business are performing exceptionally well.\nOur second Public Land store recently opened, focusing on outdoor activities.\nLooking forward, I'm incredibly enthusiastic about the future of DICK's Sporting Goods.\nWe now anticipate delivering comp sales of over 20% for 2021, and remain very confident in our business's long-term prospects.\nBefore delving into our Q3 results, it's important to note that our current success stems from a transformational journey that began in late 2017 when we started making significant changes across our business.\nWe also enhanced our service and selling culture, made our stores more experiential, and reallocated floor space to regionally relevant and growing categories.\nThese changes drove improved results and significantly enhanced our comp sales trajectory, well before the pandemic.\nFor years, we've invested in technology and data science to build our best-in-class omnichannel platform.\nThis allowed us to quickly meet athlete needs and capitalize on strong consumer demand throughout 2020, resulting in a full-year comp sales increase of nearly 10%.\nWe announced today that we've raised our full-year guidance for the third time this year, and now expect our comp sales to increase between 24% and 25%.\nDuring a time when consumers are making lasting lifestyle changes with an increased focus on health and fitness and greater participation in outdoor activities, we believe that DICK's Sporting Goods has become synonymous with sport in the United States.\nNearly our entire category portfolio has rebaselined significantly higher compared to pre-COVID sales levels.\nWe've capitalized on strong consumer demand and have gained considerable market share in key categories, driven by enhanced product access, service, and omnichannel capabilities.\nLooking ahead, we are well positioned to continue gaining share and we remain optimistic about the long-term demand trends in our most important categories like athletic apparel, footwear, team sports and golf.\nWe also remain very optimistic about longer-term EBT margin, driven by several permanent changes compared to pre-COVID levels.\nThese changes include a highly differentiated product assortment that is less susceptible to broader promotional pressures; more granular management in promotions and significantly higher profitability of our eCommerce channel.\nReturning to our Q3 results, consolidated same-store sales increased 12.2% on top of a 23.2% increase in the same period last year, and a 6% increase in Q3 2019.\nDriven by our strong sales and gross margin rate expansion, on a non-GAAP basis, our third quarter earnings per diluted share of $3.19 increased 59% over last year and 513% over Q3 2019.\nOur Q3 comps were supported by broad-based growth across our business, as our strong execution, diverse category portfolio and world-class omnichannel platform helped us continue to capitalize on and meet robust consumer demand despite a dynamic global supply chain.\nWe're continuing to see strong retention of the 8.5 million new athletes we acquired last year, and we added another 1.7 million new athletes during this quarter.\nOur active athlete database is at a record high.\nOur increasingly differentiated product assortment, combined with our disciplined promotional strategy and cadence is continuing to drive significantly higher merchandise margin rate.\nDuring the quarter, we expanded our merchandise margin rate by 301 basis points versus 2020 and by 578 basis points versus 2019.\nAs we discussed previously, we're focused on enhancing the athlete experience across our entire omnichannel ecosystem.\nIn our stores, we continue to make DICK's a great place to work, as we know that our people are our competitive differentiator and a great teammate experience drives a great athlete experience.\nIn fact, we recently earned a place on Fortune's list of Best Workplaces in Retail for 2021.\nWe're also engaging our athletes with new and elevated service standards and making our stores more experiential.\nThese strategies are working and continue to set us apart within the marketplace.\nDuring the quarter, our brick-and-mortar stores comped up approximately 15% versus last year and delivered a 31% sales increase when compared to 2019.\nImportantly, our stores continue to be the hub of our omnichannel strategy, enabling over 90% of our total sales and fulfilling approximately 70% of our online sales in Q3.\nRegarding our eCommerce business, during the quarter, we were pleased to deliver online sales growth of 1%, which was on top of a 95% increase in the same period last year.\nOur online sales remained substantially above pre-COVID levels, increasing nearly 100% when compared to the same period in 2019.\nImportantly, we also continue to drive a significant improvement in the profitability of our eCommerce channel by leveraging fixed costs, sustained athlete adoption of in-store pickup and curbside, as well as fewer and more targeted promotions.\nBeyond our omnichannel platform, our portfolio of brands is a tremendous asset.\nWe are making substantial investments in our highly lucrative and expanding vertical brands.\nOur exclusive brands like DSG, CALIA, and VRST are enhancing our product range and gaining significant popularity among our customers.\nWhile many national brands are reducing their distribution channels and concentrating on key partners, DICK's provides them with a unique and valuable platform.\nOur company is deeply rooted in sports and can display a brand's entire product line, including clothing, shoes, and equipment, across our network of over 800 stores and online platform.\nOur brand partners continue to make considerable investments in our business annually and provide us with increasing allocations of exclusive and unique products.\nThese premium products are highly sought after and rarely discounted, driving significant sales and profit growth.\nOur strategic relationships with key brands are stronger than ever, and we're making significant commitments to important brand partners.\nWe recently announced a groundbreaking new collaboration with Nike that we believe will revolutionize the sports industry.\nThis partnership will allow DICK'S and Nike to create unparalleled value for our customers through exclusive products, experiences, content, and special offers.\nWe will leverage our combined strengths and capabilities to expand our reach, engage with more athletes, and most importantly, serve them better.\nOur companies have a long history of successful collaboration, and this partnership represents a deepening of the relationship between DICK's and Nike.\nThis collaboration aims to drive growth for both companies while providing personalized service to our customers.\nAt DICK'S, we prioritize mobile technology, and we're thrilled to launch this partnership through a connected marketplace exclusively on our DICK's mobile app.\nIn the future, we will explore additional ways to collaborate with Nike and our other strategic partners across our physical and digital platforms to further enhance convenience, experiences, and content for our customers.\nNow, I'd like to provide some updates on our newest retail concept.\nWe are very satisfied with the performance of our first two DICK's House of Sport stores in Rochester and Knoxville.\nHouse of Sport is built around experience, service, community, and product, setting a new standard for sports retail and customer engagement.\nWe plan to continue refining and expanding the House of Sport concept, while applying key learnings to the rest of the DICK's chain.\nWe're also encouraged by the early results of our first two Golf Galaxy performance centers near Boston and Minneapolis-St. Paul.\nThe Golf Galaxy Performance Center has been completely redesigned and equipped with advanced golf technologies like TrackMan and BioMech.\nWe've also invested in talent to ensure our staff become trusted advisors to golf enthusiasts of all skill levels.\nIn addition to innovating within our core business, we've launched Public Lands, a new omnichannel specialty concept to better serve outdoor enthusiasts.\nOur first Public Lands store recently opened in Pittsburgh, and our second store opened in Columbus a few weeks ago.\nWe also launched publiclands.com, a comprehensive online shopping experience for outdoor enthusiasts.\nAlthough it's still early, Public Lands has had a strong start, and we're very optimistic about this growth opportunity and its goal to encourage more people to explore and protect America's public lands.\nBefore concluding, I want to address the supply chain situation.\nIn this dynamic environment, our team has done an excellent job collaborating with our vendor partners and vertical brand manufacturers to ensure a steady flow of products to meet strong demand.\nWe placed aggressive orders to stay ahead of disruptions, resulting in a 7.3% increase in our quarter-ending inventory levels compared to the same period last year.\nWhile inventory challenges will persist across the market, our fourth quarter has started strong, and we believe we are well-positioned within our industry for the holiday season.\nIn conclusion, we have exciting growth opportunities ahead of us.\nAs Ed mentioned, we are very confident in the long-term prospects of our business.\nAs we continue to execute our strategic priorities and reimagine the customer experience, we believe our investments in transforming our business will strengthen our leadership position in the marketplace.\nOur employees are at the heart of this transformation.\nNavdeep joined the company in 2017 as SVP of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer and was appointed CFO last month.\nNavdeep has had a significant impact on our business.\nOver the past four years, he has led most of the company's finance functions and has become a trusted partner to our entire executive team.\nHe has also spearheaded company-wide productivity efforts, served on our long-term Strategic Committee, and played a crucial role in securing financing at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBefore joining DICK's, Navdeep spent 11 years at Advance Auto Parts in various leadership roles, most recently as Senior Vice President of Finance.\nEarlier in his career, Navdeep held various management positions at Sprint Nextel and served as a lieutenant in the Indian Navy.\nNavdeep's financial expertise and strategic vision will be crucial to DICK's continued growth and success.\nWith that, I'm pleased to hand it over to you, Navdeep.\nWith three quarters of the year behind us, our consistently strong results have demonstrated our ability to serve our customers in a unique way while driving towards another record year for sales and earnings in 2021.\nLet's start with a brief overview of our third quarter results.\nAs Lauren mentioned, we're pleased to report a consolidated sales increase of 13.9% to approximately $2.75 billion.\nConsolidated same-store sales increased 12.2%, building on a 23.2% increase in the same period last year and a 6% increase in Q3 of 2019.\nOur strong comparable sales were driven by growth across our three primary categories: hardlines, apparel, and footwear, as well as an 8.5% increase in transactions and a 3.7% increase in average ticket value.\nCompared to 2019, consolidated sales increased by 40%.\nOur brick-and-mortar stores saw a comparable sales increase of approximately 15% versus 2020 and delivered a 31% sales increase compared to 2019, with roughly the same square footage.\nOur eCommerce sales grew 1% compared to last year, following a 95% online sales increase in the third quarter of 2020.\nCompared to Q3 of 2019, our eCommerce sales increased by 97%.\nOur online sales have increased from 13% of total net sales in 2019 to 19% in the current quarter.\nLast year, eCommerce accounted for 21% of our business.\nLet's discuss gross profit.\nIn Q3, gross profit reached $1.06 billion, representing 38.45% of net sales, a 354 basis point improvement year-over-year.\nThis enhancement was primarily due to a 301 basis point increase in merchandise margin rate and 111 basis points of leverage on fixed occupancy costs from higher sales.\nThe merchandise margin improvement was mainly attributed to reduced promotions, thanks to our unique product range and strategic promotional approach, as some market sectors continue to face supply constraints.\nWe also benefited from a favorable sales mix.\nFurthermore, we implemented selective price increases to offset higher supply chain and input costs.\nAs anticipated, these improvements were partly counterbalanced by increased freight expenses due to global supply chain disruptions and our focus on inventory availability over cost reduction.\nCompared to 2019, gross profit as a percentage of net sales improved by 886 basis points, driven by a 578 basis point expansion in merchandise margin rate due to fewer promotions, and 370 basis points of leverage on fixed occupancy costs, partially offset by higher freight costs.\nSG&A expenses totaled $631.9 million, or 23% of net sales, leveraging 151 basis points compared to last year, primarily due to increased sales.\nSG&A costs rose by $40.8 million, mainly due to current year expenses supporting sales growth.\nThe previous year's Q3 included $43 million in COVID-related expenses.\nThis year, we shifted our hourly employees to long-term focused compensation programs, including earlier and larger annual raises and higher minimum wages, partially offsetting last year's COVID-related costs.\nCompared to 2019 and on a non-GAAP basis, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales leveraged 325 basis points, primarily due to increased sales.\nSG&A costs increased by $116.8 million due to higher store payroll and operating expenses to support sales growth, as well as investments in hourly wage rates.\nDriven by strong sales and gross margin expansion, non-GAAP EBT reached $415.6 million, or 15.12% of net sales, an increase of $171.8 million or 501 basis points from the same period last year.\nCompared to 2019, non-GAAP EBT grew by $355.6 million, or roughly 1,200 basis points as a percentage of net sales.\nOverall, we achieved a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.19.\nThis represents a 59% year-over-year increase from $2.01 last year, and a 513% increase from $0.52 in 2019.\nOn a GAAP basis, our earnings per diluted share were $2.78.\nThis figure includes $7.7 million in non-cash interest expense and 12.8 million additional shares, which we expect to be offset by our bond hedge at settlement but are required in the GAAP diluted share calculation.\nBoth of these are related to the convertible notes we issued in Q1 2020.\nRegarding our balance sheet.\nWe are in a strong financial position, ending Q3 with about $1.37 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and no borrowings on our $1.855 billion revolving credit facility.\nOur quarter-end inventory levels increased by 7.3% compared to the end of Q3 last year.\nLooking forward, we continue to aggressively pursue product to meet demand and prioritize inventory availability over costs.\nWe expect elevated freight expenses to persist at least through the fourth quarter and have factored this into our outlook.\nTo echo Lauren's statement, while supply chain challenges will continue across the market, we believe we are well-positioned within our industry for this holiday season.\nRegarding our third quarter capital allocation.\nDuring the quarter, net capital expenditures were $54.1 million.\nWe paid $503 million in dividends, including a special dividend of $5.50 per share announced last quarter.\nWe also bought back 2.17 million shares of our stock for approximately $273 million at an average price of $125.80.\nWe have about $605 million remaining under our share repurchase program.\nYear-to-date, we have returned nearly $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nMoving forward, we will continue investing in our business's profitable growth while maintaining an appropriate cash balance.\nReturning capital to shareholders will remain an important part of our capital allocation strategy.\nNow, let's discuss our fiscal 2021 outlook for sales and earnings.\nAlthough it's early, Q4 has started strong.\nConsidering this, along with our significant Q3 results, expectations of continued strong consumer demand, and our confidence in managing global supply chain challenges, we are raising our consolidated same-store sales guidance.\nWe now expect full-year comp sales to increase by 20% to 25%, up from our previous expectation of 18% to 20%.\nThis is on top of a 9.9% increase in consolidated same-store sales last year and a 3.7% increase in 2019.\nAt the midpoint, our updated comp sales guidance represents a 39% sales increase versus 2019, compared to our prior expectation of 33%.\nOn a non-GAAP EBT basis, we expect full-year results to be between $1.89 billion and $1.92 billion, up from our previous outlook of $1.61 billion to $1.67 billion.\nAt the midpoint and on a non-GAAP basis, this represents a 333% increase versus 2019 and a 160% increase versus 2020.\nAt the midpoint, non-GAAP EBT margin is expected to be approximately 15.7%.\nWithin this, gross margin is expected to increase compared to both 2019 and 2020, driven by leverage on fixed expenses and higher merchandise margins.\nThis assumes higher freight costs and fewer promotions compared to both 2019 and 2020 for the fourth quarter.\nSG&A expenses are expected to leverage versus both 2019 and 2020, due to the significant projected increase in full-year sales.\nIn total, we are raising our full-year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share outlook to a range of $14.60 to $14.80, up from our previous outlook of $12.45 to $12.95.\nAt the midpoint and on a non-GAAP basis, our updated earnings per share guidance represents a 298% increase versus 2019 and a 140% increase versus 2020.\nIn conclusion, our efforts over recent years to redesign our strategy, operations, and financials position us well to deliver improved long-term value to our shareholders.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:This year has been challenging for everyone.\nDespite the difficulties, Stride has managed to succeed.\nOur success is attributed to the dedication of our numerous team members.\nThese individuals have shown unwavering commitment to our customers and families seeking alternative educational approaches, especially during these unprecedented times.\nThis year also saw a mainstream focus on online and distance learning globally, though experiences varied.\nMany schools across the nation grappled with inconsistency and uncertainty as they alternated between online and in-person instruction.\nOur educational resources are specifically designed to address this need.\nSome have resisted adopting this approach.\nOthers recognize its potential when implemented correctly.\nWe stand out, having provided online education to millions of students.\nWhile many schools experienced learning losses and declining test scores, our results surpassed expectations despite onboarding a record number of families.\nI will explain how we're adapting this approach.\nTo begin, I'll highlight some of our achievements in fiscal 2021.\nWe had an exceptional year by nearly every metric.\nWe assisted over 250,000 full-time students and attracted millions more to our programs.\nLearning loss became widespread, except in the schools under our management.\nIt's no surprise that national data revealed an overall decline in enrollment.\nWe released our inaugural ESG report, supported by several key initiatives.\nWe formed a new partnership with the National Association of Black Male Educators to increase teacher diversity nationwide.\nWe collaborated with Teach for America to share practical online teaching experience.\nWe launched the We Stand Together College Scholarship, a $10 million multi-year commitment to support underrepresented students.\nWe're not relying solely on pandemic-driven growth for our long-term strategy.\nWe changed our company name from K12 to Stride to better reflect our commitment to providing educational opportunities for learners at all levels.\nWe purchased two high-growth, high-margin companies to expand our adult Career Learning offerings.\nWe hosted an Investor Day to outline our strategy and growth trajectory through fiscal year 2025, which we believe we're on track to achieve, and we raised nearly $360 million through a convertible note offering to fund further organic and inorganic growth.\nOur General Education business saw student enrollment increase by almost 50%.\nDespite the past year's uncertainty, we experienced significant improvements in retention across both our General Education and Career Education businesses.\nWe didn't observe a mass exodus of students in the second half of the school year as many states began reopening their physical schools.\nThis demonstrates the appeal and value of our programs.\nAs previously mentioned, students enrolled in our Career Learning programs tend to have higher retention rates than our General Education students, a trend we expect to continue.\nWe also had a record number of families re-register for the fall.\nOur Career Learning business ended the year with over $250 million in revenue.\nThis represents an increase from less than $10 million just four years ago, a 150% compound annual growth rate.\nThis year, we saw growth exceeding 125% to nearly 30,000 students.\nThese programs offer career paths without the need for expensive college degrees.\nWe're expanding the programs from our MedCerts acquisition to offer high school students certificates in the healthcare industry.\nBoth our MedCerts and Tech Elevator acquisitions continue to grow, contribute to the bottom line, and exceed our expectations.\nThey represent high-growth, high-margin market opportunities that we'll continue to leverage in other areas of our business, particularly our high school programs.\nWe'll maintain our focus on IT and healthcare training as these industries are projected to add over 2.5 million new positions in the US by 2029.\nHowever, our Galvanize acquisition hasn't performed as planned.\nWe've restructured this business and believe we now have a path to renewed growth and profitability for the coming year.\nWe'll also explore ways to invest in and expand our adult learning offerings with the goal of making Career Learning a billion-dollar-plus business.\nIn June, we published our first ESG initiatives report.\nAs an education and career development company, we have a unique chance to contribute to worldwide goals in education, workforce development, and diversity and inclusion.\nOur environmental, social, and governance initiatives are founded on four key principles: promoting lifelong learning for today's competitive workforce, advancing racial and socioeconomic equity and inclusion, encouraging transparent leadership and professional growth, and working towards a more sustainable world.\nI believe our emphasis on learning outcomes is the most crucial aspect of our ESG efforts.\nStride is uniquely positioned to positively impact the lives of millions of students across all age groups.\nFew companies have such a significant influence or bear such a responsibility.\nWe take this responsibility very seriously.\nIt's now widely recognized that there are significant workforce shortages.\nStride is well-equipped to help address this shortage.\nWe've established 10-year objectives focused on learner outcomes to address this issue.\nOur aims for 2030 include graduating over 100,000 students from our Stride career high school program, producing hundreds of thousands of graduates from our adult programs, and achieving leading graduation and learning growth rates for over a million students.\nOur report provides more detailed information about our ESG initiatives.\nI urge everyone to review it.\nLet's now discuss the fiscal year 2022.\nThe long-term outlook for our General Education and Career Learning businesses remains extremely positive.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has heightened public awareness of the necessity and advantages of online education for K-12 and adult learners.\nWhile it's not suitable for everyone, many students and families have discovered that online learning and its flexibility is a preferred alternative.\nThe increased awareness and openness to diverse educational options fundamentally provides a long-term boost for all aspects of our business.\nAs is our annual practice, we'll aim to provide formal fiscal 2022 guidance during our first quarter earnings call in October.\nAlthough we're not offering guidance at this time, I'd like to share some insights into current enrollment trends.\nEven in August, we're still less than halfway through our typical enrollment season.\nThis means these trends could change in the coming weeks.\nMoreover, the pandemic has increased uncertainty around all these metrics, so please don't extrapolate from what I'm about to say.\nWe haven't observed a massive return to brick-and-mortar schools [Technical Issues].\nWe're currently surpassing the number of re-registrations we saw during fiscal 2021 and in previous years.\nAt present, we're well ahead of where we would normally be in enrollments compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nAwareness of our offerings is at an all-time high; the pandemic helped drive awareness [Technical Issues] and now families just need to choose.\nConversion rates from our new leads are at an all-time high.\nThis means when families seek us out, they're more likely to enroll.\nWe believe health and safety continue to be top priorities for families, and we're seeing even stronger demand in states where the Delta variant has surged.\nOur goal is clear: to grow every year, and importantly, we remain on track to achieve the long-term revenue and profitability targets we outlined during last fall's Investor Day.\nWe still anticipate achieving revenue of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion and adjusted operating income of $250 million to $350 million by 2025.\nNow I'll hand over to Tim to discuss our full year 2021 results.\nLet me summarize our reported results.\nRevenue for the full fiscal year 2021 was $1.54 billion, a 48% increase over the previous fiscal year.\nAdjusted operating income was $161.4 million, up 160% compared to the prior year.\nCapital expenditures were $52.3 million, an increase of $7.3 million over last year.\nIn each case, these results met or exceeded the expectations we provided in our guidance last quarter.\nThe outperformance was primarily driven by favorable revenue from enrollment and retention.\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2022, it's still too early to confidently forecast our current date enrollments for the reasons James just outlined.\nGiven where we are in the process, there remains variability around two key factors: ongoing re-registration and new enrollments, and the retention of these enrollments once school starts and through September.\nHere's what I can say today about fiscal year 2022.\nWe expect year-over-year growth in adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA compared to our strong fiscal year 2021 results.\nFurthermore, we believe the increased awareness and acceptance of online and hybrid education, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has sustainably reset the baseline for the General Education business.\nWe are certain that General Education revenue in the 2022 fiscal year will substantially exceed that of fiscal year 2020.\nWe will hold off on providing guidance until we present our first quarter fiscal 2022 results in October, as we have done previously.\nAt that point, we will have a much clearer picture of enrollments for the upcoming academic year.\nLet's now discuss our fiscal year 2021 results.\nOur General Education business saw a revenue increase of $346 million, or 37%, reaching $1.28 billion.\nThis increase was primarily due to higher enrollment numbers, partially counteracted by a decrease in revenue per student.\nGeneral education enrollments increased by 45% year-over-year, surpassing 156,000, while revenue per student decreased by 5%.\nThe reduction in revenue per student was mainly attributed to state budget constraints resulting from COVID-19 and a higher proportion of states with lower funding.\nBased on current information about state budgets and policies, we anticipate an improvement in revenue per student next year, as mentioned in our previous quarterly report.\nCareer Learning revenue grew to $256.6 million in fiscal year 2021, marking a 140% increase.\nThis growth was fueled by significantly higher participation in our Stride Career Prep Programs, as well as organic growth and new acquisitions in our adult learning sector.\nWe plan to continue expanding our Stride Career Prep Programs in fiscal year 2022, with intentions to launch four new programs and expand eight existing ones.\nGross margins increased to 34.8%, a 140 basis point improvement compared to fiscal 2020, driven by increased contributions from higher-margin adult learning businesses and reduced costs from efficiency and automation initiatives.\nWe expect this margin improvement trend to continue into fiscal 2022.\nWe are confident in achieving our 36% to 39% gross margin targets well ahead of our initial fiscal 2025 goal, which was communicated during our November 2020 Investor Day.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses rose to $424.4 million, a 35% increase from fiscal 2020.\nThis increase in SG&A was primarily due to higher costs associated with enrollment growth, increased stock-based compensation expenses, and the full-year inclusion of expenses from our adult learning businesses.\nAdjusted EBITDA reached $239.9 million, representing an 87% increase over fiscal year 2020.\nThe adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 400 basis points, rising from 12% of revenue in fiscal year 2020 to 16% in fiscal year 2021.\nThe growth in adjusted EBITDA and margin improvement are attributed to higher revenue and enhanced operating leverage.\nStock-based compensation expense increased to $39.3 million, up 67% year-over-year, due to the timing of certain stock-based grants related to our Career Learning business.\nWe anticipate stock-based compensation expense to decrease to a range of $30 million to $34 million in fiscal year 2022.\nInterest expense for fiscal 2021 totaled $18 million, aligning with our previous quarter's expectations.\nThis comprised approximately $5 million in cash interest and $13 million in non-cash amortization of the discount and fees on our convertible senior notes.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we adopted new accounting guidance related to our convertible notes ahead of schedule.\nThis will eliminate the non-cash debt discount expense, among other effects.\nConsequently, we expect our interest expense in fiscal year 2022 to be significantly lower and more in line with the cash interest recognized in fiscal year 2021.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was 26%, below the guidance range provided last quarter.\nWe benefited from some positive tax effects related to stock-based compensation, which lowered our tax rate for the year.\nIn fiscal year 2022, we expect an increase in non-deductible compensation, which will likely push our tax rate closer to the 28% to 30% range.\nCapital expenditures for the year totaled $52.3 million, a 16% increase from the previous year, primarily due to higher capitalized software development costs associated with adult learning, automation, and platform improvements.\nCapital expenditures as a percentage of revenue were 3.4%, lower than our historical average of approximately 4% to 5% over recent years.\nFree cash flow, defined as cash from operations minus capital expenditures, amounted to $81.9 million for fiscal year 2021.\nThis was about $45 million below the expectations provided at the Investor Day last November, entirely due to the timing of receipts, which resulted in lower than expected cash from operations.\nSome timing issues were related to our growth in states that typically pay in the following year, while others were due to delayed payments because of COVID.\nWe anticipate significantly higher free cash flow in fiscal 2022, reflecting the resolution of these timing issues from fiscal 2021.\nWe concluded the year with cash and cash equivalents of $386.1 million, an increase of $173.8 million compared to the same period last year.\nWe believe our strong free cash flow generation and liquidity will continue to provide the financial flexibility to fund our existing operations and pursue strategic acquisitions.\nTo recap, fiscal 2021 was a milestone year for Stride.\nWe experienced record enrollments in both our General Education and Career Learning businesses, driving double-digit growth in revenue, adjusted operating income, and adjusted EBITDA.\nOur Career Learning segment, which generated less than $7 million in revenue four years ago, produced over a quarter billion dollars in revenue this year, demonstrating the significant demand for Career Education offerings and Stride's innovation and leadership in this market.\nFurthermore, we continued to enhance our margin profile and strengthen our cash and liquidity position while maintaining a low level of debt.\nAs James mentioned, we are extremely optimistic about our business prospects and will continue to execute our high-growth career learning strategy and margin expansion

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These assertions should not be overly relied upon as they do not guarantee future results.\nOur discussion may include non-standard financial metrics.\nOur CFO, Harp Rana, is here with me today.\nWe maintained our strong performance from late last year into the beginning of 2021.\nWe achieved record profits of $25.5 million and $2.31 earnings per share in Q1.\nOur expansion strategies helped mitigate typical Q1 declines and the effects of new stimulus payments, leading to robust revenue.\nWe maintained excellent credit quality with historically low delinquency rates over 30 days.\nDespite tax refunds and two stimulus payments, our core loan portfolio grew 2% year-over-year and only decreased 2.5% quarter-over-quarter.\nThis impressive outcome was partly due to the effective new growth strategies implemented last year.\nWe issued $231 million in loans, up 1% from last year and 5% from Q1 2019, with $29 million from new growth initiatives.\nThe $600 stimulus checks seemed to be used quickly.\nThe $1,400 stimulus led to a brief increase in loan payments and a slight decrease in loan demand.\nWhile stimulus affected Q1 demand, its impact on our typical Q1 loan portfolio reduction was much less than anticipated and less severe than for others in our industry and prime credit.\nOur large loan portfolio actually increased by $4 million or 0.6% in Q1, as stimulus disproportionately affected our higher-interest small loan portfolio.\nLoan demand remained weak in April due to the final 20% of stimulus payments and additional tax refunds.\nDemand began to improve in late April, and we expect it to continue recovering in May and June, likely resulting in modest Q2 loan growth.\nWe anticipate strong loan demand in the second half of the year as the economy further reopens.\nCredit quality remained excellent in Q1, and our financial position remains strong.\nOur net credit loss rate was 7.7%, improving by 280 basis points year-over-year.\nWe ended Q1 with a record-low 30+ day delinquency rate of 4.3%, a 230 basis point improvement from March 2020.\nAs of April 30, our 30+ day contractual delinquency rate further improved to about 3.7%.\nWe anticipate continued strong credit performance throughout 2021.\nAny COVID-related credit losses are not expected until late 2021 at the earliest, though we expect delinquency rates to normalize as federal stimulus effects diminish.\nDue to our superior credit performance, we released $6.6 million in COVID-19 reserves and $3.8 million in additional reserves from seasonal portfolio reduction in Q1.\nOur $139.6 million allowance for credit losses as of March 31 compares favorably to our $47.7 million in 30+ day contractual delinquencies.\nOur allowance includes a $23.8 million reserve for potential COVID-19 related credit losses.\nWe remain cautious in maintaining COVID reserves as the economy has not fully recovered from the pandemic.\nWe continue to strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity.\nIn April, we expanded our warehouse facility capacity with new facilities from Wells Fargo, Credit Suisse, and JPMorgan.\nThe new facilities fund various loan types, including small loans, large loans, convenience checks, and digital loans.\nWe're pleased with this development, which represents another step in evolving our capital structure to support growth and capital return plans.\nWe're happy to announce a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share.\nIn May, we completed a $30 million stock buyback program, repurchasing 951,841 shares at an average price of $31.52.\nOur board has authorized a new $30 million stock repurchase program to start this month.\nOur strong performance over the past year has allowed us to maintain and expand an attractive shareholder return program.\nAs mentioned previously, 2021 is a year of investment in long-term growth.\nWe're focusing on enhancing digital capabilities, expanding geographically, and developing new products and channels for future growth.\nIn Q1, we finished developing and began testing an improved digital pre-qualification process for customers.\nDigital originations accounted for 33% of new borrower branch volume in Q1 and 25% of all branch originations in March.\nWe're pleased with the success of our digital investments and customer adoption of our expanding omnichannel model.\nWe plan to roll out the new pre-qualification process to all states in Q2 and Q3, and integrate it with existing and new digital affiliates and lead generators.\nWe'll soon begin testing a new guaranteed loan offer program as an alternative to convenience checks, offering online settlement with direct bank account funding.\nWe're on track to test end-to-end digital origination for new and existing customers later this year.\nBy Q1 2022, we expect to launch an improved online customer portal and mobile app.\nAs previously mentioned, we launched operations in Illinois, our twelfth state, in mid-April and are enthusiastic about offering our valuable loan products to millions of new customers in the region\nWe anticipate opening between 15 and 20 new branches net in 2021\nWe also expect to expand into up to two more states by the end of 2021 and an additional four to six states in the next year and a half\nOur territorial expansion will be complemented by our digital and new growth strategies, enabling our branches in these states to cover a broader area, resulting in higher average receivables per branch and fewer required locations\nOur digital investments and geographic expansion will also introduce new products to our customers, including our recently tested auto-secured product, which we plan to roll out across all our states by the end of the third quarter\nWe are very optimistic about the remainder of this year and the future prospects for our business\nWe will continue to invest in our growth initiatives throughout the year while maintaining our focus on credit quality and enhancing our overall underwriting capabilities\nAs of March 31, roughly 70% of our total portfolio had been originated since April 2020\nThe majority of these loans were subject to enhanced credit standards implemented following the onset of the pandemic\nOur credit performance and underwriting capabilities remain fundamental to our operational success and give us confidence as we pursue our long-term growth strategies\nWe are extremely pleased with our first-quarter performance, which reflects the strength and dedication of the entire regional team\nWe remain fully committed to our customers and our future direction, and we are well-positioned to generate strong top and bottom-line growth for the full year\nAs we execute our priorities this year, we are also looking ahead to 2022 and beyond\nWe are concentrating on our key strategic initiatives of digital innovation, geographic expansion, and the development of new products and channels, all of which will enable us to gain market share and create sustainable, long-term value for our shareholders\nAllow me to provide a more detailed overview of our first-quarter results\nWe achieved net income of 25.5 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.31, resulting from our growth initiatives, stable operating expenses, lower funding costs, and strong credit performance\nAs shown on Page 4, branch originations were similar to the previous year, with 169.7 million of loans originated at the end of the first quarter\nMeanwhile, we increased direct mail and digital originations by 9% year over year to 61.7 million\nOur total originations were 231.4 million, a 1% increase year-over-year and 5% higher than the first quarter of 2019, despite two rounds of government stimulus payments in the first quarter\nOur new growth initiative generated 29 million in first quarter originations\nPage 5 illustrates our portfolio growth and mix trends through March 31\nWe ended the quarter with net finance receivables of 1.1 billion, up 3 million from the prior-year period as we continue to successfully implement our new growth initiatives and marketing efforts\nOur core loan portfolio grew by 18 million, or 1.7%, from the previous year and decreased only 2.5% from the end of the fourth quarter, in line with normal seasonal liquidation despite the two rounds of government stimulus\nSmall loans decreased 8% quarter over quarter due to the disproportionate impact of the stimulus payments on this portfolio, while large loans grew slightly at 0.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020\nFor the second quarter, as Rob mentioned, we anticipate some lingering impact from the third round of stimulus and tax refunds due to the extended tax season in April, followed by a rebound in demand this month and next\nOverall, we expect to see modest quarter-over-quarter growth in our finance receivables portfolio in the second quarter\nOn Page 6, we display our digitally sourced originations, which accounted for 33% of our new borrower volume in the first quarter\nThis represents another high point for us and demonstrates our commitment to meeting our customers' needs and serving them through our omnichannel strategy\nDuring the first quarter, large loans made up 64% of our digitally sourced originations\nTurning to Page 7, total revenue increased by 2% to 97.7 million\nInterest and fees increased by 10 basis points year over year, primarily due to improved credit performance across the portfolio as a result of government stimulus, tightened underwriting during the pandemic, and our overall shift towards higher credit quality customers\nThis led to fewer loans in nonaccrual status and fewer interest accrual reversals, partially offset by the continued product mix shift toward lower-yielding large loans\nSequentially, interest and fees and total revenue yield decreased by 80 and 90 basis points, respectively\nThis was due to a combination of seasonality, our continued portfolio mix shift to larger loans, and the second stimulus payment, which, as previously noted, had a disproportionate impact on our small loan runoff in the first quarter\nAs of March 31, 65% of our portfolio consisted of large loans, and 81% of our portfolio had an APR at or below 36%\nIn the second quarter, we expect total revenue yield to be approximately 30 basis points lower than the first quarter, and our interest and fees to be approximately 20 basis points lower due to the impact that the third and largest stimulus payment is expected to have on our higher-yielding small loan portfolio\nMoving to Page 8, our net credit loss was 7.7% for the first quarter, a 280-basis-point improvement year over year, while delinquencies remain at historically low levels\nNet credit loss increased by roughly 80 basis points from the fourth quarter\nThis is due to normal seasonal increases of NPLs in the first quarter, but the rate of increase of 80 basis points in the first quarter was below the 150 and 180 basis point seasonal increases that we experienced in 2020 and 2019, respectively\nDue to government stimulus, improving economic conditions, and our lower delinquency levels, any COVID-related losses will occur in late 2021 at the earliest\nAs a result, we expect that our full-year net credit loss rate will be approximately 8%\nOur 30-plus day delinquency level as of March 31 was a record low 4.3%, a 230 basis point improvement from the prior year and 100 basis points lower than December 31\nAt the end of April, we saw 30-plus day delinquencies drop further to a record low of approximately 3.7%\nMoving forward, we expect 30-plus day delinquencies to gradually rise from the April low to more normal levels\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, our allowance for credit losses stood at 150 million, representing 13.2% of net finance receivables.\nThe allowance dropped by 10.4 million to 12.6% of net finance receivables in Q1 2021.\nThe reduction in reserves included a base reserve release of 3.8 million from portfolio liquidation and a COVID-19 reserve release of 6.6 million.\nAs we expand our portfolio in the future, we will establish additional reserves to support this new growth.\nCurrently, our macro assumptions, including the expectation of unemployment being under 10% by the end of 2021, remain largely consistent with our Q4 model.\nWe will assess these assumptions quarterly to reflect changing economic conditions as recovery begins.\nOur 139.6 million allowance for credit losses as of March 31 remains significantly higher than our 30-plus day contractual delinquency of 47.7 million.\nWe are confident that our reserves are sufficient.\nG&A expenses for Q1 2021 were 45.8 million, a 0.4 million or 0.9% reduction from the same period last year.\nThis improvement was mainly due to decreased executive transition costs and COVID-19 related operating expenses, partly counterbalanced by increased personnel and marketing expenses, as well as investments in digital and technological capabilities to support new growth initiatives and omnichannel strategy.\nOur Q1 2021 operating expense ratio was 16.3%, compared to 16.5% in the same period last year.\nSequentially, our G&A expense increased by 1 million, aligning with our expectations due to reduced deferred loan origination costs and fewer seasonal loan originations in Q1 compared to Q4.\nWe anticipate G&A expenses for Q2 to be about 2.2 million higher than Q1.\nWe plan to increase investments in the latter half of 2021 to enhance our digital capabilities, expand geographically, and develop new products and channels for long-term growth.\nThese investments will drive receivables growth and improve operating leverage over time.\nQ1 2021 interest expense was 7.1 million, representing 2.6% of our average net finance receivables.\nThis marked a 100 basis point improvement year-over-year and was 3 million, or 30%, lower than the previous year.\nThe reduced cost of funds resulted from a lower interest rate environment, improved funding costs from recent securitization transactions, and a favorable 785,000 mark-to-market increase in our interest rate cap value this quarter.\nWe currently have 400 million in interest rate caps to protect against rising rates on our variable-priced funding, which totaled 193 million at the end of Q1.\nWe acquired 100 million of additional interest rate caps in Q1 to capitalize on the favorable rate environment.\nSince the pandemic's start, we've purchased 300 million of interest rate caps with a LIBOR strike price range of 25 to 50 basis points.\nThe value of these hedges will be marked to market as rates fluctuate.\nLooking ahead, after normalizing for the Q1 hedge impact, we expect Q2 interest expense to be approximately 8.5 million.\nOur Q1 effective tax rate was 24%, compared to 36% in the previous year.\nWe anticipate an effective tax rate of about 25% for 2021.\nOur Q1 funded debt-to-equity ratio remained at a conservative 2.7-1.\nWe maintain a strong balance sheet with low leverage and 140 million in loan loss reserves.\nAs of March 31, we had 573 million in unused credit facility capacity and 207 million in available liquidity, comprising unrestricted cash and immediate credit facility draw-down availability.\nWe recently enhanced our warehouse facility capacity by closing three new warehouse facilities with Wells Fargo, Credit Suisse, and new lender JPMorgan.\nOur total warehouse capacity has increased by 175 million to 300 million, with the average term on the new warehouse extended by about four months to approximately 22 months.\nAs of April 30th, we had 758 million in unused credit facility capacity, providing ample resources to fund operations, growth plans, and our capital return program.\nIn Q1, the company bought back 352,183 shares of its common stock at an average price of $33.57 per share under its 30 million stock repurchase program.\nThe company finished the 30 million stock repurchase program in May, having repurchased a total of 951,841 shares at an average price of $31.52 per share.\nThe company's board of directors has declared a Q2 2021 dividend of $0.25 per common share, a 25% increase from the previous quarter, payable on June 15, 2021, to shareholders of record as of May 26, 2021.\nThe board of directors has also approved a new 30 million stock repurchase program.\nWe are pleased with our top and bottom-line performance, strong balance sheet, ability to return excess capital to shareholders, and growth prospects.\nRegional had an excellent first quarter, with our omnichannel operating model, new growth initiatives, and superior credit profile contributing to record performance.\nWe are eager to implement our key strategic initiatives, positioning us for sustainable long-term growth and ensuring our customers continue to receive exceptional service.\nOur long-term investments in digital innovation, market expansion, and new product and channel development will allow us to increase market share and create additional shareholder value.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We thank you for participating in our 2020 year-end earnings call today.\nAccompanying me are our usual team members: Joe Bergstein, CFO; Greg Dudkin, Pennsylvania utility head; Paul Thompson, Kentucky utility head; and Phil Swift, U.K. utility head.\nLet's proceed to Slide 3.\nI will provide some updates on regulatory and ESG matters.\nJoe will later give a detailed review of our year-end and fourth-quarter financial performance.\nI will conclude with our key priorities for 2021.\nLet's move to Slide 4.\nI'm extremely proud of PPL's performance in 2020, an unprecedented year in our lifetimes.\nThis year challenged our determination, resilience, and ability to quickly adapt to changing circumstances.\nWe successfully delivered electricity and gas safely and reliably to over 10.5 million customers when they needed it most.\nThis included essential workers like hospital staff and first responders.\nIt also included customers whose homes became workplaces and classrooms, relying on our uninterrupted service.\nWe're honored that our continued operational excellence was recognized by these same customers in 2020.\nWe ranked first among large utilities in the east for residential customer satisfaction for the ninth consecutive year, and topped all mid-sized utilities in the Midwest for both residential and business customer satisfaction.\nIn the U.K., we ended 2020 with scores exceeding nine out of ten in all four of our DNOs, likely earning us the maximum incentive reward under Ofgem's customer satisfaction measure.\nWe also received the U.K.'s customer service excellence award for the 28th time since 1992.\nWhile focusing on superior customer service, we also recognized the need to support our communities and help customers affected by COVID-19.\nWe continued offering payment assistance programs, flexible payment options, and referral services to help customers manage their energy bills.\nRegarding our financial performance, we achieved results within our original earnings guidance range, despite COVID-19 challenges.\nThis included overcoming a $0.12 per share negative impact from COVID, mainly due to low sales volumes in the U.K. and reduced commercial and industrial demand in Kentucky, as well as a $0.05 per share negative impact from mild weather compared to normal conditions.\nWe offset some of this impact through effective cost management and other factors without compromising the long-term strength of the business.\nOur regulatory structure allows recovery of under-collected revenues from lower sales volumes, which accounted for a significant portion of the 2020 impact.\nWe maintained a strong financial position and continued our commitment to returning capital to shareholders, a practice PPL has maintained quarterly for 75 consecutive years.\nLet's proceed to Slide 5.\nWhile addressing COVID-19 challenges throughout the year, we remained focused on the future.\nBuilding on our $27 billion investment over the past decade to improve customer service, we completed over $3 billion in infrastructure improvements in 2020, aligning with our initial expectations.\nNearly 90% of this investment focused on transmission and distribution infrastructure to enhance grid resilience, incorporate new technology, and advance our clean energy strategy.\nHighlighting some sustainability achievements, we continued to advance our clean energy strategy in 2020.\nWe set a more aggressive carbon reduction goal at the start of the year and invested in our networks to enable increased electrification and large-scale additions of distributed energy resources in the future.\nIn Kentucky, we obtained regulatory approval for a 100-megawatt solar power purchase agreement to meet growing customer demand for clean energy solutions.\nWe also expanded customer participation in our Solar Share Program, securing full subscriptions for two additional construction phases starting this spring.\nOur Safari Energy business added over 90 megawatts of solar capacity to its portfolio, increasing its total capacity to 110 megawatts.\nThis new capacity is contracted through long-term power purchase agreements.\nIn August, we joined a five-year industry initiative to accelerate low-carbon energy technology development and advance affordable pathways to economywide decarbonization.\nWe recognize that exceeding our current climate change goals requires new ideas, technology, and systems that can be implemented safely, reliably, and affordably.\nThis is why we're partnering with EPRI and GTI on their new Low-Carbon Resources Initiative.\nAs part of our sustainability efforts, we also focused on promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion across PPL and supporting meaningful change in our communities.\nTo build on PPL's existing momentum in this area, we adopted a new company-wide DEI strategy with five supporting commitments.\nFollowing the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and others in 2020, PPL led focused discussions with employees and communities on race and social justice, which will continue to guide our future efforts.\nWe also provided initial contributions to support local organizations focused on DEI initiatives and launched a new scholarship program aiming to award $1 million over the next decade to support minorities and females pursuing careers in engineering, IT, technical, and trade roles.\nPPL consistently prioritizes diversity, inclusion, and equity, earning recognition as a top workplace for LGBTQ equality from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation with a perfect score.\nIn 2020, we improved our environmental, social, and governance disclosures, demonstrating our dedication to transparency and keeping stakeholders informed.\nOur commitment to transparency in political spending was acknowledged by the Center for Political Accountability and the Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research, who awarded PPL their highest ranking on the CPA-Zicklin Index.\nWe will now discuss some regulatory updates.\nIn November, our Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities businesses took action to support ongoing infrastructure investments for customer benefit.\nLG&E and KU submitted rate increase requests to the Kentucky Public Service Commission, seeking approval for a total revenue increase of approximately $331 million in electricity and gas base rates.\nThe proposed increases will fund ongoing grid modernization to enhance resilience, as well as improvements to LG&E's natural gas system for improved safety and reliability.\nWe are also requesting approval for comprehensive deployment of advanced metering infrastructure, rapid electric vehicle charging stations, and an updated net metering tariff.\nIf the Commission approves, LG&E and KU's requested revenue increases would become effective July 1, 2021.\nConsidering the COVID pandemic and to minimize the immediate impact on customers, we aimed to keep the requested increase modest and included a $53 million economic relief surcredit to help offset the rate adjustment until mid-2022.\nWe have also proposed implementing AMI in a way that, based on current projections, will not require an increase in LG&E and KU's combined revenue in this rate case or future cases, as operational cost savings are expected to exceed the project's incremental capital cost.\nFurthermore, depending on the outcome of the proceeding, we aim to avoid requesting another base rate adjustment for several years.\nIn other Kentucky news, LG&E and KU issued a request for proposal on January 7 for generation capacity to address a potential energy deficit that may result from the expected retirement of 1,000 megawatts of coal-fired generation this decade.\nBrown Unit 3 is projected to be decommissioned by 2028 as it reaches the end of its economic lifespan.\nWe have provided a slide in the appendix detailing the projected economic lives of our baseload generation plan.\nThe utilities are looking for 300 to 900 megawatts of capacity starting from 2025 to 2028.\nAdditionally, we are requesting proposals for at least 100 megawatts of battery storage.\nProposals are due by March 31, and we expect to make a decision by mid-2021, potentially filing for regulatory approvals in early 2022.\nIn the United Kingdom, Ofgem released its RIIO-ED2 sector-specific methodology decision in mid-December.\nThe decision largely met our expectations and emphasizes the crucial role DNOs will play in supporting the UK's decarbonization efforts to achieve a net-zero economy.\nWPD became the first DNO to release a draft business plan for RIIO-ED2 in January.\nThe draft plan proposes £6 billion in new investments to support decarbonization, digitalization, and improved network utilization.\nRegarding our 2021 to 2025 capital plan, we have allocated over $14 billion to support ongoing modernization of our transmission and distribution networks and to advance cleaner energy initiatives.\nThis projected spending represents a $1 billion increase in capex from 2021 to 2024 compared to our previous plan.\nThe increases include $400 million in Kentucky for full deployment of advanced metering infrastructure, $300 million in Pennsylvania for additional transmission investments and IT initiatives focused on digital transformation, and $200 million in the UK due to rescheduled investments and updates to our RIIO-ED2 capital plan.\nLet's review our fourth-quarter results briefly.\nPPL's earnings from ongoing operations for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $0.59 per share, compared to $0.57 per share in the same period of 2019.\nWeather in the quarter was slightly unfavorable compared to 2019, with our Kentucky segment experiencing milder temperatures.\nThe estimated impact of COVID on our fourth-quarter results was about $0.02 per share, split evenly between lower UK sales volumes and reduced demand in Kentucky.\nWe continue to see improvement in this area as commercial and industrial demand steadily increases across our service territories.\nOverall, these results aligned with our expectations.\nExamining our full-year 2020 earnings results, we achieved earnings from ongoing operations of $2.40 per share, compared to $2.45 per share the previous year.\nOur 2020 financial results reflect an estimated $0.12 unfavorable variance due to COVID-19.\nWe also experienced a $0.06 unfavorable variance due to weather compared to 2019, primarily in Kentucky.\nIn terms of dilution for the year, we experienced $0.11 per share of dilution year-over-year, mainly reflecting the impact of the equity forward settlement in late 2019.\nAnalyzing segment drivers, excluding weather and dilution impacts, our UK regulated segment earned $1.33 per share, a $0.01 year-over-year decrease.\nThe decrease in UK earnings was primarily due to lower adjusted gross margins, driven by reduced sales volumes mainly due to COVID-19, lower other income from decreased pension income, higher operation and maintenance expense, and increased depreciation expense.\nThese decreases were partially offset by more favorable foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior period, with 2020 average rates of $1.47 per pound compared to $1.32 per pound in 2019.\nIn Pennsylvania, we earned $0.65 per share, which was $0.07 higher than our results in 2019.\nOur Pennsylvania results were primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins, mainly resulting from returns on additional capital investments in transmission and lower operation and maintenance expense.\nThe increases were partially counterbalanced by greater depreciation costs and other minor factors.\nLet's discuss our Kentucky division.\nOur earnings per share in 2020 were $0.55, which is a $0.03 improvement from the previous year's comparable results.\nThe growth was mainly attributed to improved adjusted gross margins, primarily due to higher retail rates implemented on May 1, 2019, and reduced operation and maintenance expenses.\nThese positive factors were somewhat offset by decreased commercial and industrial demand revenue, largely due to COVID-19's impact, and increased depreciation expenses.\nThe corporate and other segment showed a $0.03 improvement compared to the previous year.\nThe main factors contributing to the earnings in the corporate and other segment were reduced overall corporate expenses and other minor elements.\nMoving on to Slide 11.\nWe presented the trends in weather-adjusted sales for each segment by customer type since the pandemic's onset.\nGenerally, the reduced demand in commercial and industrial sectors was partly compensated by increased residential usage across all our service areas.\nWe also noticed a steady recovery in the commercial and industrial space as certain restrictions were relaxed throughout the year.\nIn Pennsylvania, residential usage gradually decreased following the sharp increase at the start of COVID, but remains about 3.5% higher than last year, indicating strong demand from customers still working remotely.\nThe commercial and industrial sector showed gradual recovery from the second quarter lows, ending the year less than 3% behind previous year levels.\nThe most significant declines persist mainly in the retail trade and services industry, which we anticipate will remain subdued until restrictions are removed.\nKentucky's residential usage increased by about 7% in Q4 compared to the previous year, consistent with Q3 figures.\nWe continue to see a moderate recovery in Kentucky's commercial and industrial sectors, significantly improved from the second quarter.\nCommercial and industrial volumes were down 3.5% from last year's Q4 usage, an improvement from the 7% decline observed in Q3.\nLike Pennsylvania, the services industry continues to show the largest declines in the commercial and industrial sector.\nHowever, sales to the manufacturing sector in Q4 approached 2019 levels.\nIn the U.K., residential usage also remained elevated, with volumes up about 6% compared to last year.\nThe commercial and industrial sectors have lagged behind our domestic jurisdictions overall but have continued to show strong recovery, down about 9% versus the prior year, a substantial improvement from the second-quarter lows exceeding 20%.\nDespite additional lockdowns implemented during the fourth quarter, these restrictions did not affect the construction and housing industries, and we haven't observed a slowdown in operational activity in these sectors.\nIt's worth noting that any revenue shortfall in the 2020-2021 regulatory year will be recovered by WPD in the 2022-2023 regulatory year, adjusted for inflation.\nBefore briefly highlighting our 2021 strategic priorities, I want to emphasize how proud I am of our achievements in 2020 under truly extraordinary circumstances.\nOur operations continued seamlessly, delivering very strong results.\nWe overcame significant financial challenges to meet our earnings guidance and return capital to shareholders.\nInternally, I witnessed unprecedented collaboration among our businesses as we worked to ensure each other's safety and tackle COVID-19.\nUltimately, I believe we made a positive societal impact, which is the shared purpose that unites PPL employees at all levels.\nIn 2020, we demonstrated PPL's remarkable resilience and adaptability.\nAs I've told our employees, I firmly believe we will emerge from this pandemic stronger and more united than ever before.\nWith this in mind, our clear focus moving forward is to deliver long-term value for our customers and shareholders.\nIn 2021, this includes finalizing the sale of our U.K. utility business and repositioning PPL as a purely U.S.-focused utility company.\nI'm pleased to report that the process to sell WPD is progressing as planned, and we still expect to announce a transaction in the first half of this year.\nAs previously mentioned, we believe selling the U.K. business will streamline our business mix, strengthen our balance sheet, and improve the company's long-term earnings growth rate.\nAdditionally, we believe it will provide the company with greater financial flexibility to invest in sustainable energy solutions.\nAnother top priority this year, as always, is to safely, reliably, and affordably deliver electricity and natural gas.\nThis is our most crucial responsibility.\nThis year, we will maintain our focus on continuous improvement, innovation, benchmarking, and sharing best practices as we aim to once again deliver industry-leading operational performance and provide an exceptional customer experience.\nOther key priorities for 2021 include advancing our clean energy strategy and reducing PPL's carbon footprint, further enhancing the diversity, equity, and inclusion culture I mentioned earlier, and strengthening communities through philanthropy, volunteerism, and customer assistance.\nIn summary, as we look towards 2021 and beyond, I'm enthusiastic about the opportunity to reposition PPL for future success.\nI'm confident we will continue to create long-term value for our customers, shareholders, and the communities we serve.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Given the substantial impact of COVID-19 on our operations in fiscal 2020, we will also include comparisons to our fiscal 2019 results for context.\nWe achieved robust performance across all our brands, especially in our direct-to-consumer distribution channels.\nAlthough we are benefiting from some favorable market conditions, our delivered results directly reflect our team's ongoing efforts to navigate short-term pandemic challenges while maintaining focus on our long-term strategic goal of customer satisfaction.\nOur outstanding results can be attributed to the power of our brand portfolio and our effective communication of aspirational brand messages through attractive inventory, unique products, and exceptional customer experiences.\nTo provide an outstanding customer experience in today's market, we must concentrate on our long-term goal of continuously enhancing our customer-focused, digitally-driven, seamless, cross-channel shopping experience, with a particular emphasis on mobile platforms.\nWe are continuously investing heavily in improving the customer experience, including upgrades to our mobile apps, search engine optimization, customer data analysis, customer service, and various other areas.\nThe distinction between our retail and e-commerce operations is becoming increasingly indistinct.\nWe acknowledge that a growing number of customer purchase journeys involve both physical and digital elements.\nMost consumers no longer differentiate between their digital and physical interactions with our brands, instead viewing their relationship with our brands holistically.\nCustomers desire and expect the ability to combine digital and physical elements at their discretion.\nWe are committed to fulfilling this desire and continue to invest in the necessary people, processes, and technology to do so.\nWe have frequently discussed our ability to ship from stores as an example of the merging of these two channels.\nWe have also implemented capabilities such as drive-to-store digital marketing, buy online and pickup in store, reserve online and pickup in store, virtual shopping appointments, and cross-channel customer service to better meet our customers' needs.\nThe more adept we become at providing a truly seamless omnichannel experience, the better our customers' overall experience will be, ultimately resulting in increased brand loyalty and a stronger business in the long term.\nOur team's unwavering focus on enhancing the customer experience is reflected in our numbers, which surpassed 2019 levels.\nIn the second quarter, our combined direct-to-consumer, full-price store, and e-commerce comp grew by an impressive 22% compared to 2019, with 15% growth in our largest brand, Tommy Bahama, and a remarkable 31% growth in Lilly Pulitzer.\nGrowth in our direct-to-consumer channel was led by our highly profitable e-commerce business, which expanded by 49% compared to the second quarter of 2019.\nIn addition to the impressive top-line growth, we were able to simultaneously increase our e-commerce gross margin.\nOur e-commerce operations have been enhanced by our ship-from-store capability, which allows us to utilize store inventories to fulfill e-commerce demand as well as demand from other stores.\nFor the year, we anticipate our total e-commerce business to account for approximately one-third of consolidated sales, compared to 23% in fiscal 2019.\nWhile e-commerce is our fastest-growing channel, physical stores remain a crucial component of our direct-to-consumer business.\nIn certain cases, there is no substitute for the personal interaction and high level of service we can provide in stores.\nOur retail stores experienced modest top-line growth during the quarter compared to 2019 levels, despite lower foot traffic, with sequential improvement throughout the second quarter across all regions of the country.\nAs with e-commerce, we were also able to expand retail store gross margins during the quarter, driven by full-price selling and higher initial markups.\nFor this year, we expect retail stores to constitute just under 40% of our total business.\nWe further differentiate our omnichannel approach to customer satisfaction with our food and beverage offerings.\nRestaurant and bar sales increased by 26% during the quarter compared to 2019.\nWe achieved positive comparable growth in all locations compared to the second quarter of 2019, with most showing double-digit increases.\nFor this year's second quarter, we have five additional Marlin Bar locations compared to 2019.\nOur food and beverage capabilities provide us with a unique and powerful way to build relationships with new customers and reinforce existing customers' affection for our Tommy Bahama brand.\nGiven our strong performance early in 2021 and expanding presence, we anticipate our dining and beverage operations will generate nearly $100 million in revenue this year.\nAlthough our wholesale division accounts for only about 20% of our total revenue, it remains a crucial distribution channel.\nWhen both we and our wholesale partners can operate profitably, wholesale can serve as an effective means of introducing new customers to our brands and providing another way to meet our customers' needs on their terms.\nThe outstanding results across the company for the quarter were fueled by remarkable achievements within each individual brand.\nTommy Bahama led the way with double-digit revenue growth compared to 2019.\nIncreased sales, coupled with improved gross margins and effective cost management, led to a 1,000 basis point improvement in operating margin, reaching an impressive 22.7%.\nDuring the quarter, much of the growth came from knit tops and shorts for both men and women, including many of our IslandZone Performance styles.\nThe success in these categories exemplifies how Tommy Bahama is benefiting from and capitalizing on the enduring trend towards casual, low-maintenance, and comfortable clothing.\nSimultaneously, Lilly Pulitzer achieved 16% revenue growth over 2019, expanded their gross margin, and maintained good expense control.\nThese combined factors resulted in a 230 basis point improvement in operating margin, reaching an impressive 29.5%.\nIn terms of products, we've observed a positive resurgence in woven dresses, a historical strength for Lilly, but the category experiencing the most growth has been our Lilly Luxletic activewear, which now comprises about 12% of our business.\nIn our Southern Tide division, remarkable growth in e-commerce, along with the addition of new retail stores, drove a 17% increase in sales, which, combined with improved gross margins, resulted in a 21% operating margin.\nAlthough Southern Tide's retail journey is in its early stages, with only a handful of company-owned stores in Florida, we are encouraged by the results we're seeing.\nOur emerging brands, The Beaufort Bonnet Company and Duck Head, though currently small, play a crucial role in our overall enterprise growth strategy.\nWith robust e-commerce operations and expanding wholesale businesses, both The Beaufort Bonnet Company and Duck Head delivered strong growth and improvements in both gross and operating margins.\nWe're also delighted to have secured our first lease for a company-owned store for The Beaufort Bonnet Company, which we look forward to opening later this year.\nAs we move into the second half of the year, while remaining aware of ongoing COVID-related challenges in supply chain and store and restaurant operations, we believe our focus on executing long-term strategic initiatives will continue to drive strength in our business.\nWe have developed a powerful, profitable, seamless, digital and mobile-first omni-channel platform that is fueling growth by offering a superior, modern customer experience.\nFrom a product standpoint, the trend towards casual, easy-care, and comfortable clothing aligns perfectly with our brands' strengths, and we are effectively capitalizing on this market opportunity.\nAs Tom just mentioned, exceptional performances across all our brands in the second quarter resulted in record-breaking revenue, gross margin, operating margin, and earnings.\nOn the revenue front, demand for our products remained high, with sales surpassing 2019 levels in all our direct-to-consumer channels and across all our brands.\nTotal sales for the second quarter were $329 million, compared to $302 million in the same period of 2019.\nOur gross margin continued to significantly outperform 2019 levels.\nOn an adjusted basis, gross margin increased by 450 basis points over 2019, reaching 64% in the second quarter.\nThis improvement was driven by a higher proportion of full-price sales, a shift in our sales mix towards higher-margin direct-to-consumer distribution channels, and improved initial markup (IMU).\nIncreased freight costs put some pressure on margins in the quarter, partially offsetting some of the gains.\nWe achieved improved SG&A leverage in the second quarter, reducing from 47% of sales in 2019 to 44% of sales.\nSG&A expenses increased slightly from 2019 levels, with increases in performance-based incentive compensation and marketing expenses partially offset by reductions in other employment costs due to headcount reductions and lower occupancy expenses.\nIn the second quarter, our consolidated adjusted operating margin expanded by 820 basis points over 2019 to 22%, with operating margin improvements across all operating groups.\nOur operations are well-supported by our robust balance sheet and strong cash flow from operations.\nAt the conclusion of the second quarter, our financial stability was robust, with $180 million in cash and no outstanding loans on our revolving credit facility.\nOur cash flow continues to be exceptionally strong.\nOperating activities generated $149 million in cash during the first six months of 2021, compared to $24 million in the same period of 2020.\nInventory decreased by 34% on a FIFO basis compared to the end of the second quarter of 2020.\nExcluding the Lanier Apparel division, which we are discontinuing, FIFO inventory fell by 26% compared to the end of the second quarter of 2020.\nTommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, and Southern Tide all reduced their inventory levels compared to the previous year, due to cautious seasonal inventory purchases and higher-than-anticipated sales in the first half.\nImproved enterprise order management systems also contributed to more efficient inventory utilization.\nInventory decreased by 48% on a LIFO basis, and by 39% when excluding Lanier Apparel, compared to the end of the second quarter of 2020.\nWe anticipate strong performance in our full-price direct-to-consumer business for the latter half of the year.\nWe project growth in full-price direct-to-consumer sales and an increase in consolidated gross margin compared to 2019.\nAlthough we've raised our forecast for the second half, the year-over-year improvement in our full-price direct business is expected to be partially offset by several specific challenges in the latter half of the fiscal year.\nDue to strong full-price sales in the first half, we have less inventory for second-half clearance events, including an anticipated $15 million reduction in Lilly Pulitzer's third-quarter flash clearance sale compared to 2019.\nFurthermore, initial spring wholesale shipments, which typically ship in the fourth quarter, are likely to be delayed to the first quarter of 2022 due to supply chain issues.\nLastly, the discontinuation of Lanier Apparel is expected to impact revenue in both the third and fourth quarters.\nWe anticipate Lanier Apparel sales to be approximately $25 million lower than the third quarter of 2019, and $20 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2019.\nFor the entire year, we now project sales between $1.085 billion and $1.105 billion, compared to $1.12 billion in sales for 2019.\nWe expect adjusted earnings per share to range from $6.45 to $6.70, a substantial increase from our previous guidance.\nThis projection compares to adjusted earnings of $4.32 per share in 2019.\nFor the full year, Lanier Apparel sales are expected to be $25 million in 2021, down from $95 million in 2019.\nFor the third quarter, we anticipate sales between $220 million and $230 million, compared to $241 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we project adjusted earnings of $0.20 to $0.30 per share, compared to adjusted earnings of $0.10 per share in the third quarter of 2019.\nOur outlook includes strong quarter-to-date results, with August being the most significant month of the quarter in 2021.\nThe company's effective tax rate for the full year is projected to be approximately 23%.\nWe continue to invest in our business for future growth in fiscal 2021.\nCapital expenditures are expected to be around $40 million in fiscal 2021, focusing on technology for digital marketing, customer service, mobile enhancements, and improved distribution.\nAdditionally, we're investing in new brick-and-mortar locations, with our newest Marlin Bar at Town Square in Las Vegas set to open tomorrow.\nThis Marlin Bar is replacing the recently closed full-service restaurant in the same location.\nWe are proud of our long-standing tradition of providing value to our shareholders through dividends, which we have distributed every quarter since becoming a public company in 1960.\nThis quarter, our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $0.42 per share.\nSummary: ",

call.\nEd Breen, our CEO; Lori Koch, our CFO; and Jon Kemp, president of our electronics and industrial division, are participating in today's call.\nOur latest 10-K filing and subsequent reports provide a thorough analysis of key risks and uncertainties that could lead to differing outcomes.\nAll historical financial data presented today excludes exceptional items unless otherwise noted.\nWe'll also discuss other non-GAAP financial metrics.\nI'll comment on another robust quarter, highlighting continued progress on our strategic goals as a leading multi-industrial company focused on growth and shareholder value creation.\nWe've maintained safe and efficient operations both on-site and remotely thanks to the guidelines and procedures we implemented over the past year.\nWe're urging all staff to get vaccinated and collaborating with local authorities to improve access, including offering on-site vaccinations at certain locations.\nOur Wilmington offices have fully reopened, and it's wonderful to be back working alongside our teams.\nLet's begin with Slide 2.\nWhile Lori will provide specifics, overall, we saw broad-based organic growth driven by ongoing strength in our primary markets, including continued recovery in sectors most affected by the pandemic.\nDespite a challenging production environment with rising raw material costs and ongoing supply chain and logistics issues, strong operational discipline and swift pricing actions led to approximately 460 basis points of margin improvement compared to the same period last year.\nGiven the continuing strong order trends and our confidence in our teams' ability to navigate raw material and supply chain challenges, we are increasing our full-year projections for net sales, operating EBITDA, and adjusted EPS.\nI'll provide more details on our revised guidance shortly.\nIn addition to our financial performance, we continued to execute our balanced capital allocation strategy during the quarter.\nIn May, we further reduced our debt by redeeming $2 billion in bonds, bringing our gross financial debt to $10.6 billion at quarter-end.\nSince the end of last year, we've paid down a total of $5 billion in debt and don't have another maturity until Q4 2023, further strengthening our liquidity position.\nWe also returned about $800 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends in Q2.\nWe purchased $640 million in shares during Q2, completing our previous share repurchase program and beginning repurchases under our new authorization announced last quarter, which runs until June 30, 2022.\nIn the first half of the year, we've repurchased about $1.1 billion in shares and plan to be opportunistic with our remaining authorization throughout the year.\nIn July, we bought back an additional $125 million in shares.\nRegarding dividends, we returned approximately $160 million to shareholders during the quarter.\nAs previously mentioned, we plan to work with the board to increase our dividend annually as our earnings grow.\nBefore concluding, I'm pleased to announce that in late June, we finalized the previously announced sale of our Solamet business for about $190 million.\nOn July 1, we completed the acquisition of Laird Performance Materials using available cash.\nThe Laird acquisition advances DuPont's strategy of growing as a global innovation leader and strengthens our position in advanced electronic materials.\nJon Kemp, president of our global E&I segment, is joining us today.\nThis transaction is exciting for DuPont as it significantly enhances our position in the electronics industry and accelerates the transformation of our interconnect solutions business into a comprehensive solutions provider.\nWe've been monitoring Laird for several years, admiring their capabilities as a leading provider of electromagnetic shielding and thermal management solutions, and are thrilled to have added their growth potential and capabilities to our portfolio.\nAs a reminder, Laird generated $465 million in revenue with approximately 30% EBITDA margin in 2020.\nBoth E&I and Laird are known for innovation, quality, and reliability, with strong relationships across the electronics industry.\nThis combination merges DuPont's premier applied material science expertise with Laird's industry-leading application engineering capabilities.\nIt also increases our content on many devices we're already involved with.\nWe've begun integrating Laird into our existing interconnect solutions business, creating opportunities to optimize business structure, functional support, and our global site network.\nWe expect $60 million in run-rate cost synergies by the end of year 3, with about 60% realized in the first 18 months.\nWe anticipate achieving cost synergies through a mix of G&A, procurement, and site consolidation initiatives.\nOn the next slide, I'll outline the key benefits of this transaction and explain how the combination enhances DuPont's position as a leading electronic materials provider.\nThe second way it strengthens our position is through innovation.\nThis acquisition strategically aligns us with critical needs in thermal management, signal integrity, power management, miniaturization, and high reliability.\nIt enables us to engage early with OEMs in both system design and material specification, leading to greater product differentiation and higher margins.\nAnother benefit of the acquisition is the expansion of our solutions portfolio.\nLeveraging Laird's unique multifunctional capabilities, we'll capitalize on an expanded customer base, broad product portfolio, global scale, and deep technical expertise to accelerate time-to-market, create new efficiencies in developing integrated and multifunctional solutions, and provide high-value next-generation products that will drive additional growth in the coming years.\nWe believe customers will see immediate benefits as the combined E&I organization engages across value chains to address increasingly complex industry challenges.\nOur unified organization will enhance our leadership position in assisting customers to expedite solutions required for the implementation of high-performance computing, AI, 5G communications, intelligent and self-driving vehicles, and IoT\nWe'll be strategically positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities in these key emerging sectors\nI will now discuss our financial performance for the second quarter, starting with Slide 5\nOur quarterly results showcase the diversity and robustness of our portfolio, as well as our teams' ongoing ability to perform despite rising raw material costs and global supply chain and logistics challenges\nRevenue of $4.1 billion increased by 26% compared to the second quarter of 2020, with organic growth of 23%\nThe organic sales growth was driven by a 20% increase in volume and a 3% rise in price\nCurrency exchange rates provided a 4% boost in the quarter, slightly offset by a 1% negative impact from non-core business divestitures in the previous year\nSales growth was widespread, with double-digit organic growth across all three reporting segments and regions\nThe most significant increase compared to the previous year was in our M&M segment, reflecting the substantial change in the global automotive market and strategic pricing actions\nI'll provide more details on our segment top-line results in the next slide\nIn terms of earnings, we achieved operating EBITDA of $1.06 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.06, representing increases of 53% and approximately 240%, respectively, compared to the same period last year\nThe earnings improvement was primarily due to volume gains, reflecting ongoing recovery in key end markets affected by the pandemic, and the absence of approximately $150 million in charges related to temporary facility closures, partially offset by the absence of a $64 million gain from a divested joint venture\nStrong operating EBITDA leverage led to a 460 basis point expansion in operating EBITDA margin\nIncremental margins for the quarter were approximately 43%\nGiven the unique circumstances of 2020 and the specific items that impacted our operating results in the previous year, it's crucial to assess our year-over-year operating performance for our core results on an underlying basis\nSpecifically, operating EBITDA for our core results during the quarter increased by about 40% compared to last year, excluding the impact of the $150 million in idle mill costs incurred in the previous year, with approximately 240 basis points of margin expansion and operating leverage of one and a half times\nI also continue to compare our growth to 2019, given the significant impact the pandemic had on key end markets last year\nComparing our current second-quarter results to a more normalized performance before the pandemic, overall reported sales in the quarter were up 6% compared to the second quarter of 2019, and up 10% for our core sales during the same period\nOperating EBITDA for our core results during the quarter increased by 15% compared to the second quarter of 2019, representing one and a half times leverage\nFrom a segment perspective, E&I achieved an operating EBITDA margin of 32%, with 190 basis points of expansion driven by broad-based volume gains\nM&M delivered significant operating EBITDA improvement, driven by an overall recovery in automotive markets and the absence of approximately $130 million in charges associated with temporarily idling polymer capacity in the previous year\nOperating EBITDA margin for the quarter was 23%, reflecting volume growth and net pricing gains resulting from actions taken ahead of escalating raw material costs\nIn W&P, operating EBITDA increased by 4% compared to the previous year\nOperating EBITDA margin and leverage were negatively impacted primarily by two key factors\nFirst, due to contractual commitments with customers, local selling price increases lagged behind the headwinds from raw materials and supply chain cost escalation\nWe expect this situation to improve in the second half as price increases take effect\nSecond, production volumes for Tyvek protective garments were at peak levels in the previous year due to the company's response to the pandemic\nThis allowed us to minimize manufacturing changeovers to other Tyvek grades, resulting in an overall increase in production rates\nAs Tyvek output shifted from protective garments to multiple other applications, the resulting increase in expected changeovers in the current quarter decreased production rates, leading to lower volumes\nFor the quarter, cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow were $440 million and $224 million, respectively\nAlthough these amounts have improved since the first quarter, cash flow and conversion are not at the desired levels\nThe challenges we faced are related to increased working capital levels and capital spending exceeding depreciation and amortization as we advance critical capacity expansion projects\nRegarding working capital, we experienced an increase in inventories due to our efforts to create a more stable supply chain for our customers in light of the strong demand environment and numerous raw material and logistics constraints\nIn the second half of the year, we anticipate higher cash flow and conversion rates as the global supply chain and logistics environment stabilizes\nSlide 6 provides more detailed information on the year-over-year changes in net sales for the quarter\nOrganic sales increased by 17% on 17% volume growth, with double-digit volume growth increases across all regions\nVolume gains were led by mid-20s percent growth in Industrial Solutions, reflecting broad-based demand strength across most product lines, particularly for OLED displays in new phones and television launches, medical silicones in healthcare, and Kalrez seals in electronics\nInterconnect Solutions also delivered organic growth exceeding 20% with high-teens volume growth\nThe volume growth was driven by higher material content in premium next-generation smartphones, partially resulting from timing shifts as select OEM demand moved from the second half of this year, along with some market share gains for printed circuit boards\nSemiconductor Technologies continues to benefit from strong electronics demand and advancements in key growth areas such as 5G, high-performance computing, and electric vehicles\nDuring the quarter, new technology ramps in advanced nodes within logic and foundry, and higher demand for memory in servers and data centers drove double-digit volume growth\nContinued recovery of key end markets within W&P drove organic growth of 11%, driven by volume increases\nSales gains were led by recovery in construction, with Shelter Solutions reporting organic sales growth of more than 30%, reflecting continued strength in North American residential construction for products like Styrofoam and Tyvek house wrap, as well as in retail channels for do-it-yourself applications\nSales of Corian surfaces in commercial construction increased this quarter due to growing global demand.\nSafety solutions saw high single-digit organic sales growth, with strong volume increases for aramid fibers in industrial, oil and gas, and automotive sectors.\nOverall safety volume decreased due to lower Tyvek production, as previously mentioned.\nStrong demand persisted for water technologies across the board in water solutions.\nLogistical issues, primarily in our Ultrafiltration business, hindered our ability to supply, leading to a slight volume decline compared to last year.\nWe anticipate mid to high single-digit organic sales growth for water solutions this year.\nThe M&M segment showed the most significant top-line improvement, with organic sales growth exceeding 50%.\nThe global automotive market's ongoing recovery, which accounts for about 60% of the segment's end market, drove this improvement and led to strong volume growth across all business lines.\nLocal pricing gains of 13% also contributed to organic sales growth, reflecting our efforts to offset raw material costs and higher metals pricing in the advanced solutions business.\nLocal price increased by about 8% when excluding metals pricing.\nGlobal supply constraints for key raw materials in engineering polymers are improving but are expected to remain tight through year-end.\nWe anticipate recovering lost volume related to these disruptions as raw material constraints ease.\nAdjusted earnings per share of $1.06 increased by over 240% from $0.31 in the same period last year.\nHigher segment earnings resulted in a net benefit of over $0.40.\nA lower share count provided an approximate $0.30 per share benefit to adjusted earnings compared to last year.\nThe benefit from lower interest expense in the current quarter was largely offset by a higher base tax rate compared to last year.\nThe quarter's base tax rate of 19.8% was higher than the previous year due to the absence of certain discrete gains.\nWe expect our full-year 2021 base tax rate to be closer to the lower end of our 21% to 22% range.\nWe are raising our full-year guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA, and adjusted EPS.\nOur revised guidance reflects the Laird acquisition and the Solamet business divestiture.\nWe now expect full-year net sales of about $16.5 billion and operating EBITDA of about $4.235 billion at the midpoint.\nAdjusted earnings per share are now expected to be $4.27 at the midpoint, reflecting underlying improvements, portfolio changes, and the amortization reporting change.\nFor Q3 2021, we anticipate net sales of about $4.2 billion, operating EBITDA of about $1.07 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of about $1.12 at the midpoints.\nOur 2021 sustainability report highlights our progress against 2030 goals set in 2019, featuring over 50 examples of addressing customer and community environmental and social needs.\nWe've incorporated sustainability goal progress into our incentive compensation program starting this year.\nOur R&D investment focuses on the intersection of key market trends and sustainable development needs.\nWe launched B-Free technology in our water solutions business to improve reverse osmosis desalination plant reliability.\nWe collaborated with General Motors to develop an advanced adhesive solution for electric vehicles, earning us GM's Supplier of the Year award.\nCustomer partnerships driving sustainability are crucial to our long-term growth strategy.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:My name is Mark Kowlzan, and I serve as the Chairman and CEO of Packaging Corporation of America\nJoining me on this call are Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President overseeing our Packaging division, and Bob Mundy, our CFO\nI will conclude the presentation, after which we will be happy to answer any questions you may have\nWe announced our fourth quarter 2020 financial results yesterday, reporting a net income of $124 million, equivalent to $1.30 per share\nWhen special items are excluded, our Q4 2020 net income was $127 million or $1.33 per share, compared to $163 million or $1.71 per share in Q4 2019\nNet sales for the fourth quarter remained constant at $1.7 billion for both 2020 and 2019\nThe company's total EBITDA for Q4, excluding special items, was $293 million in 2020, down from $335 million in 2019\nThe fourth quarter net income included $3 million in special items, primarily related to facility closures and restructuring expenses\nFor the full year 2020, we reported earnings of $550 million or $5.78 per share, excluding special items, compared to $726 million or $7.65 per share in 2019\nNet sales decreased from $7 billion in 2019 to $6.7 billion in 2020\nThe company's total EBITDA for 2020, excluding special items, was $1.23 billion, down from $1.45 billion in 2019\nThe $0.38 per share decrease in Q4 2020 earnings compared to Q4 2019 was mainly due to lower prices and mix in our Packaging and Paper segments, reduced Paper segment volumes, and higher maintenance costs\nIncreased freight expenses due to truck demand, driver shortages, and rail rate hikes, along with a higher tax rate, also contributed to the decline\nThese negative factors were partially offset by higher Packaging segment volumes and effective cost management\nExamining our Packaging business performance\nIn Q4 2020, the Packaging segment's EBITDA, excluding special items, was $303 million with sales of $1.54 billion, resulting in a 20% margin, compared to Q4 2019's EBITDA of $303 million and sales of $1.46 billion, yielding a 21% margin\nFor the full year 2020, the Packaging segment's EBITDA, excluding special items, was $1.2 billion with sales of $5.9 billion, producing a 21% margin, compared to 2019's EBITDA of $1.3 billion and sales of $5.9 billion, yielding a 22% margin\nOur Packaging segment experienced robust demand, with record-breaking sales volumes in both containerboard mills and corrugated products plants\nDespite replenishing some inventory by postponing a major outage at the DeRidder mill and increasing production at the Jackson mill, we ended the quarter with lower-than-planned inventory levels due to unexpectedly strong demand\nAs mentioned in our previous call, we began producing high-performance virgin linerboard on the number three machine at Jackson, Alabama in Q4 to meet strong demand from box plant customers and build inventory before year-end\nThe machine performed well, producing high-quality, lightweight grades in November and December, although at a high cost\nWe've refined our estimates for future capital investment and process changes needed to fully utilize the mill's potential for optimal containerboard production\nTo address our strategic integrated containerboard supply needs and support downstream box plant demand growth, we'll review this analysis along with other options at our February Board of Directors meeting\nWe'll provide more information on this topic after the review\nAs Mark noted, our corrugated products plants set new quarterly records for total box shipments, increasing 9.9% compared to Q4 2019, and shipments per day, up 11.7% year-over-year\nTo put it differently, despite having three fewer shipping days than Q3, our Q4 shipments surpassed Q3 by 2.2%\nAnnual corrugated shipment records were broken for the entire year, both in total and per day, increasing by 5.8% and 5.4% respectively, with an additional shipping day compared to 2019\nContainerboard external sales volume was 16,000 tons lower than the previous year's fourth quarter as we operated our containerboard system to meet the record demands of our box manufacturing facilities\nPrices and mix for domestic containerboard and corrugated products combined were $0.31 per share lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 and decreased by $0.11 per share compared to the third quarter of 2020, mainly due to a less favorable mix as graphics, point-of-purchase display, and Pacific Northwest produce businesses slow down during this period\nExport containerboard prices were $0.01 per share higher than both the fourth quarter of 2019 and the third quarter of 2020\nAs anticipated, we began to observe the initial effects of our recently announced price increases in the Packaging segment towards the end of the quarter\nWhile we refrain from commenting on specific future pricing, we anticipate implementing the majority of the increases during the first quarter of 2021\nExamining the Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the fourth quarter was $10 million with sales of $156 million or 6% margin, compared to fourth quarter 2019 EBITDA of $53 million and sales of $244 million or a 22% margin\nFor the entire year of 2020, Paper segment EBITDA excluding special items was $73 million with sales of $675 million or an 11% margin, compared to the full year 2019 EBITDA of $213 million with sales of $964 million or a 22% margin\nThe Paper segment continued to face difficult market conditions due to nationwide efforts to control the spread of the pandemic\nAs expected, sales volume was lower than the seasonally stronger third quarter and more than 30% below the fourth quarter of 2019\nAs previously mentioned, with the scheduled outage at our International Falls mill, the Jackson mill resumed production of white paper in October and manufactured both paper and containerboard during the fourth quarter\nWe will continue to evaluate our paper demand outlook and optimal inventory levels, and adjust our paper system operations accordingly\nAverage paper prices and mix were 1% lower than the third quarter of 2020 and about 3% below the fourth quarter of 2019\nIn the fourth quarter, we generated $271 million in cash from operations and $103 million in free cash flow\nThe main uses of cash during the quarter included $168 million for capital expenditures\nCommon stock dividends amounted to $75 million, $51 million was spent on federal and state income tax payments, and net interest payments totaled $40 million\nWe concluded the year with $975 million in cash on hand, or slightly over $1.1 billion including marketable securities\nOur liquidity as of December 31 was just under $1.5 billion\nFor the entire year of 2020, cash from operations was $1.03 billion\nWe had capital spending of $421 million\nFree cash flow was $612 million\nOur final recurring effective tax rate for 2020 was 25% and our final reported cash tax rate was 18%\nRegarding full year estimates of certain key items for the upcoming year, we expect total capital expenditures to range between $500 million to $525 million, excluding any potential capital spending related to the Jackson conversion as it is still being evaluated, as Mark mentioned earlier\nDD&A is anticipated to be approximately $407 million\nPension and post-retirement benefit expense is expected to be about $2 million, which is net of a nonoperating pension benefit of almost $20 million primarily due to our pension asset performance in 2020\nWe also anticipate making cash pension and post-retirement benefit plan contributions of $52 million\nDue to the recent 27% dividend increase, we anticipate dividend payouts totaling $380 million for the year\nWe expect our full year interest expense in 2021 to be around $95 million, with net cash interest payments approximating $93 million\nOur projected combined federal and state cash tax rate for 2021 is roughly 20.5%, while our book effective tax rate is estimated at about 25%\nPlanned annual maintenance shutdowns at our mills in 2021 will reduce containerboard production by approximately 81,000 tons compared to 2020\nThe yearly earnings impact of these shutdowns, including lost volume, direct costs, and amortized repair expenses, is expected to be $0.90 per share, up from $0.65 per share in 2020\nThe estimated quarterly impact in 2021 is $0.10 per share in Q1, $0.25 in Q2, $0.13 in Q3, and $0.42 per share in Q4\nThroughout the pandemic, our staff showed remarkable resilience in overcoming challenges in both their personal and professional lives, achieving significant company-wide accomplishments, particularly in safely operating our manufacturing and office locations during times of constant change and distraction\nWe undoubtedly faced difficulties and unique challenges during the year\nNevertheless, our employees maintained their determination to succeed\nOur manufacturing and sales teams continuously adapted to meet customer needs during unprecedented demand in our packaging business while effectively managing market challenges in our paper business caused by the pandemic and multiple hurricanes\nOur engineering and technology department remained on schedule with crucial capital projects and process improvements for our box plants and mills, while our corporate staff groups developed innovative remote working solutions to ensure effective company management and completion of necessary administrative tasks for employees and public company requirements\nI am very proud of our achievements and the strong relationships we have developed with our customers and suppliers over many years\nAs we transition from the fourth to the first quarter, we expect our Packaging segment demand to remain robust, with shipments surpassing last year's record first quarter\nTo meet this demand, we will continue producing containerboard at our Jackson mill, along with an appropriate amount of white paper to maintain optimal inventory levels for paper customers\nAs mentioned earlier, we anticipate realizing most of our recently announced Packaging segment price increases during the first quarter, and we expect average export prices to rise as well\nHowever, we anticipate continued higher freight costs and increased labor expenses due to annual wage inflation and timing-related increases in fringe benefits as the new year begins\nColder weather will drive up energy and wood costs\nWe also expect higher prices for recycled fiber\nWhile scheduled outage expenses should decrease, inflation-related increases in operating supplies and repair costs are expected to offset much of that benefit\nStay-at-home orders and lockdown conditions are constantly changing across the country\nWith the new federal administration in place, we expect guidelines and requirements to continue evolving\nNumerous events and actions could significantly impact our expectations and assumptions for the upcoming quarter in both our Packaging and Paper segments\nThis applies not only to the operation of our facilities but also to our customers' needs and the availability of services and products from our suppliers\nAs a result, we are unable to provide appropriate quantitative guidance for the first quarter\nWe are now ready to take any questions\nThese statements are based on current estimates, expectations, and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including economic trends and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC\nWe would now like to open the

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Present at today's First Bancorp meeting are the CEO, Aurelio Aleman, and CFO, Orlando Berges.\nWe hope everyone has a good 2021.\nLet's examine Slide 4 for an overview of the year's key points.\nWe are quite satisfied with our annual performance.\nI'm impressed by our team's ability to overcome the many obstacles presented by the pandemic in our operating environment.\nOur company underwent significant changes this year, particularly with the acquisition finalized on September 1, which has increased our market presence and strengthened our position in Puerto Rico.\nWe've experienced over 30% growth in our customer base, now serving 675,000 clients.\nWe're also happy with our technological progress and data readiness this year.\nOur customers' use of digital platforms grew significantly in 2020, with login numbers up by over 33% and digital transactions increasing by more than 55% for the year.\nContinuing to invest in digital technology infrastructure projects is a key priority.\nWe're focused on improving efficiency while simultaneously working on integration.\nWe're heavily concentrated on the integration process, which is proceeding as planned and is expected to be finished by the end of summer.\nThe economic and political situation in Puerto Rico appears to be improving.\nAdditional stimulus and disaster relief funding will provide further support to those affected by the pandemic and the overall economic climate.\nLockdowns persist at various levels, but December's economic activity was relatively healthy considering the restrictions on operating hours.\nThe hospitality and retail sectors remain the most affected.\nHowever, we're starting 2021 in a strong position with a robust balance sheet to support economic recovery.\nWe have excellent liquidity, solid resource coverage, and strong capital to begin the year.\nWe generated $102 million in net income for the year, or $0.46 per share, slightly less than the $167 million in 2019, impacted by the economic effects of the pandemic and increased provisions due to CECL and the acquisition.\nPre-tax preparation was strong, increasing 6% to $300 million, with only four months of our combined company operations.\nThis was achieved despite COVID's impact on loan activity and the challenging yield curve affecting banks' top-line revenue.\nLoan origination and renewal for the year reached $4.4 billion, with organic core deposit growth hitting a record $2 billion.\nOverall, it was a very positive core year for the company.\nLet's move to Slide 6 to review the quarter's highlights.\nThis is compared to $28 million in the previous quarter.\nIt's important to note that this is the first full quarter of operations for the combined franchise.\nPPNR was very strong at $86 million, up from $77 million in the prior quarter.\nSignificantly, we've moved past the moratoriums and are closely monitoring asset quality metrics.\nAsset quality metrics remain stable, with a focus on borrowers negatively impacted by the pandemic.\nIt's too early to predict final NPA inflows caused by the pandemic, but initial post-moratorium metrics show delinquency rates at year-end still comparing favorably to pre-pandemic levels in December 2019.\nWe continue to invest in technology to improve customer service.\nThis quarter, we implemented a new online and mobile platform for credit cards.\nWe're also continuing to roll out our new branch digital platform.\nRegarding capital, our CET1 ratio of 17.3% remains very strong post-acquisition and is among the highest in the industry.\nLet's move to Slide 7 to discuss loans, loan activity, and deposits in more detail.\nLoan origination activity was robust this quarter at $1.4 billion, excluding credit card activity.\nGrowth was primarily in the commercial and auto portfolios.\nCommercial activity is seasonal, and we had a solid quarter with deals that were delayed earlier in the year.\nWe also saw volume from the Main Street loan programs and PPP.\nExcluding Main Street and PPP, originations still increased by $278 million to $1.2 billion, which is still strong.\nThe overall portfolio, now at $11.8 billion, decreased slightly from the previous quarter, mainly due to strategic reductions in residential loans.\nWe continue to originate primarily conforming loans, which has boosted non-interest income.\nWe also received repayments of about $49 million through the PPP loan forgiveness process.\nWe anticipate approximately $100 million in PPP repayments this quarter, depending on the SBA's processing speed for forgiveness applications.\nWe're now working on Round 2 of PPP, which was recently approved.\nOur initial estimates are around $250 million in PPP loans during the first half of 2021.\nThis may replace some normal commercial volume in the coming months, as happened in the first round of PPP, but it provides great support to small businesses.\nWe anticipate providing smaller, more specific loans targeted at smaller enterprises.\nThere is sufficient liquidity available in the market for deposits.\nWe are witnessing a continuous influx of funds.\nOur deposit growth remains steady.\nWe anticipate this trend will persist throughout the year.\nOur primary focus is on boosting loan generation.\nWe have surplus liquidity that needs to be utilized.\nDuring the quarter, our core deposits increased by an additional $257 million.\nThe loan pipeline is expanding.\nConsumer and mortgage trends remain robust and stable.\nAs always, commercial lending is driven by models.\nWe are putting in considerable effort to expand our pipeline.\nPlease turn your attention to Slide 8.\nIt's noteworthy that our franchise's earning potential has reached a new peak, with $86 million in PPNR from the combined operations in just the first quarter.\nThe improved funding profile of the merged institution will help mitigate some of the yield curve's impact on the overall portfolio yield.\nWe now have access to a larger customer base for loan generation.\nLooking ahead to 2021, there will likely be some disruption due to the ongoing integration.\nThe first half of the year will primarily focus on integration efforts.\nWe aim to complete this process by summer.\nThere are some expenses associated with achieving the full benefits of integration.\nThese costs will mainly occur in the first half of the year.\nIn the second half, as the market recovers and reopens as expected, revenue growth may lead to increased variable expenses.\nWe're aiming for a long-term efficiency ratio of 55% after completing the integration.\nIt's important to recognize the challenges banks face in achieving mid-50s efficiency ratios in the current yield curve environment.\nWe're hopeful for some improvement in the curve towards the end of the year.\nLet's briefly review the capital and balance sheet on Slide 6.\nLiquidity continued to increase during the quarter.\nWe saw continued excess cash, with reserve coverage remaining at levels similar to the previous quarter, maintaining a strong 3.3% coverage.\nCapital remains robust with CET1 above 17% after completing the acquisition.\nAs mentioned previously, capital deployment opportunities remain a priority for management and the Board.\nWe announced a dividend increase to $0.07 per share last night, driven by current and projected earnings.\nAs discussed in the last earnings call, we're actively working on stress test data and an updated capital plan to present to our Board for potential additional capital actions.\nAurelio mentioned our strong quarter with $50 million in earnings, or $0.23 per share, compared to $28 million or $0.13 per share last quarter.\nRemember that this quarter reflects the full impact of the acquired operations, whereas we only had one month of those results in Q3 2020.\nThe quarter still included $12.3 million in merger and restructuring costs, compared to $10.4 million last quarter.\nAlso, last quarter included a Day 1 CECL allowance of nearly $39 million and an $8 million partial reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nNet interest income for the quarter increased by $29 million.\nThis is largely due to a $1.7 billion higher average loan balance, including the full effect of the Santander acquisition and new commercial and consumer loan originations.\nThese were partially offset by a $130 million reduction in the mortgage portfolio compared to September 30, and a $49 million reduction in PPP loans.\nWe recognized $1.1 million in interest income collected on non-accrual loans, mostly from recovered charge-offs.\nThe repayment of PPP loans resulted in $700,000 of accelerated commission income.\nWe saw a reduction of over $800,000 in interest expense, despite a $2 billion increase in interest-bearing liabilities due to the full quarter effect of the transaction and continued deposit growth.\nThis represents an 18 basis point reduction in funding costs compared to last quarter.\nNon-interest income for the quarter was $30 million, up $5 million.\nConsidering last quarter included $5 million in gains on sales of securities, which we didn't have much of this quarter, non-interest income effectively increased by $5 million.\n$2.5 million of this increase came from service charges on deposits, reflecting the full quarter of the Santander acquisition and increased transaction volumes.\nSecond and third quarter expenses were lower, with reduced variable components related to transaction volumes and associated fees.\nWe are witnessing robust loan originations and numerous refinancing activities.\nA considerable portion consists of conforming loans that we ultimately sell.\nWe saw a $500,000 rise in profits from selling some of these mortgage loans.\nIn the quarter, we also recognized $1.4 million in fees from Main Street loans we issued.\nWe originated $184 million in loans under the Main Street Lending Program.\nWe sold 95% participation to the government as outlined in the program.\nQuarterly expenses totaled nearly $135 million, up from $107 million, reflecting a full quarter's impact.\nThese expenses include $12 million in merger and restructuring costs for the quarter.\nSince the process began, we've incurred about $36 million in merger and restructuring expenses.\nThis is part of the deal.\nWe anticipate an additional $26-30 million, mostly in the first half of 2021, as we finish integrations, conversions, and other ongoing integration tasks.\nPandemic-related expenses, such as cleaning costs and extra security, amounted to $1.1 million, similar to the $1 million in the third quarter.\nExcluding these items, expenses increased by $25 million, mainly due to the full quarter of acquired operations, higher transaction volumes on debit and credit cards, and other factors, plus $900,000 in increased incentive compensation.\nWe had $2.3 million in technology fees.\nThe increased amortization of intangibles related to the transaction was about $1.5 million higher for the quarter.\nCredit-related expenses decreased slightly to $1.8 million from $2.2 million last quarter.\nOne item has been affected by moratorium programs and delays in foreclosures and other legal processes in the market.\nWe expect some increases in these categories over the next couple of quarters as foreclosures and other legal processes return to normal levels.\nThe allowance for credit losses in December was $401 million, slightly down from $402.6 million in September.\nHowever, the allowance for credit losses on loans was nearly $386 million, $1.2 million higher than September.\nThe ratio of the loans allowance was 3.28% compared to 3.25% in September.\nThe quarterly provision was $7.7 million, compared to almost $47 million in the previous quarter.\nThe third quarter included a $38.9 million Day 1 provision to comply with CECL requirements for non-PCD loans on acquired operations.\nThis quarter's projected macroeconomic scenarios for calculating the allowance for credit losses showed improvements in many economic variables, including unemployment, compared to the third quarter.\nHowever, the CRA index deteriorated in the quarter, mainly due to longer projected recovery timeframes, especially for commercial retail real estate.\nAs a result, the required provision for credit losses for commercial portfolios increased, and we booked a $22.3 million provision in the fourth quarter.\nThe allowance for credit losses increased to $252.7 million or 2.7% of loans from 2.3% last quarter.\nFor residential mortgages, improved macroeconomic variables and a $130 million portfolio reduction resulted in a $9.8 million release of credit losses for the quarter.\nSimilarly, improved macroeconomic variables led to a $2.3 million release in reserve requirements for consumer loans.\nExcluding PPP loans, the non-GAAP ratio of allowance to loans would be 3.39%, consistent with September's 3.38%.\nAsset quality remained stable, with non-performing assets flat at $294 million.\nNon-performing loans increased by $3.80 million, with $2.6 million in the residential portfolio and $1.4 million in the consumer portfolio.\nOther real estate owned decreased by $6 million due to sales.\nWe sold $5.8 million of residential real estate, all the real estate on our books.\nWith moratoriums expiring, we saw an increase in non-performing inflows to $32.9 million, up from $18.4 million in the third quarter.\nThis inflow level is in line with pre-pandemic levels from December 2019 and the first quarter of 2020.\nEarly delinquencies showed similar trends, increasing from September but still below December 2019 levels.\nWe expect some increases in non-performing loans in the first half of 2021 as we complete processes with customers and deal with moratorium impacts, returning to normal levels in the second half of the year.\nCapital ratios remain strong.\nThe leverage ratio decreased from September due to only one month of acquired operations being included in the average balance calculations.\nThe resulting leverage level of 11.3% is still very healthy and in line with expectations post-transaction.\nNet income for the year was $102 million or $0.46 per share, impacted by a $130 million increase in provisions, including pandemic effects and the $39 million Day 1 CECL allowance for non-PCD acquired loans.\nAdjusted pre-tax pre-provision income for the year increased 6% to $300 million from $284 million, including additional months from the acquired Santander operation.\nNon-performing assets decreased $24 million year-over-year to $294 million, and we continue working to reduce these numbers.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Outcomes may deviate from expectations.\nDuring today's comments, Mike, Chris, and Tom will mention certain non-standard financial metrics.\nI hope everyone is keeping well and secure.\nQuarterly revenue of $2.3 billion was marginally higher compared to the previous year.\nThe quarter's diluted earnings per share reached $3.68, while pension-adjusted earnings per share rose to $3.56 from $2.43 in the prior year.\nNew contracts valued at approximately $5.3 billion were secured during the quarter, leading to a record-breaking backlog of about $49 billion, with roughly $25 billion already funded.\nChris will elaborate on some of the key contract wins during his presentation.\nMoving on to developments in Washington.\nWe were gratified that the recently released overview of the fiscal year 2022 President's budget proposal emphasized the importance of maintaining U.S. naval strength to reassure allies and demonstrate resolve to potential adversaries.\nNotably, the budget summary highlighted ongoing efforts to modernize the nation's strategic submarine fleet, invest in unmanned and autonomous systems, and allocate funds for the next-generation attack submarine program.\nWe anticipate learning more about the budget specifics for these and other national security priorities when that information becomes available, as well as the proposed funding levels for the Energy and Homeland Security Departments.\nWe also anticipate collaborating closely with Congress as they review the FY '22 President's budget request during the current legislative session.\nRegarding portfolio adjustments this quarter, we finalized the previously announced divestiture of our oil and gas division and completed the transfer of the San Diego Shipyard to Titan Acquisition Holdings in exchange for a minority stake in this leading provider of ship repair and fleet maintenance services.\nThe completion of these transactions allows our Technical Solutions business to focus on areas where we believe our unique capabilities and strong customer relationships will drive robust organic revenue growth and improved profit margins.\nAs I conclude, I'm very satisfied with the team's operational rhythm, which has resulted in three consecutive quarters of strong program execution and financial performance.\nI'm confident that our resilience, adaptability, and positive momentum gained from weathering the impacts of COVID-19 will be key factors in leveraging our unprecedented backlog to generate strong free cash flow and create long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders, customers, and employees.\nBrian Cuccias retired on April 1 after serving as President of Ingalls since 2014 and dedicating more than 40 years to the company.\nBrian's tenure at Ingalls has been exceptional, and HII has greatly benefited from his leadership.\nKari Wilkinson took over as the new President of Ingalls on April 1, reporting to Chris.\nKari has demonstrated herself to be a strategic and forward-thinking leader focused on operational excellence, and I am extremely confident in her ability to lead Ingalls successfully.\nFrom an operational standpoint, we had a strong quarter, achieving steady progress across our shipbuilding and Technical Solutions programs.\nNow, let me highlight a few key contract awards and program updates from our business segments for the quarter.\nAt Ingalls, the team secured a life-cycle engineering and support services contract for the LPD program, potentially worth around $214 million.\nThe work scope encompasses engineering change management, supply chain oversight, training for new shipboard systems, and the execution of post-delivery maintenance periods.\nRegarding program status, LHA eight Bougainville reached a 25% completion milestone during the quarter, and the team remains committed to maintaining excellent cost and schedule performance to support planned production targets.\nThe DDG program team is concentrating on getting DDG 125 Jack H. Lucas ready for launch and preparing DDG 121 Frank E. Peterson, Jr. for sea trials, both scheduled for the latter half of this year.\nFor the LPD program, LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale is expected to complete sea trials later this year as planned.\nLPD 29, Richard M. McCool, Jr., is on schedule to be launched early next year.\nIngalls is collaborating closely with the Navy to secure contracts for LPD 32 and 33, as well as LHA nine.\nPurchasing these ships as a bundle is the most cost-effective approach.\nOnce completed, this method provides predictable cost savings for the Navy.\nNewport News received a $3 billion contract for the refueling and complex overhaul of CVN 74 USS John C. Stennis and a contract modification for building the 10th Virginia-class Block V submarine.\nThese significant contracts contribute to a record backlog, now approaching $49 billion.\nCVN 79 Kennedy is about 81% finished.\nThe team is finalizing plans to meet single phase delivery requirements while focusing on completing compartments and initial test milestones.\nCVN 73 USS George Washington is roughly 87% complete, with the crew recently beginning to move back onto the ship.\nThis key milestone supports the planned redelivery to the Navy next year.\nFor the VCS program, SSN 794 Montana is undergoing testing in preparation for delivery to the Navy later this year.\nSSN 796 New Jersey is on track to achieve its float off milestone in the second half of this year.\nTechnical Solutions secured several important contracts during the quarter, including a $175 million fleet recompete and a position on a Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific ISR and cybersecurity IDIQ contract.\nProduction of the first Orca XLUUV modules has begun at our unmanned systems center of excellence, with 75% of structural components fabricated and assembly underway, aiming for final delivery to Boeing later this year.\nThe Nuclear and Environmental Services business continues to perform well across Department of Energy contracts at Los Alamos, Nevada, and Savannah River.\nI will provide a brief overview of our first quarter results.\nGrowth at Newport News and Ingalls was largely offset by a decline in Technical Solutions due to divestitures related to portfolio-shaping actions.\nSegment operating income for the quarter increased by $35 million to $191 million compared to the first quarter of 2020, with segment operating margin rising 149 basis points to 8.4%.\nThe improvement was due to higher risk retirement at Ingalls and better performance in Technical Solutions.\nOperating income for the quarter decreased by $68 million to $147 million compared to the first quarter of 2020, with operating margin declining 35 basis points to 6.5%.\nThese decreases were mainly caused by a less favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustment, partially offset by stronger segment operating results compared to the previous year.\nThe tax rate during the quarter was about 15%, down from roughly 20% in Q1 2020.\nThe tax rate decrease was mainly attributed to selling our oil and gas operations and recognizing R&D tax credits for current and previous periods.\nQuarterly net earnings decreased to $148 million from $172 million in Q1 2020.\nQuarterly diluted earnings per share decreased to $3.68 from $4.23 in Q1 2020.\nWithout considering pension impact, quarterly diluted earnings per share increased to $3.56 from $2.43 in Q1 2020.\nThe quarter saw $43 million in operational cash flow and $59 million in net capital expenditures, equaling 2.6% of revenue, resulting in negative $16 million free cash flow.\nThese figures contrast with Q1 2020's $68 million operational cash flow, $66 million net capital expenditures, and $2 million free cash flow.\nWe contributed $72 million to pension and other post-retirement benefit plans this quarter, including $60 million in discretionary contributions to qualified pension plans.\nWe distributed $46 million in dividends, equating to $1.14 per share, during Q1.\nAs mentioned in our Q4 earnings call, we've resumed share buybacks and consider returning excess free cash flow through repurchases a key part of our long-term capital allocation strategy.\nWe bought back about 292,000 shares for approximately $50 million this quarter.\nLet's discuss pensions.\nAfter reviewing the American Rescue Plan Act, we maintain our previously provided five-year pension outlook as the most accurate projection.\nThe new legislation doesn't significantly affect our outlook due to our limited projected contributions and reduced cash sensitivity with safe harbor implementation.\nWe'll update near-term pension expectations in our Q3 call, as per our usual schedule.\nIngalls' quarterly revenue rose by $20 million (3.2%) to $649 million compared to last year, primarily due to increased DDG program revenue.\nIngalls' quarterly operating income of $91 million and 14% margin improved from Q1 2020, mainly because of higher risk retirement on LHA, related to the 25% completion milestone mentioned earlier.\nNewport News' quarterly revenue increased by $66 million (4.9%) to $1.4 billion compared to last year, due to higher revenues in aircraft carrier and submarine construction, and fleet support services.\nNewport News' quarterly operating income of $93 million and 6.6% margin slightly decreased year-over-year, primarily due to lower risk retirement on CVN 73 RCOH, partially offset by higher risk retirement on VCS Block IV boats.\nTechnical Solutions' quarterly revenue decreased by 18.3% to $259 million compared to last year, mainly due to divesting our oil and gas business and San Diego shipyard on February 1, partially offset by a full quarter of results from Hydroid, acquired at the end of Q1 2020.\nTechnical Solutions' quarterly operating income of $7 million improved from a loss in Q1 2020, primarily due to better performance in Defense and Federal Solutions and Nuclear Environmental Services, and a gain from selling our oil and gas business.\nMoving to Slide nine.\nWe

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We achieved another exceptional performance in Q3, with earnings of $0.81 per share.\nThis is attributed to various factors, including our steadily increasing repairing net income, expanded operations, emphasis on enhancing digital usage and customer service distinction, and the emerging economic and post-pandemic recovery in Puerto Rico.\nAll of this reinforces our positive outlook on Puerto Rico's economy and OFG's prospects.\nOur Q3 results demonstrate this across all operational areas.\nCore revenues totaled $135 million, showing a 4% quarterly increase when annualized.\nNet interest income rose to $103 million, partly due to a 17% reduction in funding costs.\nRevenue from banking and financial services grew by 3%.\nCredit loss provision resulted in a $5 million net gain as asset quality approached levels more comparable to U.S. peer banks.\nNon-interest expenses decreased by 5%, partly reflecting lower credit-related costs.\nPre-provision net revenue increased from $52 million in Q2 to $56 million.\nAs of September 30, customer deposits grew by $154 million to $9.2 billion, indicating increased liquidity for both business and individual clients.\nConsequently, both cash and assets expanded.\nLoans held for investment decreased by $87 million.\nExcluding forgiven PPP loans, they increased by $5 million.\nNew loan originations remained robust at $556 million.\nExcluding PPP, originations now total over $1.6 billion for the first nine months, up 69% compared to the same period last year and 79% compared to the same period in 2019, pre-COVID.\nIn Q3, we also successfully implemented our capital initiatives.\nWe bought back $40.2 million of shares as part of our ongoing $50 million repurchase program.\nWe raised our common stock dividend to $0.12 per share from $0.08 in Q1 and Q2, and $0.07 in the year-ago quarter.\nWe completed our $92 million redemption of all preferred stock.\nPlease refer to Page 4.\nAt OFG, we believe superior banking is founded on fulfilling our mission of assisting our customers, employees, and communities in attaining financial well-being.\nIn Q3, we demonstrated our adaptability to customers by introducing Puerto Rico's first digital residential mortgage process.\nWith a single click, customers can quickly obtain a pre-qualification letter, access valuable mortgage information, and apply online in one place.\nWe also swiftly processed forgiveness for our PPP clients.\nWe've now processed forgiveness for 91% of first and 25% of second PPP loans using our proprietary digital system.\nWe believe these faster, improved solutions showcase the benefits of banking with Oriental to our retail and commercial clients.\nOnline and mobile banking usage over 30 and 90-day periods remains significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels.\nThis continues to validate our long-term digital strategy and its growing acceptance among our customers and the market overall.\nFor our staff, we've implemented a mandatory COVID vaccination policy to ensure the safety of our customers and employees.\nWe've also adopted a hybrid work model to offer greater flexibility to our workforce.\nAs mentioned earlier, we've increased the hourly base pay for non-salaried employees.\nFor our communities, PASH Global and Oriental finalized a $15 million financing deal for a joint venture between PASH and Puma Energy.\nThis is enabling 200 Puma gas stations in Puerto Rico to install solar panels for producing and consuming solar energy.\nThis project is unprecedented in its kind and scale on the island.\nWe've also been developing several new corporate social responsibility initiatives, including a farming development program launched in Q3 with the Puerto Rico Conservation Trust to help various communities achieve economic sustainability.\nWe take great pride in these accomplishments.\nUltimately, nothing is more fulfilling than being part of a group that accomplishes its objectives.\nThis quarter's results motivate OFG employees to strive harder and aim higher.\nMaritza will now provide a more detailed financial analysis.\nLet's examine our financial highlights on Page 5.\nCore revenues amounted to $135 million.\nCompared to the second quarter, there was a rise of approximately $1.4 million or 4% when annualized.\nThis increase resulted from a positive $1.8 million reduction in funding costs, a $1 million growth in core non-interest income, an $800,000 increase from cash and investment securities, and $730,000 due to an extra day.\nThese gains outweighed a $2 million decrease from B2B loans and a $700,000 loan prepayment that boosted fee income in the previous quarter.\nThe PCD decline was attributed to lower volume, primarily from mortgage paydowns at lower rates.\nNon-interest expenses totaled $79 million.\nThis represents a $3.8 million reduction from the second quarter.\nThe third quarter included a $2.2 million advantage in credit-related expenses.\nThis was primarily due to profits from real estate sales.\nThe second quarter included a $2.2 million technology project write-off.\nThe third quarter also saw a mix of increased compensation for hourly employees and our previously announced cost-saving measures.\nOverall, recurring operating expenses remain consistent with our earlier projections for the year.\nHigher revenues and lower net-interest expenses led to improved operating leverage.\nThe efficiency ratio improved to 58.6%.\nThis is an improvement from 62% in the second quarter.\nWe aim to further enhance our efficiency ratio to the mid to lower 50% range.\nReturn on average assets was 1.6%, while return on average tangible common equity was 70.7%.\nWe continue to strengthen our capital position.\nTangible book value per share reached $18.59.\nThis represents a 3% increase from the second quarter.\nPlease refer to Page 6 for our operational highlights.\nAverage loan balances totaled $6.5 billion.\nThis is a decrease of $133 million from the second quarter.\nThe decline was primarily due to residential mortgage paydowns and PPP loan forgiveness.\nThis was partially offset by new commercial and auto loans.\nThe change in loan composition resulted in a 7 basis point decrease in loan yields.\nHigher residential mortgage paydowns reflected increased consumer liquidity.\nOur residential mortgage portfolio includes legacy Oriental mortgage loans and mortgage loans from the BBVA and Scotiabank acquisitions.\nNew originations, excluding PPP loans, totaled $556 million, which is $85 million less than the second quarter but $109 million more than the previous year.\nWe believe we are still observing generally strong trends in mortgage, commercial, and auto lending.\nWe continue to see growing demand for commercial loans to expand business operations, including new stores and warehouses, inventory purchases, or acquisitions.\nThe commercial portfolio, excluding PPP loans, has grown for two consecutive quarters.\nAverage core deposits amounted to $9.1 billion.\nThe second quarter saw a rise of 1.6% or $140 million.\nGrowth in non-interest bearing accounts, savings accounts, and non-accounts partially counterbalanced the reduction in customer CDs.\nThe expenses associated with core deposits are continuing to decrease.\nIn the third quarter, they reached 30 basis points.\nThis represents a decrease of 8 basis points compared to the second quarter.\nThis change reflects overall rate decreases and the ongoing maturity of older, higher-priced CDs.\nDue to the growth in deposits, the average cash balance reached $2.7 billion.\nThis represents a 7% increase or $180 million from the previous quarter.\nThe average investment portfolio reached $750 million, showing a growth of $100 million or 70% from the second quarter.\nThis includes the partial effect of $250 million in MBS purchases made at the quarter's end, capitalizing on market conditions.\nThe net interest margin was 4.12%, showing a decrease of 10 basis points from the previous quarter.\nThe increased cash amount reduced NIM by 6 basis points.\nWe are currently aiming to find opportunities to utilize excess liquidity through lending, capital actions, or investments.\nPlease refer to Page 7 for an overview of our credit quality and capital strength.\nAsset quality indicators continue to show positive trends.\nOur net charge-offs were at 37 basis points.\nThe third quarter net charge-off of $6 million included $6.5 million for a previously reserved amount on our commercial loans.\nThe early and total delinquency rates were 2.06% and 3.82% respectively, among the lowest in the past five quarters.\nThe non-performing loan rate for the non-PCD loan portfolio was 1.93%.\nThis is the lowest it has been in the last five quarters.\nAs a consequence of these factors, the provision for credit losses resulted in a net benefit of $5 million, reflecting a $4.3 million net reserve release.\nOur allowance coverage was 2.82% on a reported basis and 2.88% when excluding PPP loans.\nThe CET1 ratio remains high at 13.52% compared to our U.S. counterparts.\nStockholders' equity amounted to $1.05 billion, showing a decrease of $26 million from the second quarter.\nThis change reflected the redemption of Preferred Stock Series D and the common stock buyback, with a significant portion offset by an increase in [Indecipherable].\nThe tangible common equity ratio stood at 8.86%.\nPlease refer to Page 8 for our concluding remarks.\nAs mentioned earlier, we demonstrated strong performance across all areas this quarter.\nOur performance and credit metrics continue to match or surpass those of Mainland peers.\nWe implemented most of our stock buyback program while also increasing our common share dividend and redeeming our preferred stock.\nFrom a broader perspective, Puerto Rico continues to benefit from federal reconstruction and COVID stimulus.\nHowever, the relative economic impact here is more significant than in other U.S. jurisdictions, given our economy's size and average incomes.\nConsequently, we continue to observe growing optimism in the business sector, confirming Puerto Rico's economic revival.\nWe plan to continue leveraging our momentum in this improved economic climate.\nWe aim to utilize excess liquidity for loan growth and/or capital return initiatives.\nWe also intend to speed up our transformation, further streamline operations, and enhance efficiencies, all as part of our effort to serve customers more quickly and effectively, while assisting them in achieving financial well-being.\nWe at OFG are fully prepared.\nOperator, please initiate the question-and-answer session.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Management's assumptions form the basis of these statements, which may or may not come to fruition.\nSome of our remarks today reference non-GAAP adjusted metrics.\nWe anticipate submitting our 10-Q later today.\nThe call will be accessible on our website afterwards, and [Operator Instructions].\nThese calls are primarily intended for members of the financial community.\nI trust that you, your loved ones, and your coworkers are doing well and staying healthy.\nWe are all continuing to adapt to these extraordinary circumstances.\nIn the second quarter, cities within our service area began to reopen.\nSimilar to many regions in our country, we observed an uptick in COVID cases towards the end of July.\nHowever, it seems to have stabilized slightly.\nNow more than ever, we're embracing our core value of caring for one another and the communities we serve.\nFrom a business standpoint, we remain committed to delivering safe and reliable service while prioritizing the health and safety of our employees.\nOur conservative business model with stable utility margins continues to be advantageous.\nRecovery mechanisms are in place for most of our revenues to normalize weather impacts and decouple margins.\nWe also maintain a focus on operational efficiency.\nThis, along with the drop in natural gas prices, has resulted in natural gas bills that are approximately 40% lower now than they were 15 years ago, which is excellent news for our customers.\nThe third component of our strategy involves seeking growth opportunities that align with our conservative risk profile.\nRecent examples include a new contractual revenue stream from the North Mist gas storage expansion and our water and wastewater enterprises.\nOur robust business strategy enables us to adapt to unexpected challenges like the coronavirus.\nOur core values of integrity, safety, caring, service ethic, and environmental stewardship serve as the foundation and guiding principles for all our actions.\nSafety remains a top priority, and we stay vigilant during this pandemic regarding the wellbeing of our 1,200 employees and the 2.5 million people we serve.\nOur natural gas and water utilities are considered essential infrastructure.\nWe've maintained all crucial operations to provide reliable service while adhering to relevant health and safety guidelines, including those from OSHA and the CDC.\nWe've established a specialized field team that takes extra precautions when responding to calls where there's a known or suspected case of COVID.\nIn the spirit of caring and customer support, we temporarily halted disconnections and late fees for overdue bills.\nWe're also offering financial assistance through various programs, including our corporate philanthropy fund, gas assistance program, several state and federal initiatives, and a special employee giving campaign.\nIn June, we issued a $17 million bill credit to Oregon customers, a record amount under this sharing mechanism.\nSimultaneously, we continue to experience strong customer growth.\nNew construction and conversions resulted in connecting over 13,000 new customers in the past 12 months, equivalent to a growth rate of 1.7%.\nWhile we can't predict the full economic impact of the pandemic, our resilient business model, the timing of its onset, and our conservative and efficient operations continue to provide mitigating factors.\nWe care deeply about our customers and employees, and I'm proud of how quickly our staff has adapted to new safety procedures and embraced remote work while maintaining the highest levels of service and productivity.\nThis situation also reminds us of the importance of social justice in our workplace.\nAs a company, we've publicly declared that racism in any form is not tolerated at Northwest Natural.\nFor years, we've actively advanced an anti-racism and equity agenda, not only internally but also by founding and supporting broader community diversity initiatives and meeting ambitious goals to provide business opportunities to minority and women-owned enterprises.\nOur culture today is one of accountability, creativity, and collaboration that is inclusive and supports opportunities for all employees.\nThis work is challenging and there are no quick fixes.\nWe're committed to continuous improvement and will continue to foster such an environment, building a diverse workforce across all levels of our organization, ensuring equity in pay and development opportunities, and promoting inclusion so all voices are heard and respected.\nTurning to our progress in environmental stewardship, I'm pleased to announce that in July, we reached a significant milestone in Oregon.\nRulemaking was completed on groundbreaking renewable natural gas legislation, known as Senate Bill 98, which allows us to incorporate renewable natural gas (RNG) into our system and take the next step in our state's energy transition.\nRNG is a zero-carbon resource produced from organic materials such as food, agricultural and forestry waste, wastewater, or landfills that can be integrated into the existing natural gas system.\nThe law supports all forms of RNG, including renewable hydrogen.\nIt enables us to acquire RNG on behalf of Oregon customers and goes further than any other law by outlining goals to add up to 30% RNG into the state's pipeline system by 2050.\nUp to 5% of a utility's revenue requirement can be allocated to cover the incremental costs of renewable natural gas.\nFor Northwest Natural, this currently amounts to approximately $30 million per year.\nUtilities are permitted to include interconnections with the gas system in their rate base, and may incorporate RNG facilities if it's the most cost-effective option for customers.\nWe're grateful for the backing of the legislature, governor, and regulators in taking this important step forward.\nNorthwest Natural and all parties in the Oregon general rate case recently submitted a comprehensive agreement to the Public Utility Commission of Oregon.\nThe submission proposes a $45.8 million increase in revenue requirement, down from the initially requested $71.4 million.\nThis agreement is founded on previously agreed-upon capital components, including a 50-50 debt-equity ratio, a 9.4% return on equity, and a cost of capital just under 7%.\nThe agreement also reflects an average rate base of about $1.45 billion.\nNorthwest Natural's submission requires OPUC approval.\nIf approved, the new rates are anticipated to become effective on November 1 this year.\nThis coincides with the implementation of our revised purchased gas adjustment, or PGA.\nThis year's PGA projects a reduction in customers' bills, which will counterbalance most of the recently agreed-upon base rate increase.\nWe applaud the commissioners and involved parties for their ability to continue working remotely under challenging circumstances.\nI'll start by summarizing our second quarter and year-to-date financial results, then discuss key metrics and the financial impact of COVID-19 on our business and 2020 outlook.\nI'll explain earnings drivers on an after-tax basis using the 26.5% statutory tax rate.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.6% due to the return of excess deferred income taxes to our Oregon customers.\nNote that earnings per share comparisons were affected by the issuance of 1.4 million shares in June 2019 to fund gas utility investments.\nFor the quarter, we reported a $5.1 million net loss from continuing operations, or $0.17 per share, compared to $2.1 million net income, or $0.07 per share, for the same period in 2019.\nThe quarterly earnings decline is primarily due to two factors.\nFirst, the second quarter results reflect COVID-19's financial impact on margin, O&M, and interest expense.\nWe estimate the total COVID-19 impact to be approximately $4 million or $0.12 per share, mostly occurring in the second quarter.\nWe've recorded a deferral for some of these costs with an offsetting reserve pending regulatory clarity on cost recoverability.\nSecond, last year's second quarter results benefited from reversing an $0.11 per share earnings test reserve for environmental remediation expenses booked in the first quarter.\nRegarding the gas distribution segment, utility margin decreased by $1 million.\nHigher customer rates in Washington, customer growth, and North Mist expansion project revenues contributed $2.9 million, which was more than offset by a $3.2 million increase in environmental remediation expense due to the prior year's reserve release.\nCOVID-19's impact on margin is estimated at $1.5 million, including a $700,000 revenue decline from lower late charges and disconnection fees, which we voluntarily suspended in March.\nWe also saw slightly lower usage from non-decoupled industrial and commercial customers.\nUtility O&M increased by $2.8 million in the quarter due to higher contractor service costs for pipeline and meter safety, moving expenses related to transitioning to a new headquarters and operations center, increased compensation costs for additional IT staff, and higher wages under the new five-year union contract.\nO&M also increased by $200,000 due to a higher bad debt reserve related to COVID-19.\nDepreciation expense and general taxes rose by $2 million due to ongoing system investments, including the North Mist gas storage facility, which entered rates in May 2019.\nInterest expense increased by $1.1 million due to several March financings to boost cash reserves as a precautionary measure during significant market volatility in the pandemic's early stages.\nFor the first half of 2020, we reported $43.1 million net income from continuing operations, or $1.41 per share, compared to $45.5 million, or $1.56 per share, for the same period in 2019.\nLast year's results included a $0.23 per share regulatory disallowance related to an Oregon Commission order.\nExcluding that disallowance, adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.79 for 2019.\nThe $0.38 per share decline is mainly due to year-over-year expense growth and COVID-19 effects.\nIn the gas distribution segment, utility margin increased by $100,000.\nHigher customer rates in Washington, customer growth, and North Mist expansion project revenues contributed an additional $10.1 million.\nThis was partially offset by lower entitlement and curtailment fees related to 2019 pipeline constraints and warmer weather in 2020, which collectively reduced margin by $4.9 million.\nThe remaining $5.2 million utility margin decline results from the March 2019 Oregon order on tax reform and pension expense.\nExcept for the first quarter pension disallowance, this order doesn't impact net income as offsetting adjustments were recognized through expenses and income taxes.\nUtility O&M and other expenses decreased by $6.9 million during the first six months of 2020.\nThe decline is attributed to accounting entries related to the 2019 Oregon order, resulting in an additional $14 million expense in Q1 2019, as previously mentioned\nThis was counterbalanced by a $5.8 million rise in underlying O&M due to the cost factors I explained in the quarterly results\nWe have made significant investments in our gas infrastructure over recent years and activated the North Mist gas facility\nConsequently, depreciation costs rose by $4.9 million\nAdditionally, the 2019 utility segment tax expense included a $5.9 million advantage from implementing the March order, which had no substantial impact on net income\nProfits from our other ventures decreased by $1.5 million due to reduced asset management revenues caused by less favorable market conditions\nNow let's discuss the financial impact of COVID-19\nAlthough our business model is resilient and the pandemic began after Northwest Natural's peak heating season, we are experiencing some financial effects related to the crisis\nAs of June 30, we estimate $4 million in combined additional costs and reduced revenues\nBased on our current experience and future projections, we are closely monitoring several factors\nWe are tracking commercial customer losses due to business closures, but have not observed significant changes or immediate effects on customer growth, though it's still early in the economic downturn\nWe are also watching the loss of late fee revenue and potential bad debt expenses\nWe have increased our bad debt reserve from $800,000 in June 2019 to $1.6 million in June 2020\nWe've noticed some decrease in industrial and large commercial customer usage, but haven't seen a substantial reduction so far\nAs mentioned, we took measures to improve our liquidity by increasing cash reserves\nAs a result, we had over $470 million in cash at the end of Q1\nAs market conditions improved, we reduced that amount to $137 million\nWhile these financings incur additional interest costs, we consider it relatively inexpensive insurance given market volatility\nWe've requested regulatory deferrals to recover certain costs and are collaborating with regulators to determine which costs are eligible for recovery\nWe're also taking steps to ensure efficient operations, and these savings help offset the impact of COVID\nIn conclusion, Q2 results are aligning with our expectations, and we continue to monitor the evolving situation as we approach the next heating season\nWe reaffirm guidance for continuing operations between $2.25 and $2.45 per share, leaning towards the lower end due to potential COVID-19 implications\nThis guidance assumes continued customer growth, average weather conditions, and no significant changes in regulatory policies, mechanisms, outcomes, laws, legislation, or regulations\nThe guidance excludes any gains from the Gill Ranch sale and associated operating results, which are reported in discontinued operations\nWe are monitoring the pandemic's

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The company's financial reports provide detailed information on these elements.\nUnless explicitly stated otherwise, our discussion will focus on consolidated results using core performance measures, which are non-GAAP metrics used by management for business analysis.\nYou can find a comparison of core results to GAAP figures in the investor relations area of our website at corning.com.\nCore results and downloadable financials are accessible through our website's interactive analyst center.\nWe suggest you follow along with the presentation.\nThese materials can also be downloaded from our website.\nOur third quarter results demonstrate the company's strength, financial health, and growth potential.\nRevenue increased 16% sequentially to $3 billion.\nEarnings per share grew 72% sequentially to $0.43, with operating margin expanding to 18.3%, up 710 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points year-over-year, due to higher sales and efficient manufacturing.\nWe generated $518 million in free cash flow and ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in cash reserves.\nOur financial performance has significantly improved since April, and we anticipate a strong fourth quarter.\nWe remain cautious and continue to adapt to various global disruptions, including the pandemic, civil unrest, recession, and geopolitical conflicts.\nWe've been addressing these challenges from the beginning, and our priorities remain clear.\nOur actions must reflect our values.\nEvery aspect of our operations is guided by our commitment to employee health, safety, and well-being.\nWe're allocating resources and providing leadership to support our global communities.\nWe've initiated Unity campaigns and programs targeting racial and social equality to address the many hardships people are currently facing.\nWe're fully committed to the global health fight, mobilizing our capabilities to directly combat the virus.\nWe must also protect our financial health.\nOur third-quarter results show that our decisive actions are yielding clear benefits as we capitalize on cost savings and improve efficiencies across the company.\nWe're doing everything possible to keep the company strong, regardless of the extent or duration of global uncertainty, and it's proving effective.\nTo ensure we emerge even stronger, we're continuing to invest in creating additional revenue streams.\nWe're developing new materials and manufacturing processes, as well as collaborating with customers to create innovative solutions.\nOur portfolio's relevance places Corning at the forefront of ongoing innovation with industry leaders, and we continue to solve our customers' most challenging technology problems.\nYou may have noticed Apple's recent promotion of ceramic shield for the iPhone 12.\nThey're featuring our new-to-the-world material, the first highly transparent, color-free glass ceramic that meets the demanding requirements for smartphone cover materials.\nThis latest innovation with Apple exemplifies our ongoing strategy of creating long-term value by combining our expertise in glass science, ceramic science, and optical physics with our unparalleled manufacturing and engineering capabilities.\nCeramic shield combines the desirable attributes of glass, such as optical clarity and strength, with the toughness of ceramics.\nThe material consists of ceramic crystals within a glass matrix.\nTwo major inventions were involved: maintaining the best damage-resistant properties of both glass and ceramics, and ensuring high optical transparency by growing index-matched nanocrystals inside the glass matrix that are one-tenth the wavelength of light.\nApple has invested $450 million in Corning through their advanced manufacturing fund, demonstrating their commitment to fostering innovation among American manufacturers.\nWe're extremely proud to be a key component in the iPhone 12.\nIt's important to note that the iPhone 12 and many other flagship phones we're part of support 5G.\n5G is significant for us, as the fiber density required to deliver its promise is much greater than for 4G.\nWe recently announced a new product design to help operators significantly increase the speed and reduce the cost of their outdoor deployments.\nWe're also beginning new work to support Verizon's efforts to extend 5G indoors.\nThe relevance of our portfolio and our strong customer relationships keep us at the center of the ongoing shift to optical technologies.\nIn all the industries we serve, important market trends present new challenges that Corning is uniquely qualified to address, as well as opportunities to integrate more Corning content into products.\nThis is particularly valuable during economic uncertainty, as we're not solely relying on increased consumer purchases.\nWe're incorporating more Corning technology into products people are already buying.\nToday's results clearly show the benefits of this approach, with innovation adoption driving specialty materials sales up 23% year-over-year despite a declining smartphone market.\nThis type of outperformance is not unusual for us.\nFrom 2016 to 2019, we added $500 million in sales, or 42% cumulatively, while smartphone sales decreased.\nWe're continuing this growth trend this year.\nIn environmental technologies, our sales grew 16% in 2019, outpacing underlying unit demand as automakers added gas particulate filters to cars.\nThis quarter, we again saw outperformance with sequential sales up 68%.\nThese examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our \"more Corning\" strategy and highlight the power of our content story.\nI want to emphasize an additional point: our core technologies enable life-changing capabilities, and in these times, we're increasingly focused on life-saving innovations.\nSafe, widespread vaccine delivery is a top societal priority, and glass packaging is crucial.\nOur Valor innovation will enable faster filling line speeds and increased patient safety.\nWe're currently expanding capacity and supplying glass vials for vaccines as part of Operation Warp Speed, while leveraging our life sciences leadership to support COVID diagnostic testing and virus research efforts.\nAdditionally, reduced fine particulate pollution, the goal of our filtration products, appears to help reduce infection rates.\nWe're excited about recent university lab tests showing that our Guardian antimicrobial glass particles kill bacteria and viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.\nWe're also well-positioned to contribute as consumers adapt to a world with social distancing.\nFor instance, optical fiber enhances network capacity and efficiency, while glass serves as the primary medium for accessing information and entertainment.\nWe believe we can develop additional innovations in crucial areas as the world confronts and recovers from current challenges.\nWe experienced a robust quarter across nearly all aspects.\nIn terms of innovation, I recently examined our substantial advancements.\nFrom a financial standpoint, we achieved double-digit sales growth sequentially and improved margins to boost profitability at an even faster rate.\nWe performed well operationally, and I'd like to provide a few examples.\nDuring the pandemic, we dispatched expert engineering teams to initiate our Gen 10.5 melting operations in both Wuhan and Guangzhou.\nThese facilities are positioning us favorably to meet the rapidly growing demand for large TVs.\nIn mobile consumer electronics, we successfully scaled up a novel manufacturing process and product to meet Apple's iPhone launch requirements.\nIn the automotive sector, we adjusted our operations to accommodate the swift production ramp-up at OEMs following their significant reduction in Quarter 2.\nIn optical communications, we successfully adapted our costs to the current market conditions, resulting in substantial profitability improvement despite relatively flat sales quarter-over-quarter.\nWe continue to be vigilant in our efforts to safeguard the company's financial stability.\nWe are proud of our performance, particularly given the current global uncertainties.\nIt is evident that our employees worldwide are committed to upholding our values and giving their best every day.\nWe had an exceptionally strong third quarter.\nAs Wendell pointed out, we executed effectively and strengthened our already healthy balance sheet despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges.\nSales growth and cost-cutting measures led to substantial sequential margin expansion, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our operational adjustments.\nWe have made significant changes to align our costs and operating plans with lower anticipated sales.\nOverall, Corning continues to demonstrate that it has the resources to fulfill our commitments and extend our leadership as we maintain our focus on operational excellence, cash flow generation, and prudent capital allocation.\nBefore delving into the details of our performance and results, I want to highlight the changes at Hemlock during Q3 and explain the differences between GAAP and core results.\nOn September 9, Hemlock Semiconductor group bought out DuPont's 40.25% ownership stake in the company, transforming Corning's long-standing ownership in Hemlock into a majority position.\nIn a second transaction, Hemlock acquired certain manufacturing assets from DuPont and gained control of a crucial raw material, thereby becoming a leading, low-cost producer of ultra-pure polysilicon for the semiconductor industry.\nHemlock's leadership position is supported by attractive long-term take-or-pay customer contracts with upfront payments.\nWe are very enthusiastic about these transactions.\nThey benefit Hemlock, Corning, and our shareholders.\nWe didn't invest any money in the transaction, and Hemlock generates substantial cash flow, allowing its debt to be mostly repaid within a year.\nCorning improves its financial position by adding sales and earnings.\nIn the third quarter, we recognized $31 million in sales from the newly consolidated Hemlock.\nHemlock will contribute approximately $150 million in annual cash flow.\nPlease refer to our web disclosure for helpful consolidation details.\nNow, let's discuss GAAP.\nThe main differences between our third-quarter GAAP and core results are a non-cash gain associated with the Hemlock transaction, ongoing restructuring charges (primarily non-cash), and a mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts.\nRegarding the mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be marked-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter, even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter.\nFor us, this reduced GAAP earnings in Q3 by $103 million.\nTo be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.\nOur currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide greater certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth, and our future shareholder distributions.\nOur non-GAAP or core results offer additional transparency into operations by using a constant-currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions.\nWe are very satisfied with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides.\nWe have received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than five years ago.\nNow, I will walk you through our third quarter performance.\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, we committed to preserving our financial strength and positioning the company to emerge even stronger.\nIn Q1 and Q2, we informed you that we were responding to economic uncertainty by making significant operational adjustments.\nWe stated that we reduced costs and capital spending to align with lower anticipated sales.\nWhile ramping down production and reducing inventory impacts margins, we said that when sales growth resumed, we expected improved profitability.\nLooking at the third quarter, our sales grew 16% sequentially to $3 billion, and our operating margin expanded by 710 basis points sequentially, to 18.3%.\nThis resulted in net income of $380 million and earnings per share of $0.43, up 72% sequentially.\nWe also said we would maintain a strong cash balance and generate positive free cash flow for the year.\nIn the third quarter, free cash flow grew to $518 million, and cumulative free cash flow for the first three quarters was $484 million.\nWe ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.5 billion and expect to generate additional positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter as we continue to reduce costs, control inventory, and execute well overall.\nAs a result, I'm confident that we will achieve our free cash flow goals.\nThe actions we're taking are clearly working.\nWe have delivered significant operational improvements, which began to show results in Q2 and really accelerated in Q3.\nWe expect the benefits of these actions to continue in Q4, contributing to another strong quarter.\nNow, let's review the business segments.\nIn display technologies, third quarter sales were $827 million, up 10% sequentially, and net income was $196 million, up 29% sequentially.\nDisplay glass volume grew approximately 10% sequentially, as panel makers increased utilization, resulting in strong incrementals.\nSequential price declines were moderate, as expected.\nFrom an end-market perspective, it appears that the impact of COVID-19 has been positive.\nIn developed markets, consumers are prioritizing in-home entertainment.\nGlobally, work and study from home trends are growing.\nThis is increasing demand for TV and IT products.\nOn the other hand, smartphone demand has declined.\nThe retail market, as measured by square footage of glass, has experienced mid-single digit growth year-to-date through August.\nThe upcoming holiday shopping period will significantly influence the market's performance for the entire year.\nWe remain optimistic that television screen sizes will continue to increase over time.\nSales of TVs 65 inches or larger have increased by 40% year-to-date through August.\nOur Gen 10.5 technology positions us well to capture most of this growth, as it is the most efficient size for manufacturing large TVs.\nWe anticipate display pricing to decrease by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2020.\nThree factors contribute to a favorable glass pricing environment: expected balanced to tight glass supply and demand, competitors' profitability challenges at current prices, and the need for periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations.\nWe are aligning our Gen 10.5 tank production with panel makers' schedules.\nOur competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels.\nDisplay glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations, and glass prices must support acceptable returns on these investments.\nIn the optical communications sector, third-quarter sales increased by 10% sequentially to $909 million, with stable carrier spending and deployments and slight growth in enterprise sales.\nNet income rose by $34 million or 42% to $115 million, primarily due to improved cost performance.\nNetwork demand is at an all-time high, and network operators are making positive statements about capacity expansion.\nCurrently, COVID-related factors have hindered broad network investments, with operators focusing on addressing capacity bottlenecks.\nWe anticipate that operators will soon begin additional investments to restore normal network capacity and expand their offerings.\nLarge-scale carrier and enterprise capital projects are inevitable, but their timing is difficult to predict.\nEnvironmental technology sales in the third quarter reached $379 million, a 68% sequential increase as markets recovered and OEMs continued to adopt GPS in Europe and China.\nWe adjusted our operations effectively to match the market recovery and delivered net income of $69 million, compared to breakeven in the second quarter.\nThe business team performed exceptionally well over the past six months in responding to the rapid shutdown and restart of auto production by controlling costs and maintaining flexibility.\nAutomotive sales grew 1% year-over-year, outperforming vehicle production, which declined 6% year-over-year, due to continued strong adoption of GPS.\nChina's market performance remained strong in the quarter, showing slight year-over-year growth.\nNorth American and European OEMs more than doubled production sequentially, but experienced a 5% year-over-year decline.\nDiesel sales improved by 49% from the second quarter but were still down 15% year-over-year.\nThe North American heavy-duty truck market improved but remains in a cyclical downturn with vehicle production down 46% year-over-year.\nThird-quarter sales of heavy-duty vehicles in China continued to exceed 2019 levels, with increased adoption of advanced content in preparation for China 6 regulations.\nThis year has been challenging for our automotive market access platform, but we are recovering faster than the market due to increasing content, primarily GPS and advanced heavy-duty products.\nOur content-driven strategy continues to yield strong results.\nSpecialty materials sales reached $570 million in the third quarter, up 23% year-over-year, outperforming the declining smartphone market.\nNet income grew 59% year-over-year to $146 million.\nSales growth was driven by Ceramic Shield, our new glass ceramic on the iPhone 12, premium glass sales, IT and tablet glass sales supporting work-from-home trends, and strong performance in our advanced optic products.\nStrong adoption and commercialization of our innovations led to robust year-over-year results for specialty materials in the third quarter, and we expect this trend to continue for the full year 2020.\nIn life sciences, North American lab utilization is increasing, and the pandemic is driving demand for laboratory diagnostic tests and consumables, leading to increased demand for our products.\nIn July, we implemented our long-term plan to launch a new, larger distribution center to support our growth and enhance our ability to meet our customers' increased needs worldwide.\nStarting this center during a pandemic proved more challenging than anticipated, which limited third-quarter sales.\nSales declined 8% sequentially, while net income decreased by 10%, in line with the lower volume.\nWe have added resources where needed, implemented recovery plans, and are confident that operations will support the required output in Q4.\nWe anticipate strong sequential life science growth in the fourth quarter.\nRegarding our balance sheet and financial stewardship, we have maintained our commitment to preserving financial strength and positioning the company for future growth.\nWe have implemented operational improvements and generated strong free cash flow.\nWe maintain a conservative balance sheet with a strong cash position of $2.5 billion at the end of the quarter.\nOur debt structure is conservative by design and relatively unique, with an average debt maturity of about 25 years, the longest in the S&P 500.\nOver the next 15 months, we have less than $70 million in debt coming due.\nLess than half of our total debt is due within the next 20 years, with no single year having debt repayment over $500 million.\nOur balance sheet is designed to withstand challenging times like these.\nWe expect to generate positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter and for the year, maintain a strong cash position, and continue our dividend.\nWe have the necessary financial resources to weather the economic slowdown.\nIn conclusion, we demonstrated outstanding operational performance in the quarter with significant sequential improvement in sales, net income, earnings per share, and free cash flow.\nWe are successfully executing our operational and financial goals to remain strong during the crisis and expect another solid quarter to end the year.\nWe remain aware of potential impacts from the pandemic, global recession, civil unrest, and geopolitical tensions.\nRegardless of the recovery's duration or shape, Corning is effectively safeguarding its financial strength, our growth drivers remain intact, and we continue to advance important growth initiatives with industry leaders.\nWe are confident that our execution and market leadership position us to emerge from the current global uncertainty even stronger.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other SEC filings outline numerous risks and uncertainties that could affect these statements.\nOur actual outcomes may vary significantly from what is expressed or implied in our comments due to these risks.\nWe finalized the acquisition of Apple Leisure Group on November 1, and our enthusiasm for the merged company's potential has only grown since our initial announcement in August.\nAfter spending more time with the ALG team, meeting hotel owners, and visiting several impressive AMR collection resorts over the past few months, I'm excited about ALG's future as part of Hyatt.\nThe cultural alignment between our companies, with a shared focus on care, is perfect.\nThe timing is proving advantageous as leisure demand remains strong and represents a growing portion of our business mix.\nWe will keep you updated on our integration progress and ALG platform performance going forward.\nFocusing on our results, we've had another quarter of recovery, demonstrating our business's strength and confirming that we're emerging from this challenging period as a more adaptable and robust company.\nIn just two quarters, our quarterly adjusted EBITDA has improved by $130 million, reaching nearly 70% of 2019 levels in Q3.\nWe've worked hard to adapt our operating model, and our financial results and momentum reflect this progress.\nWhile focusing on cash preservation and expense management, we've invested in growth areas without compromising our long-term strategy.\nWith increasing vaccination rates, easing global travel restrictions, and reopening borders, I'm more confident than ever about our path to full recovery.\nI'm optimistic about recent business trends and key developments, including the ALG acquisition, which show significant progress towards realizing our long-term strategy benefits.\nLet's examine the latest business trends.\nQ3 RevPAR continued to recover rapidly, accelerating nearly 30% compared to Q2 and doubling Q1 levels.\nAs mentioned in our previous earnings call, we experienced a surge in leisure demand during summer, with systemwide RevPAR exceeding $100 in July, about 75% recovered compared to 2019.\nRevPAR decreased by approximately 10% in August compared to July due to seasonality and reimposed travel restrictions in certain markets related to the Delta variant.\nHowever, this decline was brief.\nDemand rebounded throughout September and has further strengthened as we enter Q4.\nOctober's absolute RevPAR is nearly as strong as July at $98.\nEncouragingly, the recovery has broadened, with recent improvement coming from urban locations, which saw 10% RevPAR growth in October compared to July.\nLeisure Transient remains the top-performing segment, with systemwide Leisure Transient revenue at 96% of fully recovered levels in Q3, despite significant global restrictions.\nStrong leisure transient demand is proving to be more than just a summer phenomenon, with October bookings for all periods over 20% ahead of 2019 levels.\nAmericas resort transient revenue is pacing 25% ahead of 2019 levels for late December, suggesting this festive season could be one of our strongest ever.\nGroup and business transient demand have also shown positive progression.\nWhile demand didn't immediately accelerate after Labor Day due to the Delta variant, upward momentum has been steady throughout September and October.\nGroup demand improvement in October has been particularly significant after elevated cancellations in August and early September.\nSystemwide group revenue increased 16% in October compared to September, trending at 50% of fully recovered levels.\nGroup bookings for 2022 are showing significant improvement, with October leads for 2022 growing 38% compared to September and now 10% ahead of 2019 levels.\nWhile 2022 group pace is about 80% recovered, slightly weaker than last quarter, strong current bookings and growing lead volume provide confidence in building momentum for 2022.\nBusiness transient recovery has been softer than group but shows steady momentum, reaching 46% of 2019 levels in October.\nRegional accounts continue to outperform larger national accounts, but the gap is narrowing.\nOur largest corporate accounts have grown by 50% since June, and we're encouraged by dialogues with corporate customers returning to offices and planning more robust travel in 2022.\nRecovery momentum has expanded geographically.\nEurope has seen notable improvement, now trending at roughly the same level as the United States after a fivefold increase in RevPAR over the past five months.\nThe Middle East is experiencing 70% occupancy, similar to 2019 levels, driven by strong demand from the Dubai Expo running from October to March 2022.\nIndia's occupancy, which was below 20% a few months ago due to the Delta variant, is now trending at almost 60% as October ends.\nConsidering trends across geography and travel purpose, along with recent forward booking data, the underlying business momentum is clear and aligns with our belief that we're on a path to full recovery.\nRegarding our long-term strategy, we've been actively positioning Hyatt for the future by focusing on three pillars: maximizing our core business, integrating new growth platforms, and optimizing capital deployment.\nI struggle to remember a quarter where we made as much progress on our long-term strategy as we did in Q3 this year.\nLet's begin with the first part of our plan, which is optimizing our main business as it forms the foundation for all our activities.\nWe've concentrated on three crucial areas within this part to boost performance.\nInitially, we're targeting high-end travelers by delving deeper into this segment rather than expanding beyond it.\nNext, we're channeling more business to our direct platforms through engagement backed by data and analysis.\nLastly, we're operating efficiently by being adaptable and responsive to market changes.\nOur advancements in these areas are evident not only in our Q3 financial results mentioned earlier but also in our core metrics when compared to Q3 2019.\nSome notable achievements include increased market share, improved direct channel mix, a higher proportion of hotel arrivals from existing loyalty members, and better comparable O&L margins than the same period in 2019.\nThe ultimate indicator is owner investment in our brands, best shown through our net room growth and pipeline.\nOur Q3 net room growth was 6.9%, leading the industry, with notable openings including Thompson Hollywood, Park Hyatt Toronto, and Hyatt Ziva Riviera Cancun.\nOur pipeline, now at 103,000 rooms, has grown from the previous quarter and represents an industry-leading 41% of our current property portfolio.\nWe also made significant progress with the second part of our long-term strategy by integrating new growth platforms through our acquisition of Apple Leisure Group, an exciting new asset-light growth opportunity for Hyatt.\nALG, now part of Hyatt, immediately doubles our resort portfolio, increases our European presence by over 60%, and positions us as the world's largest operator of luxury all-inclusive resorts.\nWe expect this to increase our systemwide stabilized leisure transient revenue mix to over 50%.\nWe also anticipate the ALG brands will drive accretive room growth well into the future, similar to our Two Roads Hospitality acquisition in 2018, which has significantly driven Hyatt's growth this year, including conversions and pipeline expansion.\nIn 2021, ALG's AMR collection is expected to end the year with 35% net room growth, adding 31 hotels and about 8,500 rooms, bringing the AMR collection to 101 hotels totaling 33,000 rooms by year-end.\nThe ALG acquisition is a defining moment in Hyatt's 60-plus year history, comparable to our international expansion into Hong Kong or the launch of the Park Hyatt brand.\nWe're now entering a new chapter for Hyatt.\nBesides the exciting growth the acquisition brings to Hyatt and the new experiences the ALG platform offers our guests, ALG's earnings base allows us to make significant progress on the third part of our long-term strategy: optimizing capital deployment.\nWe're encouraged that ALG is on track to outperform its 2019 results in 2021, exceeding our expectations.\nThis earnings base allows us to execute a crucial part of our capital strategy: unlocking the value of our real estate assets by selling them over time and prioritizing reinvestment of proceeds into growth opportunities for Hyatt.\nIn August, along with the acquisition announcement, we committed to a $2 billion expansion of our asset disposition plan.\nThe proceeds from these future asset sales will help us reduce our balance sheet debt more quickly, paying off the debt incurred for the ALG acquisition.\nWe've started this process with two properties currently on the market and other active discussions underway.\nWe're confident in our ability to execute this expanded asset disposition plan.\nWe've realized over $3 billion in proceeds since our original 2017 announcement at a very attractive multiple, and we still have a high-quality, highly desirable asset base on our balance sheet.\nTo recap, the $3 billion commitment was split into two parts: $1.5 billion in 2017 and another $1.5 billion in 2019.\nIn September, we sold two assets, the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe and Alila Ventana Big Sur, for about $500 million in gross proceeds, bringing our total gross proceeds from asset sales since 2017 to over $3 billion at an average aggregate multiple of 17.4 times.\nWe kept long-term management agreements for both recently sold hotels and exceeded our disposition target well ahead of schedule.\nIn conclusion, we look forward to continuing our track record of realizing proceeds above Hyatt's implied valuation multiple while transforming our earnings mix to an expected 80% fee-based proportion by the end of 2024.\nImportantly, with earnings from our ALG acquisition and fees driven by our industry-leading growth, we'll achieve this progress while maintaining investment capacity for future opportunities.\nOverall, I'm very pleased with our progress towards our long-term strategy as we remain focused on executing the three key areas I've outlined to position ourselves for the future.\nLastly, I want to mention the owner's meeting we recently held at the beautiful Hyatt Regency Huntington Beach Resort.\nAttendance was at an all-time high, and the energy from gathering in person was truly palpable.\nI was impressed by our shared optimism about the future and how our purpose of caring for people so they can be their best has resonated with and been felt by our owners during the industry's most challenging downturn ever.\nTheir feedback focused on our attentiveness, focus on important issues, and staying connected to their needs.\nWe have much to do to attract the best talent in a challenging labor market, to drive market share and operating margins for our brands and owners, and to ensure our systems and services keep pace with rapidly changing technology trends.\nI left the meeting feeling energized by our progress and the opportunities ahead to continue delivering value to all our stakeholders.\nWe've made significant progress towards realizing the benefits of our long-term strategy.\nAs the recovery continues, we've positioned Hyatt to emerge from this pandemic as a stronger and more agile company.\nOur view of sustainable future demand continues to sharpen, and with each passing month, our conviction and enthusiasm grows.\nOver to you, Joan.\nYesterday evening, we reported third quarter net income attributable to Hyatt of $120 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.15, with our results positively impacted by $307 million in gains from real estate sales.\nThird quarter adjusted EBITDA was $110 million, effectively doubling our second quarter adjusted EBITDA, again demonstrating our ability to convert improving demand into strong earnings growth.\nIn a RevPAR environment that's improving but still challenging, we managed to narrow our adjusted EBITDA decline to just 32% in the third quarter compared to the same period in 2019, matching our systemwide RevPAR decline of 32%.\nMoreover, our third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.4%, a 50 basis point improvement from the 26.9% adjusted EBITDA margin we reported in the third quarter of 2019, serving as another indicator of operational excellence in a lower demand environment.\nSystemwide RevPAR was $94 in the third quarter, representing a 29% increase compared to the second quarter.\nBoth occupancy and rate contributed to sequential growth, with occupancy improving by 7% and rate increasing by 12%.\nThe rate improvement is particularly noteworthy as it reached 96% of 2019 levels across the entire system.\nOur base incentive and franchise fees amounted to $96 million in the third quarter, reaching 71% of 2019 levels, with these fees recovering more fully than RevPAR due to our strong net rooms growth over the past two years.\nLet's move on to our segment results.\nOur management and franchising business generated a combined adjusted EBITDA of $85 million, showing a 33% improvement from the second quarter.\nThe Americas segment was responsible for the majority of the sequential growth and recovered to about 80% of 2019 segment adjusted EBITDA levels.\nHotels and resort locations were the main drivers of recovery during July and August, with urban locations showing more significant improvement in September, driven by increasing demand for business travel and group bookings.\nOur Europe, Africa, Middle East and Southwest Asia segment also saw substantial improvement in the third quarter, benefiting from relaxed travel restrictions and reopened borders across Europe.\nFees from our European hotels more than doubled compared to the previous quarter, with France and Southern Europe leading the recovery.\nThe Asia Pacific segment didn't experience the same level of improvement as our other two segments, and recovery in this region remains inconsistent.\nMainland China's RevPAR started the quarter strong, trending 4% ahead of 2019 levels in July, before dropping to less than 50% of 2019 levels in August due to reinstated travel restrictions.\nDemand has since improved, with RevPAR strengthening to 78% of 2019 levels in October.\nFurthermore, the recovery in Asia Pacific, excluding Mainland China, has progressed more slowly than other parts of the world due to stricter travel restrictions still in place.\nNevertheless, we remain optimistic that results will improve in the region as vaccination rates continue to increase, allowing for restrictions to be eased.\nShifting focus to our owned and leased hotels segment.\nThis business delivered $51 million of adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter, representing a $39 million improvement from the second quarter.\nThe performance significantly exceeded expectations, driven by the creativity and adaptability of our teams to market conditions.\nOwned and leased RevPAR was $117 for the third quarter, improving 39% from the second quarter with notable improvement in group revenue, which increased 87% sequentially and accounted for over 28% of the room night mix.\nWe previously discussed the strong performance of our resorts during the quarter, but it's also important to highlight the exceptional performance of some of our larger owned convention hotels.\nIn the third quarter, Hyatt Regency Orlando, Hyatt Regency Phoenix, and Grand Hyatt San Antonio collectively had a stronger EBITDA contribution compared to the third quarter of 2019.\nThis is particularly noteworthy considering group business accounted for approximately 70% of the rooms revenue mix for these hotels during the third quarter of 2019.\nThis year, these hotels still managed to generate significant group business, representing 57% of rooms revenue, and were also able to increase transient revenue by nearly 30% above 2019 levels through innovative strategies such as repositioning the hotels for families and other leisure travelers.\nThis exemplifies how we are adapting our sales strategies in real-time to meet current demand profiles and maximize performance of our owned and leased hotels.\nOverall, excellent revenue management and strong operational execution have resulted in significant margin expansion for our owned and leased hotels.\nComparable operating margins were 20.3% in the third quarter, an improvement of 490 basis points compared to 2019 levels, despite RevPAR only recovering to 75% of 2019 levels.\nUnfilled positions have also contributed to lower operating costs, and we continue to closely monitor the labor environment and are working diligently to fill open positions.\nThe situation remains challenging, but we're making progress.\nAs mentioned last quarter, we continue to see some pressure on wages, and our general managers have made significant adjustments based on competitive market factors, with our response varying by market.\nI'd like to provide an update on our liquidity and cash position.\nAs of September 30, our total liquidity, including cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and available revolver borrowing capacity, was approximately $4.3 billion, compared to $3.2 billion as of June 30.\nWe received a $254 million tax refund in July, $491 million of net proceeds from the sale of Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe and Alila Ventana Big Sur, and raised $575 million in net proceeds from our equity offering in September.\nWe also repaid $250 million in senior notes that matured in August.\nIn October, we raised $1.75 billion of short-term 2- and 3-year fixed and floating rate notes at an approximate weighted average interest rate of 1.48%.\nWe used $750 million of those proceeds to refinance our 2022 short-term prepayable bonds and successfully reduced our interest costs by $12 million annually on the refinancing.\nOur approximate total liquidity after the debt capital markets proceeds was $5.2 billion at the end of October.\nOn November 1, we closed on the acquisition of ALG and paid cash of $2.7 billion.\nAfter the acquisition and as of today, our total liquidity position remains strong at approximately $2.6 billion, with $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and $1.3 billion available under the revolver.\nLastly, I'd like to make a few additional comments regarding our 2021 outlook.\nIn line with our communication in the second quarter, we continue to expect adjusted SG&A to be around $240 million, excluding any bad debt expense or ALG integration costs.\nWe're still finalizing the ALG integration cost estimate but expect it to be between $5 million and $10 million for the full year of 2021, with $2 million of that amount already included in the third quarter adjusted SG&A.\nIt's important to note that these costs are non-recurring and our plan does not include an extensive or costly integration of systems and processes.\nWe continue to expect capital expenditures for 2021 to be approximately $110 million, excluding any impact from ALG.\nWe mentioned on our last call that we are accelerating selected renovation projects to take advantage of lower displacement during the fourth quarter, so our capital expenditures could end up slightly higher if we secure our materials and labor needs before the end of the year.\nRegarding net rooms growth, we are reaffirming our expectation of growth to be over 6% for the full year, excluding any impact from ALG.\nThere is some uncertainty related to supply chain issues, which could delay certain openings until the first quarter of 2022.\nHowever, over 6% remains our best estimate at this time, and we're pleased to be delivering another very strong year of net rooms growth.\nLooking ahead to 2022, we look forward to sharing more about the progress of our ALG integration efforts, and we'll provide more detailed disclosures on the ALG business in our next earnings call.\nWe're proud of our achievements in advancing our long-term strategy and are excited about the value creation ALG brings to Hyatt, positioning us better than ever to drive asset-light growth.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Devan Bhavsar introduces us today to Bill McMorrow, Mary Ricks, Matt Windisch, and Justin Enbody from Kennedy-Wilson\nAdditional details can be found on the Investor Relations webpage\nOur third quarter results were exceptional, with adjusted EBITDA rising over 165% compared to the same period last year, and we've achieved record results for the first nine months of this year\nFor the initial nine months of 2021, adjusted EBITDA reached $741 million, a significant increase from $261 million in the same period of 2020\nWe've made significant advancements this year on our primary goals of increasing our in-place annual NOI and expanding our fee-bearing capital\nWe had a busy quarter, finalizing $1.8 billion in investment deals, bringing our year-to-date total to $4.4 billion\nOur assets under management have expanded by 17% in 2021, reaching a record $20.5 billion, up from $17.6 billion at the end of 2020\nWe anticipate closing more transactions by year-end, which would further boost our AUM and lead to a record year of capital deployment for KW\nLet me begin by offering some insight into what we're observing in our markets, as real estate fundamentals continued to improve during the quarter\nGlobal transaction volumes remain robust, with Q3 volumes in the U.S. surging 150% from last year's levels, according to Real Capital Analytics\nInstitutional demand for real estate continues to be strong, with trillions of dollars of global capital still seeking solid risk-adjusted returns\nOur operational metrics for 2021 continue to show improvement\nIn our U.S. market, we witnessed ongoing impressive apartment rent growth, with rents increasing at one of the fastest rates in recent history across all our regions\nInvestor demand for high-quality rental housing remained very strong, resulting in cap rate compression and further increases to the value of our real estate portfolio\nOur Mountain West apartment portfolio, our largest region with nearly 11,000 units, outperformed once again, driven by attractive migration trends and relative affordability\nWe also observed significant improvements in our Pacific Northwest and California portfolio, as pandemic-related moratoriums began to expire, and we expect substantial rent growth in all these areas over the next 15 months\nIn Europe, we saw outstanding performance in our U.K. and Dublin properties\nThe U.K. lifted all COVID restrictions on July 19\nIn Dublin, virtually all travel resumed on July 26, and we observed a gradual return to office that we expect will accelerate over the next six months and positively impact our portfolio\nStrong leasing demand in our Dublin multifamily portfolio led to occupancy increasing by over 400 basis points in Q3 to 96.6% occupancy\nThe main acquisitions in the quarter were three wholly owned multifamily assets totaling 879 units, purchased for a total of $399 million\nTwo of these properties are situated in suburban Seattle, and the third is located in suburban Denver\nWe're eager to implement our value-add programs at these communities, which have consistently demonstrated our ability to generate outsized returns\nOur global multifamily portfolio grew to a record 33,400 units at quarter end, including almost 5,000 units under development, which we expect to complete at yields well above current market cap rates\nWe're on track to increase our global unit count to 35,000 by year-end\nMary will discuss later the impressive growth of our European logistics portfolio\nOur Q3 transactions increased estimated annual NOI to $413 million, a $19 million increase for the year, and we raised our fee-bearing capital to $4.8 billion, representing 23% growth year to date\nI'm pleased to announce that yesterday, our board of directors approved a 9% increase to our quarterly dividend, which now annualizes to $0.96 per share\nLooking ahead, I believe the key drivers of our business are well positioned with our multifamily portfolio, the reopening of our European markets, the growth of our investment management platform, and the completion of our development projects\nBefore we delve into these initiatives in more detail, I'll hand the call over to our CFO, Justin Enbody, to highlight our Q3 financial results\nIn Q3, we reported GAAP earnings per share of $0.47 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $0.18 in Q3 of last year\nAdjusted net income in the quarter grew to $112 million, up from $27 million last year\nAdjusted EBITDA increased to $203 million in the quarter, compared to $76 million in 2020\nFor the year, we've had GAAP earnings per share of $1.96 per share, adjusted net income of $424 million, and as Bill mentioned, adjusted EBITDA of $741 million, representing record results for the first nine months of the year\nIn our co-investment portfolio, which includes our unconsolidated funds and joint ventures, we continue to see appreciating asset values, driven by strong NOI growth and further cap rate compression\nThis strong performance resulted in $79 million in gains and $46 million of accrued performance fees in the quarter\nFor the quarter, including promotes, total adjusted fees were $56 million, up from $8 million in Q3 of last year\nRegarding our balance sheet, in August, we issued $600 million of unsecured bonds maturing in 2030\nThe proceeds were used to fully repay our line of credit, as well as the remaining $296 million of our KWE bonds due in 2022, which was completed in October\nOur debt maturity schedule has been greatly enhanced, with no unsecured debts due until 2025 and our $500 million revolving credit facility remaining unused\nOur debt's pro forma average interest rate stands at 3.6% with a weighted average maturity of 6.5 years, showing a 2.5-year improvement since the year's start\nThis quarter, we repurchased $25 million of stock at an average price of $21.55\nSince early 2018, we've given back $750 million, or about $5.40 per share, to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks, including repurchasing 15.7 million shares, roughly 10% of our outstanding shares\nWe have $213 million remaining from our $500 million buyback authorization, with some of it used in October\nOur global multifamily portfolio is performing exceptionally well, thanks to our market choices and hands-on management approach\nOur properties are seeing better market conditions, fewer delinquencies, and rising rents\nPositive migration trends and affordability are driving exceptional demand, especially in our Mountain West portfolio, where same-property revenues grew by 11% and NOI by 15%\nWe believe there's still significant potential in our Mountain West portfolio, with average monthly rents at $1,366, as people seek better quality of life and move from high-rent, high-tax states\nWe're also noticing improving trends in our Pacific Northwest and California assets\nThe reopening of offices has positively impacted renter demand\nRent concessions in the U.S. decreased by 63% in Q3 compared to the same period last year, and we saw record average leasing spreads of 27% on new leases across our U.S. portfolio\nWe continue to collaborate with our tenants and utilize available rent relief measures\nThese factors combined led to strong same-store revenue growth of 8% and NOI growth of 12% in our U.S. market rate multifamily portfolio compared to Q3 2020\nThis marks our best quarter of NOI growth in five years\nSequentially from Q2 this year, revenues grew by an impressive 6% and NOI by 8%\nCurrent rents in our U.S. portfolio are now 6% above pre-pandemic levels\nWith an average loss to lease of 15%, we anticipate strong growth for our portfolio in 2022 and beyond\nOur Dublin apartment portfolio is also experiencing strong demand as people return to the city\nThis led to Clancy Quay being stabilized in Q2, and Capital Dock is now 77% leased, expected to stabilize in Q4\nOverall occupancy in Dublin is returning to pre-pandemic levels\nBesides long-standing mega-cap tech companies, other high-growth tech firms like Stripe, TikTok, ServiceNow, and First Data are expanding their presence in Dublin\nWe remain confident in the long-term prospects of the Irish apartment market, driven by a young and growing population\nAdditionally, many multinational companies have their European headquarters in Dublin, with a workforce more likely to rent than buy\nRegarding our office portfolio, as employees return to work, we're seeing improvements in the operational environment, including more firm requirements, tour requests, and deals being finalized\nQuality in design, construction, and staff wellness remains crucial as tenants are attracted to amenity-rich buildings with ESG credentials\nWe continue to focus on office tenants in high-growth and essential business sectors, including life sciences, media, and technology\nIncluding our suburban apartment and growing logistics assets, we believe this thematic approach positions our overall portfolio well for future cycles\nA recent example is at 111 Buckingham Palace Road in London, where by October, we transacted on about 100,000 square feet of lease transactions, representing 45% of the building\nThese transactions will boost occupancy from 80% to 100% in Q4, deliver 26% growth above in-place rents, and 40% of the income at pre-COVID top rents exceeding GBP70 per square foot, compared to 15% in Q3 2020\nMajor tech firms accounted for 80% of the new leases, showing that top tenants are active in the market and willing to commit to the right space\n71% of our office NOI comes from our European portfolio, which saw Q3 same-property revenue grow by 4% and NOI grow by 5%\nThese results were driven by strong rent collections, lower bad debt, and the expiration of free rent periods in the quarter\nWith a greater focus on employee retention, large corporate tenants are recognizing the benefits of modern, low-rise suburban offices, such as affordability, shorter commutes, and outdoor amenities\nWe continue to see this trend in our own portfolio, with about 90% of the NOI from low and midrise properties\nWe completed 585,000 square feet of leasing in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to 1.5 million square feet, with a WALT of 7.6 years\nOur leasing pipeline remains strong, with 152,000 square feet of leasing completed so far in Q4 and another 600,000 square feet in legal negotiations, giving us good momentum heading into next year\nRegarding our investment management platform, we continued to see strong growth in the quarter, with our fee-bearing capital increasing to $4.8 billion\nSince 2018's beginning, this has grown by over 160 percent.\nOur rapidly expanding worldwide credit division continued to spearhead growth in the third quarter.\nWe declared a new £500 million pledge for European loans in July, elevating total global commitments to $3 billion.\nWe invested $440 million in loans during Q3, including our initial European loans on several large industrial portfolios.\nOur debt division expanded by 24% to $1.4 billion in outstanding loans, with $140 million in upcoming unfunded commitments.\nWe've drawn high-quality borrowers with valuable assets to our debt platform, averaging $70 million per loan with a four-year weighted average maturity.\nWe continue to observe robust macroeconomic conditions in Europe's logistics sector.\nOccupational demand has pushed U.K. vacancy to a record low of 3.4%, while yields across Europe have continued to decrease due to accelerating rent growth.\nFrom the outset, our platform was based on the idea that last-mile logistics properties near transit hubs would be in high demand, as they enable efficient product delivery to end customers.\nCOVID has expedited this theory, with online sales now constituting 28% of total retail sales in the U.K.\nOur industrial portfolio has expanded rapidly, and including assets under offer, it now has a gross value of about $1.1 billion across 59 assets, with KW owning approximately 20%.\nWe anticipate further growth in both our debt and logistics platforms in Q4, as well as continued expansion of our investment management business, which has $2.1 billion in future commitments from various strategic partners.\nAnother crucial growth area for KW will be the completion of our development and lease-up projects, which have progressed steadily throughout the pandemic.\nOur developments, totaling $2.7 billion in cost, are being delivered with strong sustainability credentials, focusing on environmental improvements and tenant wellness.\nOnce these assets are completed and stabilized, we expect an additional $105 million in estimated annual NOI for KW, representing an initial yield on cost of about 6%.\nWe're close to finishing two office properties in central Dublin, Hannover Quay and Kildaire Street, totaling 134,000 square feet, expected to complete in Q4 and Q1, respectively.\nWe remain on schedule to complete most of our construction projects in 2023 and 2024, on time and within budget.\nLast month, we announced an exciting new project in partnership with Cal State Channel Islands.\nWe will develop 589 residential units as part of a master-planned community in Camarillo, California.\nThe project will include 310 wholly owned market-rate units, 170 affordable units through our vintage housing joint venture, and 109 for-sale townhomes by Comstock Homes.\nThis development is adjacent to a 386-unit wholly owned community we acquired in 2016.\nThis type of project is well-suited for KW, given our extensive experience in developing both market-rate and affordable multifamily units.\nWe aim to complete construction in 2024 and look forward to breaking ground in Camarillo later this month.\nI'll now hand it back to Bill.\nAs you can see, we have multiple avenues to drive further earnings and cash flow growth at Kennedy-Wilson.\nAs mentioned in our previous call, we have a clear path to grow our stabilized NOI by 10% to 15% annually over the next three years, driven by strong organic NOI growth, new acquisitions, and the completion of our construction projects.\nWe also plan to increase our fee-bearing capital and resulting fees by 15% to 20% per year over the next three years.\nThese factors combined should lead to significant growth in both our net asset value per share and our assets under management.\nLooking ahead to 2022, I'm very optimistic about our ability to continue expanding our business for several reasons.\nFirstly, business conditions have improved as economies reopen, and we're experiencing a very healthy transaction and financing market, possibly the strongest in the last decade.\nSecondly, over the past 18 months, we've either grown or established new investment platforms with well-capitalized, highly liquid global strategic partners who are eager to expand their relationship with Kennedy-Wilson.\nWe can now creatively allocate capital across the entire capital structure and in a wide range of asset classes.\nLastly, our global investment team remains intact, and our global communication has never been better.\nI'm very pleased with our team's progress not only in Q3 but throughout 2021.\nI'm also reminded of the importance of long-term relationships, both internal and external to KW.\nAlthough I may be biased, we have an exceptional global team that has been working together for decades, and our internal communication is at its best ever.\nThis fact, combined with high-quality properties in the right product category, located in diverse and growing markets, has positioned KW for excellent long-term growth.\nNow, Daven, I'd like to open the floor for questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We regret this mistake.\nWe will examine our 2020 closing and talk about financial projections for 2021.\nI'm happy to announce that we concluded the year with an exceptionally strong quarter.\nWe achieved double-digit growth across all major financial indicators and once again surpassed our financial goals.\nThis is particularly impressive considering how robust last year's fourth quarter was.\nAs you're aware, during this challenging year and as we dealt with the pandemic, we aimed to be as open as possible and provide insight into our anticipated financial performance.\nIn such unusual circumstances, the typical response would be to withdraw guidance and observe from afar.\nHowever, as you know, we did our best to share our observations with you.\nWe followed the same approach at the end of the third quarter when we decided to provide a 2021 outlook as soon as we had some visibility, which was a full quarter earlier than usual.\nToday, this outlook has become more defined and we've chosen to update and increase the guidance.\nLet's begin by examining our fourth quarter results.\nThe fourth quarter revenue amounted to $3,298 million, which exceeded the upper limit of our guidance range by $108 million.\nSlightly over 70% of this surplus came from strong organic performance, while less than 30% was due to favorable foreign exchange rates.\nRevenue grew by 13.9% on a reported basis and 12.2% at constant currency.\nThe fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $735 million increased by 14.5%, reflecting our revenue growth and productivity measures.\nThe $25 million surplus above the upper limit of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger organic revenue performance.\nThe fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.11 grew by 21.3%.\nThe surplus here entirely reflects the adjusted EBITDA flow-through.\nOur strong fourth quarter financial results were driven by numerous operational achievements during 2020.\nHere's some additional information on those achievements, starting with technology.\nDemand for our technology offerings remained strong in 2020.\n60 new clients decided to implement OCE last year, bringing our total number of OCE client wins to 140 since launch.\nAs you know, at the beginning of 2020, a top 15 global pharma client began deploying OCE in the US.\nThis client has now decided to start global OCE deployment for their medical teams, primarily their almost 2,000 medical science liaisons worldwide.\nThe same client is also expanding its use of IQVIA technologies through our HCP Engagement Management platform.\nWe launched this platform during 2020.\nHCP Engagement Management works in conjunction with OCE to ensure global commercial activities are executed in compliance with all global regulations.\nIn addition to HCP Engagement Management, you would have seen that during 2020 we also launched OCE Optimizer.\nOCE Optimizer is a real-time map-based territory and sales rep alignment solution, which helps our clients plan their sales rep activity and improve their marketing plans.\nMoving on to our Real World business.\nOur Real World business has been relatively well protected from the impact of the virus, and it has shown strong growth for the year.\nThe business is advanced in the use of secondary data, remote monitoring and virtual research approaches, which helped the team quickly adapt to working in the new remote world at the onset of the pandemic.\nOur extensive clinical data assets are crucial to our real world differentiation.\nThe team has continued to invest in these extensive clinical data assets and these assets now include over 1 billion active non-identified patients globally.\nThe team is actively integrating these extensive clinical data into research.\nIn 2020, we introduced CARE, our COVID Active Research Experience registry to help communities and public health authorities better understand the impact of COVID-19 on the population.\nWe are utilizing this platform along with our vast experience in registries and analytics, to collaborate with the FDA, to support a better understanding of how people are affected by exposure to COVID.\nThis work will help identify which symptoms individuals experienced, the duration and severity of symptoms, and whether any medications or supplements they are taking affect the severity of those symptoms.\nIt's an ideal application of our real world capability.\nSimilarly, we have become the preferred partner around the world to assist various governments and healthcare authorities with large scale diagnostic testing and monitoring of COVID patients.\nThese new series of offerings which leverage our interconnected capabilities, contributed incrementally to the strong sequential growth in our TAS segment.\nAs you know, the R&DS team responded swiftly in 2020 to support our clients with the development of vaccines and therapies for COVID-19.\nOur involvement spans over 300 clinical trials and studies for the virus, including four of the five vaccine trials that progressed through Phase III with US Government funding in Operation Warp Speed.\nWe utilized our direct-to-patient solutions, including patient registries and IQVIA sponsored ads, to accelerate recruitment.\nWe have enlisted more than 100,000 patients for COVID trials thus far.\nThe COVID-19 crisis has intensified the need for remote and risk-based monitoring in clinical research, which has led to increased adoption of our Virtual Trials technology.\nWe've secured over 60 new studies using our Virtual Trials solutions across 10 therapeutic areas, including contracts with five top 10 pharmaceutical companies.\nThe technology package incorporated eConsent, telemedicine, eCOA and digital communication, and its platform on health cloud, a Salesforce platform specifically designed for healthcare and life sciences.\nThis technology was implemented to accelerate vaccine development and played a crucial role in helping the team secure the two Phase III full-service COVID trials we are currently managing.\nThe climate for R&D and outsourcing remains robust.\nBiotech funding continues to be strong, with the National Venture Capital Association reporting a record number of deals for the year.\nThe pipeline of late-stage molecules keeps expanding and has reached an all-time high.\nThis thriving environment, combined with our unique capabilities, has resulted in substantial new business awards for the R&DS team.\nOur contracted backlog, including pass-throughs, increased by 18.5% year-over-year to $22.6 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nConsequently, our projected revenue from backlog for the next 12 months rose to $5.9 billion, a 13.5% increase year-over-year.\nWe maintained our strong momentum in the fourth quarter, with the team achieving a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.41, including pass-throughs, and 1.42 excluding pass-throughs.\nWe ended the year with an LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio of 1.53 including pass-throughs and 1.44 excluding pass-throughs.\nWe anticipate continued robust activity in the future, as our pipeline of R&DS opportunities is growing by double-digits in both volume and value across a wide range of therapies.\nAs Ari mentioned, this quarter provided a strong conclusion to the year.\nLet's begin by examining revenue.\nFourth quarter revenue of $3,298 million increased by 13.9% on a reported basis and 12.2% at constant currency.\nRevenue for the full year was $11,359 million, representing a 2.4% increase on a reported basis and 2.3% at constant currency.\nTechnology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the fourth quarter was $1,425 million, showing a 17.4% increase on a reported basis and 15.1% at constant currency.\nThe jump in growth this quarter compared to the 9.2% growth in the third quarter was due to COVID-related work mentioned by Ari.\nFull year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $4,858 million, up 8.3% on a reported basis and 8.1% at constant currency.\nR&D Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $1,684 million increased by 14.5% at actual FX rates and 13.2% at constant currency.\nPass-throughs contributed 220 basis points to fourth quarter R&DS revenue growth, entirely due to COVID work.\nHowever, it's worth noting that R&DS achieved double-digit organic growth in both services and on a fixed FX basis.\nThis performance is particularly impressive given the challenging comparison to the fourth quarter of 2019, when organic service revenue also grew at a double-digit rate.\nFor the full year, R&D Solutions revenue was $5,760 million, essentially flat on both a reported and constant currency basis.\nExcluding the impact of pass-throughs, R&D Solutions' full year reported revenue grew by 2.2%.\nCSMS revenue of $189 million decreased by 10% on a reported basis and 11.9% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter.\nFor the full year, CSMS revenue of $741 million declined by 9% at actual FX rates and 9.2% at constant currency.\nDemand for field representatives remains weak in the current environment.\nAs a result, business development activity has slowed, but the businesses performed slightly better than expected as clients have largely retained existing field representatives.\nMoving down the P&L, adjusted EBITDA was $735 million for the fourth quarter, representing growth of 14.5%.\nFor the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $2,384 million.\nFourth quarter GAAP net income was $119 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.61.\nFor the full year, GAAP net income was $279 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.43.\nAdjusted net income was $411 million for the fourth quarter and $1,252 million for the full year.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share grew by 21.3% in the fourth quarter to $2.11.\nFull year adjusted diluted earnings per share was $6.42.\nAs Ari highlighted, R&DS new business activity remains strong, with backlog growing 18.5% year-over-year to close 2020 at $22.6 billion.\nWe expect $5.9 billion of this backlog to convert to revenue over the next 12 months, representing a year-over-year increase of 13.5%.\nThis forms the foundation for our 2021 forecast, which I'll be elaborating on soon\nLet's examine the financial position\nAs of December 31, we had $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, with $12.5 billion in debt\nOur net debt amounted to $10.7 billion\nOur net leverage ratio improved to 4.5 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA by December 31, down from a peak of 4.8 times at the end of Q2 and 4.7 times at the end of Q3\nWe've pledged to reduce leverage to between 3.5 and 4 times net leverage by the end of 2022, and we expect significant progress towards this goal in 2021 due to our double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and improved free cash flow conversion\nCash flow remains a highlight, with operating cash flow reaching $750 million in Q4, a 29% year-over-year increase\nCapital expenditures were $176 million, resulting in free cash flow of $574 million\nFor the full year, free cash flow was $1.34 billion, up 61% year-over-year\nWe restarted our share buyback program in Q4, repurchasing $102 million worth of shares\nTotal share repurchases for the year amounted to $423 million\nWe concluded the year with 194.8 million diluted shares outstanding and currently have $918 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization\nDue to our strong free cash flow performance, actions taken at the start of the pandemic to access capital markets, and capital allocation decisions during the year, we now have $3.3 billion in available funds on our balance sheet, comprising an undrawn revolver of $1.5 billion and a cash balance of $1.8 billion\nWe will continue to be prudent in how we use these funds for liquidity, in line with our goal of reducing net leverage\nNow, let's discuss our guidance\nWe're increasing our full-year revenue guidance by $250 million at the low end and $300 million at the high end of the range\nThe updated revenue guidance is $12,550 million to $12,900 million, with about half of the increase due to a stronger business outlook and the rest from favorable foreign exchange rates compared to our Q3 guidance\nIt's worth noting that the revised guidance includes approximately 200 basis points of FX tailwind versus the previous year\nWe're also raising our full-year profit guidance\nWe've increased our adjusted EBITDA by $35 million at the low end and $40 million at the high end, resulting in full-year guidance of $2,760 million to $2,840 million\nThe change in FX rates versus our previous guidance actually had a slightly negative impact on profit due to unusual currency fluctuations\nThe increase in adjusted EBITDA guidance is primarily due to the stronger organic revenue outlook\nWe're raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.12 at the low end and $0.13 at the high end to $7.77 to $8.08\nThis represents year-over-year growth of 21% to 25.9%\nLet me provide some additional details to help with your models\nWhen modeling quarterly revenue, remember that Q2 will have the easiest comparison and Q4 the toughest\nOur adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance assumes interest expense of about $415 million, operational depreciation and amortization slightly over $400 million, other below-the-line expense items such as minority interest of approximately $50 million, and continued share repurchase activity\nWe expect the effective tax rate to remain largely in line with 2020\nOur full-year 2021 guidance assumes current foreign exchange rates remain stable for the rest of the year\nBefore discussing Q1 guidance, let me share the expected segment growth rates for 2021\nWe anticipate Tech & Analytics Solutions reported revenue growth to be between 9% to 12%, R&D Solutions reported revenue growth to be between 14% and 17% (including a 100 basis point headwind from pass-throughs), and CSMS reported revenue growth is expected to be down about 2%, weaker earlier in the year but recovering later\nNow, let's look at Q1 guidance, assuming FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter\nQ1 revenue is expected to be between $3,150 million and $3,200 million, representing reported growth of 14.4% to 16.2%\nAll three segments should show similar constant currency growth rates to Q4\nAdjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $660 million and $675 million, representing reported growth of 17.4% to 20.1%\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $1.81 and $1.87, up 20.7% to 24.7%\nTo recap, we delivered strong Q4 results with double-digit growth in all key financial metrics, building on a strong Q4 in 2019\nWe achieved mid-teens revenue growth for both our TAS and R&DS segments\nR&DS backlog improved to $22.6 billion, up 18.5% year-over-year\nWe generated strong free cash flow of $574 million for Q4 and $1.34 billion for the full year\nWe ended 2020 with net leverage of 4.5 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA and a healthy liquidity position, including an undrawn revolver and $1.8 billion in cash\nLooking ahead to 2021, we anticipate double-digit revenue growth, margin expansion, adjusted diluted earnings per share growth exceeding 20%, continued robust R&DS bookings activity, and further reduction in our net leverage ratio\nLet's now turn it over to the operator for the Q&A session\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Let's review the Safe Harbor statements before we start.\nWe may discuss non-GAAP financial measures during today's call.\nThis conference call may contain time-sensitive information that is only accurate as of this earnings call date.\nWe do not commit to and explicitly reject any obligation to update or revise this information.\nI will now hand over the conference to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Lambiase.\nI'm pleased to report that all Chimera employees are in good health and working from home.\nWe activated our contingency work plan in early March and haven't encountered any major technology issues.\nWe hope you and your loved ones remain safe and healthy as well.\nIn March, the COVID-19 pandemic created an atmosphere of fear and extreme uncertainty, leading to near-disastrous conditions in the fixed income markets.\nMany investors believed that government-mandated lockdowns would likely trigger an economic recession, prompting them to sell their credit investments and reinvest in safer, risk-off assets like T-Bills, U.S. Treasury notes, and cash.\nCredit-focused bond funds and ETFs experienced record outflows, forcing fund managers to sell their holdings in thin markets, resulting in increased volatility and market disruptions.\nAll fixed income market sectors, except U.S. treasuries, saw sharp downward price movements.\nInvestors using leverage as part of their strategies were also compelled to sell assets as they tried to meet margin calls from their repo lenders.\nThe market conditions in March 2020 were very similar to those experienced during the 2008 crisis.\nHowever, price movements were rapid and occurred over a much shorter period.\nThe Federal Reserve responded quickly, announcing numerous initiatives on Sunday, March 15, to combat the worsening economic conditions.\nThe Federal funds rate was reduced to 0%, new purchase plans for treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities were introduced, and funding programs like the TELS and commercial paper facility were revived from the 2008 Federal Reserve playbook.\nThe Fed's actions were largely beneficial in bringing order to many areas of the fixed income market, including agency mortgage-backed securities.\nThe Federal Reserve did not offer liquidity programs for residential credit securities, which continue to trade poorly in the secondary markets.\nLike the Fed, Congress also took action by passing the CARES Act to assist individuals most directly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe U.S. economy today is vastly different from its state prior to the COVID-19 crisis.\nThe sudden shutdown of the U.S. economy has quickly created some of the worst economic problems since the Great Depression.\nIn the past six weeks, 30 million people have filed for unemployment benefits, a stark contrast to the 3.5% unemployment rate in February.\nMany U.S. homeowners have opted to use newly created mortgage forbearance programs.\nIn the short term, government initiatives and mortgage forbearance will mitigate the immediate impact on the U.S. economy.\nHowever, these measures may have lasting negative effects on the housing and mortgage market if they continue for an extended period.\nOver recent years, Chimera has implemented several balance sheet strategies that have helped during this challenging time to safeguard our book value, meet all margin calls from our repo lenders, and pay our dividends.\nOur agency mortgage-backed securities portfolio has always had two purposes: primarily as a source of spread income, and secondarily as a source of liquidity instead of selling our higher-yielding legacy assets.\nThis quarter, we sold our agency pass-through securities to reduce debt and further decrease our overall portfolio leverage.\nWe ended the first quarter with 2.2 times recourse leverage, a 35% reduction from year-end.\nOver the past decade, we've purchased or acquired approximately a $14 billion portfolio of legacy non-agency securities and seasoned low loan balance mortgages.\nThis portfolio is financed through securitization and repo leverage, but it has not been immune to downward price movements.\nWe've worked hard to protect this portfolio, which has historically been a consistent earnings driver for our company and sets Chimera's portfolio apart in the mortgage REIT industry.\nWe remain optimistic that eventually, the pricing of these assets will return to their fundamental value, rather than the illiquid pricing we're currently experiencing.\nRevitalizing the economy should be an effective initial measure in the process, potentially leading to enhanced credit spreads and recovery of our diminished book value from the quarter.\nWe have been actively engaged in executing transactions on the liability portion of our balance sheet over the past few months.\nChimera conducted two mortgage securitizations in March, amounting to $883 million.\nWe have secured over $800 million in extended refocus for our credit assets and issued $374 million of convertible debt, further diversifying our liability and capital structure.\nAlthough pricing is rarely optimal during a crisis, we are encouraged by our ability to access the capital markets.\nLooking ahead, it's challenging to predict how the U.S. economy will perform as it begins to recover.\nWe are in unexplored territory regarding the high unemployment rates and drastic changes in social behaviors.\nWhile we'd like to believe in a rapid V-shaped recovery, it's more likely to be a longer and more difficult journey to return to our February position.\nThe outlook for the mortgage and housing market will also be demanding in the immediate future.\nMortgage forbearance continues to create significant uncertainty in mortgage credit, and we will remain cautious until we have more clarity on the duration and totals of forbearance in our portfolio.\nGiven these complexities, it will be challenging to forecast earnings for the upcoming quarters until economic conditions become clearer.\nOur focus remains on maintaining liquidity, extending our financing terms, and preserving our credit portfolio.\nWe are navigating through an extremely turbulent period but remain optimistic that the U.S. economy will recover and the mortgage market will stabilize once the economy restarts and people return to work.\nThe initial quarter of 2020 was marked by extreme volatility in the U.S. fixed income market.\nThe 10-year treasury note began the year at 1.92% and decreased by 125 basis points, concluding the first quarter with a yield of 0.67%.\nAs part of its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve reduced its overnight lending rate by 150 basis points over a two-week period.\nThe significant decrease in interest rates, sharp rise in rate volatility, and investors' flight to quality resulted in a substantial imbalance of funds across most fixed income products.\nInvestors using leverage were compelled to sell their securities at low prices to meet margin calls on existing repo transactions.\nChimera was not exempt from these effects.\nIn the first quarter, we employed a combination of cash balances, unpledged securities, and outright sales of our agency assets as part of our overall liquidity management strategy.\nTo date, Chimera has successfully met all margin calls.\nChimera's funding strategy is multifaceted.\nThe primary goal has been and continues to be the use of securitization to create long-term funding for our credit assets.\nBy the end of the first quarter, we had nearly $8.5 billion of securitized debt outstanding.\nAdditionally, we utilize repo financing on our retained assets, legacy non-agency securities, and loans.\nWe typically opt for longer repo maturity dates when financing these assets, allowing for more effective counterparty and portfolio management.\nAfter the quarter ended, we added two new long-term credit financing facilities totaling $800 million.\nThese facilities include attractive features, such as a significant reduction in daily mark-to-market risk on our credit assets.\nWe successfully continued our loan securitization strategy this quarter, pricing two deals in March with seasoned reperforming loans from our warehouse.\nCIM 2020-R1 comprises $391 million in underlying loans with a weighted average coupon of 5% and a weighted average loan age of 158 months.\nThe average loan size in the R1 securitization was $123,000 with an average FICO score of 613.\nWe sold $312 million in senior securities with a 2.35% cost of debt.\nChimera retained a March 2023 calendar call option on the R1 securitization.\nFurthermore, we securitized CIM 2020-R2, which consisted of $492 million in underlying loans with a weighted average coupon of 3.79% and a weighted average loan age of 161 months.\nThe R2 deal's typical loan was $219,000 with an average credit score of 690.\nWe issued $352 million in senior securities at a 2.55% interest rate.\nDue to sharp interest rate declines, increased price fluctuations, and repo margin calls, we liquidated our entire $5.7 billion portfolio of residential agency pass-throughs this quarter.\nThese pass-throughs were our most easily sold and least profitable assets, always intended to meet our cash needs.\nWe also ended all our agency hedge positions, including U.S. Treasury note futures and $4.1 billion in interest rate swaps.\nWe kept our agency CMBS portfolio, which we've built up over many years.\nThis portfolio was valued at $2.5 billion at the end of the quarter.\nWe still appreciate the income spread from this portfolio and the better convexity profile of Ginnie Mae project loans compared to residential agency pass-throughs.\nThese securities perform well in repo markets and have similar rates and haircuts to traditional agency pass-throughs.\nThe unique prepayment restrictions and penalties become more valuable as interest rates decrease.\nAfter the quarter ended, agency CMBS spreads began to narrow when the Federal Reserve started buying these assets as part of their quantitative easing program.\nThis quarter's portfolio changes have greatly reduced the company's risk exposure as measured by recourse leverage.\nOur recourse leverage at quarter-end was 2.2 times, down from 3.4 times at year-end and 3.8 times at the end of Q3 2019.\nThis represents a 35% reduction in recourse leverage over the past three months and 42% over the last six months.\nIt's crucial to note that due to current market conditions, our high-yield credit assets, which make up the largest part of our portfolio, have decreased in value, contributing to Chimera's lower book value this quarter.\nBy keeping this portfolio, we maintain the possibility of security value increases as the economy recovers and the country navigates through the current pandemic.\nAs we navigate the current economic crisis, we remain cautiously optimistic.\nWe will continue to spread out repo maturities and aim for longer-term credit repo.\nAs we gain more insight into the housing and mortgage market impacts from the crisis, we'll look to invest cash in new opportunities, as we've done for the past ten years.\nI'll now go over Chimera's financial highlights for the first quarter.\nGAAP book value at the end of Q1 was $12.45 per share.\nOur GAAP net loss for Q1 was $389 million, or $2.08 per share.\nCore net income for Q1 was $106 million, or $0.57 per share.\nEconomic net interest income for Q1 was $151 million.\nIn Q1, the yield on average interest-earning assets was 5.3%.\nOur average cost of funds was 3%, and our net interest spread was 2.3%.\nTotal leverage for Q1 was 4.7 to 1, while recourse leverage ended the quarter at 2.2 to 1.\nQ1 expenses, excluding servicing fees and transaction costs, were $18.6 million, in line with the previous quarter.\nGiven the current market conditions, we wanted to provide additional information about liquidity.\nWe currently have about $650 million in cash and unencumbered assets.\nThis is after paying both our preferred and common stock dividends totaling $111 million.\nAdditionally, in April, we completed a public convertible bond offering that raised $374 million.\nWe believe having ample liquidity is crucial in this market, and we're pleased that the capital markets were accessible for us to achieve this goal.\nWe will continue to monitor our liquidity and evaluate opportunities to increase it while balancing support for our current portfolio and seeking new market opportunities.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Gene Lee, Darden's Chairman and CEO, Rick Cardinas, President and COO, and Raj Vennam, CFO are participating in today's call.\nWhen discussing second quarter performance, comparisons to pre-COVID refer to the second quarter of fiscal 2020.\nLast year's results are not considered meaningful due to the pandemic's impact and the limited capacity environment during the second quarter of fiscal '21.\nFiscal 2022 third quarter earnings will be released on Thursday, March 24 before the market opens, followed by a conference call.\nGene will provide brief comments, Rick will update on operating performance, and Raj will detail financial results and provide an updated fiscal 2022 financial outlook.\nThroughout the quarter, sales trends remained strong as all brands focused on creating memorable guest experiences.\nDespite facing the toughest inflationary environment in years, we achieved strong profitable sales growth.\nOur success in navigating the pandemic demonstrates the effectiveness of our strategy, driven by our back-to-basics operating philosophy and the strength of our four competitive advantages.\nOur disciplined adherence to our strategies allows us to manage this environment effectively while returning significant cash to shareholders.\nWe will continue to focus on people and product, with Rick providing more details shortly.\nOur teams have effectively managed inflation, and Raj will provide more information on this during his remarks.\nThe holiday season is the busiest time for our restaurant teams as they delight guests and help create lasting memories.\nThis time of year reminds us that service is at the core of our business, as we are committed to serving our guests, team members, and communities.\nTo help fight hunger, our foundation provided $2.5 million this fiscal year to help Feeding America add refrigerated trucks for 15 food banks, supporting mobile pantry programs in areas with high food insecurity.\nWe are uniquely positioned to help, and by leveraging our scale and partnerships with companies like Penske Truck Leasing and Lineage Logistics, we're proud to contribute to getting food to those in need.\nWe announced today that Rick will succeed me as Chief Executive Officer and join Darden's Board of Directors, effective May 30th.\nThis is the appropriate time for this transition, and I look forward to continuing as Darden's Chairman.\nOur company is in a strong position, and this is also the right time for me and my family. I'm excited for Rick, who has been an excellent partner over the last seven years and is one of the best strategic thinkers I've worked with.\nOur brands have significant opportunities ahead, and Rick is ideally suited to lead Darden into its next chapter.\nI am honored to be appointed Darden's next Chief Executive Officer and grateful to Gene and the Board for their confidence in me.\nIt is humbling to lead 170,000 outstanding team members who nourish and delight everyone we serve.\nI have been fortunate to work with each of Darden's CEOs, giving me a strong appreciation for the leadership legacy I'm inheriting.\nBy maintaining our commitments to operational excellence and maximizing the power of the Darden platform, we will continue to execute our strategy to drive growth and shareholder value.\nRegarding the quarter, our restaurants continue to perform at a high level.\nOur top priority remains simplifying operations to drive execution, which is why we again paused new initiatives during the quarter to eliminate distractions and allow our operators to focus on running great shifts.\nThis pause also ensures they can concentrate on people and product as we navigate current staffing and supply chain challenges.\nWe are pleased with the progress made on staffing, with manager staffing levels above historical norms and team member staffing levels continuing to improve.\nOur updated recruitment process has simplified talent acquisition, allowing our leadership to concentrate on effectively integrating and educating new employees\nWe persist in supporting our staff, enhancing our already competitive employment offerings\nWe pledged to raise the base hourly pay for our restaurant workers to $12, including tips, by January 2023, but due to our strong performance, we're moving this up to January 2022\nThis change primarily affects entry-level positions such as greeters, bussers, and kitchen staff\nWith this adjustment, we anticipate our restaurant employees will earn approximately $20 per hour on average\nOur employees are crucial to our success\nWe strive to be the preferred employer in our industry, and we're pleased that our manager and staff retention rates are among the highest in the field\nWe'll keep investing in our workforce to maintain and recruit top industry talent\nOur supply chain department continues to excel in ensuring our restaurants have the necessary products to serve customers\nOur stock levels are robust, and the team's ability to meet business demands is evident in the record-breaking number of cases shipped in the past two quarters\nMaintaining consistent supply for our restaurants reduces distractions and enables our operators to perform optimally, whether serving guests in-house or through takeout\nDuring the quarter, takeout sales continued to benefit from our strong digital platform\nThis platform simplifies operations for our teams and enhances convenience for customers to visit, order, pay, and collect their food\nOff-premise sales made up 28% of Olive Garden's total sales and 15% of LongHorn Steakhouse's total sales\nDigital transactions accounted for 60% of all off-premise sales this quarter and 11% of Darden's total sales\nWe successfully opened 12 new restaurants this quarter, including a flagship Yard House in Times Square, with minimal staffing issues\nThe construction time for new restaurants is longer now than in the past, and we're seeing extended lead times for kitchen equipment and technology hardware\nNevertheless, we're on track to open about 35 to 40 new restaurants this fiscal year\nI want to acknowledge our restaurant and support center staff for their dedication in creating exceptional guest experiences\nI wish everyone a safe and joyous holiday season\nSecond quarter total sales reached $2.3 billion, a 37% increase from last year, driven by 34.4% same-restaurant sales growth and 34 net new restaurant openings\nAverage weekly sales increased by over 7% compared to pre-COVID levels\nDiluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.48\nTotal EBITDA was $335 million, resulting in a 14.7% EBITDA margin\nOur significant business model improvements combined with strong sales led to a 270 basis point margin increase compared to pre-COVID levels\nWe expect this to be the highest quarterly EBITDA margin growth this fiscal year due to the quarter's low seasonality\nWe continue to return substantial cash to shareholders, paying $143 million in dividends and repurchasing $266 million in shares, totaling over $400 million returned to investors this quarter\nWhile we're pleased with our performance, cost pressures continue to exceed our expectations for both commodities and labor, with total inflation at 6% this quarter\nOur teams continue to show flexibility in managing this challenging environment\nDuring this period, we took several actions to maintain the robustness of our business model while considering the effects on our customers and employees.\nWe implemented additional price increases as one of these measures.\nIn the second quarter, we raised prices by 2%, and we anticipate price increases of nearly 4% in the latter half of the year, resulting in an overall price increase of just below 3% for the entire fiscal year.\nWe are continuing to implement our strategy of setting prices significantly lower than the overall inflation rate to reinforce our position as a value leader by utilizing our large-scale operations.\nThis pricing strategy addresses most of what we believe to be the long-term impacts of the current inflationary environment, while absorbing shorter-term fluctuations and providing flexibility for future needs.\nFor the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect commodity and labor inflation to reach its peak in the third quarter before beginning to decrease as we enter the fourth quarter and compare it to last year's fourth-quarter commodity inflation of 4.3%.\nLet's now examine our profit and loss statement and the performance of different segments in the second quarter.\nWe are comparing our results to those from the second quarter of 2020, before COVID-19, as we believe these figures more accurately represent normal business operations and align with our approach to margin expansion opportunities.\nIn the second quarter, food and beverage costs increased by 220 basis points, primarily due to a 9% rise in commodity prices, as well as investments in food quality and portion sizes, while keeping price increases significantly below inflation.\nLabor costs in restaurants decreased by 90 basis points, thanks to increased sales and improved efficiency from operational simplifications, which partially offset higher wage pressures.\nHourly wages increased by almost 9% during the quarter.\nRestaurant expenses decreased by 130 basis points due to higher sales, which more than compensated for increased utility costs.\nMarketing expenses were reduced by $44 million, resulting in a 230 basis point improvement.\nAs a result, Darden's restaurant-level EBITDA margin was 18.8%, which is 230 basis points better than pre-COVID levels.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were 40 basis points lower, due to savings from the 2021 corporate restructuring, a decrease in mark-to-market expenses, and increased sales.\nNow, let's look at the performance of our different segments.\nOlive Garden's sales in the second quarter increased by 5% compared to pre-COVID levels, which is a strong performance, especially considering we were comparing against nine weeks of unlimited pasta promotions.\nThis sales growth, combined with improvements in Olive Garden's business model, led to a 320 basis point increase in segment profit margin, even while dealing with higher inflation.\nLongHorn continued to show strong sales growth, with a 22% increase compared to pre-COVID levels.\nHowever, inflationary pressures, including double-digit increases in commodity prices, were at their highest in the second quarter, resulting in an 80 basis point decrease in segment profit margin.\nSales in our Fine Dining segment increased by 22% compared to pre-COVID levels, as this segment continues to show a strong recovery in performance.\nSegment profit margin grew by 140 basis points, driven by strong sales and operational efficiencies, which more than offset double-digit commodity inflation.\nOur other segment grew sales by 7% compared to pre-COVID levels and increased segment profit margin by 250 basis points.\nThis segment continues to perform well, and we're pleased to see the business model transformation persist.\nLastly, regarding our financial outlook for fiscal year 2022, we have updated our projections to reflect our year-to-date performance and expected performance for the rest of the year.\nWe now anticipate total sales of $9.55 billion to $9.7 billion, representing growth of 9% to 11% from pre-COVID levels, same-restaurant sales growth of 29% to 31%, and 35 to 40 new restaurant openings.\nWe expect capital spending of approximately $425 million, total inflation of about 5.5% with commodities inflation between 7% and 8%, total restaurant labor inflation between 6% and 6.5% including hourly wage inflation approaching 9%.\nWe project EBITDA of $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion, an annual effective tax rate of approximately 14%, and approximately 130 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year.\nThese projections result in diluted net earnings per share between $7.35 and $7.60.\nThis outlook suggests EBITDA margin growth compared to pre-COVID levels similar to our previous projection of 200 to 250 basis points, with increased revenue from pricing and higher sales helping to offset elevated inflation.\nSummary: ",

second, a sales organization capable of selling the entire portfolio; third, a product function capable of adding features and new solutions; fourth, a world-class team; and fifth, to strengthen our balance sheet.\nWe refer to all of these actions as One Deluxe, another example of following through on our commitments.\nHaving fulfilled these prerequisites, we're prepared to expand our business through a major strategic, logical, and responsible acquisition.\nFirst American will be an excellent fit.\nNow, let's discuss our sales performance.\nWe continue to make significant strides in becoming a sales-driven revenue growth company, having secured the two largest deals in company history in less than six months with PNC and Truist, as we continue to unify our go-to-market sales approach to drive growth.\nWe're acquiring new business at an accelerated rate and successfully cross-selling our products and services.\nLet's examine the PNC deal for a moment.\nWe've further expanded our existing relationship with a new multi-year partnership with the eighth largest commercial bank in the U.S., leveraging services from our core Deluxe data-driven marketing solution, complemented by promotional and multiple other Deluxe products, including our proprietary artificial data tools, strategic sourcing framework, and delivery optimization algorithm. We will help PNC find and onboard new customers with improved speed to market, better value, increased efficiency, and continuous innovation.\nThis exemplifies the power of expanding an existing relationship to include other Deluxe services.\nUnder the company's old operating silos, this opportunity might not have been identified, let alone combined multiple existing products to create a compelling solution for PNC.\nThis further demonstrates that our One Deluxe strategy is effective.\nSome of our key wins for the quarter include: in Payments, we've extended our relationship with BBVA, providing a significant number of Deluxe mobile capture solution licenses to support its end consumer and small business customers.\nIn Cloud, aside from PNC, which will also benefit our Promotional Solutions segment, key wins include another top 50 financial institution, where we will deliver full end-to-end campaign management services for its branch transformation initiatives.\nWe also signed the top mortgage originator in the U.S., where we will offer prescreen and mail services to support their customer acquisition and recapture programs.\nIn Promotional Solutions, beyond the PNC transaction, Deluxe has expanded its relationship with LPL Financial.\nLPL will use the Deluxe brand center platform to efficiently rebrand newly acquired strategic broker-dealers with all pertinent marketing and operational materials while supporting regulatory compliance.\nIn checks, we successfully extended and expanded our contractual check relationships across several top-tier financial institutions.\nAdditionally, we recently closed on a significant deal with TD Bank, the seventh largest bank in North America.\nOur recently enhanced check products and, importantly, the strength of our balance sheet, enable us to continue winning market share and protecting our outstanding cash flow.\nWhile it will take time to onboard these wins, our One Deluxe strategy is clearly working, and we're on track to significantly exceed last year's record sales performance.\nMoving on to some segment highlights.\nPayments had a solid quarter, growing beyond the major wins in Q1 last year, and the impact of the [Indecipherable]. We continue to work on our implementation backlog and expect acceleration as COVID-related implementation customer delays fade away over the coming months.\nOur treasury management business led the way this quarter.\nServices mentioned include automation, intelligence, lockbox processing, and remote capabilities.\nThe company's digital payments business, though relatively small, experienced significant growth, more than doubling compared to the previous year, and the company remains optimistic about its prospects.\nThis achievement showcases the company's capability to innovate and successfully develop new products.\nThe company recently initiated a soft launch of their human resources management solution.\nThis platform integrates HR and payroll functions for small and medium-sized businesses, featuring a modern user interface, demonstrating the company's ability to create new products.\nThe Deluxe Payment Exchange network has been expanded to include digital payments directly into lockboxes, building upon existing digital payment products.\nThe company has implemented a solution for medical claims payments, with plans to expand its application further.\nThe company is very positive about the growth potential of these new offerings.\nSignificant progress has been made in acquiring new clients for Cloud Solutions.\nThe company's 2021 cloud revenue will be affected by exits and divestitures from 2020, as previously discussed.\nExcluding these factors, the cloud decline rate was approximately 10%, or just over half of the reported rate, with sequential growth of 5% before the business.\nThese factors provide confidence in the business's trajectory.\nKeith will provide more detailed information on this topic.\nThe company is particularly optimistic about data-driven marketing prospects as the economy recovers.\nAs anticipated, signs of improvement were observed in the first quarter.\nThe company has good visibility for the rest of the year, collaborating with financial institution customers on large-scale marketing campaigns, increasing confidence for 2021 and beyond.\nWebsite services demonstrated resilience compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by improved client retention and favorable exchange rates.\nEncouraging signs of recovery were observed in corporation services, as previously announced.\nThe Promotional Solutions segment was impacted by ongoing COVID-related lockdowns, particularly in the Northeast and West Coast, as well as severe winter weather in February.\nDespite these challenges, the rate of decline improved compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, and the company is optimistic about this segment's prospects as recovery progresses.\nNotably, adjusted EBITDA margin improved by over 600 basis points year-over-year, which Keith will discuss further.\nThe business essentials line, providing custom forms and other routine business products, performed well during the quarter and serves as a leading indicator of overall economic recovery.\nA recovery in branded merchandise is expected as events and in-person activities resume with the waning of COVID.\nThe profitable check business continued to be affected by secular trends, the pandemic, and severe weather.\nThe company anticipates that accelerated COVID recovery and market share gains will significantly reduce the rate of decline throughout the year.\nEarly signs of recovery are evident in the sequential improvement of revenue decline rates between Q4 2020 and Q1 2021.\nThe company's check strategy focuses on gaining market share, maintaining margin percentages, and making strategic investments to generate strong cash flow for investments in payments and cloud.\nThis strategy is proving successful, helping the company secure some of its largest deals, expand into Canada, and win significant competitive contracts.\nIn conclusion, the company's recovery is accelerating, and margin percentages are expanding.\nLiquidity has improved for the fourth consecutive quarter, with net debt at its lowest level in almost three years.\nAll four business segments are experiencing positive momentum at the start of the year.\nThe company's transformation into a sales-driven payments and trusted business technology company is yielding results and will be further enhanced by the addition of First American.\nThe One Deluxe strategy is proving effective, and execution is strong.\nThis represents a new phase for Deluxe as a payments and trusted business technology company.\nKeith will now provide more details on the financial performance.\nThe company is pleased with its first quarter results.\nDespite ongoing effects of COVID and severe weather in February, improvements were seen in sequential quarterly trends.\nThis performance aligns with guidance and indicates an accelerating recovery expected throughout the rest of the year.\nEnterprise-level highlights for the quarter will be discussed before moving on to segment details.\nTotal revenue for the quarter was $441.3 million.\nWhile this represents a 9.3% decline compared to the same period last year, it marks a 360 basis point improvement in the rate of decline from the previous quarter.\nGAAP net income for the quarter was $24.3 million.\nYear-over-year comparability is not meaningful due to asset impairment charges in the first quarter of 2020 related to anticipated COVID effects.\nAdjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA exclude these non-cash charges, along with restructuring, integration, and other costs.\nThese adjustments are detailed in the reconciliations provided in the release.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 8.6% to $90.5 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin improved by nearly 340 basis points year-over-year to 20.5%.\nThese improvements were primarily driven by reductions in SG&A, as expenses were aligned with the post-COVID operating model and progress continued on internal value realization initiatives.\nTurning to segment details, Payments grew Q1 revenue by 3.2% year-over-year to $79.5 million, consistent with expectations shared in the fourth quarter call.\nPayments also grew nearly 2% sequentially from the fourth quarter.\nThe quarterly performance was led by the treasury management business, which grew 4% year-over-year.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 1.7% in the quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 23%, down 40 basis points due to product mix impacting gross profit rates compared to the previous year.\nWe anticipate continued double-digit revenue growth for the year as we implement new clients acquired in 2020 and early 2021.\nWe are investing to drive expansion and onboard all our new business.\nAs a result, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to stay around the low 20% range throughout the year.\nThe addition of First American Payment Systems later this year will significantly alter our payments figures.\nI'll provide more details on that shortly.\nCloud Solutions revenue indicates recovery, but the business is performing better than the reported results suggest.\nBusiness divestitures in 2020 affected the reported results.\nTo offer better clarity, we'll share cloud revenue performance excluding these business exits, in addition to our GAAP results.\nRevenue decreased 18.2% year-over-year to $62.2 million this quarter, but increased 5% from Q4.\nBusiness exits accounted for 8% of the year-over-year decline, while revenue benefited from growth in data-driven marketing.\nAs anticipated, Q1 data-driven marketing solutions revenue improved from Q4 as pandemic-related slowdowns eased and marketing spend recovered.\nWe signed several new data marketing clients this quarter, in addition to the major PNC deal, which will benefit us in future periods.\nWeb and hosted solutions remained steady compared to Q4, due to improved client retention and favorable exchange rates.\nYear-over-year declines in this business were due to the economic environment and our decision to discontinue certain product lines last year.\nCloud's adjusted EBITDA margin in Q1 improved by over 800 basis points compared to last year, due to expense alignment with post-COVID targets and improved mix from business exits.\nWe anticipate cloud margins to remain healthy in the low to mid-20% range.\nPromotional Solutions revenue for Q1 2021 was $124.5 million.\nThough down 12.8% year-over-year, the sequential decline rate improved by 380 basis points from Q4 2020.\nThe quarter's adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.2%, up 640 basis points due to reduced SG&A expenses.\nWe expect improved adjusted EBITDA margins throughout 2021 in the low to mid-teens, resulting from value initiatives and cost actions taken in 2020, including improvements in distributor relationships.\nChecks revenue in Q1 declined 8.1% to $175.1 million due to secular trends and pandemic impacts.\nThe decline rate improved 180 basis points from Q4 despite severe weather, indicating COVID recovery.\nQ1 adjusted EBITDA margin remained strong at 47.7%.\nBased on high renewal rates and new business acquired, we expect secular check declines to return to mid-single-digit rates or better, in line with recoveries from previous economic slowdowns.\nOur quarter-end liquidity was strong at $427.7 million, including $125.4 million in cash.\nThe amount drawn under the credit facility remained unchanged at $840 million.\nNet debt decreased for the fourth consecutive quarter, reaching $714.6 million, the lowest in nearly three years.\nThis result during a pandemic highlights our management team's financial discipline.\nFree cash flow was $17.9 million for Q1 2021, a 46.7% improvement from last year, primarily due to improved working capital efficiency.\nOur Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, payable on June 7, 2021, to shareholders of record on May 24, 2021.\nWe did not repurchase common stock in Q1.\nOur capital allocation priorities are to invest in growth while paying our dividend, and to pay down debt.\nWe'll consider future repurchases opportunistically.\nWe're well positioned for recovery to accelerate in Q2, enabling us to end the year with mid-single-digit sales-driven revenue growth without acquisitions.\nThis achievement would be historic, as the company hasn't reported such growth in over a decade.\nWe're reiterating our guidance for 2021 revenue growth of 0% to 2% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 20% to 21%, without considering First American's impact.\nWe expect capital expenditures of about $90 million for continued transformation, innovation, and scale-building.\nWe anticipate a tax rate of approximately 25%.\nWe'll update our full-year guidance, including First American, during our Q2 2021 earnings call in early August.\nI'm pleased with Q1 results and believe the company is in a strong position as we maintain momentum and work towards our 2021 expectations.\nOur Q1 results demonstrate our continued momentum and the effectiveness of our One Deluxe strategy.\nThe acquisition of First American aligns with our strategy and will accelerate our growth, transforming Deluxe into a payments and trusted business technology company.\nWe've spent the past 2.5 years preparing to reenter the M&A market by improving technology, reorganizing sales, expanding products, building our management team, and strengthening our balance sheet.\nI'm proud that our team achieved these goals quickly during an unprecedented pandemic.\nWe consistently deliver on our promises.\nWe are truly a new Deluxe.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Jeff will commence the call by providing an overview of our third quarter results.\nFollowing that, Roop will present a detailed analysis of our third quarter performance, including a summary of our cash position and balance sheet, as well as guidance for the fourth quarter.\nTo conclude the call, Jeff will offer a market sector outlook, provide an update on our strategic initiatives, and discuss our midterm financial model before we open the floor for questions and answers.\nWe sincerely hope you and your loved ones are keeping safe and well during these challenging times.\nIn the third quarter, we achieved revenue of $526 million, representing a 7% increase from the second quarter, driven by robust demand in our defense, semiconductor capital equipment, and telecommunications sectors, along with enhanced manufacturing efficiency.\nOur non-GAAP gross margins showed significant improvement, rising by 170 basis points to 8.7% for the quarter, thanks to increased operational efficiency.\nEnhanced profitability and disciplined expense management resulted in non-GAAP earnings of $0.32 per share, which includes $1.3 million or $0.04 per share in COVID-related expenses.\nWe anticipate that COVID-related costs will become a standard part of our operational expenses going forward.\nAlthough we expect these costs to decrease somewhat from current levels, it's unlikely they will be completely eliminated.\nI'm pleased to report that after a couple of challenging quarters, our manufacturing and engineering services operations have largely returned to pre-COVID productivity levels, contributing to our improved third-quarter results.\nThis achievement has required tremendous effort from our COVID task force and entire workforce to maintain strict protocols ensuring a safe and healthy workplace, which remains our top priority.\nOur cash conversion cycle for the quarter improved to 81 days from 84 days in the previous quarter.\nAs mentioned before, our go-to-market team continues to secure exciting opportunities aligned with our complex and focused services and solutions, leveraging the full range of One Benchmark capabilities.\nWe had another strong quarter of bookings in Q3, securing business that is expected to generate over $200 million in future engineering and manufacturing revenue.\nIn the medical sector, we were awarded a new project for a lab-free rapid COVID-19 testing device from DnaNudge, which has begun production at our Netherlands facility.\nWe are thrilled to collaborate with DnaNudge, providing DFX support and high-reliability manufacturing for this rapidly scaling product.\nWe also secured design and manufacturing process contracts with two other companies for a pulmonary treatment device and an optical diagnostic product for renal applications.\nIn the defense sector, we were awarded new projects for secure communication radio modules, incorporating our design solutions and manufacturing services for electronics to be used in military aircraft.\nFor the industrial sector, we were awarded a full system box build for a LiDAR application and manufacturing for a new generation of oscilloscopes.\nIn the computing sector, we were awarded a new prototype for a hyperscale computing customer and a new outsourcing contract from an existing customer for network control and monitoring electronics.\nOur pipeline for new business remains strong across our target sectors and subsectors, and we are optimistic about the potential for continued wins, as the outsourcing environment for both engineering and manufacturing projects remains favorable.\nWe sincerely hope that everyone and their families continue to prioritize their safety and health.\nBenchmark's total revenue for Q3 was $526 million, representing a 7% increase compared to the previous quarter.\nMedical sector revenues remained stable quarter-over-quarter, as anticipated, due to moderating demand for COVID-19 related products such as ventilators, x-ray machines, and ultrasound devices.\nNew product demand is shifting towards diagnostic devices, such as DnaNudge's diagnostic box, which we secured in Q3.\nSemiconductor capital equipment revenues increased by 14% in the third quarter and 45% year-over-year, driven by consistently strong demand across our customer base in this sector.\nAerospace and Defense revenues rose by 18% sequentially in the third quarter, fueled by robust defense demand for surveillance, connectivity, encryption, and digital subsystems, as well as new program wins.\nIn contrast, commercial aerospace demand, which accounted for 30% of our 2019 revenues, remained subdued and declined for certain platforms during the quarter.\nIndustrial sector revenues remained flat sequentially due to ongoing weakness in the oil and gas industry, which represented approximately 20% of our 2019 revenue.\nAdditionally, demand remains sluggish for customers serving commercial building infrastructure and transportation markets.\nOverall, the higher-value markets accounted for 81% of our third quarter revenue.\nIn the traditional markets, computing revenues remained stable sequentially, with steady demand for high-performance computing and data center storage products.\nTelecommunications sector revenue increased by 16% from Q2, with improved demand for commercial satellite and network infrastructure products.\nOur traditional markets represented 19% of third quarter revenues.\nOur top 10 customers accounted for 42% of sales in the third quarter.\nOur GAAP earnings per share for the quarter were $0.16.\nThese GAAP results included restructuring and other one-time costs totaling $7.2 million.\nOf this amount, $6.3 million relates to asset impairment, severance, and other items associated with the decision to discontinue a certain line of business in our Aerospace and Defense sector related to turbine machining.\nThe remaining $900,000 of restructuring and other one-time costs are attributed to various restructuring activities across our sites.\nWe received a $1.6 million insurance recovery related to our Q4 2019 ransomware incident.\nTo date, we have recovered a total of $6.6 million.\nLet's move to slide eight.\nFor Q3, our non-GAAP gross margin was 8.7%, showing a 170 basis point increase from the previous quarter.\nDuring this period, gross margin benefited from higher revenues, which allowed for improved leverage across our cost structure, increased productivity at our sites, and lower COVID-19-related costs compared to the previous quarter.\nWe estimate that we incurred approximately $1.3 million, or about $0.04 per share, in COVID-related costs this quarter, compared to $3.4 million in Q2.\nOur SG&A expenses amounted to $29.7 million, representing a $1.2 million increase from the previous quarter but a $1.2 million decrease year-over-year.\nWe anticipate that our SG&A costs will remain relatively stable between Q3 and Q4.\nOperating margin rose to 3%, up from 1.2% in Q2, due to higher revenue and increased gross margin.\nIn Q3, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 18.6%, which was lower than expected due to the insurance recovery reported in Q3 and the distribution of profits globally.\nThe company's non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter amounted to $0.32.\nThe non-GAAP return on invested capital was 5.8%.\nOur adjusted earnings per share showed sequential improvement due to enhanced operational performance, reduced interest expenses, and a lower tax rate.\nAs of September 30, we had a cash balance of $335 million, with $161 million accessible in the United States.\nWe maintain a robust capital structure, and our liquidity position offers flexibility in managing our business to support our future plans.\nThe company generated $6 million from operating activities and invested $6 million in capital expenditures.\nOur accounts receivable balance increased by $4 million from the previous quarter, reaching $306 million.\nContract assets stood at $161 million on September 30, compared to $154 million on June 30.\nPayables decreased by $22 million compared to the previous quarter.\nInventory decreased by $11 million sequentially, totaling $353 million as of September 30.\nLet's review our cash conversion cycle on slide 10.\nOur cash conversion cycle lasted 81 days.\nThe number of days for accounts receivable improved by three.\nInventory days saw a six-day improvement, and customer deposits improved by one day, contributing to an overall three-day sequential improvement.\nLet's examine our capital allocation update on slide 11.\nIn the third quarter, we continued to distribute a quarterly cash dividend of approximately $5.8 million.\nWe plan to maintain the recurring quarterly cash dividend.\nNo share repurchases were made in Q3.\nWe may consider resuming share repurchases opportunistically in Q4.\nLet's review our fourth quarter 2020 guidance on slide 12.\nWe anticipate revenue to be between $500 million and $540 million.\nWe expect our gross margins to be between 9% and 9.1% for Q4, with SG&A expenses ranging from $29 million to $30 million.\nThis range takes into account the SG&A cost reductions that Jeff will discuss further, continued reduced travel expenses, and the reinstatement of certain employee salaries that were temporarily reduced.\nOur guidance implies an operating margin range of 3.3% to 3.5% for modeling purposes.\nThe provided guidance excludes the impact of intangible asset amortization and estimated restructuring and other costs.\nWe anticipate incurring restructuring and other non-recurring costs of approximately $2.8 to $3.2 million in Q4.\nWe expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $0.32 and $0.36, with a midpoint of $0.34.\nWe estimate generating approximately $45 million to $50 million in cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2020.\nCapital expenditures for the year are expected to be between $32 million and $38 million as we prioritize investments to support new customers and expand production capacity for future growth.\nOther expenses, primarily interest expense related to our outstanding debt, are expected to be $2.7 million.\nWe anticipate our non-GAAP effective tax rate for Q4 to be between 18% and 20% due to the distribution of income across our global network.\nThe expected weighted average shares for Q4 are 36.5 million.\nThis guidance considers all known constraints for the quarter and assumes no further significant disruptions to our supply base, operations, or customers.\nThe guidance also assumes no material changes to end market conditions due to COVID-19.\nFollowing Roop's comments on our fourth quarter guidance, I'd like to provide additional insight into our demand outlook by sector, as shown on slide 14.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect increased revenues from stronger demand and new programs in defense, industrials, and telco to offset anticipated declines in medical as we shift manufacturing from COVID-19-related therapeutic equipment to diagnostic, trauma, and elective surgical devices.\nWe anticipate Q4 revenue to be in line with Q3 levels.\nWe don't expect the usual seasonal uptrend in Q4 this year as customers are more cautious about increasing their demand signals given the current economic and geopolitical environment.\nRegarding the medical sector, during the first half of this year, we experienced demand reductions in our core medical products for cardiac, renal, and orthopedic markets associated with trauma and elective surgeries as many existing and new customers reallocated their manufacturing and sales capacity to fight COVID.\nAs reported, one of our key cardiac customers, ZOLL Medical, enlisted Benchmark to support a rapid ramp-up of manufacturing capability for ventilator production.\nIn the fourth quarter, we anticipate declining demand for COVID-19 therapy devices, but the corresponding demand recovery for our non-COVID products isn't expected to begin until the first half of next year.\nThis anticipated recovery, along with new medical programs, gives us confidence that next year will be another growth year for the medical sector.\nIn the semiconductor capital equipment sector, after a stronger-than-expected increase in Q3, demand remained stable for Q4.\nWe are well-positioned in this sector with our advanced precision machining and electronics manufacturing capabilities, and the future demand outlook is positive.\nThis sector is expected to remain strong as the semiconductor capital equipment index predicts another growth year in 2021.\nRegarding the aerospace and defense sector outlook, our portfolio consists of approximately 70% defense-related products and 30% commercial aerospace offerings based on 2019 revenue levels.\nDefense demand across the portfolio remains strong in Q4 as we support many funded programs across the United States Armed Forces.\nWe expect our commercial aircraft programs, which have seen significant declines in the first half of 2020, to experience limited recovery in Q4 and fiscal year 2021.\nAs previously mentioned, we haven't observed an increase in industrial orders for oil and gas, building, and transportation infrastructure markets, with many large projects continuing to face delays.\nAlthough demand is weak, we anticipate an overall increase in industrial activity in Q4 due to new programs and a rise in global engineering services projects.\nWe observe steady demand across our computing and telecommunications customer base.\nHigh-performance computing projects are progressing as expected in the second half, but are somewhat offset by persistent weakness in higher-value enterprise applications as remote work trends continue.\nIn telecommunications, network infrastructure product demand remains strong among many of our customers due to the ongoing need for increased data service bandwidth.\nFollowing a positive rebound in Q3, demand from our commercial satellite customers has remained stable in Q4.\nAs indicated in our guidance, given this revenue and sector mix forecast, we are on track to achieve at least 9% gross margins in Q4.\nWe are making consistent progress on our key strategic initiatives outlined for 2020.\nMy team and I regularly review progress and share updates with our extended teams to ensure all of Benchmark is aligned with a common set of objectives.\nCustomer focus is a top priority at Benchmark.\nWe are utilizing customer feedback to improve our engagement model and simplify doing business with our organization.\nThis focus, combined with operational performance, forms the foundation of customer satisfaction, which I'm pleased to report remains high.\nWe are developing long-term technology roadmaps and business relationships with many of our growth and strategic accounts to inform how we can invest in and provide more value to our customers in the future.\nThis customer-centric approach is crucial for growing our business.\nIn our sector strategies, we are focusing on selecting vertical submarkets that align best with our value proposition.\nOur goal within these markets is to expand and scale with strategic customers by offering our full range of services and capabilities.\nThis includes targeted investment in technology innovations that set Benchmark apart from competitors and even potential customers' internal manufacturing to increase our success rates.\nThis approach is proving effective across all our higher-value sectors.\nIn fact, over the past year, we have seen improvements in engineering services linked to EMS deals and vice versa.\nWe continue to drive enterprise efficiencies.\nWe are ongoing with our global footprint optimization, reducing manufacturing in some locations while increasing production in others.\nThe aim is to achieve efficiencies with fewer facilities by selecting locations with operational synergies that align with customer preferences.\nIn the third quarter, we decided to discontinue a line of business in our A&D sector related to turbine machining.\nThis decision aligns with our strategic goals for the affected facility and reflects the prolonged downturn in commercial aerospace demand due to the pandemic.\nThese decisions are challenging, but we're focused on our long-term strategy.\nWe are rigorously controlling our costs and managing expenses through improved processes, G&A centralization, and intense focus on project and investment prioritization.\nWe are restructuring our SG&A landscape.\nFor next year, we aim to keep SG&A at or below $130 million, even with the end of temporary salary cuts and corporate furloughs, increased travel expenses, and higher variable compensation.\nOur investments in HR, IT, finance, and other shared services to enable centralization are resulting in lower costs for next year.\nUnfortunately, this requires restructuring activities, which will occur this quarter.\nLastly, I want to address our initiative on engaging talent and transforming our culture.\nBenchmark has a strong cultural foundation based on a committed workforce dedicated to delivering for our customers.\nOur investments in this initiative will focus on improving self-service tools, increasing empowerment, and developing critical skills to ensure we can find the talent our organization needs in future leaders within our own diverse team.\nThis includes an ongoing commitment to advancing diversity and inclusion efforts at all levels of the company, which we are enhancing as part of our ongoing ESG focus.\nFor technology companies like Benchmark, competitiveness requires innovation, fresh ideas, and creative thinking, all of which are fueled by diversity.\nThe focused work on these strategic priorities forms the basis for setting our midterm target model through 2022.\nThe company had made significant progress in shifting towards higher-value markets before my arrival, and we have now reached our target mix between traditional and higher-value splits.\nSelecting the right markets and customers remains key to our strategy.\nSetting aside COVID and the resulting macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe we can achieve a 5% compound annual growth rate in revenue over the next two years by expanding our current accounts and ramping up new programs with our targeted new customers.\nWhile we're overcoming significant revenue decline headwinds in our aerospace and oil and gas markets, as well as other demand softness in our installed base due to the pandemic recession, our growth expectations reflect the strength of our recent bookings and outsourcing wins.\nAs the economy improves later in 2021 and through 2022, we expect our growth to accelerate further with this new win momentum and recovery in our customer installed base.\nWith our current business mix, the success of ongoing operational excellence initiatives, and our current global footprint, we are targeting gross margins in the range of 9.3% to 9.7%.\nRegarding SG&A expenses, I'm committed to effective overhead management and have taken necessary actions to create an efficient organization that is appropriately sized to support our customers and employees.\nAs the company expands and requires greater investments in capabilities, we will keep expenses aligned with our future revenue growth.\nThe resulting non-GAAP operating margin target range will be between 3.4% to 3.8%.\nWith this model, we are confident that we can grow earnings faster than revenue.\nAs operating margins improve, we anticipate a corresponding improvement in ROIC.\nI am confident and remain excited about our team's ability to capitalize on growth opportunities in our diverse end markets, where our deal pipeline and win rate are increasing, and we remain focused on executing our ongoing initiatives to increase incremental value for our customers, employees, and shareholders.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Management's expectations, plans, and estimates of our prospects form the basis for these assertions.\nThe statements made today may only be accurate as of Thursday, July 23, 2020, and could be subject to change.\nWe are not obligated to update our statements or any other information we provide.\nJojo Yap, Peter Schultz, Chris Schneider, and Bob Walter, who hold key positions in our company, are also participating in today's call.\nI trust you and your loved ones are staying healthy during these difficult times.\nBefore delving into the quarterly results, we'd like to express our appreciation and say goodbye to a valued member of the First Industrial team.\nWe've previously announced that Bruce Duncan has stepped down from our Board.\nMany of you are aware that Bruce has accepted a new position as CEO of another REIT.\nBruce joined First Industrial as CEO in 2009 during a challenging period and provided exceptional guidance in stabilizing and transforming our business model and portfolio.\nWe extend our best wishes to Bruce in his new role.\nAs you may have noticed, experienced FR Director Matt Dominski has assumed the role of Chairperson.\nMatt has been a valuable member of our Board since 2010.\nWe're excited to have Matt as our new Chair and anticipate his ongoing advice and leadership.\nLet's now discuss the quarterly results.\nWe achieved strong performance in various areas, including collections, leasing, investment, and capital markets.\nOur regional teams performed exceptionally well in collections during the second quarter.\nAs of yesterday, we've collected 98% of second-quarter monthly rental billings, and so far, we've collected 97% of July billings, which is ahead of the pace we experienced in the second quarter.\nIncluding collections from government-related tenants that typically pay at the end of the month, our collection rate for July would also be 98%.\nApproximately 65% of the outstanding monthly rental billings in the second quarter were in areas with moratoriums on landlords' eviction rights, which we believe contributes to the open receivables for this group.\nTo clarify, in calculating this collections percentage metric, the numerator reflects cash collections, and we don't credit ourselves for security deposit applications under our methodology.\nAdditionally, the denominator reflects total monthly rental billings and isn't reduced for bad debt expense reserves or rent deferrals.\nIncluding surrendered security deposits and bad debt reserves recognized in the second quarter, our outstanding accounts receivable related to our monthly rental billings in Q2 is only $550,000.\nRequests for rent relief have significantly decreased.\nDuring the COVID-19 crisis to date, we've established rent deferment agreements with 14 tenants, totaling $750,000 or about 18 basis points of annualized billings.\nThe average term for these deferrals is 1.3 months.\nIt seems the government stimulus has aided many of our customers, and business leaders generally are more optimistic about their prospects.\nThe industrial sector continues to perform well as goods continue to move through logistics facilities.\nAs you've observed, economic activity has improved since March and April, and our customers and prospects are pursuing new space requirements, albeit cautiously in some cases.\nIn its second quarter preliminary flash report, CBRE reported 19 million square feet of net absorption compared to 56 million square feet of completion.\nThese figures are unsurprising given the economic slowdown due to COVID and the resulting decrease in Q2 leasing activity.\nHowever, we're optimistic about our long-term prospects given the acceleration of e-commerce adoption and the potential for additional safety stock, generating increased demand for logistics space.\nThis view is supported by CBRE's recent forecast that annual net industrial absorption will reach over 333 million square feet by 2022.\nIf accurate, net absorption for the sector will surpass the post-great financial crisis high of 324 million square feet in 2016 and the all-time record of 329 million square feet in 2000.\nDespite completions exceeding net absorption nationally in the quarter, our portfolio occupancy increased to 97.7% at quarter-end.\nWe also secured a significant leasing deal at our Nottingham Ridge Logistics Center in the I-95 North submarket in Baltimore.\nA leading e-commerce company has rented the entirety of Building A, which spans 585,000 square feet, on a long-term contract starting in late June.\nWe managed to rent out this property much faster than the 12-month timeline we had initially projected in our forecast, especially considering we acquired it in Q1.\nWith only 54,000 square feet left to rent, we've reached 93% occupancy in this two-building complex totaling 751,000 square feet.\nLet's examine our portfolio's performance more closely.\nAs of July 22nd, we've renewed 83% of our leases expiring in 2020, with an 8.6% increase in cash rental rates.\nWe anticipate that the cash rental rate change for new and renewed leases will be around 10% for the entire year.\nThe real estate market has started to recover after a period of inactivity during which the gap between asking and bidding prices widened slightly.\nMany properties were temporarily withdrawn from the market as stakeholders sought more clarity on economic trends and asset valuations.\nThe federal government's stimulus measures helped alleviate some concerns, and based on current observations, prices have returned to pre-pandemic levels and in some instances have even increased.\nWe successfully acquired a few properties in high-demand markets during the quarter.\nWe purchased a 39,000 square foot property in Fremont, Northern California, along with an adjacent 46,000 square foot building.\nThe total purchase price was $17.8 million, with an average initial yield of about 4.6%.\nWe also acquired a 9.7-acre covered land investment in the Inland Empire for $3.5 million.\nThe site currently generates a 3% yield and will provide cash flow as we obtain necessary permits for development.\nThe property has the potential for a 155,000 square foot development.\nIn the third quarter so far, we've finalized the purchase of a 6.6-acre site in Seattle for $6.1 million, which can support a 129,000 square foot building.\nWe're thrilled to announce a new build-to-suit project at our First Nandina II location in the Inland Empire.\nThe 221,000 square foot building has been leased long-term to a company that manufactures material handling systems.\nThe total investment is $22.4 million with an initial cash yield of approximately 6.2%.\nWe're moving forward with all our ongoing development projects, which totaled 1 million square feet and represented an investment of $94.7 million as of June 30th.\nIn addition to our on-balance sheet developments, construction is progressing well on the 643,000 square foot speculative building in our Phoenix joint venture at PV303.\nOur share of the investment is $21 million, and we're targeting a 7% yield.\nOur on-balance sheet land holdings can accommodate roughly 13 million square feet of future developments, with most of the land already zoned and ready for construction.\nWe're continuing to prepare infrastructure at several sites to be ready to start new projects when economic conditions in specific submarkets warrant it.\nIn Q2, we divested three buildings totaling 211,000 square feet for $14.6 million.\nThese included properties in Detroit, Chicago, and our final asset in Indianapolis.\nSo far this year, we've sold 437,000 square feet for a total of $41.1 million.\nAs a reminder, we expect to finalize a $55 million sale in Phoenix during Q3, where the tenant exercised their purchase option in 2019.\nRegarding our recent capital market activities.\nOn July 7th, we agreed to a private placement to issue $300 million in 10 and 12 year notes with an average interest rate of 2.81%.\nOn July 15th, we extended a term loan that was due to mature in January 2021.\nThese two actions provide us with additional capital for new investments and extend our debt maturity schedule.\nOverall, it was a successful and very active quarter with excellent performance from our team.\nI'll start by discussing our earnings per share and FFO for the second quarter.\nDiluted earnings per share were $0.28 compared to $0.31 a year ago, and NAREIT funds from operations were $0.46 per fully diluted share, up from $0.43 per share in Q2 2019.\nFFO for Q2 2020 includes roughly $500,000 in cash bad debt expenses related to tenant accounts receivable and $400,000 in non-cash bad debt expenses for writing off certain deferred rent receivables.\nWe anticipate Pier 1 will pay August rent, which along with July's payment, represents a $500,000 increase from our previous guidance.\nOccupancy rose to 97.7%, an increase of 60 basis points from the previous quarter and 40 basis points from the same period last year.\nDuring the quarter, we initiated approximately 2.9 million square feet of leases, comprising 600,000 in new leases, 1.6 million in renewals, and 700,000 for developments and acquisitions with lease-up.\nThe tenant retention rate by square footage was 88.7%.\nCash-based same-store NOI growth, excluding termination fees, reached 6.3%, boosted by higher rental rates for new and renewed leases, reduced free rent, and built-in rental rate increases in our leases.\nThis growth was partially counteracted by increased bad debt expenses and slightly lower average occupancy.\nOverall cash rental rates increased by 11%, with renewals up 8.9% and new leases up 16.7%.\nOn a straight-line basis, overall rental rates rose by 32.4%, with renewals increasing by 30.6% and new leases by 37.5%.\nAs mentioned by Peter, we completed two capital market transactions in the third quarter to extend and diversify our maturities at favorable rates.\nWe agreed to issue $300 million in fixed-rate senior unsecured notes through a private placement offering.\nThe notes are divided into two portions: $100 million with a 10-year term at 2.74% and $200 million with a 12-year term at 2.84%.\nWe anticipate closing the offering around September 17th of this year.\nInitially, we will use these funds to reduce our line of credit, providing more liquidity for new investments and a secured debt maturity in 2021.\nWe also refinanced our $200 million unsecured term loan that was set to mature at the end of January 2021.\nThe new loan has an initial maturity date in July 2021, which can be extended to July 2023 through two one-year extensions at our discretion.\nThe loan features interest-only payments with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 150 basis points.\nIn conjunction with the new term loan, we entered into interest rate swap agreements that convert the loan to a fixed interest rate of 2.49% starting in February 2021.\nThis refinancing will result in approximately one cent per share savings in 2021.\nFollowing these transactions, one of our remaining 2021 maturities is the previously mentioned $63 million of secured debt in the fourth quarter.\nWe can settle this using our line of credit, which will have additional capacity from our private placement offering proceeds.\nThe other maturity is our line of credit, due in October 2021, but we have the option to extend it for another year.\nOur leverage is in a good position, with net debt plus preferred stock to EBITDA at 5.2 times as of June 30th.\nWe've adjusted our guidance range for NAREIT FFO and FFO before one-time items to $1.76 to $1.84 per share, with a midpoint of $1.80.\nThis represents a $0.02 per share increase compared to the midpoint of our guidance from the first quarter call.\nThe increase is primarily due to the early lease-up of the 585,000 square foot building at Nottingham Ridge Logistics Center and two months of additional rental income from Pier 1.\nThis is slightly offset by additional interest expense, assuming we use the private placement offering funds to pay down our line of credit in the near term.\nOur projected range for average quarter-end occupancy remains 96% to 97%, and we still anticipate $900,000 in cash bad debt expenses for each of the third and fourth quarters.\nNote that guidance doesn't include potential write-offs of deferred rent receivables for tenants experiencing financial difficulties.\nOther key assumptions for guidance include: same-store NOI growth on a cash basis before termination fees of 3.25% to 4.25%, an increase of 25 basis points at the midpoint and a narrower range.\nOur G&A guidance range remains $31 million to $32 million.\nGuidance also includes anticipated 2020 costs for completed and under-construction developments as of June 30th, plus the third quarter start of First Nandina II.\nFor the full year 2020, we expect to capitalize about $0.04 per share of interest related to our developments.\nThe impact of any future gain from the final settlement of an insurance claim for a damaged property is excluded.\nGuidance also doesn't account for potential equity issuance.\nOur company is designed for long-term success and is well-positioned to drive cash flow growth for shareholders by meeting the logistics needs of various essential and emerging businesses while capitalizing on e-commerce trends.\nWe will now proceed to the question-and-answer segment of our call.\nSummary: ",
    "output": "compname reports second quarter ffo per share of $0.46.\nq2 ffo per share $0.46.\nq2 earnings per share $0.28.\n2020 ffo guidance increased $0.02 at midpoint to $1.80 per share/unit primarily reflecting portfolio performance.\n",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:AMG's impressive second-quarter results demonstrate ongoing expansion, reflecting successful strategy implementation and a focus on new investments.\nThe company achieved its best-ever second quarter with a 47% year-over-year increase in economic earnings per share, reaching $4.03, primarily due to a 40% EBITDA growth and continued share buybacks.\nStrong investment performance by affiliates has led to higher assets, improved organic growth, and significant performance fees in the first half of the year.\nThe quarter began with an investment in OCP Asia, expanding presence in the region's growing private credit markets, and concluded with a partnership with Parnassus, the industry's largest independent ESG-focused fund manager.\nThese new affiliates, along with the recent investment in Boston Common, are expected to generate over $90 million in EBITDA in 2022 and significantly contribute to long-term organic growth.\nThe company is only midway through 2021.\nWith Parnassus joining, AMG's run-rate EBITDA now exceeds $1 billion, enhancing opportunities for investing in new affiliates, areas of secular growth, and resources to boost existing affiliate growth, including strategic capital and distribution.\nThe company's model has attracted seven new high-quality independent investment firm partnerships in the past two years.\nAMG anticipates greater opportunities for new investments due to a favorable transaction environment, strong competitive position, and increasing demand for partnership solutions.\nPreviously highlighted client demand trends persist, including interest in illiquid alternatives, while others like responsible and impact investing have accelerated, amidst an improving active management landscape.\nAMG's strategy focuses on investing in areas of secular growth, reflected in recent investments increasing exposure to fast-growing segments like Asia, private markets, and ESG.\nWith the addition of Parnassus, Boston Common, and Inclusive Capital Partners, AMG's affiliates will manage over $80 billion in dedicated ESG strategies and more than $600 billion in strategies incorporating ESG, positioning them for future growth in responsible and impact investing.\nParnassus, a sustainable investing pioneer, has a 37-year history of principle-based investing, achieving attractive risk-adjusted returns while creating positive societal impact.\nAMG has known Parnassus leadership for nearly a decade.\nParnassus chose AMG as their long-term partner for their first generational transition.\nAMG's partnership approach is believed to be the best solution for independent firms, maintaining client-partner alignment across generations while preserving unique entrepreneurial cultures.\nThis approach is particularly crucial for Parnassus given its leading position in responsible and impact investing.\nSuccession planning remains a core component of AMG's partnership approach, addressing the inevitable generational and demographic transitions in partner-owned firms.\nSelecting an experienced, supportive partner is vital for the long-term success of independent firms.\nAMG's expertise in developing and executing management transition plans and aligning incentives across generations of affiliate partners is a significant differentiator.\nWith nearly three decades of experience, AMG provides customized partnership solutions based on principles of independence, alignment, and support.\nIn the past two years, AMG has enhanced its strategic focus and resources for originating, structuring, and executing new investments.\nFor the first time since 2016, the majority of cash flow will be deployed in new affiliate investments, with additional high-quality prospects in the pipeline.\nGrowth was a central theme for the second quarter, driven by new investments and strategic actions to support affiliates and enhance distribution resources.\nAMG Funds, the U.S. wealth platform, completed its transition to an affiliate-only model, aligning with the institutional distribution strategy.\nShareholder approval was obtained for all funds transitioning from external sub-advisors, resulting in an additional $4 billion now managed by AMG affiliates.\nThe changes include a more diverse product lineup with lower fees, offering clients access to excellent affiliate strategies in areas like ESG equities and fixed income, Asian equities, and international equities.\nThis strategic evolution aligns all AMG operations and resources across global institutional wealth platforms with affiliates, positioning the company for significant future organic growth.\nThis instance exemplifies how investments in our affiliates' growth can generate value for shareholders.\nA few years back, we initiated the AMG Pantheon's fund with a $10 million investment, recognizing the potential to offer U.S. wealth investors access to private equity portfolios.\nRecently, the fund achieved a notable milestone by surpassing $0.5 billion in assets under management.\nThe fund's exceptional performance and increasing organic growth demonstrate that U.S. wealth investors are recognizing the advantages of including private equity in their investment portfolios.\nThis illustrates how AMG's core capabilities can foster new growth opportunities for our affiliated companies.\nFurthermore, we've been proactively investing in our affiliates through team acquisitions, including global sustainable equities and fixed-income groups at Artemis, and more recently at Pantheon, where we facilitated the addition of a real estate team to enhance their global infrastructure and real assets platform.\nThe positive momentum we described in our business at the year's beginning is only starting to show in our results.\nLooking ahead to the latter half of 2021 and the entirety of 2022, we see substantial opportunities to build on this momentum by continuing to execute our strategy, which aims to boost top-line EBITDA growth and, combined with share repurchases, will further increase our earnings per share and create significant long-term value for shareholders.\nOur second-quarter results highlight the unique growth drivers inherent in AMG's business model.\nThese results also demonstrate our capacity to generate shareholder value both now and in the future.\nOur affiliated companies delivered robust investment performance.\nWe achieved net inflows when excluding Quant strategies.\nWe invested considerable capital in both new partnerships and existing affiliates, while also repurchasing stock during the quarter, showcasing our ability to drive growth through each of our core earnings drivers.\nFor the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA of 227 million showed a 40% year-over-year increase, driven by strong affiliate investment performance in markets and the impact of our growth investments.\nEconomic earnings per share of $4.03 grew by 47% compared to the previous year.\nThis growth was further enhanced by our share repurchase activities.\nNet client cash inflows, excluding certain quantitative strategies, amounted to 3 billion for the quarter, driven by private markets, specialty fixed income, U.S. equities, ESG strategies, and the strategic development of our U.S. wealth platform, AMG Funds.\nOutflows from specific quant strategies totaled 11 billion but had minimal impact on our earnings.\nOur organic growth profile is improving as clients seek active management solutions in a more volatile market environment, and we continue to add new affiliates in areas of secular growth, including ESG, Asia, and private markets.\nExamining performance by asset class and excluding certain quantitative strategies, our illiquid alternative strategies had another strong quarter with 3.7 billion in net inflows, led by successful fundraising at Pantheon, EIG, and Bearing.\nPerformance in this category remained strong, with over 90% of assets outperforming benchmarks in the most recent and previous vintages.\nPrivate markets businesses like OCP Asia continue to be a focus area for new investments and represent a significant source of stable management fee earnings and long-term performance fee potential.\nIn liquid alternatives, net inflows were 1.4 billion, supported by ongoing client demand for alternative sources of risk and return in the low-yield environment, including at affiliates such as Garda and Capula.\nWe continue to see substantial performance fee generation in this category, reflecting excellent performance across our concentrated long-only equity and specialty fixed income strategies.\nIn global equities, we reported net outflows of 6.3 billion, primarily due to specific, lower fee institutional reallocation activity.\nThese mandates accounted for roughly two-thirds of the outflows in this category.\nLong-term global equity performance remains strong, particularly in strategies that significantly contribute to our EBITDA.\nOur U.S. equity strategies continue to gain momentum with $2.9 billion in inflows, primarily due to high client interest, especially in value-focused strategies managed by prominent firms like River Road and Yactman, as well as our small-cap strategies.\nWe maintain robust performance in this area, bolstered by our recent investments in Jackson Square, Boston Common, and Parnassus.\nLooking ahead, we have a well-balanced mix of high-performing growth and value strategies.\nOur multi-asset and fixed-income category saw inflows of nearly $1 billion, mainly driven by sustained demand for municipal bond strategies and wealth management solutions, particularly at GW&K and Baker Street this quarter.\nIn the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA reached $227 million, showing a 40% year-over-year increase, propelled by strong affiliate performance in markets and additional earnings from our recent new affiliate investments.\nOur adjusted EBITDA included $16 million in performance fees, reflecting exceptional affiliate investment performance, particularly in our liquid alternatives category.\nEconomic earnings per share grew by 47% year-over-year to $4.03, further enhanced by ongoing share repurchase activities.\nOur recently announced partnership with Parnassus is anticipated to finalize early in the fourth quarter, resulting in a partial-year impact on our 2021 financial results.\nAfter accounting for one-time transaction costs, we anticipate Parnassus will contribute roughly $15 million to our fourth-quarter EBITDA results.\nFor the full year 2022, we expect Parnassus to contribute approximately $70 million in EBITDA and $1.30 in economic earnings per share.\nLet's now turn to specific modeling items for the third quarter.\nWe project adjusted EBITDA to fall between $215 and $220 million, based on current AUM levels, reflecting a flat market blend through yesterday and seasonally lower performance fees of up to $5 million.\nOur share of interest expense was $27 million for the second quarter, and we anticipate it to increase to $28 million in the third quarter, reflecting our recent hybrid bond offering.\nControlling interest depreciation was $2 million in the second quarter, and we expect a similar level in the third quarter.\nOur share of reported amortization and impairments was $36 million for the second quarter, and we anticipate a similar figure in the third quarter.\nOur effective GAAP and cash tax rates were 36% and 18%, respectively, for the second quarter, and we expect GAAP and cash tax rates to be 25% and 18%, respectively, for the third quarter.\nIntangible-related deferred taxes were $31 million this quarter, and we expect this to decrease to a more normalized level of $12 million in the third quarter.\nBoth our GAAP tax rate and intangible-related deferred taxes were higher this quarter due to recently enacted U.K. tax rate changes, but did not impact economic net income or economic earnings per share.\nOther economic items were negative $4 million.\nFor modeling purposes, we expect other economic items, excluding any mark-to-market impact on GPNC, to be $1 million in the third quarter.\nOur adjusted weighted average share count for the second quarter was 42.5 million, and we anticipate our share count to be approximately 42.1 million for the third quarter.\nLastly, let's discuss the balance sheet and capital allocation.\nOur balance sheet remains robust as we invest for growth and consistently return capital to shareholders.\nEarlier this month, we further strengthened the balance sheet by issuing a 40-year $200 million hybrid bond at an asset management industry low coupon of 4.2%.\nWe continue to prioritize extending duration, enhancing flexibility, and maintaining significant capacity to allocate capital to fuel our growth strategy.\nWe remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders.\nIn the second quarter, we repurchased $80 million of shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $290 million, and we're on track for $500 million in repurchases for the full year, subject to market conditions and the timing of new affiliate investments.\nOver the past 24 months, we've returned nearly $1 billion of excess capital to shareholders, repurchasing almost 20% of our outstanding shares, while simultaneously partnering with seven new affiliates and investing in our existing affiliates and centralized capabilities.\nAs Jay highlighted in his remarks, our strong results this quarter demonstrate AMG's unique growth drivers and underscore the strength of our business model and the effectiveness of our strategy.\nThe momentum in our business continues to accelerate, and we are deploying our capital and resources to compound growth over time.\nOur recent investments in new affiliates add significant and growing earnings power to our business, and combined with our strong capital position and demonstrated ability to return capital to shareholders, we are well-positioned to deliver long-term shareholder value.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Here are the paraphrased sentences:\nKasey Jenkins, Vice President of McCormick Investor Relations, is speaking.\nAfter some instructions for the operator, Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman, President and CEO, and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO, will begin their remarks.\nIn our discussion, we'll reference certain non-GAAP financial metrics.\nThese include data in constant currency, as well as adjusted figures for gross margin, operating income, income tax rate, earnings per share and leverage ratio that exclude the impact of special charges, expenses related to acquiring Cholula and FONA, and for 2019, the non-recurring benefit from the U.S. Tax Act.\nAs a reminder, we performed a 2-for-1 stock split at the conclusion of our fiscal 2020.\nIt's crucial to note that these statements contain expectations and assumptions regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nI'm now pleased to hand over the discussion to Lawrence.\nBeginning with Slide 4, our fourth quarter performance concluded a year of robust financial results.\nDespite significant disruption in 2020, we achieved strong results, demonstrating the resilience of our business model, the worth of our products, our organizational capabilities, and the effective execution of our strategy.\nI'm extremely proud of McCormick's performance in this unprecedented business environment.\nWe achieved outstanding underlying operational performance while safeguarding our employees and acknowledging their exceptional efforts, making crucial investments in our supply chain and brand development to drive future growth, and aiding our communities through relief initiatives.\nWe're also thrilled about our recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, two excellent businesses that will continue to support distinctive growth and performance, setting McCormick up for success in 2021 and beyond.\nAs illustrated on Slide 5, we possess a diverse and advantageous global flavor portfolio with appealing offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels.\nThe diversity and reach of our portfolio across segments, regions, channels, customers and product offerings provides a balanced and varied portfolio to maintain consistent performance during volatile periods, as evidenced by our fourth quarter and fiscal year outcomes.\nThe ongoing shift in consumer behavior towards more cooking and eating at home drove substantial increases in demand for our Consumer segment, as well as increased sales to packaged food company customers in our Flavor Solutions segment.\nConversely, we experienced reduced demand from our restaurant and other foodservice customers for away-from-home products in our portfolio.\nThe impact of this shift to more at-home consumption has differed by region due to varying levels of away-from-home consumption and the pace of COVID-19 recovery in each area.\nCollectively, these impacts continue to showcase the strength and diversity of our offerings.\nAs we enter 2021, I'm confident our operational momentum will persist.\nOur 2021 outlook anticipates that our continued underlying business momentum and the Cholula and FONA acquisitions will drive robust sales, adjusted operating income, and earnings growth, while funding our investments in business transformation.\nMoving to Slide 6, starting with the fourth quarter results, which aligned with the guidance we provided for sales, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted earnings per share in our previous earnings call, our top line grew 5% compared to the same period last year, including a 1% favorable impact from currency.\nIn constant currency, our total sales increased by 4%, with both segments contributing to the growth.\nAdjusted operating income decreased by 4%, as growth from higher sales and CCI-led cost savings was more than offset by increased planned brand marketing investments, COVID-19-related expenses, and higher employee benefit costs.\nOur fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.79 compared to $0.81 in the prior year, primarily due to lower adjusted operating income, partially offset by reduced interest expense.\nExamining our fourth quarter segment business performance, beginning on Slide 7 with our Consumer segment, we achieved 6% sales growth, or 5% in constant currency, driven by increased at-home cooking and eating.\nOur Americas constant currency sales growth was 6% in the fourth quarter.\nOur total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio, as indicated by IRI consumption data, grew 14%, reflecting the strength of our categories as consumers continue to cook more at home.\nSimilar to previous quarters, our sales increase was lower than the U.S. IRI consumption growth, which can be attributed to service level pressures and increased pricing reflected in scanner data.\nAs mentioned in our September earnings call, we anticipated service level pressures in the fourth quarter due to sustained increased demand.\nTo protect our top-selling holiday items, we had to suspend or reduce production of some secondary products, which importantly led to our strong holiday performance, and consistent with previous quarters, scanner data shows higher pricing growth due to the shift towards grocery stores over mass merchandisers and closed stores, as well as some impact from reduced promotional activity.\nFocusing on the U.S. branded portfolio in spices and seasonings and other key categories, excluding dry recipe mixes, we achieved double-digit consumption growth in the fourth quarter and again increased our household penetration and repeat purchase rates.\nOur fourth quarter dry recipe mix consumption was impacted by supply constraints but still achieved double-digit growth for the year, as did spices and seasonings and other key categories.\nIn the fourth quarter, we continued to gain market share in categories less affected by supply constraints, including hot sauces, stocks and broth, barbecue sauce, wet marinades, and Asian products.\nThe majority of our categories continued to outpace total store and center-of-store growth rates, positively impacting not only the McCormick brand but smaller brands as well, such as Stubb's, Lawry's, Simply Asia and Thai Kitchen.\nIn e-commerce, we experienced triple-digit pure-play growth with McCormick branded consumption outpacing all major categories.\nWhile we don't expect consumption to continue at the highly elevated level of our fourth quarter, we do anticipate continued and long-lasting growth from the increase in at-home cooking. The most recent IRI scanner sales data for the five weeks ending January 17th shows total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio consumption is still growing at approximately 11.5% with continued strength in spices and seasonings.\nConsumers are continuing to choose our brands, have positive experiences, and repurchase our products.\nIn the fourth quarter, we increased our brand marketing investments across all regions as planned, with the Americas' messaging and promotional activities focused on the holiday season proving successful.\nWith our high level of effective brand marketing investments and initiatives to deepen our digital engagement with consumers, we're capitalizing on the opportunity to build long-term brand equity, attract new customers, and increase usage by existing consumers.\nWith our recently added manufacturing capacity, we're well-positioned moving into 2021, and we'll continue to drive growth through strong brand marketing, category management initiatives, and new product innovations.\nTurning to EMEA, our constant currency sales rose 10% in the fourth quarter with broad-based growth across the region.\nOur largest markets continued to drive double-digit total branded consumption growth with market share gains across the region in several categories.\nSpices and seasonings consumption was strong in all markets, and our Vahine brand in France again experienced strong consumption growth, outpacing the homemade desserts category.\nIn the U.K., Frank's RedHot drove hot sauce category growth and gained market share with over 50% consumption growth.\nIn EMEA, our household penetration and rate of repeat buyers increased significantly across our major brands and markets during the fourth quarter and the full year compared to last year.\nImportantly, for the full year, we gained market share in the total EMEA region for spices and seasonings and dry recipe mixes.\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, our constant currency sales declined 10% driven by softness in branded foodservice products, which are included in our Consumer segment in this region.\nThe foodservice industry is continuing to recover, but at a gradual pace.\nGrowth in China was also impacted by a shift to a later Chinese New Year in 2021, which in turn affected shipments at the end of our year.\nExcluding those impacts, consumer consumption in the region was strong, particularly for Gourmet Garden and Frank's RedHot in Australia.\nMoving to Slide 8, our Flavor Solutions segment returned to growth in the fourth quarter with a 3% constant currency sales increase, and all three regions contributed to the sales growth.\nIn both our Americas and EMEA regions, we experienced increased demand from our consumer packaged food customers or at-home customer base, with strength in the base business as well as momentum with new products.\nAlso in both regions, we experienced demand declines in our away-from-home customer base for branded foodservice and restaurant customers.\nThe net impact of this demand volatility, along with pricing actions to cover cost increases, drove EMEA's fourth quarter constant currency sales growth of 5% and the Americas, which is more focused on branded foodservice, growth of 2%.\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, our constant currency sales grew 7% driven by Australia and China's growth with quick service restaurant (QSR) customers, where we continue to see momentum in limited time offers and core business, partially driven by customers' promotional activities.\nShifting from our fourth quarter results, I'm pleased to share our full fiscal year accomplishments.\nThese not only highlight what we've achieved during 2020 but also fuel our confidence to drive another year of strong operating performance in 2021.\nStarting with our 2020 financial results as seen on Slide 9, we achieved 5% constant currency sales growth with 10% growth in our Consumer segment led by increased at-home cooking and eating.\nPartially offsetting this growth was a 2% constant currency sales decline in the Flavor Solutions segment as COVID-19 restrictions in most markets, as well as consumer reluctance to dine out, reduced demand from restaurant and other foodservice customers.\nWe achieved $113 million in annual cost savings driven by our CCI program, our fuel for growth, and there continues to be significant potential in 2021 and beyond to deliver additional cost savings.\n2020 was the ninth consecutive year with record cash flow from operations, ending the year at over $1 billion, a 10% increase from last year.\nWe're making great progress with our working capital improvements.\nAt year-end, our Board of Directors announced a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend, marking our 35th consecutive year of dividend increases.\nWe have paid dividends every year since 1925 and are proud to be a dividend aristocrat.\nNow I'd like to comment on some of our 2020 achievements beyond our financial performance.\nE-commerce growth accelerated significantly in 2020, which we were well prepared for due to our past investments and investments we activated early in the year.\nOur 2020 growth of 136% was outstanding, with triple-digit growth in all categories, including pure-play, click and collect, and our own direct-to-consumer properties.\nWe expect the consumer shift towards increased online shopping to continue, and we are well-positioned for the opportunities still ahead.\nWe continue to build long-term brand equity through our brand marketing investments, increasing by 7% in fiscal 2020.\nMost recently, with a double-digit increase in the fourth quarter across all regions, which will continue to drive strong growth momentum into 2021.\nWe designed targeted media and messaging focused on cooking at home and connecting with consumers digitally more than ever in 2020.\nOur digital leadership was again recognized, as we were ranked as the number 1 food brand with the highest designation of genius by Gartner L2 research in their Digital IQ U.S. ranking.\nThis is the seventh consecutive year we were ranked in the top five food and beverage brands.\nWe continue to be recognized for our efforts in doing what's right for people, communities, and the planet.\nDuring 2020, we were recognized for the fourth consecutive year as a DiversityInc Top 50 company.\nEarlier this week, Corporate Knights ranked McCormick in their 2021 Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations Index as number 1 in the food products industry for the 5th consecutive year, as well as the number 1 U.S. company overall and globally number 6 overall.\nFinally, during the year, we continued to invest in expanding our global infrastructure.\nIn the Americas, we broke ground on a new state-of-the-art Northeast Distribution Center in Maryland, which will optimize our distribution network.\nIn our EMEA region, we began construction on a new Flavor Solutions manufacturing facility in the U.K. to support the region's strong and growing customer base.\nIn China, we are investing in flavor capabilities to further drive Flavor Solutions growth.\nThese investments will create both capacity and capability, which will further drive our growth momentum.\nIn a moment, Mike will discuss our projections for 2021.\nI'd like to comment on our recent acquisitions and highlight our growth momentum and plans for 2021.\nWe've strengthened our global flavor leadership and accelerated our condiment and flavors growth platforms by acquiring Cholula and FONA.\nCholula is an iconic, fast-growing Mexican hot sauce brand that complements our existing hot sauce portfolio well.\nFONA, a leading North American flavor manufacturer, enhances our global flavors platform with its complementary portfolio.\nWe anticipate strong growth contributions from Cholula and FONA in 2021, following their acquisitions in late 2020.\nIntegration activities are proceeding as planned for both companies as we align our organizations to quickly capitalize on opportunities and drive growth.\nWe have proven expertise to unlock Cholula's significant growth potential effectively.\nIn our Consumer segment, we'll use our operational capabilities to boost Cholula's brand presence, increase product availability, and expand into new flavors and formats.\nCholula has maintained strong momentum into 2021, outpacing category growth.\nFor our Flavor Solutions segment, we'll focus on strengthening Cholula's go-to-market strategy across foodservice channels.\nWe're uniquely positioned to expand Cholula's distribution and penetration in foodservice.\nOur broad customer reach and culinary expertise allow us to provide expanded recipe ideas and flavor solutions to operators.\nFONA will be crucial in accelerating our Americas flavor platform and portfolio shift.\nBy combining our infrastructures, we'll offer customers more comprehensive products, improve our competitive position, and create growth opportunities.\nFONA enhances our health and wellness portfolio and expands our R&D capabilities, especially in flavoring nutritional products.\nOur natural flavors platform is significantly strengthened by FONA's predominantly natural portfolio and expertise in citrus flavors.\nOur combined technology platforms will drive long-term growth in flavor development across various applications.\nWe can reach a broader customer base and deepen existing relationships by cross-selling our expanded portfolio.\nCustomers have responded positively to the acquisition, recognizing the increased value we can provide.\nWe're confident in delivering on our acquisition plans, backed by our successful track record of integrating acquired businesses.\nAcquisitions remain a key part of our long-term growth strategy, with Cholula and FONA adding to our history of creating value through acquisitions.\nGlobal demand for flavor continues to drive our sales growth.\nWe're capitalizing on consumer interest in healthy cooking, trusted brands, digital engagement, and purposeful practices.\nThese trends have accelerated during the pandemic, positioning us well for continued growth.\nOur Consumer segment is experiencing sustained high demand globally as people cook more at home.\nConsumers are enjoying home cooking and perceive it as safer, healthier, and more cost-effective.\nWe expect the preference for home cooking to persist beyond the pandemic, driving demand for our products.\nWe've significantly increased our manufacturing capacity to meet demand and are improving service levels.\nWe're implementing long-term solutions to strengthen our supply chain resilience and support future growth.\nWe're continuing to invest in brand marketing and new product innovation to drive growth.\nIn our Flavor Solutions segment, we're seeing various stages of recovery across our diverse customer base.\nGrowth with packaged food customers has returned to pre-COVID levels, while the recovery for foodservice customers is ongoing.\nWe have positive fundamentals in place to navigate through this period and are excited about the recovery momentum.\nWe expect to drive overall organic sales growth in both segments in 2021, though growth may vary by region and quarter.\nOur fundamentals, momentum, and growth outlook are stronger than ever, positioning us for continued success and achievement of our long-term objectives.\nI will now offer additional commentary on our fourth quarter and full-year performance, as well as provide details about our outlook for 2021.\nDuring the fourth quarter, sales increased by 4% when adjusted for currency fluctuations.\nHigher volume and product mix in our Consumer segment drove sales growth, while volume and mix in Flavor Solutions remained similar to the previous year.\nPrice increases to offset rising costs also positively impacted both segments.\nThe Consumer segment experienced 5% growth in constant currency, primarily in the Americas and EMEA regions.\nContinued shifts to eating at home and increased home cooking, along with consumers adding flavor to restaurant takeout and delivery meals, are sustaining higher demand for our consumer products, resulting in increased volume and mix in these areas.\nConsumer segment sales in the Americas rose 6% in constant currency compared to Q4 2019, driven by higher volume and product mix across numerous brands including Simply Asia, Thai Kitchen, Frank's RedHot, French's, Lawry's, Zatarain's, Gourmet Garden, and Stubb's.\nThese gains were partially offset by volume declines in McCormick's branded spices, seasonings, recipe mixes, and private label products due to capacity limitations.\nIn EMEA, constant currency consumer sales grew 10% year-over-year, with strong performance across all countries in the region.\nThe main drivers of volume and mix growth were our Schwartz and Ducros branded spices and seasonings, Vahine homemade dessert products, and Kamis branded items in Poland.\nConsumer sales in the Asia-Pacific region decreased 10% in constant currency, primarily due to lower branded foodservice sales and a shift to a later Chinese New Year.\nThe Flavor Solutions segment saw a 3% increase in constant currency sales for Q4, with growth across all three regions.\nIn the Americas, Flavor Solutions' constant currency sales increased 2%, driven by pricing to cover cost increases, partially offset by lower volume and product mix.\nVolume and product mix declined due to reduced demand from branded foodservice and other restaurant customers.\nThis decline was partially offset by higher demand from packaged food companies, particularly in snack seasoning.\nIn EMEA, constant currency sales rose 5%, attributed to pricing to cover cost increases and higher volume and product mix.\nVolume and product mix growth was driven by increased sales to packaged food companies, especially in snack seasonings, partially offset by lower sales to branded foodservice and other restaurant customers.\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales increased 7% in constant currency, driven by higher sales to quick-service restaurants in China and Australia, partly due to limited-time offers and promotional activities.\nSummary: ",

    "pred_output": "2020 was a year of resilience and growth for McCormick, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The company achieved strong financial results, with a 5% increase in constant currency sales and a 10% increase in cash flow from operations. The Consumer segment saw significant growth, driven by increased demand for at-home cooking and eating, while the Flavor Solutions segment experienced a decline in sales due to reduced demand from foodservice customers. The company's recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA are expected to drive growth in 2021, and McCormick is well-positioned to capitalize on the ongoing shift towards at-home cooking and eating.

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'll begin by highlighting key points from the quarter, followed by Jack's presentation of second quarter results and third quarter projections.\nI'll then offer some final thoughts before we open the floor for questions.\nJack will now address the safe harbor statement before we continue.\nThese declarations are founded on the current views and expectations of management.\nAs we approach mid-2021, I'm growing more confident about the robustness of the global economic recovery.\nWe're witnessing a significant rise in hiring optimism as vaccine distribution progresses and lockdown measures are relaxed.\nThe recovery is proceeding at a rapid pace, with hiring intentions increasing much more quickly than after the previous economic slowdown.\nDespite recent concerns about rising infection rates, we don't anticipate they'll significantly alter the positive trajectory of the recovery.\nDuring the second quarter, I spent considerable time in Europe meeting with our market leaders, teams, and clients.\nThis included attending Viva Tech, one of the world's premier technology conferences in Paris, with our French team, which I'll discuss later in our innovation update.\nI also participated in the Choose France event alongside other global leaders, meeting with President Macron and his administration.\nI'm optimistic about France's future as the government continues to enhance the country's competitiveness, and our business is well-positioned to benefit from their economic growth.\nMy conversations with clients clearly indicate a strong resurgence in demand for our services across all our brands.\nThis is reflected in increased activity in both temporary and permanent placements, as well as demand for workforce solutions.\nBusinesses increasingly seek our assistance in finding and retraining talent to capitalize on the rapidly improving economic recovery and accelerate digital transformation to emerge stronger in the post-pandemic era.\nLet's examine our financial performance.\nRevenue for the second quarter reached $5.3 billion, representing a 31% year-over-year increase in constant currency.\nWe experienced significant revenue growth in our key markets, resulting in financial performance that exceeded expectations.\nThe quarter's operating profit was $170 million, showing a substantial increase as we mark the anniversary of the pandemic's most severe financial impact.\nThe operating profit margin stood at 3.2%.\nExcluding special charges from the previous year, the operating profit margin increased by 260 basis points.\nEarnings per diluted share were $2.02.\nOur latest talent shortage survey, encompassing 42,000 employers across 43 countries, revealed that 69% of employers globally - a 15-year high - are experiencing difficulties in hiring skilled workers across various industries.\nDespite more widespread vaccinations, workers continue to grapple with pandemic-related issues such as healthcare and childcare concerns.\nUnemployment benefits and related programs are also having a lingering effect on the labor supply.\nWe anticipate that pandemic-related talent shortages will gradually ease in the coming quarters.\nHowever, the long-term effects of digitization and other structural labor market changes are here to stay.\nThis suggests that hiring skilled talent and supporting individuals in reskilling and upskilling for growth roles will drive demand for the foreseeable future.\nThe current job market favors workers.\nConsequently, we're beginning to see employers respond to workers' desires: wage increases in some areas, greater flexibility, skills development opportunities, and a clear commitment to ESG, particularly regarding an organization's social and environmental impact.\nSecond quarter revenues reached the upper end of our constant currency guidance range.\nGross profit margin significantly exceeded our guidance range.\nOperating profit amounted to $170 million, representing a substantial increase from the prior year period, which was heavily impacted by the pandemic.\nThe operating profit margin was 3.2%, surpassing the midpoint of our guidance by 80 basis points.\nAnalyzing our revenue trend in more detail, after adjusting for the positive impact of currency of about 10%, our constant currency revenue increased by 31%.\nThe impact of net dispositions and slightly more billing days was minimal, resulting in an organic days-adjusted revenue increase of 31% as well.\nCompared to pre-pandemic levels, our second quarter revenues were 4% below 2019 levels on an organic days-adjusted constant currency basis, representing a 1.5% improvement from the first quarter trend on the same basis.\nExamining the earnings per share bridge on Slide 4, earnings per share were $2.02, significantly exceeding our guidance range.\nCompared to our guidance midpoint, our results included improved operational performance of $0.55, slightly higher than expected foreign currency exchange rates with a positive impact of $0.03, a slightly better than anticipated effective tax rate adding $0.02, and favorable other expenses contributing $0.02.\nAnalyzing our gross profit margin in detail, it came in at 16.3%.\nStaffing margin contributed a 60 basis point increase, including 20 basis points related to direct cost accrual adjustments in France, representing a 40 basis point underlying improvement in staffing margin.\nPermanent recruitment contributed a 50 basis point GP margin improvement as hiring activity was strong across our largest markets.\nOur Experis Managed Services business in Europe contributed a 10 basis point margin improvement.\nThese increases were partially offset by other business mix factors, primarily involving a lower mix of Right Management career transition business.\nLet's review our gross profit by business line.\nDuring the quarter, the Manpower brand comprised 64% of gross profit.\nOur Experis Professional business accounted for 21%, and Talent Solutions made up 15%.\nThe Manpower brand reported an organic constant currency gross profit year-over-year growth of 51%.\nOur Manpower business experienced the most significant decline a year ago and consequently saw the largest increase during this recovery period.\nCompared to pre-pandemic levels, this represented a 4% decrease from the second quarter of 2019 on an organic constant currency basis.\nGross profit in our Experis brand increased by 23% year-over-year during the quarter on an organic constant currency basis.\nThis represented a 1% decrease from the second quarter of 2019 on an organic constant currency basis.\nTalent Solutions, which includes our globally leading RPO, MSP, and Right Management offerings, saw organic gross profit increase by 27% in constant currency year-over-year.\nThis represented a 12% increase from the second quarter of 2019 on an organic constant currency basis.\nOur RPO business posted double-digit GP growth during the quarter due to significant growth in hiring activity.\nOur MSP division, which has consistently performed well in recent quarters, maintained its strong growth trajectory with double-digit increases in gross profit during the period\nOur Right Management division is experiencing a decline in outplacement activities as economic recovery strengthens, resulting in a roughly 9% year-over-year decrease in gross profit\nOur quarterly SG&A expenses totaled $690 million, representing a 10% increase on a reported basis compared to the previous year\nDisregarding goodwill and other impairment charges from the prior year, SG&A showed a 17% increase when adjusted for constant currency\nThis increase in SG&A corresponds to a 40% rise in gross profit on a constant currency basis, demonstrating balanced investment and strong gross profit flow-through for the quarter\nOperating costs rose by $96 million, while net dispositions resulted in a $1 million reduction\nCurrency fluctuations led to a $42 million increase\nSG&A expenses as a proportion of revenue were 13.1% in the second quarter, indicating ongoing improvements in efficiency as revenue recovers\nThe Americas segment accounted for 20% of total consolidated revenue\nQuarterly revenue reached $1 billion, marking a 23% increase in constant currency\nOperating Unit Profit (OUP) amounted to $56 million\nExcluding prior year impairment costs, OUP grew by 116% in constant currency, with OUP margin expanding by 230 basis points to 5.4%\nThe United States is the largest market in the Americas segment, comprising 60% of the segment's revenues\nU.S. revenue totaled $629 million, representing a 22% increase compared to the previous year\nAfter adjusting for franchise acquisition and days, this increase was 21%\nDisregarding impairment charges from the prior year, OUP for our U.S. operations increased by 149% year-over-year, reaching $38 million for the quarter\nThe OUP margin stood at 6%\nWithin the U.S. market, the Manpower brand accounted for 35% of gross profit during the quarter\nRevenue for the U.S. Manpower brand increased by 36% during the quarter\nWhile the U.S. Manpower business continues to recover, we've observed a shortage in candidate supply during the second quarter and expect this trend to persist through the summer months\nThe Experis brand in the U.S. contributed 32% of gross profit for the quarter\nIT skills make up approximately 80% of revenues within the U.S. Experis brand\nExperis U.S. revenues grew by 5% during the quarter\nWe are optimistic about the current trends in our U.S. Experis business and anticipate further improvement in the third quarter\nTalent Solutions in the U.S. accounted for 33% of gross profit and experienced 14% revenue growth in the quarter\nThis growth was primarily driven by RPO, which saw substantial revenue increases as hiring programs continued to strengthen\nThe MSP business maintained its strong performance, achieving double-digit revenue growth in the quarter\nFor the third quarter, we anticipate ongoing underlying improvement in U.S. revenue growth, ranging from 11% to 15% year-over-year\nComparing projected third-quarter revenues to pre-crisis levels in constant currency, this represents a 2% decline compared to 2019 levels, using the midpoint of our guidance\nOur Mexican operations experienced 6% revenue growth in constant currency during the quarter\nOn April 23, the Mexican government enacted labor legislation that will prohibit certain types of temporary staffing not considered specialized services, effective July 23\nAs a result, companies operating in Mexico will be barred from using temporary staffing for functions already considered in-house core competencies of their workforce\nWe have been collaborating with our clients as the market adapts to this legislation and expect a reduction in revenues for our Mexican business starting in the third quarter as clients navigate the new regulations and adjust their workforce strategies accordingly\nAlthough this will lead to revenue reductions over the next few quarters, we believe the shift towards more specialized staffing will improve the margin profile of our Mexican business\nWe also anticipate potential new revenue opportunities over time as clients modify their workforce strategies\nWhile it's challenging to forecast due to the rapid implementation of the legislation, we currently estimate a revenue decrease for the Mexican business in the third quarter ranging from 28% to 32% in constant currency\nMexico accounted for 2.8% of our 2020 revenues\nRevenue in Canada increased by 22% in days-adjusted constant currency during the quarter\nRevenue in other countries within the Americas grew by 40% in constant currency\nThis growth was driven by significant constant currency revenue increases in Argentina, Colombia, Peru, and Chile\nThe Southern Europe segment accounted for 46% of consolidated revenue in the quarter\nRevenue in Southern Europe reached $2.4 billion, growing 51% in constant currency\nThis growth reflects ongoing improvement driven by France and Italy\nOperating Unit Profit (OUP) totaled $115 million, with an OUP margin of 4.8%\nFrance comprised 56% of the Southern Europe segment's revenue in the quarter, increasing by 67% in days-adjusted constant currency\nCompared to the same period in 2019, France's revenues were down 12%\nAlthough restrictions impacted the rate of revenue improvement during the quarter, the French business continued to perform well in a challenging environment, and we expect ongoing improvement now that most restrictions have been lifted\nOUP for France was $66 million in the quarter, with an OUP margin of 4.9%\nAs previously mentioned, direct cost accrual adjustments of approximately $10 million benefited France's results\nAs we enter the third quarter, we estimate a year-over-year constant currency increase in revenues for France ranging from 12% to 16%\nComparing estimated third quarter revenues to pre-crisis levels in constant currency, this represents a 5% decline compared to 2019 levels, using the midpoint of our guidance\nRevenue in Italy reached $469 million in the quarter, reflecting a 57% increase in days-adjusted constant currency\nThroughout the second quarter, revenues in Italy continued to surpass 2019 levels\nOUP for Italy totaled $32 million, with an OUP margin of 6.8%\nWe anticipate that Italy will continue to perform exceptionally well in the third quarter, with year-over-year constant currency revenue growth ranging from 20% to 24%\nRevenue in Spain increased by 12% in days-adjusted constant currency compared to the prior year, while revenue in Switzerland grew by 33% in days-adjusted constant currency\nThe Northern Europe segment accounted for 22% of consolidated revenue in the quarter\nRevenue increased by 23% in constant currency to $1.2 billion, driven by growth in all major markets\nOUP accounted for $18 million with a margin of 1.5%.\nThe UK represents our biggest market in Northern Europe, accounting for 37% of segment revenue this quarter.\nUK revenues saw a 30% increase in days-adjusted constant currency during the quarter, including significant new business.\nThe UK's performance in the second quarter continued to surpass 2019 levels.\nWe anticipate ongoing strong growth between 34% and 38% in constant currency year-over-year for the third quarter.\nGermany's revenues rose by 9% in days-adjusted constant currency in the second quarter.\nDespite Germany remaining a challenging market for our industry, we expect to see continued revenue improvement there in the third quarter.\nThe Nordics experienced a 17% revenue growth in days-adjusted constant currency.\nThe Netherlands saw a 9% increase in revenue in days-adjusted constant currency.\nBelgium's days-adjusted revenue grew by 24% in constant currency during the quarter.\nOther Northern European markets experienced a 41% revenue growth in constant currency this quarter.\nThis growth was primarily driven by strong performance in Poland, Russia, and Ireland.\nThe Asia Pacific Middle East segment makes up 12% of the company's total revenue.\nRevenue in this segment grew by 6% in constant currency to $620 million this quarter.\nOUP was $22 million with a margin of 3.6%.\nJapan's revenue increased by 10% in days-adjusted constant currency, showing improvement from the 6% growth rate in the first quarter.\nOur Japan business continues to lead the market in revenue growth, and we expect ongoing mid- to high single-digit revenue growth in the third quarter.\nAustralia's revenues declined by 11% in days-adjusted constant currency.\nOther markets in Asia Pacific Middle East saw a 9% revenue growth in constant currency.\nLet's now discuss cash flow and balance sheet.\nFree cash flow for the first six months of the year was $171 million, compared to $577 million in the same period last year, reflecting significant accounts receivable declines in the prior year.\nDays sales outstanding decreased by almost two days year-over-year to 56 days at the end of the quarter.\nCapital expenditures amounted to $12 million during the quarter.\nWe bought back 432,000 shares of stock for $50 million in the second quarter.\nOur year-to-date stock repurchases total 1.5 million shares for $150 million.\nAs of June 30, we have 1.9 million shares left for repurchase under the 6 million share program approved in August 2019.\nOur balance sheet remained strong at quarter-end with $1.46 billion in cash and $1.09 billion in total debt, resulting in a net cash position of $368 million.\nOur debt ratios at quarter-end show total gross debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA of 1.79 and total debt to total capitalization at 31%.\nThere were no changes to our debt and credit facilities during the quarter.\nOur $600 million revolving credit facility remained unused.\nNow, let's review our outlook for the third quarter of 2021.\nOur guidance assumes no significant additional lockdowns or business restrictions affecting our clients in our major markets beyond those currently in place.\nWe forecast third-quarter earnings per share to be between $1.86 and $1.94, including a positive $0.04 per share impact from foreign currency.\nWe expect constant currency revenue growth to be between 12% and 16%.\nThe midpoint of our constant currency guidance is 14%.\nA slight decrease in billing days and the minor impact of net dispositions in the third quarter slightly affect the growth rate, resulting in an expected organic days-adjusted revenue growth of 15% at the midpoint.\nCompared to pre-crisis levels, this would represent a third-quarter organic constant currency range of 1% to 3% relative to 2019 revenues.\nWe anticipate our third-quarter operating profit margin to improve by 50 basis points at the midpoint compared to last year.\nThis indicates another quarter of strong sequential underlying improvement.\nWe expect the effective tax rate in the third quarter to be 33%.\nBased on our improved earnings mix, we now estimate the full-year effective tax rate to be approximately 33%, a 1% improvement from our previous estimate of 34% provided last quarter.\nAs usual, our guidance doesn't include restructuring charges or additional share repurchases, and we estimate our weighted average shares will be 55.2 million.\nWe continue to invest in technology and are making significant progress on our plans to diversify, digitize, and innovate.\nOur award-winning RPO business within our Talent Solutions brand has been recognized again, scoring highly for our strong tech ecosystem, consulting capabilities, data-driven solutions, and business intelligence.\nThis marks the 11th year we've been named a global leader in RPO in the Everest Group PEAK Matrix Assessment.\nWe've also been named MSP leader for the eighth consecutive year by Everest, recognizing our top position in market impact.\nThey also acknowledged our global leadership in tech, workforce strategies, data-driven approach, and range of solutions, including Right Management and our consulting capabilities.\nI congratulate our Talent Solutions colleagues for our leadership in the RPO and MSP space, which is a crucial part of our diversification strategy to grow higher-margin value business.\nWe continue to rapidly execute our technology and web transformation.\nOur power suite tech stack is helping us enhance our competitive advantage as we move to cloud platforms, improving customer experience while streamlining candidate management.\nOur approach ensures we're always up-to-date, able to integrate with the best tech, and capable of scaling while turning our data into a key asset.\nWe're moving quickly, with 19 market deployments completed and another 16 in progress.\nWe look forward to providing a further update on this at year-end.\nWe're also making significant progress in innovation.\nIn June, we participated in the World Famous Viva Technology Conference in Paris alongside major tech companies.\nAs the conference's only HR partner since its inception five years ago, this was an excellent opportunity to showcase our latest innovations and collaborate with over 30 HR start-ups on using AI, machine learning, and data-driven predictive performance tools.\nCombined with our human expertise, these technologies help us upskill people rapidly and at scale, and match people to jobs more accurately and quickly than either humans or machines could do alone.\nThis approach aims to build a better, brighter future of work through bold, disruptive ideas and collaboration across business, government, and education.\nThis is how we will create sustainable skills, resilient communities, and greater prosperity for all.\nLet's now open the call for Q&A.\nSummary: ",

uniquely positioned to deliver such a result\nIn D&B Europe, our newly acquired Bisnode region, we secured several deals with Global 500 companies as our strategy to become the preferred provider in Central Europe has started to yield results\nBayer, a life science company with over 150 years of history and expertise in healthcare and agriculture, signed a three-year global contract for D&B data across multiple delivery platforms\nThis agreement will support Bayer in organizing and managing their third-party records across various software platforms\nDeutsche Bank signed a new contract to use our local German database to support their sales efforts\nAfter comparing various data and usability factors, they chose D&B over their previous provider, a major international competitor\nWe continue to build and grow relationships with Global 500 companies\nBy the end of the second quarter, nearly three-quarters of Global 500 companies were our clients, a significant increase from around two-thirds at the end of 2019\nWe're expanding our relationships with key clients while also seeing positive growth in smaller markets.\nWe've begun addressing the SMB market innovatively by developing our D&B product and data marketplaces.\nThe D&B product marketplace offers a select range of our solutions and partner products tailored for small businesses.\nThe marketplace now features 20 partners, including recent additions like Brex and LendingTree, alongside established brands such as Microsoft, Comcast Business, AT&T Business, Mastercard, and Symantec.\nUsers can now purchase a wider variety of pre-matched, independent data sets from alternative providers in the D&B Data Marketplace, including commercial real estate, job postings, shipping, healthcare, and U.S. agricultural data.\nBy the end of the second quarter, we had 36 partner data sets, up from 22 at the end of the first quarter.\nRegarding our e-commerce strategy, we're seeing increased interest in our digital offerings.\nIn Q2, dnb.com visits grew to over 46 million, an 84% increase compared to the same quarter last year.\nWhile most visitors come for CreditSignal and monitoring services, we're noticing growing interest in our sales and marketing solutions.\nOur e-commerce sales reached over $2 million in Q2, a 73% increase from last year, and we expect sales to double by the end of Q3.\nWe anticipate that this growth, combined with our D&B Marketplaces, will generate nearly $10 million in additional annual recurring revenue by year-end.\nWe're focusing on introducing new products and use cases as our third priority.\nWe recently launched D&B Rev.Up ABX, a solution that streamlines marketing and sales workflows for our clients.\nSince its introduction, we've secured six deals worth nearly $2 million, with a robust and growing pipeline as awareness increases and new features are added.\nWe're now bringing Rev.Up capabilities to the SMB market with D&B Rev.Up Now, offering enterprise-level digital marketing technology to smaller businesses at an affordable price.\nWe're enhancing our sales and marketing solutions through a partnership with Zeta Global, combining consumer and business data into a secure data cloud with profiles of over 220 million U.S. individuals.\nThis collaboration merges Zeta's B2C data with Dun & Bradstreet's B2B data, creating a comprehensive view of individuals for targeted marketing.\nWe're introducing D&B ESG Intelligence, which provides standardized scores and analytics based on our Data Cloud and established sustainability standards.\nOur ESG rankings cover 12 themes and 32 categories, helping clients understand specific risks and opportunities.\nWe aim to establish a standardized commercial ESG score, similar to how PAYDEX became the standard for commercial credit scores.\nIn our international segment, we're rolling out localized solutions across our markets.\nWe launched 14 new products across Europe, Greater China, and partner markets in Q2, including D&B Finance Analytics, D&B Risk Analytics, and Data Blocks.\nWe've expanded the distribution of D&B Onboard and Direct+ through our worldwide network partners.\nIn Europe, we're seeing good adoption of existing products while introducing new ones in various markets to modernize our offerings and attract new customers.\nOur new product revenue is growing significantly, with the New Product Vitality Index reaching 6% in Q2, up from 0.2% in Q2 2019.\nThe Bisnode integration is progressing well, with synergy realization slightly ahead of expectations.\nWe've achieved over $25 million in annualized savings through Q2 by consolidating functions and optimizing our real estate strategy.\nWe've implemented a new global data framework in D&B Europe markets to improve database quality and consistency.\nWe've made key data improvements in various European markets to enhance customer satisfaction and retention.\nOverall, we're pleased with our ongoing transformation and the foundation we're laying for accelerated growth in the remainder of 2021 and into 2022.\nOur second-quarter 2021 GAAP revenues were $521 million, a 24% increase (23% on a constant-currency basis) compared to the same quarter last year, including a $2 million impact from purchase accounting adjustments.\nThe company's GAAP net loss in Q2 was $52 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, an improvement from the $208 million loss in the same quarter last year.\nThe better performance was mainly due to reduced expenses from debt retirement related to the IPO, lower interest costs, improved operating income from decreased equity-based compensation, and the Bisnode acquisition's impact.\nThese positive factors were somewhat counterbalanced by a higher tax provision in the current year, primarily resulting from changes in state apportionment and the UK's tax rate increase.\nLet's move on to examine our adjusted results for the second quarter on the next slide.\nThe company's total adjusted revenue for Q2 reached $521 million, growing by 24.4% or 23.2% when accounting for constant currency.\nThis year-over-year growth included a 19.9 percentage point contribution from the Bisnode acquisition and a 0.5 point impact from reduced deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments.\nOrganic revenue growth on a constant-currency basis was 2.8%, driven by strong performance in our international segment and moderate growth in North America.\nThe company's total adjusted EBITDA for Q2 was $198 million, an increase of $22 million or 13%.\nExcluding Bisnode's impact, EBITDA showed a slight increase due to revenue growth, partially offset by higher data and processing costs, increased commissions, and elevated public company expenses.\nThe adjusted EBITDA margin for Q2 stood at 38.1%.\nWithout considering Bisnode's impact, the EBITDA margin was 40.8%.\nAdjusted net income for Q2 reached $108 million, or $0.25 per adjusted diluted share, up from $81 million in Q2 2020.\nWe will now discuss the performance of our North America and international segments on the next slide.\nNorth America's Q2 revenue was $357 million, growing by about 1% compared to last year.\nExcluding foreign exchange benefits and Bisnode's negative impact, North America's organic revenue increased by $3.2 million or 1%.\nOur finance and risk solutions continued to show strength, with solid growth in finance solutions due to new business and increased customer spending.\nThis growth was partially offset by a $1 million revenue reduction from the Bisnode transaction.\nSales and marketing revenue decreased by $3.1 million or 2% to $158 million.\nDespite strong data sales, overall growth in this segment was impacted by a $4 million reduction from the Data.com legacy partnership wind-down.\nNorth America's Q2 adjusted EBITDA decreased by $3 million or 2% to $167 million, mainly due to higher data processing costs and commissions, partially counterbalanced by revenue growth and ongoing cost management.\nThe adjusted EBITDA margin for North America was 46.9%.\nLet's move to the next slide to discuss our international segment.\nInternational segment revenue for Q2 increased by 147% to $164 million, or 137% on a constant-currency basis, primarily driven by the Bisnode acquisition and strong growth in both finance and risk and sales and marketing solutions.\nExcluding Bisnode's impact, international revenues grew by approximately 13%.\nFinance and risk revenues rose by 92% to $104 million, or 85% on a constant-currency basis, mainly due to the Bisnode acquisition.\nWithout Bisnode's impact, revenue grew 10% across all markets, including higher Worldwide Network alliance revenue and increased UK market revenue.\nSales and marketing revenues surged by 383% to $60 million, or 366% on a constant-currency basis, primarily due to the Bisnode acquisition.\nExcluding Bisnode, revenue grew 22% due to higher API offering revenues and increased product royalties from Worldwide Network partners.\nInternational adjusted EBITDA for Q2 increased by $23 million or 113% to $43 million, mainly due to Bisnode's impact and revenue growth across international businesses, partially offset by higher data costs.\nThe adjusted EBITDA margin was 26%, or 28.9% excluding Bisnode.\nLet's review our capital structure on the next slide.\nAs of June 30, 2021, we had $178 million in cash and cash equivalents, which, combined with our $850 million revolving credit line, provides total liquidity of about $1 billion.\nOur total debt principal was $3,667 million, with a leverage ratio of 4.7 gross and 4.4 net.\nThe credit facility senior secured net leverage ratio was 3.6.\nNow, let's discuss our full-year 2021 outlook on the next slide.\nWe expect adjusted revenues to remain between $2,145 million and $2,175 million, a 23.25% increase from 2020.\nOrganic constant-currency revenue growth, excluding lower deferred revenues impact, is projected to be 3% to 4.5%.\nAdjusted EBITDA is expected to range from $840 million to $855 million, an 18% to 20% increase.\nAdjusted earnings per share are anticipated to be at the high end of the $1.02 to $1.06 range.\nAdditional details for our outlook include: interest expense of $200-210 million, depreciation and amortization of about $90 million excluding purchase accounting effects, an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 24%, weighted average shares outstanding of about 430 million, and increased capex guidance of $237 million, up from $160 million, due to the purchase of our new global headquarters.\nWe expect organic revenue growth to accelerate throughout the year, with Q3 slightly below the midpoint of our range and Q4 at the high end.\nQ3 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be below the low end of the guidance growth range, similar to Q2, due to timing of certain expenses.\nQ4 adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to be above the high end of the guidance growth range.\nWe are satisfied with our performance in the first half of 2021 and look forward to maintaining strong momentum in both our North America and international segments.\nWe're now ready to take questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:This data can be found on our Investors Relations webpage at investors.\nFor a comprehensive analysis of these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nDuring this call, we'll be discussing non-GAAP financial metrics as outlined by SEC Regulation G, including funds from operations (FFO), core FFO, same-center net operating income, and adjusted EBITDA.\nPlease be aware that management's remarks contain time-sensitive information that may only be accurate as of today, May 6, 2021.\nToday's call will feature Steven Tanger, our Executive Chair; Stephen Yalof, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Williams, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nWe're optimistic about the broader economic outlook over the last three months, with ongoing vaccine distribution and an improving retail landscape, as evidenced by the Consumer Confidence Index reaching its highest point since the pandemic began in late April.\nThe positive trends we're observing in some of our operational metrics highlight the strong value our open-air centers offer to both retailers and customers.\nWe believe that by continuing to implement our strategy effectively, we will set the company up for long-term, sustained growth.\nWe're happy to report that foot traffic at our domestic open-air centers in the first quarter almost matched 2019 levels and surpassed them in April.\nWe've made strides in our key business priorities: leasing, managing, and promoting our outlet centers.\nOur main focus is on increasing occupancy, boosting leasing activity, and refining our product mix to enhance shopper frequency and duration, while also attracting new customers to Tanger Centers.\nAt the end of the quarter, our consolidated portfolio occupancy stood at 91.7%, a slight increase of 20 basis points from the end of 2020.\nThis includes the expected reclamation of 61,000 square feet of space during the quarter due to bankruptcies and company-wide restructurings.\nFor all renewals and re-leased spaces that began during the 12 months ending March 31, 2021, blended average rental rates decreased by 2.8% on a straight-line basis and 8.5% on a cash basis.\nHowever, this represents an improvement of 300 basis points on a cash basis and 390 basis points on a straight-line basis compared to our Q4 2020 reported spreads.\nWe anticipate continued long-term improvement as positive foot traffic and sales trends will support higher rents.\nIn the short term, however, we expect to see ongoing pressure on re-leasing spreads this year as we fill reclaimed spaces that were previously rented at above-average rates for our portfolio.\nWe collected approximately 95% of the contractual fixed rents billed in the first quarter of 2021.\nAs of April 30, 2021, we had collected 96% of the deferred 2020 rents due in the first quarter and 83% of all deferred 2020 rents, leaving a remaining balance of just $3.7 million.\nBased on this collection rate, we're confident in our outlook for future collections.\nThe significant rebound in foot traffic we discussed last quarter has continued.\nIn the first quarter, domestic foot traffic reached 97% of 2019 levels, despite February being affected by severe winter weather and our centers operating 20% fewer hours.\nWe believe comparing to 2019 is more relevant since we began feeling the pandemic's effects in March of last year.\nOur consistently strong foot traffic clearly demonstrates the appeal of our open-air shopping centers, their prime market locations, and the value we offer to both our retail partners and shoppers.\nIt's worth noting that in Canada, where we have two unconsolidated joint venture properties, stores were closed under government mandate until mid-February and are currently closed again due to mandates.\nOver the past 12 months, 280 leases totaling over 1.4 million square feet have commenced.\nAs of March 31, renewals executed or in progress represented 52% of the space set to expire this year, compared to 63% at the same time last year.\nThe slower-than-usual pace reflects our strategic decision to delay some renewal leasing activity as the overall economic and retail environments improve.\nWe continue to strengthen relationships with our traditional tenants and are seeing a measured increase in new leasing activity, with particular interest from higher-end brands.\nOne of our leasing priorities is developing new business with local and regional brands.\nThis program presents exciting chances to introduce novel and engaging ideas to our venues, offering more diverse options for our customers.\nWe are continuously diversifying our tenant portfolio beyond clothing and shoes, expanding into areas such as dining, interactive experiences, home furnishings, kitchenware, sports equipment, and specialty grocers.\nConsequently, we are reconceptualizing the design aspects of our shopping centers.\nIn Grand Rapids, Michigan, we've created an outdoor seating area in a previously underutilized section of our center, connected to a new microbrewery restaurant.\nAt our Hilton Head location, the renowned gourmet grocer, Nantucket Meat & Fish, is currently being built for a Memorial Day grand opening.\nOur collaboration with Fillogic, a logistics-as-a-service platform in Deer Park, has established a 5,000 square foot micro-distribution hub aimed at providing cost-effective and efficient distribution solutions for our retailers and shoppers.\nWe maintain robust pop-up leasing activity, which serves multiple purposes: introducing new brands to the outlet market that may become long-term tenants, revitalizing otherwise vacant spaces, providing variety and more choices for shoppers, generating immediate NOI, and in some cases, maintaining temporary occupancy while we postpone long-term leases for market improvement.\nAs of March 31, 2021, this type of tenancy accounted for approximately 8.6% of our consolidated portfolio's total GLA.\nAlthough higher than previous levels, this approach has proven beneficial to our centers in the past.\nSince joining Tanger a year ago, our main focus has been enhancing our operational efficiency by empowering our local leadership teams to manage leasing, business development, and operational efficiencies at each center.\nThese efforts have been successful, as reflected in our better-than-expected short-term leasing, paid media, and operating expense contributions.\nIncome from non-rental sources, such as paid media and sponsorships, significantly contributed to the Other Revenues line in the first quarter of 2021, resulting in a 14% year-over-year increase.\nWe have decentralized shopping center operations, giving each center's management team responsibility for revenue generation and decision-making authority over operating expenses.\nSimultaneously, we are centralizing certain procurement activities to leverage our organization's scale.\nThe COVID-19 situation has highlighted the importance of meeting customers where they are and creating more personalized experiences.\nOur marketing and digital transformation teams have expanded our virtual shopping options, curbside pickup with interactive capabilities, live stream shopping, and digital pre-shopping on the Tanger app and website.\nOur digital initiatives aim to create highly personalized relationships with users and further build our loyalty base by providing more relevant offers and content to individual shoppers.\nAs our operating strategy evolves, our commitment to environmental, social, and governance efforts remains steadfast.\nIn 2021, we initiated a comprehensive third-party materiality assessment to ensure we are addressing the most important ESG issues for our stakeholders and integrating these issues into our core values.\nOur Board and executive leadership team are engaged in ESG issues affecting the organization, and we are investing time and resources to expand our diversity, equity, and inclusion program.\nWe believe education is crucial to embedding DE&I throughout our culture and are launching unconscious bias training for our senior leadership team, which will be rolled out across the organization.\nWe are also investing in our communities in new ways, including through our newly implemented small business owner outreach initiative.\nThis program offers opportunities for new and existing businesses in our communities to establish themselves in Tanger Centers, supported by our proprietary suite of services to help them incubate and grow.\nIn 2021, we will continue our efforts to streamline ESG reporting to make the data more accessible and easier to navigate for stakeholders.\nTo improve transparency and reporting on our ESG efforts, we will begin implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures during 2021, focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, energy performance, biodiversity, water usage, and waste management.\nThese projects impact the global environment, extend Tanger's environmental efforts beyond our immediate footprint, and provide additional opportunities to engage with our employees, retailers, and shoppers.\nOur team remains focused on returning to sustained growth.\nWe have bolstered our balance sheet and are exploring selective growth opportunities.\nWe are reviving our marketing initiatives for our proposed Nashville project, and as restrictions ease, potential tenants are visiting the site.\nThe advancements we're making in each of our strategic goals assure us that we'll generate long-term value for our investors.\nThe first quarter's results demonstrated ongoing positive momentum but still show the lingering effects of the pandemic, recent bankruptcies, and company-wide restructurings.\nThe core FFO available to common shareholders in the first quarter was $0.40 per share, a decrease from $0.50 per share in the same period last year.\nThe first quarter 2021 core FFO excludes $2.4 million, or $0.02 per share, in general and administrative expenses related to a voluntary retirement plan and other executive severance costs.\nThe consolidated portfolio's same-center NOI declined by 8% for the quarter.\nThis decrease is due to rent adjustments and store closures from recent bankruptcies and company-wide restructurings, partially offset by the reversal of about $1.6 million in reserves related to previously deferred or negotiated rents.\nWe collected approximately 95% of the contractual fixed rents billed in the first quarter of 2021.\nWe're also continuing to collect rent billed for previous periods, including amounts from 2020 that we allowed our tenants to postpone to 2021.\nAs of March 31, 2021, the remaining rental revenue reserves for 2020 rents deferred or under negotiation amounted to $2.6 million.\nAfter implementing our ATM program, we strategically raised capital in March to reduce debt and improve our balance sheet.\nIn the first quarter, we issued 6.9 million common shares, generating $128.7 million in net proceeds at an average price of $19.02 per share.\nWe used the proceeds to reduce $25 million of borrowings from our $350 million unsecured term loan on March 11, 2021, and on April 30, we completed a partial early redemption of $150 million of our 3.875% senior notes due December 2023 for $163 million in cash.\nAfter the redemption, $100 million remains outstanding.\nWe have no major debt maturities until December 2023.\nAs previously announced, we anticipate taking a charge in the second quarter of 2021, currently estimated at about $14.1 million, or $0.14 per share, including a roughly $13 million make-whole premium for the early redemption of the notes and $1.1 million in unamortized debt discount and loan costs.\nThis charge will affect our second quarter net income and FFO but will not impact core FFO.\nWe expect the 2021 net dilutive impact per share to be about $0.12 for net income, $0.18 for FFO, and $0.04 for core FFO.\nThis debt reduction improves our leverage ratio and increases our balance sheet flexibility.\nMaintaining a strong financial position has always been a priority for us.\nWe will maintain our disciplined and cautious approach to capital allocation.\nBesides dividend distributions necessary to maintain REIT status, our main uses of capital include investing in our portfolio to increase NOI, reducing leverage to pre-COVID levels over time, and considering selective growth opportunities in the long term.\nOur outlook for 2021 remains the same.\nAlthough we're encouraged by our progress, we still anticipate pressure from current vacancies, potential additional store closures, and rent modifications.\nAs mentioned in our fourth quarter earnings call, we expect store closures in 2021 related to bankruptcies and company-wide restructurings to total about 200,000 square feet, including the 61,000 square feet we reclaimed during the first quarter.\nMost of the recapture should happen in the first half of the year.\nAdditionally, our guidance assumes no further domestic government-mandated shutdowns and anticipates lease termination fees to decrease by $9 million to $10 million, or $0.09 to $0.10 per share, from the elevated level we saw in 2020.\nBased on our current outlook, we still expect core FFO per share for 2021 to be between $1.47 and $1.57.\nWe are maintaining this guidance despite the previously discussed $0.04 dilutive impact.\nFor more details on our key assumptions, please refer to our release issued yesterday evening.\nWe can now take our first question.\nSummary: ",

refer to our 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.\nNet income reconciliations can be found in the supplemental package submitted to the SEC and accessible on our website.\nWe enhanced customer relationships with $156 million in new bookings, achieving record results in both the 0-1 megawatt and over 1 megawatt categories, concluding the year with $500 million in new bookings, a 15% increase from the previous year.\nDespite ongoing pandemic and global supply chain challenges, we continued to improve our global platform by completing organic development projects in various metros and making strategic investments, establishing Digital Realty as the leading pan-African provider.\nWe had a strong financial quarter with full-year results exceeding the upper end of the guidance range provided last year at this time.\nWe further reinforced our balance sheet by raising equity capital through the creation of Digital Core REIT in a highly successful IPO on the Singapore Stock Exchange and the related sale of a 90% interest in 10 fully utilized core data centers.\nAs ongoing capital partners, Digital Realty and Digital Core REIT can continue their collaboration while offering customers a seamless experience.\nOur strategy for long-term value creation is based on a global, connected, and sustainable framework.\nWe made additional progress in each area during the fourth quarter.\nWe continued to expand our global business with record worldwide bookings and strong performance across all regions and product types, including quarterly highs in both our sub-1 megawatt and over 1 megawatt categories.\nWe also announced two major global initiatives.\nIn December, we announced the successful listing of Digital Core REIT as an independent publicly traded company on the Singapore Stock Exchange.\nThe company is valued at $1.4 billion with a 4.25% cap rate and includes properties in the U.S. and Canada.\nWe obtained over $950 million in net proceeds from the transaction and maintained a 35% equity stake in the publicly traded REIT.\nThe offering was well-received, and Digital Core REIT's stock has increased by approximately 30% since the IPO, enhancing the value of our remaining ownership share.\nIn addition to providing investors with a stable cash flow from high-quality core data centers, Digital Core REIT offers key strategic advantages to Digital Realty.\nDigital Core REIT is a long-term capital partner with an extended investment horizon and a global mandate to invest in stable, income-producing data centers.\nDigital Core REIT has been carefully designed to ensure a seamless customer experience.\nDigital Realty sponsors and externally manages Digital Core REIT.\nWe will continue to manage the properties, maintaining the same level of operational excellence, and will earn fees for asset and property management, as well as acquisitions, dispositions, and development.\nFrom a customer's perspective, there are no changes when we contribute an asset to Digital Core REIT.\nDigital Core REIT is an ideal partner vehicle for Digital Realty.\nWe anticipate contributing additional stabilized core assets to Digital Core REIT in the future and may also co-invest alongside Digital Core REIT in future investment activities.\nOur interests are aligned, as Digital Realty will maintain a 10% direct ownership stake in each asset, in addition to 35% in the publicly traded vehicle.\nDigital Core REIT is led by two long-standing Digital Realty team members, John Stewart, who is well-known to most of you, and Dan Tith.\nWe are enthusiastic about their opportunity to create value for Digital Core REIT unitholders, including Digital Realty.\nOur second global initiative, announced shortly after the quarter's end, is the definitive agreement to acquire approximately a 55% stake in Teraco, Africa's leading carrier-neutral colocation provider.\nThis acquisition immediately establishes Digital Realty as the leading colocation and interconnection provider on the rapidly growing African continent and builds upon our previous investments in Africa with iColo in Kenya and Mozambique, and Medallion in Nigeria.\nTeraco complements these investments and our highly connected facilities in the Mediterranean by hosting key strategic landing points for subsea cables surrounding Africa.\nFrom Marseille and Athens in the north, Mombasa and Maputo in the east, Durban and Cape Town in the south, and Lagos on the west coast, PlatformDIGITAL supports our customers' growth and the broader digital transformation of the entire African continent.\nTeraco operates seven state-of-the-art data centers across three key metros in South Africa and serves over 600 customers, including more than 275 connectivity providers, over 25 cloud and content platforms, and approximately 300 enterprises.\nTeraco facilitates about 22,000 interconnections between customers, hosts seven cloud on-ramps, and provides direct access to seven subsea cables.\nTeraco has consistently generated strong double-digit growth in revenue and EBITDA.\nAdditionally, more than half of Teraco's operational portfolio was developed within the past two years.\nThe current development pipeline will expand the existing asset base by over 25%.\nTeraco owns land adjacent to its highly connected campuses in Johannesburg and Cape Town that can support doubling the current capacity, representing significant potential for embedded growth and providing substantial runway to support our customers' expansion.\nMajor global cloud and content platforms have recently begun making significant investments in Africa, given the existing capacity within the operational portfolio, the additional capacity currently under construction, and the strategic land holdings to support future expansion.\nTeraco is uniquely positioned to support the anticipated growth of digital infrastructure in Africa over the coming years.\nLet's examine our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3.\nDuring the fourth quarter, Digital Realty received Nareit's Leader in the Light Award for the fifth consecutive year, complementing the company's five-star GRESB rating and top ranking in the technology and science sector.\nDigital Realty was also recognized as one of America's Most Responsible Companies by Newsweek and was the highest-ranked data center company.\nWe continue to advance our sustainable financing strategy by recasting and increasing our credit facility with improved terms, incorporating a sustainability-linked pricing component that adjusts based on annual performance against specific green targets.\nWe are dedicated to minimizing our environmental impact while meeting the needs of our customers, investors, employees, and broader society, as well as advancing our goal of delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders.\nLet's examine our investment activities on the fourth page.\nWe are continuing to expand our worldwide infrastructure.\nBesides the Teraco deal, we have increased our presence on Africa's East Coast with iColo and enhanced our acquisition of Medallion data centers in Nigeria by purchasing two plots in Lagos for future expansion.\nIn the coming ten years, we anticipate significant opportunities for international businesses to tap into Africa's rapidly expanding internet economy, with Digital Realty uniquely positioned to facilitate this growth.\nWe are also investing in the organic expansion of our platform.\nThe fourth quarter saw us invest $580 million in growth capital expenditure, our largest quarterly growth capex investment so far.\nWe currently have 44 ongoing projects, totaling over 250 megawatts of IT capacity across 27 global metros.\nBy year-end, 46% of this capacity was pre-sold.\nGeographically, our heaviest investment continues to be in EMEA, with 27 ongoing projects totaling over 140 megawatts across 16 metros.\nIn the Asia Pacific region, we completed several development projects during the fourth quarter, including facilities in Singapore and Hong Kong.\nWe launched Digital Seoul 1 in January, our first data center in South Korea and the country's first carrier-neutral facility.\nThis facility will function as a connectivity hub for latency-sensitive customer workloads, while also connecting to hyperscale applications hosted in our second Korean facility, which has over 60 megawatts of capacity currently under construction just outside the city center.\nThe two facilities will be linked by fiber to create a connected campus, complementing each other by offering solutions for the entire customer spectrum, from small performance-sensitive colocation customers to massive hyperscale deployments.\nIn North America, our development pipeline is diverse in both product mix and geography, with projects underway in seven different markets.\nWe continue to observe strong hyperscale demand in Hillsboro, while expanding in Downtown Atlanta to introduce additional colocation capacity at one of the most highly connected locations in the Southeastern United States.\nWe are bringing capacity online in both these markets, among others, given the strong demand backdrop and our tightening inventory position.\nLet's consider the macro environment on Page 5.\nWe are fortunate to operate in a business tied to secular demand drivers.\nOur leadership position provides us with a unique perspective to identify global secular trends as they emerge on platformDIGITAL.\nOur customers continue to address some of the most complex IT infrastructure connectivity and data integration challenges.\nWe are observing a growing trend of multinational companies across all segments, deploying and connecting large, private data infrastructure footprints on PlatformDIGITAL across multiple global regions and metros.\nIndustry research firm Gartner recently updated their global IT spending forecast for 2022, projecting a 5.1% increase to $4.5 trillion, driven by companies investing in digital data growth strategies.\nGartner also predicts that by 2024, 75% of organizations will have deployed multiple data hubs to drive mission-critical data analytics sharing and governance in support of digital data growth strategies.\nThese forecasts align with our view of future trends.\nOur market intelligence tool, the Data Gravity Index, predicts similar growth in the intensity of data creation and its gravitational pull on global IT infrastructure.\nAdditionally, our industry manifesto, \"Enabling Connected Data Communities,\" serves as the global playbook for industry collaboration to address data gravity challenges directly and unlock a new era of growth opportunities for all companies.\nFrost & Sullivan recently named Digital Realty as the Company of the Year for North American data center best practices.\nThis recognition reflects our ongoing focus on operational excellence, underpinned by continuous innovation and execution of the PlatformDIGITAL roadmap.\nWe are honored by the strong validation of the differentiated value proposition we are creating for customers and partners.\nGiven the resilience of the demand drivers underpinning our business, and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe we are well-positioned to continue delivering sustainable growth for customers, shareholders, and employees, regardless of what the macro environment may bring.\nLet's examine our leasing activity on Page 7.\nAs Bill mentioned, we achieved record bookings of $156 million with an $11 million contribution from interconnection during the fourth quarter.\nVolume was high across both of our primary reporting categories in the quarter, with a healthy mix between enterprise and hyperscale business.\nFor the full year, we booked $0.5 billion of new business with roughly a 60-40 split between greater than 1 megawatt and less than 1 megawatt plus interconnection.\nThe EMEA region had a particularly strong quarter, accounting for approximately 60% of total bookings, led by Frankfurt with outstanding performance across product types.\nThe fourth quarter was also notable for the strength of cross-selling between regions.\nNearly 30% of our sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection bookings were exported from one region to another, a strong indication of the value customers derive from our global platform.\nUnsurprisingly, the Americas was our biggest exporter with most deals landing in EMEA, followed by APAC.\nBoth EMEA and APAC had strong export quarters as well, with over 15% of their sub-1-megawatt plus interconnection bookings landing out of region.\nThe weighted average lease term was nearly 10 years, primarily driven by hyperscale pre-leasing in EMEA.\nWe acquired over 130 new logos during the fourth quarter, our second-best quarterly result and just shy of last quarter's record 140 for our full year total of 480 new logos.\nWe are encouraged by the consistent organic growth of our customer base, and we view these results as strong validation of platform digital and our global strategy.\nRegarding specific wins during the quarter and around the world, Graphcore, a British semiconductor company that develops accelerators and systems for AI and machine learning, chose PlatformDIGITAL to address their density, security, and scale requirements.\nThe initial deployment will be in Amsterdam, followed by a global rollout, and we are also collaborating on solution engineering and joint go-to-market activities.\nA leading high-frequency trading firm is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL to extend their high-performance computing platform across two continents and expand trading into two new international metros, while improving cloud access and business continuity in the United States.\nA Global 2000 U.S. energy provider is expanding with Digital Realty, consolidating their own on-premise facilities and using PlatformDIGITAL to scale their business across multiple metros.\nA prominent aerospace company is growing its presence on PlatformDIGITAL, utilizing robust interconnections to facilitate data exchange across four new regions.\nA major insurance brokerage firm is streamlining its data center operations and has chosen PlatformDIGITAL to eliminate data gravity obstacles and connect with cloud services in multiple metropolitan areas.\nAn Ivy League university is expanding its use of PlatformDIGITAL to transition away from its on-site facility and improve its connectivity with the healthcare provider network for data sharing.\nA leading food services company in the Asia-Pacific region has opted for PlatformDIGITAL to enhance cloud connectivity and take advantage of local data exchange hubs in Japan.\nThe current backlog of signed but not yet active leases increased from $330 million to $378 million, as our record-breaking fourth quarter signings outpaced commencements.\nThe gap between lease signings and commencements was exceptionally long at nearly 14 months, primarily due to long-term leases on recent development projects in EMEA as customers rushed to secure long-term growth opportunities amid diminishing inventory.\nWe finalized $151 million worth of lease renewals in the fourth quarter, in addition to the record-breaking new leases signed.\nThe average lease duration for renewals signed during the fourth quarter was close to four years.\nRenewal rates decreased by 4%, influenced by a few large deals in North America where negative releasing spreads on renewals over 1 megawatt outweighed the positive spreads on renewals under 1 megawatt.\nOverall portfolio occupancy decreased by 60 basis points, almost entirely due to newly completed development projects that became operational during the quarter.\nSame capital cash NOI growth was negative 6.6% in the fourth quarter, mainly due to customer turnover in North America and increased property operating and net utilities expenses.\nThe U.S. dollar strengthened during the fourth quarter compared to the previous year's exchange rates, resulting in a roughly 130 basis point negative impact on our year-over-year growth in reported results across all financial metrics.\nWe mitigate currency risk by issuing debt in local currencies as a natural hedge, limiting our economic exposure to currency fluctuations to only our net assets within a given region.\nIn addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also reduce interest rate risk by proactively converting short-term variable rate debt into longer-term fixed rate financing.\nGiven our strategy of aligning the duration of our long-term assets with long-term fixed-rate debt, a 100 basis point change in base rates would have approximately a 50 basis point impact on our full year FFO per share.\nOur short-term funding and refinancing risk is well-managed with a diverse range of public and private capital sources available to support the growth of our business.\nFourth quarter core FFO per share increased by 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, driven by strong operational performance, cost management, and reduced financing costs due to proactive balance sheet management over the past 12 months.\nFor the full year, core FFO per share grew by 5% year-over-year and exceeded the upper limit of our initial guidance range by $0.03, which did not account for the contribution of $1.4 billion in assets through Digital Core REIT in early December.\nWe anticipate core FFO per share for 2022 to be between $6.80 and $6.90, including the 1% dilution from Teraco and an expected 100 to 200 basis point headwind from foreign exchange due to the strength of the dollar compared to 2021.\nWe expect to generate revenue between $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion in 2022 and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.5 billion.\nGiven the tight supply environment, we anticipate flat cash renewal rates in 2022, an improvement from slightly negative rates in 2021.\nWe expect overall portfolio occupancy to remain within the current range despite significant new capacity scheduled to come online during the year and the potential for lease-up within the Teraco portfolio.\nWe have made a strong start on our financing plans for the year with a highly successful 750 million bond offering in early January, consisting of 10.5-year paper at a 1.375% coupon.\nWe plan to raise $500 million to $1 billion through capital recycling, either through contributions to Digital Core REIT, sales of non-core assets to third parties, or a combination of both.\nRegarding the quarterly dividend, the distribution policy is ultimately decided by the board. Given the continued growth in our cash flows and taxable income, we anticipate continued growth in the per-share dividend, as we have seen each year since our IPO in 2004.\nAs of year-end, our reported leverage ratio was 6.1 times, while fixed charge coverage was 5.4 times. After accounting for the settlement of the $1 billion September forward equity offering, leverage decreases to 5.7 times, and fixed charge coverage improves to 5.7 times.\nWe continue to implement our financial strategy of maximizing available capital options while minimizing related costs and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets.\nWe restructured our credit facility during the fourth quarter, increasing it from $2.35 billion to $3 billion, extending the maturity by three years, and reducing pricing by 5 basis points.\nWe also incorporated a sustainability-linked pricing component subject to adjustment based on annual performance targets, further demonstrating our commitment to sustainable business practices.\nAfter the quarter ended, we raised approximately $850 million from 10.5-year euro bonds at a 1.375% coupon and used part of the proceeds to redeem all $450 million of our outstanding 4.75% U.S. dollar bonds due in 2025.\nOur weighted average debt maturity is over six years, and our weighted average coupon is just above 2%.\nApproximately three-quarters of our debt is denominated in non-U.S. currencies, reflecting the growth of our global platform while also serving as a natural foreign exchange hedge for our investments outside the U.S.\n94% of our debt is fixed-rate, protecting against a rising interest rate environment, and 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing maximum flexibility for capital recycling.\nWe have a clear runway with minimal near-term debt maturities and no excessively large repayments in future years.\nOur balance sheet is prepared to withstand economic challenges while also positioned to support growth opportunities for our customers worldwide, in line with our long-term financing strategy.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Furthermore, we examine alternative financial indicators such as core funds from operations (core FFO), adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), and net debt to recurring EBITDA.\nI'm delighted to announce that we reached a record investment volume of about $1.1 billion in the first three quarters of 2021, with continued progress as we enter the final quarter of the year.\nAlthough replicating this investment volume demonstrates our talented team's efforts, I'm most impressed by the exceptional quality of our investments made in a challenging climate.\nWhile our investment activities have further enhanced our top-tier retail portfolio, we've also strengthened our robust balance sheet with $1.5 billion in capital markets transactions year-to-date, positioning our company for dynamic growth in the coming quarters.\nSignificantly, we completed our first preferred equity offering in the third quarter, raising $175 million at a 4.25% coupon.\nThis represents the lowest non-PSA REIT preferred equity coupon ever recorded and provides a new source of perpetual capital for our rapidly expanding company.\nIn the third quarter, we invested approximately $343 million in 83 high-quality retail net lease properties across our three external growth platforms, with 80 of these properties sourced through our acquisition platform, representing an acquisition volume exceeding $340 million.\nThe 80 properties acquired during the third quarter are leased to 49 tenants operating in 20 distinct retail sectors, including top performers in off-price retail, convenience stores, tire and auto service, home improvement, auto parts, grocery, and general merchandise.\nThe acquired properties have a weighted average cap rate of 6.2% and a weighted average lease term of 10.7 years.\nAs noted, in the first nine months of the year, we've invested a record $1.1 billion in 226 retail net lease properties across 40 states and 26 retail sectors.\nWhile increasing the lower end of our acquisition guidance for the year to $1.3 billion, our careful and disciplined approach is evident in the nearly one-third of annualized base rents acquired year-to-date derived from ground lease assets and roughly 70% of annualized base rents acquired coming from leading investment-grade retailers.\nThis past quarter, we executed several unique transactions, including our third Amazon Fresh store in Illinois.\nWe're thrilled about the opportunity to add another Amazon Fresh store to our portfolio, located in a prominent Chicago suburb with median household incomes of $110,000 and a daytime population of approximately 225,000 within a 5-mile radius.\nOur acquisition team continues to uncover attractive ground lease opportunities.\nDuring the quarter, we completed the acquisition of a 9-property portfolio of Thorntons Convenience Stores for about $21 million.\nThe stores, which pay an average annual rent of only $120,000 per year and have a weighted average lease term of nearly 20 years, are all well-situated in the Nashville and Chicago MSAs.\nShortly after agreeing to purchase this portfolio, BP announced they're assuming full ownership of the Thorntons convenience store chain after 2.5 years as part of a joint venture established in 2019.\nThis transaction makes BP, rated A-minus by S&P, one of the leading convenience store operators in the Midwest with over 200 stores across six states.\nOther notable ground lease acquisitions during the quarter include a Walmart and Sam's Club in Lansing, Michigan, two Lowe's Stores in Wallingford, Connecticut and Abington, Massachusetts, and a CVS in Springfield, Massachusetts.\nWe have acquired 73 ground leases year-to-date for a total investment of nearly $350 million, representing almost 31% of acquisition spend for the entire year.\nThis includes 28 ground leases during the third quarter, representing an investment volume of over $108 million.\nAs of September 30, our ground lease exposure reached a record of nearly 14% of annualized base rents.\nThe ground lease portfolio now derives approximately 87% from investment-grade tenants and has a weighted average lease term of 12.1 years, with an average rent of less than $10 per square foot.\nThis portfolio continues to offer an extremely attractive risk-adjusted investment for our shareholders.\nRecent earnings calls and discussions have included considerable dialogue regarding our ground lease portfolio and its valuation.\nThis presents a compelling comparison when considering the value of our ground lease portfolio, which has a weighted average credit rating of BBB plus, over two years of additional term compared to the Bloomberg BBB index, and internal growth of nearly 1%.\nAs of September 30, our portfolio's total investment-grade exposure was approximately 67%, representing close to a 100 basis point year-over-year increase.\nOver a two-year period, our investment grade exposure has enhanced by approximately 10 percentage points.\nWe continue to discover promising opportunities with our retail partners in our Development and Partner Capital Solutions program.\nDuring the initial three quarters of the year, we had seven development and PCS projects either finished or in progress, representing a total committed capital of about $40 million.\nI'm happy to report that we began construction on our third development with Gerber Collision in New Port Richey, Florida, during the quarter.\nUpon completion, Gerber will enter into a new 15-year lease, with rent expected to start in the second quarter of 2022.\nIn the third quarter, construction progressed on two development and PCS projects with an estimated cost slightly exceeding $5 million.\nThese projects include our inaugural 7-Eleven development in Saginaw, Michigan, and a Gerber Collision in Pooler, Georgia.\nWe are committed to utilizing our three external growth strategies and unique asset management capabilities to broaden our relationships with top-tier retailers, offering comprehensive solutions that support their real estate strategies and expansion plans.\nWhile we continue to enhance our premium retail portfolio through record investment activity, we remained active in property sales during the third quarter.\nWe continue to decrease our exposure to franchise restaurants and non-core tenants by selling three properties for total gross proceeds of about $11.8 million at a weighted average cap rate of 6.3%.\nAs of September 30, we have sold 13 properties for gross proceeds just over $48 million and are maintaining our disposition guidance of $50 million to $75 million for the year.\nStrengthened by the recent addition of David Darling as our Vice President of Real Estate, the asset management team continues to carefully address upcoming lease expirations.\nTheir efforts have reduced our 2021 expirations to just four leases, representing 0.1% of annualized base rents.\nDuring the third quarter, we executed new leases, extensions, or options on approximately 72,000 square feet of gross leasable area.\nIn the first nine months of the year, we executed new leases, extensions, or options on about 347,000 square feet of gross leasable space.\nOur 2022 lease expirations are minimal, with only 19 leases expiring, representing less than 1% of annualized base rents over the next year.\nAs of September 30, our growing retail portfolio comprised 1,338 properties across 47 states, including 162 ground leases, and remains virtually fully occupied at 99.6%.\nFor long-time followers of our company, this reduction in Walgreens exposure is a significant achievement, considering our historical exposure once approached 40% of our portfolio.\nWe have made a deliberate effort to adjust our pharmacy exposure given the high per square foot rental rates of many older pharmacy leases and the evolving strategies of CVS and Walgreens in a rapidly changing landscape.\nMany of you are familiar with Mike, as he most recently served as Chairman of the US Real Estate, Gaming and Lodging Investment Banking Practice at Jefferies.\nThroughout his career, Mike has raised over $50 billion in capital through numerous transactions.\nHaving worked with Mike for many years, I am very excited to leverage his unique perspectives and experiences as our company continues to grow and evolve dynamically.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Peter to discuss our financial results for the quarter.\nCore funds from operations for the third quarter was $0.92 per share, representing a 13% increase compared to the same period last year.\nAdjusted funds from operations per share for the quarter grew 11.5% year-over-year to $0.89.\nAs a reminder, treasury stock is included in our diluted share count before settlement if and when ADC stock trades above the deal price of our outstanding forward equity offerings.\nThe total dilutive impact related to these offerings was approximately half a cent in the third quarter.\nAs we've stated in recent discussions, we anticipate achieving high single-digit growth in full-year AFFO per share earnings.\nFollowing our 6% AFFO per share increase in 2020, this suggests a cumulative two-year growth in the mid-teens range.\nWe believe this level of per-share growth is highly attractive when considered alongside our robust portfolio and extremely stable financial position.\nThis steady and dependable earnings expansion continues to enable an increasing and well-supported dividend.\nIn the third quarter, we announced monthly cash dividends of $0.217 per common share for July, August, and September.\nOn a yearly basis, these monthly dividends represent an 8.5% increase compared to the annualized dividend from the same quarter last year.\nDespite significantly raising the common dividend over the past year, we maintained conservative payout ratios in the third quarter, with 71% of core FFO per share and 70% of AFFO per share, respectively.\nAfter the quarter ended, we further increased the monthly cash dividend by 4.6% to $0.227 per common share for October.\nThis monthly dividend translates to an annual dividend of $2.72 per share, a 9.8% increase over the $2.48 per share annual dividend from the fourth quarter of 2020.\nOver a two-year period, this represents cumulative annualized dividend growth exceeding 15%.\nThird-quarter general and administrative expenses, which were affected by recent changes in the company's executive leadership, amounted to $5.7 million.\nG&A expenses were 6.5% of total revenue, or 6% when excluding the non-cash amortization of above and below-market lease intangibles.\nAlthough we continue to invest in personnel and systems to support our dynamic and expanding business, we still expect G&A as a percentage of total revenue to be approximately 7% for the full year 2021.\nThis estimate excludes the impact of lease intangible amortization on total revenues.\nAs noted in the previous quarter, G&A expenses for our acquisitions team vary based on the year's acquisition volume, and our current G&A expense projection reflects an acquisition volume within our revised guidance range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion.\nThe total income tax expense for the third quarter was about $390,000, slightly lower than anticipated due to a one-time refund.\nWe still expect the total income tax expense for 2021 to be close to $2.5 million.\nRegarding our capital markets activities for the quarter, as Joey mentioned, we completed our first preferred equity offering in September, raising $175 million in gross proceeds at a record-low coupon of 4.25%.\nThis favorable offering demonstrates our ability to strategically access another source of capital to support our company's continued growth.\nDuring the third quarter, we entered into forward sale agreements through our ATM program to sell approximately 367,000 shares of common stock, expecting to generate net proceeds of about $27 million.\nWe also settled nearly 886,000 shares under forward ATM sale agreements during the quarter, receiving net proceeds of approximately $56 million.\nAt the end of the quarter, we had about 3.4 million shares remaining to be settled under existing forward sale agreements, which are expected to raise over $226 million in net proceeds upon settlement.\nIncluding the settlement of our outstanding forward equity, our strengthened balance sheet stood at approximately 3.7 times net debt to recurring EBITDA.\nExcluding the impact of our unsettled forward equity, our net debt to recurring EBITDA was about 4.4 times.\nWhen including our recent preferred equity offering in net debt, this adds roughly half a turn of leverage to our net debt to recurring EBITDA metrics.\nAs of September 30, total debt to enterprise value was just under 25%, while our fixed charge coverage increased to a record 5.1 times.\nWith full availability under our revolving credit facility and nearly $830 million in total liquidity, we have substantial flexibility to execute our growth plans.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We will examine the financial outcomes for the third quarter of 2021 and offer insights into significant business trends for Bio-Rad.\nJoining me on the call are several key executives including our CEO, CFO, COO, and the presidents of our Life Science and Clinical Diagnostics divisions.\nOur actual outcomes may significantly differ from these projections and expectations, and the full impact and length of the COVID-19 crisis remains uncertain.\nIn our discussion today, we will reference non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share, which are financial metrics not defined under standard accounting practices.\nI now hand over the call to our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Ilan Daskal.\nBefore delving into the specifics of the third quarter, I'd like our Chief Operating Officer, Andy Last, to provide an update on Bio-Rad's operations given the current global pandemic situation.\nAnnette has significantly contributed to the growth of the Life Science Group and Bio-Rad through her efforts and leadership, and the company has initiated a search for her replacement, with updates to be provided in the coming months.\nI'd like to briefly review our current operational status worldwide.\nAs we enter our seventh consecutive quarter operating during the COVID pandemic, I'll keep my comments brief since we've established a routine with embedded safety measures for employees.\nDuring Q3, we observed improved demand in both life science and diagnostic markets across all regions.\nThe supply chain issues mentioned in our Q2 call have continued, particularly regarding the supply and cost of plastic materials, electronic components, and increased shipping expenses.\nSo far, we've managed to balance supply and demand through careful planning.\nHowever, we anticipate these supply constraints to persist through the end of the year and into 2022, making it increasingly challenging to fully meet customer demand.\nDue to the COVID-19 Delta variant, we've postponed our return to workplace date for U.S. employees until early November.\nIn Q3, we implemented a mandatory vaccination policy for all U.S. employees and are very satisfied with the outcome of this decision.\nWe believe we're upholding our commitment to providing a safe work environment for all our staff.\nAs we move into Q4, we expect a sequential decrease in COVID-related demand for our products.\nOverall, we believe most of our end markets are nearing normal operations, though we acknowledge that COVID will continue to present dynamic market challenges.\nI'll now review the third quarter results.\nThird quarter 2021 net sales were $747 million, a 15.4% increase compared to $647.3 million in Q3 2020.\nExcluding currency effects, sales grew by 13.8%.\nThe Q3 sales include a $32 million settlement for past royalties from 10 times.\nWithout this settlement, the Q3 year-over-year currency-neutral revenue growth was 9%.\nGeographically, we saw strong currency-neutral growth in the Americas and Asia, while Europe experienced a slight decline due to tough comparisons with COVID-related sales from the previous year.\nWe estimate COVID-19-related sales were approximately $57 million this quarter, as we continue to benefit from demand spikes in areas experiencing new outbreaks.\nLife Science Group sales in Q3 2021 were $373.5 million, up from $324 million in Q3 2020, representing a 15.3% increase on a reported basis and a 13.9% increase excluding currency effects.\nExcluding the $32 million royalty settlement, the core Life Science business grew 4.1% on a currency-neutral basis compared to Q3 2020.\nThe third quarter's year-over-year sales growth was primarily driven by increased sales of Droplet Digital PCR products, and excluding COVID-related sales, our core qPCR business also saw significant growth due to strong adoption of our new CFX Opus platform.\nProcess Media, which can vary quarterly, experienced strong double-digit growth compared to the same quarter last year.\nExcluding Process Media sales and the $32 million royalty settlement, the underlying Life Science business declined 2% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q3 2020 due to lower COVID-related sales.\nWhen also excluding COVID-related sales, Life Science year-over-year currency-neutral revenue growth was 21.8%.\nThe biopharma market has exhibited robust expansion for our Droplet Digital PCR platform.\nWe are witnessing consistent uptake of ddPCR in wastewater solutions, bolstered by government funding for public health laboratories.\nLife Science sales, adjusted for currency fluctuations, increased year-over-year in the Americas and Asia, but decreased in Europe.\nEuropean region revenue showed a double-digit increase compared to the previous year when COVID-related sales were excluded.\nThe Clinical Diagnostics Group's sales in Q3 reached $372.2 million, up from $322.2 million in Q3 2020, representing a 15.5% increase on a reported basis and a 13.7% increase when adjusted for currency fluctuations.\nAll product lines within the Diagnostics Group experienced growth during the third quarter.\nThe year-over-year increase was attributed to the recovery of routine testing, which is nearing normal levels, except for blood typing, which is recovering more slowly.\nThe Diagnostics Group's sales, adjusted for currency fluctuations, showed double-digit growth across all regions year-over-year.\nThe reported gross margin for Q3 2021 was 58.6% on a GAAP basis, compared to 56.7% in Q3 2020.\nThe improvement in Q3 2021 gross margin was primarily due to settlement payments and our initiatives to enhance productivity and efficiency.\nAmortization costs related to previous acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold were $4.7 million, compared to $4.8 million in Q3 2020.\nSG&A expenses for Q3 2021 totaled $216.2 million or 28.9% of sales, compared to $198.2 million or 30.6% in Q3 2020.\nThe increase in SG&A spending was primarily due to employee-related expenses.\nTotal amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.4 million, compared to $2.3 million in Q3 2020.\nResearch and development expenses in Q3 were $64.5 million or 8.6% of sales, compared to $59.5 million or 9.2% of sales in Q3 2020.\nQ3 operating income was $156.8 million or 21% of sales, compared to $109.6 million or 16.9% of sales in Q3 2020.\nThe change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $4.869 billion of income to the reported results, primarily related to holdings of Sartorius AG shares.\nInterest and other income resulted in a net expense of $3.2 million during the quarter, mainly due to foreign exchange losses, compared to $5.5 million of expense last year.\nThe effective tax rate for Q3 2021 was 21.8%, compared to 21.9% for the same period in 2020.\nThe tax rates for both periods were influenced by the substantial unrealized gain in equity securities.\nReported net income for Q3 was $3.928 billion, with diluted earnings per share of $129.96.\nThis increase from the previous year is largely attributed to changes in the valuation of Sartorius holdings.\nWe will now discuss the non-GAAP results.\nIn our non-GAAP analysis, we have excluded certain unusual and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margin, as well as other income.\nIn the non-GAAP results for Q3, we have excluded $32 million in sales related to the 10 times legal settlement.\nIn cost of goods sold, we have excluded $4.7 million for amortization of purchased intangibles, $4.1 million in IP license costs associated with the debt royalty payment, and a small restructuring cost.\nThese exclusions resulted in a non-GAAP gross margin of 57.9% for Q3 2021, compared to 57.5% in Q3 2020.\nNon-GAAP SG&A in Q3 2021 was 29.6%, versus 29.4% in Q3 2020.\nIn the non-GAAP SG&A calculations, we have excluded $2.4 million for amortization of purchased intangibles, $2.3 million in legal-related expenses, and a small restructuring and acquisition-related benefit.\nNon-GAAP R&D expense in Q3 2021 was 9%, compared to 9.2% in Q3 2020.\nIn the non-GAAP R&D calculations, we have excluded a small restructuring cost.\nThe combined effect of these non-GAAP adjustments leads to a shift in the quarterly operating margin from 21% using GAAP standards to 19.4% using non-GAAP methods.\nThis non-GAAP operating margin is comparable to the 18.8% non-GAAP operating margin observed in the third quarter of 2020.\nWe have omitted certain items below the operating line, including the $4.869 billion increase in Sartorius equity holdings value and approximately $2 million in losses related to venture investments.\nThe non-GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 2021 was 18%, down from 22.5% in the same period of 2020.\nThe lower rate in 2021 was primarily due to the geographical distribution of earnings.\nFurthermore, the effective tax rate decreased because of a rise in tax deductions related to compensation.\nNon-GAAP net income for Q3 2021 reached $112.2 million, or $3.71 per diluted share, up from $90.3 million and $3 per share in Q3 2020.\nLet's examine the balance sheet.\nAt the end of Q3, total cash and short-term investments amounted to $1.343 billion, an increase from $1.167 billion at the close of Q2 2021.\nWe did not repurchase any of our stock during the third quarter.\nIn Q3 2021, net cash generated from operating activities totaled $230.4 million, an improvement from $135.7 million in Q3 2020.\nThis increase is largely attributable to higher operating profits.\nAfter the quarter ended, we finalized the acquisition of Dropworks for about $125 million in cash.\nDropworks is creating a droplet-based digital PCR system that may offer a more economical solution to simplify the digital PCR workflow for life science research and diagnostic applications.\nWe anticipate that Dropworks will expedite Bio-Rad's entry into the lower-end segment of the digital PCR market and enable expansion in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion qPCR segment, significantly broadening the potential for our ddPCR platforms.\nThe adjusted EBITDA for Q3 2021 was 23.1% of sales.\nIn comparison, the adjusted EBITDA for Q3 2020 was 22.9%.\nNet capital expenditures for Q3 2021 were $34.6 million, while depreciation and amortization for the same period was $33.7 million.\nRegarding our outlook.\nWe anticipate a continued trend towards more normalized growth rates.\nHowever, we are experiencing increased supply chain constraints, leading to greater uncertainty about the timing of customer deliveries.\nWe have revised our full-year 2021 non-GAAP currency-neutral revenue growth guidance to between 12% and 13%, up from our previous guidance of 10% to 10.5%.\nThis updated forecast includes a wider revenue range due to the supply challenges we are facing.\nFull-year COVID-related sales are now expected to be between $240 million and $245 million, an increase from our previous guidance of $200 million to $210 million.\nWe now project full-year non-GAAP gross margin to be between 57.5% and 57.8%, up from our previous guidance of 57% to 57.5%.\nFull-year non-GAAP operating margin is forecasted to be approximately 19.5%, an increase from our prior guidance of 19%.\nOur updated guidance assumes higher operating expenses in Q4 as we continue to anticipate a gradual return to more normal activity levels.\nWe have revised our annual non-GAAP effective tax rate projection to between 21% and 22%.\nThe lower rate compared to our previous guidance is primarily due to an increase in compensation-related tax deductions.\nWe now forecast full-year adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 23.5% and 24%, up from our previous guidance of 23% to 23.5%.\nGiven the uncertainties surrounding COVID, we have decided to postpone our Investor Day to February, as we prefer to host an in-person event.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Jonathan introduced Todd Leombruno, the chief financial officer, as the speaker.\nPlease refer to the provided slide number.\nNon-GAAP financial measure reconciliations are included in the materials distributed today.\nAs is customary, Tom will begin by discussing quarterly highlights and commenting on the company's transformation.\nBefore we start, there are two points to address.\nWe remain restricted by U.K. Takeover Code regulations regarding certain details of the pending Meggitt acquisition.\nAdditionally, we're rescheduling our upcoming virtual investor day due to a timing conflict with another company's event.\nOur virtual meeting is now set for Tuesday, March 8 from 9 am to 12 pm Eastern Time.\nDuring this event, we'll cover various topics including the unveiling of our new long-term financial goals.\nThe slide's title, \"Exceptional execution in a challenging environment,\" accurately describes our performance this quarter.\nThe company's overall performance in safety, sales growth, margin expansion, and EPS was remarkably strong.\nThis was achieved despite one of the most challenging operating environments in recent memory, considering the combined effects of inflation, supply chain issues, and the Omicron variant.\nLet's begin with the first point.\nWe maintain our emphasis on safety as our top priority.\nWe're utilizing our high-performance teams, including plant and warehouse work groups as well as Star Point teams and Kaizen.\nThis team structure combined with Kaizen is fostering a culture of ownership within the company.\nThis ownership extends beyond safety to quality, cost, delivery, and engagement.\nYear-over-year sales growth reached 12%, with organic growth at 13%.\nGrowth was consistent across all external reporting segments and regions.\nWe achieved second quarter records for both total sales and total segment operating margin.\nEBITDA margin was 18.2% as reported, or 22.7% adjusted.\nThis represents a significant 180 basis point increase from the previous year.\nThe demand environment remains strong, with over 90% of our end markets in growth mode.\nThis performance is the result of Win Strategy 2.0 and 3.0 implementations.\nCombined with our strategic portfolio changes, successful acquisitions, and powerful market trends, we anticipate a future characterized by longer cycles, increased resilience, and faster growth.\nMoving to the next slide, we've previously discussed this framework that guides our company strategies.\nWe aim to fulfill our purpose, excel at generating and deploying cash, and achieve top-quartile performance among our proxy peers.\nThe following slide visually represents how our company has evolved in recent years.\nWe've updated this slide with FY '22 figures.\nThe left side shows adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share, while the right side displays adjusted EBITDA margin.\nLooking at the left, you can see that after 100 years of effort, we reached $6.99 EPS in FY '16.\nIn the past six years, we've grown that by 2.5 times to over $18 in our current guidance.\nThe growth from FY '20 to FY '22 alone is nearly $6, coinciding with the launch of Win Strategy 3.0.\nOn the right, our year-to-date EBITDA margin of 22.4% represents a remarkable 770 basis point improvement since FY '16.\nThese results are attributable to our people, portfolio changes, and the cumulative effects of Win Strategy 2.0 and 3.0.\nRegarding the Meggitt transaction, we continue to make progress.\nWe're working on four main areas: economic and national security reviews with the U.K. government, which are proceeding positively, and antitrust and FDI filings, which are advancing as expected.\nWe still anticipate closing in Q3 of calendar year 2022.\nThis combination is exciting, doubling our aerospace business size with complementary technologies.\nWe're at the start of a commercial aerospace recovery, with significant synergies expected from merging the two companies.\nIn addition to strategic acquisitions, we're well-positioned with our eight motion and control technologies to benefit from four key secular trends.\nBeyond aerospace recovery, electrification, ESG, and digitization represent long-term growth drivers for us, both in onboard systems and infrastructure.\nWe look forward to discussing these trends further at our investor day on March 8.\nMoving to Slide 9, I'll review our FY '22 Q2 results.\nAs Tom mentioned, this was an exceptional quarter, demonstrating our operations leaders' ability to drive the company to new performance levels.\nSales increased by 12% year-over-year, reaching a record $3.8 billion.\nOrganic sales growth was strong at 13%, with currency effects reducing reported sales growth to 12%.\nDemand remains robust across all our industrial businesses, with healthy backlogs.\nIn our aerospace segment, commercial demand continues to show positive trends.\nWe previously discussed how the purchases of CLARCOR, LORD and Exotic are surpassing our expectations.\nThe segment operating margins have reached a second quarter record when adjusted.\nWe achieved a 21.6% segment operating margin.\nThis represents a 120 basis point improvement from the previous year.\nOur teams are effectively navigating the widely known supply chain challenges and inflationary environment.\nI want to praise our team's quick actions in managing these costs and inflationary pressures while still attaining record sales for the quarter.\nAs Tom mentioned, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.7%.\nThis is an increase of 180 basis points compared to last year.\nOur adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share have both grown by 29% compared to the previous year.\nNet income totaled $582 million, or 15.2% return on sales.\nAdjusted earnings per share reached $4.46.\nThis is a $1.01 increase from the prior year's $3.45, making it an exceptional quarter.\nLet's move to Slide 10.\nThis slide shows a breakdown of adjusted earnings per share, and I'll explain some of the factors that led to the $1.01 increase in EPS.\nAs you can see, operational performance is the primary driver of this increase.\nAdjusted segment operating income grew by $132 million.\nThis is 19% higher than the previous year.\nIt accounts for 80% of the increase in our earnings per share this quarter.\nWe also had some other positive items totaling $0.19.\nThere were some favorable currency gains.\nWe sold a few facilities that we had restructured.\nThese sales were completed in the quarter.\nWe also have lower pension expenses compared to last year.\nAll of these factors combined to add $0.19.\nYou can see the other items on the slide that collectively contributed $0.04 favorably.\nHowever, the main takeaway is that this was an exceptionally strong operational quarter.\nMoving to Slide 11, I'll comment briefly on our segment performance.\nTom mentioned those long-term trends.\nWe're seeing growth from these trends across all our segments.\nEach segment has achieved a record adjusted segment operating margin this quarter.\nWe successfully maintained a cost-price neutral position.\nWe're very pleased with that.\nIncremental margins were 32% compared to the previous year.\nI'd like to remind everyone that this is despite a $65 million headwind from discretionary savings we had in the prior year.\nExcluding those discretionary savings, our incremental margins were 48%.\nThis demonstrates outstanding performance across the board from our teams.\nIt truly showcases the effectiveness of the win strategy and our ability to perform in the current economic climate.\nLooking at orders, they're up 12% and demand continues to be strong across our businesses.\nTo provide some context on Diversified Industrial North America, sales reached $1.8 billion.\nOrganic growth in this segment was 15% compared to the previous year.\nWe're very satisfied with the performance in this region.\nWe've discussed extensively - and I know everyone is aware of the well-documented supply chain issues.\nTom mentioned the Omicron surge.\nWe are not exempt from these challenges.\nHowever, we managed to maintain operating margins at a very high level of 21.3% in this segment, which we're proud of.\nOrder rates continue to be very strong at 17% growth.\nOur backlog is robust.\nAs Tom mentioned, 91% of our markets are growing.\nSo there are great developments in the North American businesses.\nThe Industrial International segment is a success story.\nSales are $1.4 billion.\nOrganic growth is up 14% in this segment.\nI want to highlight that across all regions within our International segment, organic growth was in the mid-teens.\nSo we're seeing robust activity across the board.\nPerhaps even more impressive are the adjusted operating margins at 22.4%.\nThis represents an increase of 210 basis points compared to the previous year.\nCertainly, we're benefiting from increased volume.\nWe've talked extensively about our growth in international distribution.\nWe're also seeing benefits from product mix.\nThe team is doing an excellent job controlling costs.\nThis has been a long-term effort over an extended period from that team.\nI'm very pleased that they're able to maintain this high level of margin performance.\nOrder rates there were up 14%, with a substantial backlog and really solid international performance.\nLooking at the aerospace systems segment, we're seeing continued signs of recovery.\nSales were $618 million.\nOrganic sales growth is positive at nearly 6%.\nWe observed very strong demand in our commercial OEM and MRO markets.\nMargin performance here was also excellent.\nOperating margins increased by 270 basis points, ending the quarter at 20.7%.\nI want to remind everyone that this is still at pre-COVID volume levels.\nSo it's an outstanding margin performance from our aerospace team.\nAerospace orders on a 12-month rolling basis declined by 7%.\nHere is my attempt at paraphrasing the given sentences:\nWe had some large multi-year military orders in the previous period that created a difficult comparison for aerospace.\nExcluding those orders, aerospace orders would have shown mid-teens positive growth.\nWe're observing ongoing indications of gradual improvement in the aerospace sector.\nOur aerospace order value this quarter was the highest it's been in the past three quarters.\nThe aerospace division had an excellent quarter.\nLooking at the segments overall, we see outstanding operational performance.\nWe're experiencing positive growth, strong order values, healthy backlogs, record profit margins, and solid execution across all areas.\nThe segments are performing exceptionally well.\nRegarding cash flow year-to-date, we surpassed $1 billion in cash flow from operations.\nThis represents 13.3% of sales.\nFree cash flow stands at $900 million, nearly 12% of sales.\nYear-to-date conversion is now at 107%.\nWe continue to carefully manage working capital across the company.\nWe're simply responding to increased demand levels.\nWorking capital change improved this quarter as predicted.\nThis quarter saw a 1.9% use of cash, compared to a 4.1% source of cash last year.\nFor the full year, we still anticipate mid-teens cash flow from operations, and free cash flow will exceed 100%.\nI'd like to comment on our capital deployment activities.\nAs many may have seen, our board recently approved a dividend of $1.03 per share.\nThis supports our 65-year record of increasing dividend payments.\nI'll provide an update on the Meggitt financing.\nWe're making progress with our flexible financing plan.\nWe secured a deal-contingent forward hedge contract for £6.4 billion.\nAccounting rules require marking these contracts to market, resulting in a non-cash charge of $149 million this quarter.\nWe've recorded this in the other expense line and are treating it as an adjusted item.\nWe now have $2.5 billion in escrow for the Meggitt transaction, listed as restricted cash on our balance sheet.\nThis was funded through commercial paper and some cash reserves.\nConsequently, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.7 times this quarter.\nNet debt was 2.5 times, or 1.8 times accounting for the restricted cash.\nWe've raised the full year adjusted earnings per share by $0.75.\nOur previous guidance was $17.30 at the midpoint, now moved to $18.05.\nWe've narrowed the range to $0.25 up or down.\nSales guidance has also increased to 10% growth at the midpoint, with a range of 9% to 11%.\nThe sales growth breakdown shows 10.5% organic growth, about 1 point unfavorable currency impact, and no impact from acquisitions.\nWe don't expect the Meggitt deal to close in our fiscal year.\nWe've raised the full year adjusted segment operating margin guidance by 20 basis points to 22.1% at the midpoint, with a 20 basis point range on either side.\nCorporate G&A and other expenses are expected to be $656 million as reported, or $435 million adjusted.\nWe're adjusting for Meggitt transaction-related expenses, including $71 million in costs year-to-date and the $149 million non-cash mark-to-market loss.\nThe tax rate is now projected to be slightly lower at 22% based on first-half activity.\nOur full-year guidance assumes a 48% first half, 52% second half split for sales, adjusted operating income, and earnings per share.\nWe're guiding Q3 FY '22 adjusted earnings per share at $4.54.\nWe have a highly engaged global team living up to our purpose of enabling engineering breakthroughs for a better tomorrow.\nThe Win Strategy 3.0 has shown impressive results and has significant future potential.\nOur portfolio transformation continues with three great acquisitions and a fourth in progress, making us more resilient and longer-cycle focused.\nCombined with the secular trends mentioned, we're very optimistic about the future.\nOur success stems from portfolio and strategy changes, but ultimately from our 55,000 team members who think and act like owners, driving this transformation.\nAs a reminder, please ask one question with a follow-up if needed, then rejoin the queue to allow others a chance to ask questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Stakeholders are encouraged to thoroughly examine various statements provided by NHI and its regular reports submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission, including potential risks and other details disclosed in NHI's Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2020.\nWe express our profound appreciation to all the frontline workers who are relentlessly fighting COVID-19 daily, despite the significant risks to themselves and their loved ones.\nFor a long time, NHI has respected the senior housing and skilled nursing organizations and their personnel who go above and beyond to ensure the safety and happiness of our elderly population.\nThis statement has never been more accurate than it is today.\nAs a gesture of recognition, we have showcased some of our preferred caregiver and resident images on the cover of our supplemental report.\nI encourage you to view it.\nCrises define reputations, and I observe operators making sound choices and acting based on their core values, selflessly caring for residents, fostering a corporate culture that values employees, and offering guidance and reassurance to staff and residents' families.\nI anticipate that when future generations look back on our industry's practices during this period, certain operators will be recognized as heroes.\nNevertheless, the obstacles this pandemic presents to our operators and business are significant, and it's challenging to predict accurately when we'll return to a more typical operational environment.\nOur operators have done a commendable job in restricting the spread of COVID-19.\nAs of May 5th, we had 192 active resident cases in 37 facilities.\nTo provide context, NHI cares for over 20,000 residents across all our properties; thus, less than 1% are affected.\nAs our operators have implemented their protocols and taken appropriate measures to prevent or limit virus transmission, there has been a notable decrease in inquiries, tours, and move-ins.\nThis is negatively impacting occupancy rates.\nKevin will provide more details on this later.\nRegarding expenses, it's unsurprising that our operators are incurring higher costs, particularly for labor and personal protective equipment.\nThis is evidently putting pressure on our operators' profit margins, and we are prepared to assist them in navigating this challenging period when necessary.\nIn April, NHI received 99.7% of its contractual rent, and so far in May, we have collected approximately 94%, which aligns with our expectations as we typically receive a portion of collections through the 15th of the month, depending on specific lease terms.\nAs this pandemic unfolds, NHI is committed to maintaining transparency with the investment community.\nTo this end, we have improved occupancy disclosure for Bickford, Holiday, and Senior Living Communities, which Kevin will discuss in more detail.\nWe were the first to report COVID-19 incidents in our communities and will continue providing weekly updates on our website as long as it remains relevant.\nHowever, given the uncertainty surrounding the scope and spread of COVID-19, NHI has limited visibility regarding its potential financial impact.\nConsequently, we are withdrawing our previously issued 2020 guidance.\nConcerning the dividend, our Board remains committed to our dividend policy and will evaluate the August dividend in mid-June.\nOur net income per diluted common share for the quarter ending March 31, 2020 was $1.37, including the gain on sale, compared to $0.83 for the same period in 2019.\nExamining our three FFO performance metrics for the first quarter, NAREIT FFO increased 3.1% to $1.35, normalized FFO rose 3.8% to $1.36, and adjusted FFO or AFFO grew 5.7% to $1.29.\nWe use cash NOI as our primary performance metric.\nWe define cash NOI as GAAP revenue excluding straight-line rent, tenant escrow funds, and lease incentive and commitment fee amortizations.\nFor the quarter ending March 31, cash NOI increased 9.2% to $76.3 million compared to $69.8 million in the previous year.\nThe growth in our cash NOI for Q1 2020 was attributed to our organic expansion from lease increases and the impact of investments made after Q1 2019, including the recent Timber Ridge joint venture, as well as the ongoing fulfillment of our obligations\nPage 17 of our Q1 2020 SEC filed supplement contains a reconciliation of cash NOI\nGeneral and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2020 rose by 7.4% compared to the same period last year, reaching $4.3 million\nThe G&A cost increase was distributed across various areas, including the growth of our asset management team, other salary-related increases, and costs associated with increased use of external consultants\nRegarding our financial position, we concluded the quarter with total debt of $1.55 billion, with slightly over 90% being unsecured\nAs of March 31, we had $142 million available on our $550 million credit line\nNHI also held $46 million in cash, resulting in a net debt of $1.5 billion, which is $67.6 million higher than our net debt at the end of December\nThis increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Timber Ridge, which was finalized at the end of January\nAt the end of the quarter, we also had about $24.2 million in a restricted 1031 account, not included in our cash equivalents but recorded in other assets, which came from the sale of eight Brookdale properties in January\nOur debt capital metrics for the quarter ending March 31 showed a net debt to annualized EBITDA ratio of 4.7 times, unchanged from the previous quarter, an average debt maturity of 3.7 years, and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.8 times, up from 5.7 times in Q4 2019\nFor the quarter ending March 31, our average cost of debt was 3.3%\nThe performance of stock markets over the past month has not met our expectations\nHowever, in the first quarter, we submitted a new automatic shelf registration and renewed our ATM program, providing us with $500 million in new ATM capacity\nOur investment-grade credit ratings, including a recently confirmed stable outlook from Fitch, along with our new shelf that includes an indenture, position us for a potential public debt offering when market conditions improve\nAlthough currently expensive, we consider the public equity and debt markets accessible to us and a potential source of liquidity\nDavid brings 23 years of accounting expertise to NHI, having previously held CAO positions at MedEquities Realty Trust and Healthcare Reality Trust, as well as experience as an Audit Senior Manager at Ernst & Young\nWe have been providing weekly updates on active resident cases in our communities, but I wanted to provide more context\nAs Eric mentioned, we had 37 facilities with one or more active resident cases, including 20 senior housing properties and 17 skilled nursing facilities\nOf the 20 senior housing properties, 14 were need-driven and six were discretionary\nThe 37 properties involve 13 different operators across 18 states\nWe had a total of 192 active resident cases, with 97 in our SNFs, 40 in the skilled nursing wings of our CCRCs and senior living campuses, and 55 in our senior housing properties\nWe maintain frequent communication with our operating partners and are confident they are adhering to their own infection control protocols and following CDC guidelines, state health agency regulations, and in some cases, exceeding these requirements\nOverall, we are very pleased and grateful for our operators' efforts to prevent or limit the spread of COVID-19 in their communities\nThe relatively low incidence doesn't surprise us and is a testament to our operators, whose primary goal is to keep our senior population safe\nRegarding the CARES Act, several of our senior housing operators have been approved for or have received funds from the Paycheck Protection Program\nThe triple net lease structure has proven advantageous when applying for these loans\nOur SNF operators are also benefiting from the CARES Act\nPayments from the Provider Relief Fund averaging about $150,000 per facility, the suspension of the 2% Medicare sequestration, and the 6.2% increase in the FMAP are improving near-term liquidity for the SNFs\nRegarding collections, we received 99.7% of payments in April, and so far in May, we have collected approximately 94%, which aligns with our expectations as we typically receive a portion of collections through the 15th of the month depending on the terms of the underlying leases\nAt present, no one is behind on payments\nWe regularly communicate with our operators and are seeking innovative solutions that are advantageous for them during these unprecedented times while also being beneficial for our shareholders.\nOur leases with many senior housing operators include credit enhancements, amounting to about $38.7 million in cash along with guarantees, and we have strong credit from our skilled nursing facility operators.\nRegarding the performance of our various asset types and major operators, our necessity-driven senior housing operators took early action against the pandemic and have so far managed to restrict the virus's spread.\nAccording to our most recent weekly report, 14 assisted living and senior living facilities had active cases among residents, with most locations having fewer than five cases per facility.\nBickford, which accounts for 17% of our yearly cash revenue, has experienced a slight decrease in move-out rates, but like much of the industry, their lead generation and tours have dropped by over 40%, affecting new move-ins and occupancy rates.\nBickford's average occupancy for comparable communities was 87.3% in Q1 and 86.6% for March.\nIn April, occupancy further decreased by 130 basis points to 85.3%.\nOur entrance fee communities have performed somewhat better as resident turnover is significantly lower and residents tend to be younger and in better health compared to other property types.\nHowever, they are not immune to COVID-19's impact, and we have had four entrance fee communities with active resident cases in our latest weekly update, though like assisted living, the number of cases per community is limited.\nSenior living communities, representing 16% of our revenue, had an average occupancy of 80.4% in Q1, which slightly increased to 80.6% in March, but fell to 79% in April as several entrance fee sales were postponed due to the pandemic.\nOur independent living communities have seen a similar decline in leads, tours, and move-ins as our assisted living operators.\nThe occurrence of COVID-19 is relatively low in independent living, with only two properties having active resident cases as of the last update.\nHoliday Retirement, accounting for 11% of our yearly cash revenue, had an average occupancy of 87.3% in Q1 and 86.7% in March.\nThe average occupancy for April decreased by 170 basis points to 85%.\nBickford, SLC, and Holiday make up about 56% of our senior housing units.\nCollectively, these three experienced an average occupancy decline of 150 basis points from March to April, which serves as a good indicator for the rest of the senior housing portfolio.\nThe skilled nursing portfolio, representing 26% of our yearly cash revenue, is supported by two excellent credits: NHC and The Ensign Group.\nAs of our most recent weekly update, 17 of our 78 SNFs had active resident cases.\nWe have observed more instances of outbreaks in some of our SNFs, which is expected given the higher acuity patient population and the more frequent contact caregivers have with patients and residents.\nDue to the short average length of stay for Medicare patients and the temporary suspension of elective procedures, SNF occupancies have generally declined more than what we are seeing in senior housing.\nHowever, there is more government financial support available for the SNF industry.\nNHC, which accounts for 12% of yearly cash revenue, has received funds from the Provider Relief Fund.\nThe company also anticipates gaining liquidity through the Medicare Accelerated Payment Program, the Medicare sequestration suspension, the payroll tax deferral, and supplemental Medicaid payments.\nOverall, we are very confident in the credit quality of our SNF portfolio.\nThe pace of deals has slowed, and all indications suggest this will continue for the next several months as accurate price discovery is nearly impossible to determine at present.\nOur immediate focus is on continuing to fund existing commitments and engaging in intensive asset management by creatively offering guidance and assistance to our operators when necessary.\nFor the long term, we maintain ongoing discussions with existing and new operators and expect our pipeline will be prepared to support significant external growth once some normalcy returns to the market.\nI want to express my gratitude and admiration for all our operators and the frontline heroes who perform truly remarkable acts of courage for their residents and patients every day.\nWith that, I'll return the call to Eric.\nIt's important to note that NHI's management team and Board have extensive experience in managing during times of crisis.\nI believe our strong balance sheet and liquidity, combined with robust lender and market relationships, position us on solid ground.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Describing 2020 as a unique year would be a massive understatement.\nThe coronavirus pandemic caused immense hardship, disruption, and loss of life.\nOur company's success during this crisis is both humbling and a testament to our employees' dedication, as they managed our internal challenges while meeting increased consumer demands amid the pandemic and quarantine.\nFinancial highlights for the year include an 18.5% rise in net sales to $1.968 billion and a 19.4% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $361.2 million.\nThis exceptional growth slowed briefly in the fourth quarter, but I believe this slowdown is temporary.\nAs previously mentioned, we achieved record-breaking financial results in fiscal 2020.\nWe reached all-time highs for net sales, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted diluted earnings per share this year.\nOur fiscal 2020 net sales totaled $1.968 billion, representing a $307.5 million or 18.5% increase from the previous year.\nThe fiscal 2020 net sales figure includes roughly $27.8 million from our Crisco acquisition.\nThe Crisco deal was finalized on December 1, 2020, contributing a full month of net sales.\nOur adjusted EBITDA before COVID-19 expenses reached $374.8 million in fiscal 2020, a $72.3 million or 23.9% increase.\nThroughout 2020, we spent approximately $13.5 million on additional COVID-19 measures at our production facilities, mainly covering temporary enhanced pay for manufacturing staff, wages for quarantined employees, and other health and safety precautions.\nIncluding these expenses, our reported adjusted EBITDA was $361.2 million, a $58.7 million or 19.4% increase compared to the previous year.\nAdjusted EBITDA before COVID-19 expenses accounted for 19% of net sales in fiscal 2020.\nAfter factoring in the roughly $13.5 million in COVID-19 costs, adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales was 18.4%.\nIn fiscal 2019, adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales was 18.2%.\nFourth quarter net sales totaled $510.2 million, a $40 million or 8.5% increase.\nThe fourth quarter 2020 net sales included about $27.8 million from our Crisco acquisition.\nWe generated $77.6 million in adjusted EBITDA before COVID-19 expenses in the fourth quarter, an $8.1 million or 11.7% increase.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we incurred approximately $4.3 million in additional COVID-19 expenses at our manufacturing facilities.\nConsequently, our reported adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $73.3 million, a $3.8 million or 5.6% increase from $69.5 million in the same period last year.\nOur fiscal 2020 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.26, a $0.62 per share or 37.8% increase compared to the previous year.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we reported $0.35 in adjusted diluted earnings per share, a $0.07 per share or 25% increase compared to the previous year.\nFiscal 2020 net sales grew by $307.5 million, comprising a $244.5 million increase in base business net sales and a $63 million increase from acquisitions.\nThe $244.5 million rise in base business net sales included $209.8 million from increased base business volume.\nOf the $63 million in acquisition-related net sales, $33.7 million came from an additional seven and a half months of Clabber Girl sales in fiscal 2020, while $27.8 million was attributed to one month of Crisco sales.\nFiscal 2020 base business net sales also benefited from $35.8 million in net pricing, which included our spring 2019 price increase, our 2019 trade spend optimization program, and the impact of COVID-19, resulting in lower than average daily trade promotions during the pandemic's peak.\nNote that our pricing calculation also reflects favorable mix as we saw fewer spices in the foodservice channel, which typically have lower margins.\nForeign exchange had a negative impact of slightly over $1 million on net sales for the year.\nWe estimate that the extra reporting week in fiscal 2020, which fell in the third quarter, contributed approximately $35 million to our net sales.\nGreen Giant led our brand performance, reaching about $639 million in net sales during fiscal 2020, a $112.2 million or 21.3% increase for the year.\nGreen Giant's success was primarily driven by shelf-stable products, with Green Giant Le Sueur shelf-stable net sales increasing by approximately $64.8 million or 39.7% for the year.\nGreen Giant shelf-stable products experienced COVID-19 enhanced sales, leading to exceptional performance from late March through the end of the third quarter.\nIn the fourth quarter, we began carefully managing sales through customer allocations to ensure sufficient product availability until this summer's pack season.\nAs a result, Green Giant shelf-stable net sales remained flat in the fourth quarter, despite ongoing elevated demand and double-digit consumption trends.\nGreen Giant frozen product net sales increased by double digits for the year, up $47.4 million or 13.1%.\nAmong our other major brands, Cream of Wheat had one of the best performances in fiscal 2020, with net sales increasing by approximately $12.9 million or 21.6% for the year.\nCream of Wheat continued to excel in the fourth quarter, with net sales up by $2.7 million or 16.1% compared to the same period last year.\nClabber Girl also performed strongly, part of what we believe will be a lasting resurgence in baking.\nClabber Girl product net sales increased by approximately $10.2 million or 18.9% during the comparable period following our mid-May 2019 acquisition.\nWe are very pleased with Clabber Girl's performance, which generated approximately $97.5 million in net sales during our first full year of ownership, compared to our initial expectations of around $75 million.\nClabber Girl net sales increased by approximately $2.5 million or nearly 10% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year.\nOrtega net sales also saw double-digit growth during fiscal 2020, increasing by $17.9 million or 12.7% compared to the previous year.\nSupply chain constraints, driven by industry-wide taco shell capacity limitations, restricted growth in the fourth quarter.\nAs a result, while our net sales growth was impressive with a $2.5 million increase or 7.3% compared to the same period last year, we could have achieved more with additional product supply.\nVictoria was also one of the larger gainers in the portfolio, increasing net sales in fiscal 2020 by $11.3 million or 26.4% compared to the previous year.\nVictoria's net sales reached nearly $55 million in 2020.\nAlthough consumption remained strong throughout the year, net sales decreased by approximately $0.6 million or 4.7% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the timing shift of a large promotional event with a key club customer from fourth quarter 2019 to third quarter 2020.\nMaple Grove Farms net sales increased by approximately $6.1 million or 8.7%, an impressive performance given that a substantial portion of Maple Grove Farms' business is in the foodservice channel, which was severely impacted for a significant part of the year.\nFourth quarter performance also showed nice improvement, with net sales up $2.1 million or 12.2%, driven by continued strong consumption trends and an improvement in the foodservice side of the business.\nOur spices & seasonings, including legacy brands such as Ac'cent and Dash and brands acquired in 2016 like Tones and Weber, increased by $30.9 million or 9.2% for the year.\nSpices & seasonings net sales reached $367.7 million in fiscal 2020.\nThe retail side of this business began showing strong momentum by June as more Americans embraced cooking and seasoning meals at home, a trend that continues in 2021.\nThe foodservice side of the business continues to be down but is slowly improving.\nIn the fourth quarter, net sales of our spices & seasonings increased by $2.1 million or 2.4%.\nDespite the outstanding performance for the year, our spices & seasonings could have grown even more, even with the drag from foodservice, had we had additional supply.\nNew York Style faced difficulties in both foodservice and retail deli sectors, though the latter was less affected.\nNew York Style's net sales decreased by $1.8 million, representing a 4.5% decline in fiscal 2020 compared to the previous year.\nFiscal 2020's gross profit amounted to $481.7 million, equivalent to 24.5% of net sales.\nWithout certain expenses and adjustments, our gross profit would have reached $486.7 million, or 24.7% of net sales.\nIn fiscal 2019, gross profit was $383.1 million, or 23.1% of net sales.\nExcluding specific expenses and adjustments, our gross profit for fiscal 2019 would have been $405.1 million, or 24.4% of net sales.\nApart from COVID-19 related costs, inflation remained relatively stable for most of 2020.\nInflation began to increase late in the third quarter and accelerated in the fourth quarter, particularly affecting freight costs, certain agricultural products, other ingredient costs, and packaging.\nWe anticipate continued inflationary pressures in the coming months and are working to mitigate these effects in our 2021 budget.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year totaled $186.2 million, or 9.5% of net sales.\nThis compares favorably to the previous year's 9.7% of net sales, which amounted to $160.7 million in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe increase in SG&A expenses was due to higher selling expenses, consumer marketing investments, warehousing costs, and general and administrative expenses.\nSG&A increases included higher selling, brokerage, and incentive compensation tied to increased sales and profitability.\nThese increases were partially offset by a reduction in acquisition divestiture-related and non-recurring expenses.\nWe generated $374.8 million in adjusted EBITDA before COVID-19 expenses, and $361.2 million after including $13.5 million in COVID-19 expenses.\nThis compares to adjusted EBITDA of $302.5 million in 2019.\nOur adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020 were $2.26, compared to $1.64 per share in 2019.\nThe increase was primarily due to higher volumes, including COVID-19 driven demand, as well as the acquisitions of Clabber Girl and Crisco.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share also benefited from increased adjusted EBITDA margins and lower effective borrowing costs, despite COVID-19 related expenses.\nWe had a strong year for cash flow, with net cash provided by operating activities of $281.5 million, supporting our dividend policy and reducing our net debt.\nWe began the year with a net debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 6.12 times, improved to nearly 4.75 times at the end of the third quarter, and finished the year at approximately 5.21 times.\nOur increased operating cash flow allowed us to reduce net debt by about $135 million over the year, excluding the Crisco acquisition.\nWe expect elevated net sales in the early months of 2021, driven by consumption levels that have remained over 10% higher than pre-pandemic levels across our portfolio.\nWe don't anticipate exceeding our net sales from March, April, or May 2020, which were driven more by pantry loading than consumption.\nWe have strong expectations for fiscal 2021, especially compared to 2019, with the year off to a great start.\nDue to challenges in forecasting COVID-19 impacts, we can't provide a detailed financial forecast at this time.\nWe expect to generate record net sales of $2.05 billion to $2.1 billion in 2021, including the full-year benefit of the Crisco acquisition.\nWe anticipate different challenges in 2021 compared to 2020, including increased inflation across key input costs such as agricultural products, packaging, and freight.\nWe plan to manage these costs through pricing initiatives and cost-saving activities to maintain our margin profile and cash flows.\nMost of our brands grew in fiscal 2020, some substantially, due to the dramatic effects of COVID-19 on consumer buying and dining patterns.\nE-commerce sales grew significantly, with an estimated 150% increase, albeit from a modest base.\nWe expect this trend to continue in 2021 and are investing in our online presence and marketing with various retailers.\nOur business benefited from low concentration in the foodservice channel, which decreased from 13% to 9% of net sales in 2020.\nWe're seeing modest recovery in the foodservice channel and expect it to strengthen as the year progresses.\nHousehold penetration of B&G Foods brands increased by 900 basis points, and the average sale per purchase grew by 25%.\nWe're expanding our digital capabilities to track consumer trends and invest in reinforcing purchases.\nOur consumption trends consistently showed double-digit increases, placing us at or near the top of comparable food companies.\nWe increased marketing spending by about 20% for the year and over 50% in the fourth quarter to reinforce gains and promote our brands.\nDespite positive results, the year's performance doesn't fully reflect potential changes in consumer behavior due to supply chain capacity issues.\nWe faced challenges meeting demand for meal solution brands like Ortega and Bear Creek, as well as spices & seasonings due to manufacturing capacity issues and COVID-related absenteeism.\nWe implemented aggressive quarantine policies for employee safety, which often left facilities short-handed and increased costs.\nIn the fourth quarter, we placed Green Giant shelf-stable products on allocation due to crop conditions and co-packer capacity issues, resulting in flat sales for the quarter.\nRelief in this area is not expected until the new crop arrives in summer.\nThe fourth quarter's 2.5% increase in base business sales doesn't fully represent the business's performance, as consumption trends remain very strong.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we observed weaker sales in November and December, likely due to retailers overstocking in the third quarter in anticipation of strong holiday demand that didn't materialize as expected.\nExcess inventory had to be reduced as the anticipated demand failed to meet expectations.\nThe timing of the typically slow sales week at year-end shifted, falling in our financial January in 2019 but at the end of December in fiscal 2020.\nThis shift is evident in the 35% increase in January 2021 base business sales, accounting for about 5% of fourth quarter net sales year-over-year difference.\nThe fourth quarter's adjusted EBITDA was impacted by $4.3 million in COVID-related expenses not offset by increased sales, and an additional $4.5 million spent on marketing.\nWe remain very optimistic about 2021 as our sales continue to be strong, reflecting consumption trends and improving service levels as we increase capacity and our workforce strengthens.\nWhile we're still experiencing COVID-related expenses, the spending rate is decreasing and should not reach the $13.5 million cost seen in the last three quarters of 2020.\nOur innovation-driven growth was hindered in 2020 as retailers canceled resets and focused on maintaining inventory of existing products.\nDespite limited launches, new products from 2020 and 2019 accounted for about 2% of our net sales, or $45 million.\nSuccessful items from this group will see expanded distribution in fiscal 2021, along with new product introductions across various brands, particularly in Green Giant frozen and Ortega products.\n2021 will include a full year of ownership of the Crisco brand, which we acquired on December 1 and which significantly contributed to our fiscal 2020 results in just one month.\nWe are currently integrating the brand and expect to complete the process by the end of summer.\nCrisco brings strong sales, boosted by COVID trends, and very attractive margins.\nThe acquisition aligns perfectly with our model in terms of purchase price, financing costs, tax advantages, EBITDA margin, and free cash flow from EBITDA.\nWe see good opportunities for the brand to grow through new distribution and products, which we plan to execute in 2021.\nAs mentioned, this year presents challenges, including significant cost pressures in transportation, packaging, and commodities.\nOur operations team has protected us where possible, but we still face some exposure that we must address.\nWe plan to tackle this through a combination of pricing, trade program rationalization, and an enhanced cost reduction program.\nSome actions have already been taken, such as price increases on the Underwood brand and Green Giant shelf-stable products last month, with more to follow.\nCost relief on some elements, such as commodities, remains uncertain due to competition for crop planting this year, with outcomes unclear until the fall harvest.\nNotable progress in 2020 includes increased recognition of B&G Foods' corporate responsibilities as we approach $2 billion in net sales.\nA new Corporate Social Responsibility committee was formed at the Board of Director level to oversee our efforts in meeting corporate social responsibilities.\nWe adopted and published new human rights and environmental health and safety policies on our website.\nWe've also established an employee-directed diversity, equity, and inclusion council to address workforce needs and achieve appropriate diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout the company.\nWhile we've had existing efforts in these areas, we've formalized them and are committed to increasing our efforts and investments.\nEstimating our performance for fiscal 2021 is challenging due to the unique circumstances.\nThe year has started with good momentum, but we'll soon reach the weeks when consumers were stockpiling in 2020, which we can't expect to match.\nHowever, the \"new normal\" trends observed in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 could support increased sales compared to fiscal 2019.\nMany people will likely continue working from home part-time, and we believe consumers have rediscovered the satisfaction and savings of cooking and baking at home.\nWe're investing to encourage more home baking, particularly appropriate since about 19% of our sales involve baking brands.\nWe aim to retain new customers who discovered our brands through traditional and online marketing.\nBased on these factors, we estimate base business net sales will exceed 2019 net sales by approximately 10%, with 11 months of Crisco net sales on top of that.\nWe maintain our operating model of modest organic growth in established brands, larger growth through accretive acquisitions, and returning a significant portion of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends.\nThis strategy has resulted in a net sales compound annual growth rate of 11% and an adjusted EBITDA CAGR of 11.9% since our 2004 IPO.\nB&G Foods has paid out $1.73 billion in dividends since the IPO, representing approximately 60% of free cash flow on average.\nIn 2020, the payout ratio was about 54%, lower than usual due to the exceptional operating results.\nWe want to acknowledge our employees' contributions, especially those on the front lines in manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, and offices, who ensured we could supply the foods consumers needed.\nOther workers made important contributions while working from home, often in less than ideal circumstances.\nTheir dedicated efforts enabled us to achieve record results in fiscal 2020 and begin 2021 with prospects for another successful year.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:In the third quarter, Sherwin-Williams maintained its focus on addressing customer needs, countering increasing expenses through pricing strategies, and investing in future expansion amid challenging industry-wide conditions.\nMarket demand remained generally strong, but raw material costs continued to rise significantly and supply availability did not improve.\nDespite these challenges affecting our quarterly performance, we continued to enhance our customer relationships and take steps to strengthen our long-term position.\nWe are optimistic about future demand and even more confident in our strategy, team, and market standing.\nAllow me to briefly review the quarterly financial results.\nLet's begin with revenue.\nConsolidated sales for the third quarter of 2021 saw a slight increase of 0.5%, reaching $5.15 billion.\nThe availability of raw materials had a significant negative impact on sales, estimated at a high single-digit percentage, with approximately 75% of this effect felt in The Americas Group.\nThe Consumer Brands Group experienced most of the remaining impact, while the Performance Coatings Group was minimally affected.\nThe consolidated gross margin decreased by 630 basis points to 41.6%, due to reduced sales volume, raw material cost inflation outpacing our short-term price increases, and supply chain inefficiencies.\nSG&A expenses decreased by 2.7% in dollar terms and fell 90 basis points to 26.6% as a percentage of sales.\nConsolidated profit before tax declined by $264.1 million or 30.2% to $611.5 million.\nThe third quarters of 2021 and 2020 included $70.3 million and $76.4 million in acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expenses, respectively.\nExcluding these items, consolidated profit before tax decreased by 28.4% to $681.8 million.\nDiluted net income per share in the quarter fell to $1.88 from $2.55 in the previous year.\nBoth the third quarters of 2021 and 2020 included acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expenses of $0.21 per share.\nExcluding these items, the adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter decreased by 24.3% to $2.09 from $2.76.\nEBITDA for the quarter was $834.2 million, or 16.2% of sales.\nNet operating cash increased to $2.1 billion, or 13.5% of sales in the first nine months of 2021.\nNow, let's examine our operating segments.\nDespite strong demand, sales in The Americas Group decreased by 0.4% as volume and mid-single-digit price increases could not fully offset the decrease related to raw material availability.\nSegment margin fell by 3.8 percentage points to 21.3%, primarily due to lower sales volume and higher raw material costs, partially offset by price increases.\nSegment SG&A remained relatively unchanged year-over-year in both dollar terms and as a percentage of sales, as we continued to invest in strategic growth initiatives.\nSales in the Consumer Brands Group decreased by 22.8% compared to a very strong performance a year ago.\nThis decrease included approximately five percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture, lower volume, and the negative impact of raw material availability, partially offset by price increases.\nAdjusted segment margin decreased by 11.7 percentage points to 14.7% of sales, primarily due to lower sales volume, higher raw material costs and supply chain inefficiencies, partially offset by price increases and effective sales and marketing cost control.\nSales in the Performance Coatings Group increased by 17.4%, driven by volume, price increases, and favorable currency exchange rates.\nAdjusted segment margin decreased by 5.5 percentage points to 10.5% of sales as the benefits of higher volume, price increases, and effective cost control were more than offset by higher raw material costs, which saw the highest inflation among the company's three operating segments.\nLet me reiterate the key points we shared during our September 29 update call.\nFirstly, demand remains strong across our professional architectural and industrial markets.\nMany external indicators, and more importantly, our customers, remain very positive.\nDemand is not the issue.\nSecondly, we are prepared to meet this demand.\nWe continue to invest in growth initiatives.\nWe currently have significant production capacity available and are adding 50 million gallons of additional architectural production capacity over the next two quarters.\nOur capabilities are not the issue.\nThe challenges that affected our third quarter and have continued into October are industry-wide raw material availability constraints and inflation.\nLet me be clear about our response to these challenges.\nNo company has more resources and capabilities than Sherwin-Williams.\nWe are leveraging all of these to keep our customers supplied with paint and working more effectively than our competitors.\nWe will maintain our focus on providing customer solutions.\nWe are aggressively countering raw material inflation with significant pricing actions across all our businesses.\nWe implemented multiple price increases during the quarter and will continue to do so as necessary.\nWe are working closely with our suppliers to improve availability as quickly as possible.\nSimultaneously, we are exploring every option to better control our own future, including our recent announcement to acquire Specialty Polymers, Inc.\nOur team, which is experienced and extensive, remains highly confident.\nWe fully expect to emerge from these current challenges as a stronger company with improved customer relationships and continued strong value creation for our shareholders.\nIn a moment, I'll provide more details on Jim's third quarter results summary.\nBut first, I'd like to comment on our year-to-date performance.\nWhile factors largely beyond our control have forced us to adjust our expectations, we have still delivered a solid performance.\nFor the first nine months of 2021, consolidated sales increased by 9.4% or $1.31 billion.\nDespite raw material inflation in the high teens, adjusted profit before tax increased by 1.5% or $33.1 million, and adjusted diluted net income per share increased by 4.8% to $6.80 per share.\nEBITDA adjusted for special items is $2.73 billion, equivalent to 18% of total company sales.\nDespite the challenging circumstances, we've persisted in making investments to sustain our long-term growth.\nWe're optimistic that our profit margins will significantly improve once supply chain issues and inflation pressures ease.\nLet's now examine the performance of individual segments during the third quarter.\nIn The Americas Group, sales were significantly hampered by shortages in raw materials.\nOn a positive note, customer demand remains robust and there's a substantial backlog of orders.\nWe anticipate growth rates will substantially improve as industry supply chain issues are resolved.\nThe Protective & Marine division led sales growth in the third quarter, increasing by a high single-digit percentage.\nThis division is experiencing strong demand from customers in industries such as oil and gas, flooring, and seal manufacturing.\nThe residential repaint sector, TAG's largest business, grew by a low single-digit percentage compared to a strong double-digit increase in the previous year.\nOnce industry supply chain problems are addressed, we expect this business to return to its previous growth trajectory, where we've consistently achieved double-digit growth over the past five years.\nSales in the new residential sector increased by a low single-digit percentage.\nNew housing permits and construction starts have been trending positively since last summer, and our customers are reporting strong order volumes.\nWe're noticing that numerous projects are being delayed due to shortages of various building materials, not just paint.\nThe property management sector saw a slight increase in sales during the quarter.\nFactors such as increased apartment turnover, resumed travel, return to workplaces, and school reopenings should support higher growth once raw material availability improves.\nOur commercial business experienced a slight decline in sales during the quarter.\nSimilar to the new residential sector, projects are taking longer to reach the painting stage due to shortages of multiple building materials.\nAs anticipated, our DIY business saw a double-digit decrease compared to an exceptionally strong performance last year, further exacerbated by raw material shortages.\nFrom a product perspective, interior paint sales outperformed exterior sales, with interior paint constituting the larger portion of sales.\nWe implemented a mid-single-digit price increase in the third quarter, resulting from our February 1st and August 1st price hikes and our mid-September surcharge.\nWe anticipate that these pricing actions will lead to a high single-digit percentage price realization in the fourth quarter, bringing our full-year price realization for TAG to the mid-single-digit range.\nWe will continue to assess the need for additional pricing actions.\nWe've opened a net total of 50 new stores year-to-date.\nIn addition to these new stores, we continue to invest in sales representatives, management trainees, innovative products, e-commerce, and productivity-enhancing services.\nWe are maintaining our focus on these growth initiatives.\nTurning to our Consumer Brands Group.\nSales decreased by a double-digit percentage, influenced by challenging comparisons to the previous year, consumers returning to work, raw material availability issues, and the sale of the Wattyl business.\nOverall, DIY demand continued to normalize compared to 2020 levels.\nThis was partially offset by growth in the North American Pros Who Paint category, which saw strong double-digit increases in both the quarter and year-to-date.\nWhile sales declined in all regions, the impact was less severe in North America, our largest market, compared to Europe and Asia where COVID restrictions were more significant.\nPricing was positive in the quarter, though not as high as in The Americas Group.\nAs you're aware, our global supply chain organization is managed within this segment.\nThis team continues to collaborate with suppliers to navigate industry-wide raw material supply chain disruptions caused by Winter Storm Uri and Hurricane Ida.\nWe are prepared with ample capacity and are expanding further to better serve customers as raw material availability improves.\nLastly, let me discuss the third quarter trends in the Performance Coatings Group.\nWe continue to see positive momentum, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of growth for this business.\nGroup sales increased by over 17% in the quarter, including a 2% boost from currency translation.\nPricing was in the high single-digit range, and all regions and divisions experienced growth.\nRegionally, sales growth in the quarter was strongest in Europe and Latin America, followed by North America and Asia.\nEvery division in the group grew, with the majority achieving double-digit growth, driven by strong underlying demand, new customer acquisitions, and increased share of wallet.\nStarting with packaging, which achieved strong double-digit growth compared to a high single-digit increase last year.\nSales increased by double digits in every region.\nDemand for food and beverage cans remains strong, and our non-BPA coatings continue to gain traction with existing and new customers.\nNext is General Industrial, the largest division of the group, which recorded its third consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth.\nSales increased by double digits in every region.\nSales were robust across most of our customer segments, led by heavy equipment, containers, and general finishing.\nOur Coil Coatings business continues to perform consistently.\nSales grew by a double-digit percentage for the second consecutive quarter and were positive in all regions.\nThis team continues to excel at winning new accounts in all regions.\nGrowth was led by the construction and appliance sectors.\nAutomotive refinish sales increased by a mid-single-digit percentage.\nThe number of miles traveled is approaching levels seen before the pandemic.\nSales of our products and systems in North America remained robust.\nThe Industrial Wood segment experienced modest growth in the low single digits.\nOur largest market, North America, saw substantial double-digit growth, but this was counterbalanced by significant sales declines in Asia Pacific due to COVID-related closures.\nThe demand for our products in kitchen cabinetry, flooring, and furniture applications continues to be driven by new home construction.\nLet me discuss our capital allocation so far this year before moving on to our outlook.\nWe have given back over $2.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nWe have spent $2.1 billion to acquire 8.075 million shares at an average cost of $265.88 per share.\nWe paid out $442.9 million in dividends, a 20.4% increase.\nWe also invested $248 million in our business through capital expenditures, with about $36 million allocated to our Building our Future project.\nAt the end of the quarter, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.5 times.\nWe also announced the acquisitions of Sika and Specialty Polymer, which are anticipated to be completed in early 2022, if not earlier.\nLet's move on to our outlook.\nWe anticipate continued strong demand in North American professional architectural markets.\nWe expect DIY demand to normalize as people return to work.\nWe anticipate industrial demand to remain strong.\nRaw material availability issues will continue to be a challenge in the fourth quarter, but the situation is improving.\nWe believe we have endured the worst of Hurricane Ida, and supply should continue to improve.\nWe expect to be in a make-and-ship mode and don't anticipate building inventory until the first quarter of 2022.\nRegarding costs, our raw material inflation expectations for the year have increased to the low 20% range from the high teens due to additional pressure since our last guidance.\nWe don't anticipate any significant improvement until well into 2022.\nAll divisions continue to implement price increases as needed to offset these costs.\nWe acknowledge that the timing of price realization will continue to put pressure on margins in the short term.\nAs we've stated before, we expect margin expansion over the long term and maintain our gross margin target of 45% to 48%.\nGiven this context, we expect fourth quarter 2021 consolidated net sales to increase by a mid- to high single-digit percentage compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.\nWe anticipate The Americas Group sales to increase by a mid- to high single-digit percentage, with professional sales at or above the high end of this range and DIY sales returning to more typical levels.\nWe expect Consumer Brands sales to decrease by a mid-teens percentage, including a negative impact of about seven percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture, and we anticipate Performance Coatings sales to increase by a mid-teens percentage.\nOur guidance includes a similar impact on our architectural businesses as a percentage of sales from raw material availability as we experienced in the third quarter.\nFor the full year 2021, we expect consolidated net sales to increase by a high single-digit percentage.\nWe anticipate The Americas Group to increase by a high single-digit percentage; Consumer Brands Group to decrease by a mid-teens percentage, including a negative impact of about four percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture; and Performance Coatings Group to increase by a low 20s percentage.\nWe expect diluted net income per share for 2021 to be between $7.16 and $7.36 compared to $7.36 earned in 2020.\nFull year 2021 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.85 per share and a loss on the Wattyl divestiture of $0.34 per share.\nOn an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2021 earnings per share of $8.35 to $8.55.\nLet me conclude with some additional information that may be helpful for your modeling.\nWe anticipate a slightly improved sequential gross margin in our fourth quarter as additional price increases are implemented.\nWe expect to see a decrease in our fourth quarter operating margin due to the reduction in gross margin, partially offset by leverage on SG&A due to strong sales growth.\nWe will continue to invest across the company to enhance our ability to provide unique solutions to our customers.\nWe plan to open around 80 new stores in the U.S. and Canada in 2021.\nWe'll also focus on sales representatives, capacity and productivity improvements, as well as systems and product innovation.\nWe also plan additional investments in our digital platform for the home center channel.\nThese investments are included in our full year guidance.\nWe expect foreign currency exchange to provide a benefit of approximately 2% in the fourth quarter.\nWe anticipate our 2021 effective tax rate to be slightly below 20%.\nWe expect full year depreciation to be about $270 million and amortization to be about $310 million.\nWe anticipate full year capital expenditures to be approximately $370 million, including about $70 million for our Building our Future project.\nOur interest expense guidance remains unchanged at approximately $340 million.\nWe plan to increase the annual dividend per share by 23.5% for the full year.\nWe expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases.\nWe'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that align with our strategy.\nWe're

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We mention some of these risks in our Securities and Exchange Commission documents.\nJoining me on today's call are Paul McDermott, President and CEO; Steve Riffee, Executive VP and CFO; Karen Filter, Senior VP and General Counsel; Drew Hammond, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer; and Graham Montgomery, VP and Head of Research.\nWe achieved robust financial results in the second quarter despite ongoing economic challenges, demonstrating our portfolio's resilience.\nAs the local economy slowly reopens, we remain focused on ensuring the health and safety of our residents, tenants, employees and their families.\nIn recent months, WashREIT developed and implemented a comprehensive plan to reduce the spread of COVID-19 at our properties.\nWe reached out personally to our office tenants to understand their needs and discuss our approach, ensuring they are comfortable with our implemented protocols.\nTo date, we haven't experienced significant bad debt, and alongside reentry planning, we've been working diligently with financially impacted tenants to finalize deferral arrangements.\nWe're pleased to report that we've largely completed this effort as of today.\nThese are undoubtedly challenging times.\nNevertheless, we've adapted to the new demands of today's operating environment and taken swift, deliberate action to protect and support our residents and tenants.\nI'm extremely proud of the WashREIT team's dedication during this difficult period.\nMoreover, these times have emphasized the importance of social fairness, equity, and justice.\nOur company has responded with a renewed commitment to enhancing diversity, inclusion, and belonging within our organization and community, aiming to create lasting positive change.\nAs we begin the second half of the year, we're increasingly confident in our region's resilience and, consequently, our portfolio's strength.\nOur focus on the Washington metro area provides economic stability compared to other major metropolitan areas.\nThis holds true both historically and during the current downturn.\nThe Washington metro area continues to experience fewer job losses since the pandemic began compared to other large metro areas and the U.S. overall.\nWashington Metro employment decreased by 9% in the second quarter, compared to over 11% for the U.S. as a whole.\nA recent Delta Associates analysis determined that the Washington multifamily market is better positioned to withstand a down cycle than almost all other large metropolitan areas in the nation.\nThis is largely due to the federal government's presence and the corresponding stability of the professional business services sector, which together make up 46% of the D.C. metro economy compared to 25% for the 30 largest metro areas.\nFurthermore, our professional business services sector is more heavily weighted towards the professional, scientific, and technical subsector, which has performed well during this crisis and generated 1.6% job growth year-over-year in June.\nThis sector is expected to recover faster than others and continues to be the primary source of private job creation in the region long-term, according to Delta Associates.\nAs expected, the federal government sector has been the least negatively impacted by the pandemic so far.\nMany federal agencies actually received increased funding, which could lead to additional hiring, especially at critical agencies like the FDA, NIH, and FDA.\nGovernment contractors have been awarded $1.2 billion in contracts year-to-date directly related to the COVID-19 response, according to JLL.\nEmployment trends in the regional information sector show limited disruption and major tech industry investments, including Amazon's HQ2 campus construction and Virginia Tech yard campus.\nThe Washington metro area led the country in Q2 leasing activity, driven by 1.6 million square feet of positive net absorption in Northern Virginia.\nDespite stay-at-home orders, office leasing activity in Northern Virginia only declined 12% in the second quarter compared to the five-year trailing quarterly average, according to CBRE.\nOver half of the leasing activity in Northern Virginia was driven by government contracting services.\nGovernment contractor awards have increased 4% year-over-year due to the government's response to COVID-19.\nTech and government contracting accounted for 60% of our office leasing volume in Northern Virginia last year.\nLooking ahead, we expect demand from these sectors to continue growing.\nUnsurprisingly, Washington D.C. office leasing activity has slowed more than in Northern Virginia due to lower momentum entering this downturn.\nHowever, the impact of local job losses for office-using sectors in D.C. has been limited.\nNo office-using sector lost more than 5% of its total workforce during the second quarter, according to BLS data.\nAdditionally, the number of tours increased substantially in July.\nWe expect our D.C. office portfolio to perform defensively against this backdrop.\nMaryland, Virginia, and D.C. each implemented a phased approach to reopening starting in late May.\nD.C. and Maryland are currently in Phase Two with limited reopenings of shops and restaurants, while Virginia is in Phase Three, allowing all retail and public services to resume with social distancing measures in place.\nWith the implementation of Phase Two reentry protocols, we're seeing increased activity across all our asset classes.\nMultifamily touring and application volumes have tripled since early April for both our same-store and non-same-store assets, with same-store applications trending above prior year levels.\nAfter closing our leasing office, we leveraged our virtual touring capabilities and continued leasing in April and May.\nOnce local social distancing requirements eased, we began offering self-guided tours in June.\nWe recently opened our multifamily amenities and common areas and started offering in-person tours with additional safety precautions.\nThe lease-up of Trove continues to progress and is expected to reach stabilized occupancy in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nWhile the economic shutdown has impacted the original expected pace of leases, we averaged about 16 leases per month during the second quarter and expect to reach breakeven occupancy levels by year-end, followed by steady quarterly NOI growth thereafter.\nOur total lease rate growth for the quarter was a positive 40 basis points, which, combined with our sequential decline in ending occupancy of less than 80 basis points for our stabilized properties, demonstrates the resilience of our value-oriented multifamily portfolio.\nLease rates for our non-same-store portfolio, which includes strong performance from our Class B suburban communities, grew over 2% during the quarter on a blended basis, comprising 2.6% renewal lease rate growth and 1% new lease rate growth.\nOur suburban garden-style apartments offer larger unit sizes, open-air hallways, and less density compared to mid or high-rise buildings, allowing us to benefit from increasing demand for these qualities in the near-term following the pandemic.\nLong-term, expanding our multifamily portfolio to growing suburban markets in the D.C. metro suburbs positions us to capture a larger share of regional household formation and job growth.\nWe began to see increased utilization at all our office properties towards the end of the quarter, most notably at our Northern Virginia office assets, as Northern Virginia is now in Phase Three of reopening.\nIn preparation for property repopulation, we developed a detailed reentry plan emphasizing employee and tenant health and well-being as top priorities.\nWe've contacted our tenants to discuss the plans and protocols we've implemented.\nFeedback on our collaborative approach has been very positive, often strengthening our relationships with tenants.\nWe've upgraded our office buildings with improved ventilation filters, installed directional safety practice signage, contactless opening technology, and protective shields around front office desks, along with various other measures to facilitate safe reentry.\nWe've also established enhanced cleaning protocols, including more frequent cleaning and the use of electrostatic cleaning sheets, and developed elevator and common area safety protocols to reduce the risk of virus transmission.\nOur tenant experience app, NU, which began rolling out in January, has kept us connected with many tenants despite remote work.\nThe Concierge program continues to provide a wide range of on-demand services and has partnered with local vendors and farmers to offer grocery and other essential deliveries.\nWe couldn't have chosen a more critical time to introduce this technology to assist our tenants both professionally and personally during this challenging period.\nOur Space+ program has allowed us to meet changing tenant needs more efficiently with flexible lease terms.\nOur spaces offer tenants quick move-ins, all-inclusive pricing, flexibility for short and long-term planning, as well as privacy and independence, not just for brand building, but now more importantly than ever, for control over the health of the tenant's office.\nAll our Space+ tenants have control over their own private space, which is becoming increasingly important in this COVID-19 environment.\nIn a climate where many tenants are moving slower on larger and longer requirements, flexibility is key, and Space+ is playing a crucial role in meeting tenant needs.\nWe entered 2020 expecting to see sequential quarterly growth, driven by renovation-led value creation and commercial lease commencements.\nWhile the pandemic has disrupted the timing of that growth, our key growth drivers remain intact.\nWe have structured our multifamily portfolio to maintain growth drivers while potentially capturing that value for shareholders as normal activities resume.\nWe've invested in Class B properties in submarkets with larger than usual rent gaps between Class A and B units and limited new supply, positioning us for quick recovery and preserving future value-add rent growth from renovations.\nOur 2019 strategic allocation expanded our renovation pipeline to over 3,000 units, representing five years of growth at attractive returns.\nThough most of our portfolio doesn't directly compete with new supply, Northern Virginia, where 80% of our multifamily assets are located, is expected to see a 24% decrease in new deliveries over the next year.\nThe pandemic will likely delay projected construction starts in late 2020, reducing deliveries in 2022 and 2023.\nOverall, the Washington metro region faces a severe housing shortage and our research supports our belief in future growth opportunities.\nWe have significant growth potential with Trove, having largely completed the capital investment, with Phase Two finishing in a couple months.\nWhile the disruption affected the initial leasing pace, we anticipate reaching breakeven occupancy in Q4 and achieving quarterly NOI growth through stabilization in 2021 and 2022.\nIn our office portfolio, embedded growth comes from future move-ins for high-quality space, value-oriented pricing, and move-in ready spaces with flexible lease terms.\nWe expect signed leases to continue occupying space, boosting occupancy in Q4 and throughout 2021.\nMany of our speculative leasing opportunities, which had strong momentum pre-pandemic, are in our prime assets like Watergate 600, Arlington Tower, and Silverline Center, as well as our Space+ program, well-suited for demand during this cautious transition period.\nAlthough physical tours paused, they've resumed, but decision-making remains slower than usual as entry is being more carefully considered by potential tenants.\nWe believe these leasing opportunities will materialize, it's just a matter of when.\nI'll begin by discussing our cash collection performance before reviewing our Q2 results and outlook for the rest of 2020.\nOur multifamily collections remain very strong, demonstrating the resilience of our submarkets, industry mix, and lower average rent-to-income ratio of 26%.\nWe collected over 99% of cash rents in Q2 and over 99% of contractual rents.\nOur rent collections through the first three weeks of July have also been strong.\nWhile we're offering deferred payment plans to residents financially impacted by the pandemic, deferrals have been relatively low, averaging less than 0.4% of total monthly rental income.\nOur monthly multifamily collection performance continues to exceed national averages.\nWe collected 99% of cash rents in June compared to 96% nationally per NMHC.\nWe attribute our outperformance partly to high exposure to industries that have fared well during this crisis and lower exposure to underperforming industries.\nCOVID-19's impact on the Washington metro market has been mainly limited to three sectors, accounting for about 75% of local job losses.\nThe impact has been more widespread across sectors in the U.S. overall, with those same three sectors representing less than 60% of total national losses through June.\nThus, the U.S. is experiencing job losses across more industries than our region.\nThe Washington metro market's relative strength reflects the stability provided by technology and federal contracting.\nWe monitor our residents' industries, and our exposure is heavily weighted towards the most resilient economic sectors and less weighted to the most impacted industries, resulting in very high collection rates and stable cash flows.\nWe collected 97% of cash rents in Q2 and over 99% of contractual rents, excluding deferred rent.\nAs of July 22, our July collections are on par with the same period in June.\nSimilar to our multifamily resident industry mix, our office tenants are relatively more weighted to stronger economic sectors than the U.S. overall, which has helped us experience limited bad debt so far.\nWe've agreed to defer $1.2 million of rent for office tenants, expecting to collect over 85% of that deferred rent by the end of 2021, with the remainder thereafter.\nWe believe our efforts to derisk our portfolio by selling all single-tenant office assets and 75% of our previous retail exposure, including all power centers, and reallocating that capital to our multifamily portfolio is proving valuable in these economic times.\nRetail now comprises just 6% of NOI, and while retail tenants have struggled the most, we collected 72% of retail rents in Q2.\nExcluding deferred rent, our collection rate was about 90% in Q2 and 91% during the first three weeks of July.\nYear-to-date, we've only incurred about $770,000 of bad debt expense related to retail tenants, with $638,000 of that related to COVID-19.\nWe'll continue to monitor their strength and ability as the economy progresses.\nWe've agreed to defer approximately $1 million of rent for retail tenants, expecting to collect over 50% of that rent by the end of 2021.\nThis assumes our region continues to gradually reopen through year-end.\nTo date, we haven't incurred material bad debts related to COVID-19.\nOverall, we've only deferred a small portion of rent and the expected cash NOI impact is less than $0.01 per share through the end of 2021.\nWhile we've possibly experienced the most disruptive part of the pandemic, uncertainty regarding its duration and future impact remains.\nWe currently believe Q2 represented the most challenging quarter.\nHowever, future and ongoing economic disruption could result in bad debt greater than what we've incurred to date.\nWe'll continue to monitor future developments and proactively address them as they occur.\nRegarding the balance sheet, we have a strong liquidity position with about $530 million available as of June 30, no significant capital commitments for the rest of the year, and no remaining maturities in 2020.\nAs of June 30, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 6.1 times, at the lower end of our target range.\nWe prepaid our $250 million 4.95% bonds in early April, and we can access the capital markets to further term out debt when it makes sense.\nWe expect to remain well within our bank and bond covenants and have access to our mostly undrawn line of credit if needed.\nBased on current projections, we've reduced 2020 assumed capital expenditures by about $40 million compared to our initial guidance.\nThis includes nearly $30 million less in assumed capital expenditures and $11 million less in development spending as we no longer expect to break ground on the Riverside development this year.\nOur capital expenditure reductions include nonessential building improvements, tenant improvements and leasing costs, prospective leasing, and lower multifamily renovation capex.\nOur future multifamily renovation pipeline remains intact, though we're suspending the program until market disruptions subside.\nWe plan to allocate the renovation capital later when the market allows for rent increases to deliver appropriate ROI.\nAs we navigate the second half of the year, we'll continue exploring opportunities to further reduce nonessential capex spending to bolster our liquidity.\nLooking ahead, we're confident in our ability to execute our short-term goals of providing payment flexibility to residents and tenants in need while maintaining the operational flexibility necessary to achieve our long-term goals.\nAs Paul mentioned, we posted solid Q2 results despite the challenging operating environment.\nI'll discuss those results before addressing our future outlook.\nWe reported core FFO of $0.39 per diluted share.\nOverall, same-store NOI declined 4.5% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 3.5% on a cash basis, due to same-store office NOI decline of 4.8% on a GAAP basis and 3.7% on a cash basis, as well as bad debt expenses related to COVID-19 of about $720,000.\nThe same-store office NOI decline was driven by expected decline in parking income and increased bad debt expenses related to COVID-19.\nExcluding the decline in parking income and increased bad debt expenses compared to our prior 2020 expectations, same-store office NOI would have increased slightly year-over-year.\nOur multifamily same-store NOI increased by 0.7% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 0.8% year-over-year on a cash basis.\nThe company achieved 40 basis points of blended year-over-year lease rate growth, driven by strong performance from our suburban assets in our non-same-store portfolio.\nSame-store new lease rates declined by just under 4%, while renewal rates increased by over 1.4%, reflecting a blended lease rate decline of approximately 40 basis points.\nLease rates for non-same-store properties increased by over 2% during the quarter on average, with renewal rates rising by 2.6% and new lease rates growing by 1%.\nOur same-store multifamily portfolio is currently about 94% occupied, and our total portfolio occupancy exceeds 94%, with 97% of units leased.\nSame-store net operating income declined in our remaining retail properties, which we classify as \"other\", dropping 24.6% on a GAAP basis and 22.1% on a cash basis, mainly due to increased credit losses, including amounts owed by tenants affected by COVID-19 that are unlikely to be collected.\nRecoveries also decreased compared to the same period last year.\nThe total write-off impact of COVID-19 in the quarter was about $560,000, including straight-line rents and lease intangibles, with a cash impact of approximately $335,000.\nRegarding leasing activity for the quarter, although the economic shutdown slowed velocity and tours, we finalized roughly 20,000 square feet of new office leases and 15,000 square feet of office renewals in Q2.\nWe achieved rental rate increases of 0.8% on a GAAP basis and -2.3% on a cash basis for new leases, and 19.4% on a GAAP basis and 1.9% on a cash basis for renewals.\nCost-saving measures reduced operating expenses by about $848,000 in Q2, net of tenant recoveries and expenses related to preparing our office buildings for reoccupation.\nThe Q2 operational cost savings primarily included reduced utility usage, lower maintenance and repair costs, decreased security expenses, and reduced tenant event and amenity costs compared to our original forecast.\nLet's discuss our financial outlook.\nWe are now four months into the pandemic.\nWhile we cannot predict the ongoing severity of the pandemic or the strength of the recovery, we believe we can forecast the impact of COVID-19 on our NOI and interest expense for the rest of 2020, excluding future bad debt, with certain caveats.\nI will outline the effects we're seeing on various financial performance metrics.\nOur projections assume that the gradual reopening will continue uninterrupted through year-end.\nMultifamily occupancy decreased to 94% in June and has remained stable through July.\nAs confinement measures eased and we increased staffing in our leasing offices, we've observed a significant increase in tours and applications.\nTotal application volumes have tripled from early April lows, and same-store applications have been over 30% higher than last year's levels since late May.\nWe anticipate that the ongoing increase in leasing activity will lead to a gradual rise in occupancy to 95% by year-end.\nWe didn't raise rents on 12-month or longer renewals in Q2, which affected our NOI growth as we typically achieve significant rent increases during the strong Q2 leasing season, especially given our strong lease rate growth in March.\nConsequently, our renewal retention increased to 60%.\nWhile higher renewal retention helped maintain occupancy and preserve our seasonal rent roll during these uncertain times, it didn't fully offset the impact on occupancy from reduced new leasing volumes.\nLower growth in new and renewal lease rates, as well as decreased move-in and other fee income, were partially counterbalanced by operating expense savings in Q2.\nThe majority of the expected full-year impact of COVID-19-related operating expense savings was recognized in Q2.\nExcluding bad debt impact, we expect COVID-19's effect on our multifamily NOI to result in a reduction of about $0.03 per share compared to our initial core FFO guidance for 2020.\nOverall, we had previously anticipated significant multifamily growth in 2020, which is now likely to be postponed until 2021 and beyond.\nAs Paul mentioned, we have a five-year pipeline of value-add renovations to implement once conditions improve and it's appropriate to resume such growth.\nWe still expect future NOI growth from Trove, which I'll discuss next.\nTrove is on track to deliver Phase II in Q4.\nOur lease-up had just begun when social distancing measures halted on-site tours.\nHowever, we've been successfully converting virtual tours into signed leases.\nWhile virtual touring continues to be successful, we expect the lease-up to take longer than initially anticipated and will likely result in a loss between $600,000 and $700,000 in 2020.\nThis translates to a negative impact on core FFO of approximately $0.01 per share compared to our initial guidance.\nAs Paul also mentioned, we expect to reach breakeven occupancy near year-end and achieve stabilization in Q4 2021.\nTherefore, Trove should provide substantial growth in 2021 and further year-over-year growth in 2022.\nMoving on to commercial properties.\nTenant improvement build-outs for upcoming lease commencements are expected to continue without interruption.\nWe have over 55,000 square feet, representing about 150 basis points of future increased occupancy, in signed leases that haven't yet commenced.\nAlthough physical tours had stopped, they resumed towards the end of the quarter and increased substantially through July to just below pre-COVID-19 levels.\nOverall decision-making has slowed as the pace of Phase III entry has, in many cases, allowed prospective tenants more time.\nAdditionally, we are negotiating lease extensions with several tenants who were previously expected to vacate.\nOur previous 2020 revenue expectations included speculative office lease commencements that have been affected by the current economic disruption and are now likely to be substantially executed in 2021.\nThe majority of this leasing was anticipated to occur during Q3 and Q4 at high-quality spaces across Watergate 600, Silverline Center, Arlington Tower, and Space+.\nLeasing momentum has been strongest at these locations.\nWe expect the impact of reduced speculative leasing to be only partially offset by higher revenue from lease renewals and extensions.\nWe have minimal commercial lease expirations for the remainder of 2020, limiting the downside risk of our internal leasing estimates.\nOffice lease expirations represent about 4% of our office revenues and less than 2% of our overall revenue.\nAs many tenants opt to delay long-term decisions, short-term lease extensions and renewal activity could trend higher as the year progresses.\nParking revenue has decreased as people are not driving to their offices.\nWe currently project that parking revenue will decline by over $1.3 million for the remainder of the year.\nHowever, this estimate could change if the shutdown is more prolonged than we've assumed.\nConversely, once the economy recovers, we may experience an increase in parking income from higher utilization as tenant transportation preferences shift away from public transit.\nWe are already observing signs of increased transient parking at many of our properties.\nCurrently, we anticipate achieving additional operating cost savings of approximately $750,000 for the rest of the year, assuming a gradual increase in office utilization over the remaining months.\nThis amount is net of expenses associated with preparing our buildings for reentry and the cost savings we expect to pass along to our tenants.\nExcluding future bad debt, we expect the impact of COVID-19 on our office and other NOI to result in a negative impact of about $0.08 per share compared to our initial core FFO guidance for 2020.\nMost of that impact will occur during the second half of the year, as we previously expected a ramp-up during that period that we now anticipate will occur throughout 2021.\nPartially offsetting the negative impact of COVID-19 on our business is a reduction in our expected interest expense by $0.04 per share relative to our initial core FFO 2020 guidance, excluding any future refinancings to further extend debt maturities.\nIn total, we expect the impact of COVID-19 on NOI and interest expense to result in a negative impact of approximately $0.08 per share compared to our initial guidance for 2020.\nWe are not updating other guidance assumptions at this time.\nThe majority of the impact will occur during the second half of the year, as we previously anticipated a ramp-up during that period that we now expect to occur throughout 2021.\nOverall, we're actually slightly ahead of our original budget for the first six months of 2020, despite experiencing a historically challenging four-month period.\nAs we've just explained, much of the growth we had planned for the second half of 2020 appears to be deferred, but we believe it remains intact for the future.\nIn conclusion, while we are operating in a challenging environment, we are confident in our ability to effectively manage through this period of uncertainty while preserving the embedded growth potential of our assets.\nOur value-oriented portfolio has demonstrated resilience as we absorb the near-term impact, which is further underscored by our strong rent collection performance and the proven stability of the Washington metro economy.\nMoreover, our sustained multifamily lease rate growth and stabilizing occupancy trends highlight the value of our research-driven capital allocation strategy, which has led us to invest in well-located residential units that will be in the path of growth once the economy recovers.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Let's begin by reviewing our safety warnings.\nVarious elements such as climate, regulatory changes, market competition, and other risks detailed in the Company's SEC documents can influence outcomes.\nI'd like to discuss our updated projections for 2021 at the midpoint of the year.\nIn our March outlook, we presented the top six forecasts, and in May, we added that net income would increase more rapidly than revenue.\nI want to compare our initial predictions with our actual performance for the first half of the year.\nRegarding revenue, we anticipated a low double-digit increase, but we're now seeing a 25% growth at the halfway point.\nWe projected gross profit margins to be comparable to previous years, and we're currently at 39%, which is consistent with our forecast.\nWe expected some increases in operating expenses due to growth initiatives, but as a percentage of sales, we're actually down 1%.\nWe anticipated interest expenses to be similar to 2020, but they've decreased by 30%.\nWe projected our tax rate to be in the mid-20% range by year-end, and while we're currently at 31% compared to 23%, we expect this to align with our forecast due to tax benefits in the fourth quarter.\nWe aimed for a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2 to 2.5 times as we built up inventory, and we're currently at 2.5 times, but expect this to decrease in the second half, potentially falling below 2 barring any acquisitions.\nNet income is growing significantly faster than revenue, at 86% compared to 25%.\nWe're now predicting that our EBITDA for the year will grow more rapidly than revenue, with a 29% increase for the first half.\nCurrently, our business is performing well.\nWe continue to benefit from favorable market conditions.\nOur cotton-related products, particularly our insecticide Bidrin, are performing strongly due to active plant bug populations.\nWe anticipate a successful year for Bidrin and expect our defoliant Folex to perform well, especially in West Texas.\nCorn soil insecticides are looking promising for 2022, with some sales expected in this quarter and in the fourth quarter and first quarter of next year.\nOur customers are actively securing products, with reports of up to 300 different products being on allocation in the United States.\nWe're well-positioned with our six North American plants.\nWe face some challenges with inbound freight from Asia, though this only affects about 10-12% of our imports.\nContainer costs have increased dramatically from $3,500 to $20,000, significantly impacting overall freight revenue.\nWe've been relatively successful in implementing price increases to offset rising costs, and we're continuously monitoring and addressing cost changes.\nI'll now hand over to David.\nWe plan to submit our Form 10-Q today.\nAs mentioned in previous discussions, our company operates in industries considered essential infrastructure in all our operating countries.\nThroughout 2020 and the first half of 2021, our customers, suppliers, employees, and operations have continued largely unaffected by the pandemic.\nOur net sales for the second quarter of 2021 increased by 29% to $135 million, compared to $105 million in the same period last year.\nUS sales grew by 44% to $84 million, while international sales increased by 10% to $51 million.\nInternational sales made up 38% of total net sales, down from 44% in the same quarter last year.\nOur US Crop business saw improved gross profit on increased sales, which were up by approximately 40%.\nHowever, our factory performance faced short-term challenges, including a delayed production start in our LA facility and mechanical testing at our access plant.\nThese issues have largely been resolved.\nOverall, our gross margin percentage remained strong at 43%.\nOur Non-Crop gross margin increased by 39%, with sales up by 55% compared to the same quarter last year.\nWe saw improved sales of our US Dibrom products and pest strips.\nWhile we had higher Envance technology license income in the first half of 2021, we recorded lower license income in the second quarter.\nWe also experienced lower factory recovery in Q2 2021 due to the previously mentioned reasons.\nOverall, our gross margin percentage remained strong at 46%.\nOur Q2 2021 international sales increased by 10%, with a significant 35% increase in gross margin.\nMore than half of this improvement came from our newly acquired businesses, AgNova in Australia and Agrinos biologicals, both of which generate above-average margins for our international operations.\nOverall, our gross margin improved to 31% from 25% in the same period last year.\nOur overall cost of goods remained steady at 61% of net sales.\nWe're experiencing some upward pressure on costs for certain products due to raw material sourcing.\nWe're also seeing significant increases in inbound ocean freight, particularly from Asia, though our exposure is limited.\nWe've implemented selective price increases to offset this cost inflation.\nThis graph illustrates how factory performance affected our overall gross margin.\nIn Q2 2021, factory costs were 3.3% of sales, compared to 0.6% in Q2 2020.\nDespite this, our margin percentage remained consistent for both quarters.\nOperating expenses for the quarter increased by $9.5 million or 28% compared to the same period last year.\nHowever, expenses as a percentage of net sales remained steady at 32%.\nThe increased costs included activities from two newly acquired businesses, accounting for about a third of the increase.\nThis included a $1 million charge in additional deferred consideration for the Australian business acquired in Q4 2020, which has exceeded expectations.\nOur outbound freight costs, which are largely volume-driven, increased by 34%.\nThis increase, which accounted for a quarter of the total rise, was influenced by sales volume, customer mix, destinations, products, and some freight inflation.\nOther increases included legal expenses and higher incentive compensation accruals linked to business performance.\nAs shown in this slide, our operating income was 33% higher than the same period in 2020.\nWe recorded lower interest expenses in Q2 2021 compared to last year.\nTwo main factors are at play.\nThe interest rate on our loan has decreased due to the US government's economic stimulus policy.\nAdditionally, our borrowings have reduced because of debt repayment from 12 months of business cash generation, partially offset by some acquisitions.\nOur effective tax rate rose to 32% in Q2 2021 compared to 29% in the same period last year.\nThe primary cause for the higher effective rate is the non-tax-deductible earn-out expense from the Australian acquisition.\nThese elements combined to affect the bottom line.\nWe're reporting net income of $5.1 million versus $3.9 million last year, a 32% quarter-over-quarter increase.\nIn the first half of 2021, our sales grew by 25% and gross margins increased by 24% in absolute terms.\nOur main divisions - US Crop, US Non-Crop, and International - all contributed to this impressive performance.\nOperating expenses have risen, mainly due to businesses acquired in late 2020, increased performance-based compensation, and costs related to volume changes like freight and warehousing.\nOverall, operating costs increased by 21% compared to a 29% rise in net sales.\nOperating costs as a percentage of sales improved to 34% in 2020 from 35% the previous year.\nInterest expense has decreased by 30% due to cash generated over the past 12 months.\nTax expenses increased in line with financial performance.\nOverall, net income grew by 86%.\nFocusing on the balance sheet, we increased cash generation from operations by 41% in Q2 2021 compared to the same quarter last year.\nWorking capital remained relatively stable midway through the annual cycle.\nThis performance includes the expanded scope from businesses acquired in Q4 2020.\nWe continued our strategy of acquiring attractive assets to fill portfolio gaps during the quarter.\nWe paid a $10 million deposit for a product acquisition, taking control of the asset at the start of Q3.\nAt the end of June 2020, our inventories stood at $175 million compared to $181 million the previous year.\nExcluding products and entities acquired since December 2019, our base inventory has reduced by 11% from $177 million to $158 million this year.\nWe believe we've managed inventory well during this phase of the company's annual cycle.\nOur current year-end inventory target is $150 million, compared to $164 million at the end of 2020.\nThis target assumes minimal pandemic impact, normal weather patterns, and excludes acquisitions.\nRegarding liquidity, we use consolidated EBITDA as defined in our credit facility agreement to determine leverage.\nOur consolidated EBITDA for the four quarters ending June 30, 2021, was $59 million, up from $52 million in the same period last year.\nAs a result, credit facility availability increased to $57 million on June 30, 2021, from $49 million the previous year.\nWe've been managing debt effectively while progressing through the annual cycle and continuing to invest in the business.\nOur credit facility was set to expire in June 2022, but we've executed a new agreement with slightly larger capacity and improved covenants.\nWe're optimistic about our liquidity position for the remainder of this year and beyond.\nIn the first half of 2021, sales increased by 25%, gross margins by 24%, operating expenses decreased relative to net sales, interest expense reduced, and net income improved by 86%.\nOn the balance sheet, accounts receivable grew due to strong sales, inventories were well-controlled, working capital remained flat during the quarter, and debt is lower than last year despite three acquisitions in the past 12 months.\nWe've secured a new credit facility with improved availability.\nReflecting on our November 2020 three-to-five-year forecast, we projected our existing product sales to grow from $468 million to $507 million by 2023 and $527 million by 2025, representing a 2.5% annual increase.\nFor our new product pipeline, we anticipated adding $37 million in three years and $109 million over five years through product differentiation and combining molecules.\nWe projected acquisition growth to reach about $100 million over five years, starting at a lower level than our average of $40 million per year.\nOur existing product line forecast remains unchanged, but we're seeing a reset with new products.\nWe're now running about a year behind schedule, expecting to hit the $109 million target between 2026 and 2027.\nWe remain confident in meeting our acquisition targets.\nFor green solutions, we projected aggressive growth of 10% CAGR globally, with our initial $22 million growing by $48 million in three years and $118 million by 2025.\nFor the first half of 2021, we're at $17 million and expect to reach $32-35 million, a 50% increase.\nWe're targeting 40% annual growth to reach $70 million and $140 million, potentially including acquisitions.\nOur portfolio has expanded from 80 to over 100 unique biological solutions globally, spanning biofertilizers, microbials, biochemicals, and biostimulants.\nFor the Agrinos products acquired in the US, we're conducting 14 different crop trials this year.\nHere are the paraphrased sentences:\nFurthermore, our AMGUARD Non-Crop division has conducted nine turf experiments.\nWhen we discuss trials, we're referring to the overall scope of a particular project direction, not individual plots.\nHowever, when considering actual plots, we're dealing with a total of 1,500 test areas.\nThis pertains solely to our green solutions, specifically Agrinos in the United States.\nWe had anticipated achieving approximately $35 million in additional sales by 2023 and $130 million by 2025.\nOur team has determined that within the US, focusing on just four crops and excluding international markets, we're slightly behind schedule, essentially operating about a year behind our initial projections.\nAllow me to explain the reasons for this delay.\nThere are three main factors we consider for this initiative to gain momentum, starting with the equipment's performance, which we believe has been successfully beta tested in all aspects, including cartridge tracking, refilling, applications, and prescription input.\nThe second area involves developing a range of products for our SaS customers, which are soil-applied solutions allowing for multiple product use.\nLast year, we primarily offered our core products, typically associated with nematode or insect control.\nWe also have a micronutrient and zinc product available.\nThis year, several customers successfully applied multiple products, using three different options.\nHowever, many growers chose to postpone their investment until the 2022 season when more options become available.\nWe haven't provided a clear picture of our future product range.\nWe're enthusiastic about 2022, as it marks the first time we'll be able to include both soybean and cotton solutions for our growers to apply.\nUntil now, corn growers have only applied corn solutions, but they typically grow soybeans as well.\nIn the Southern market, corn growers often cultivate cotton in addition to soybeans and corn.\nThis allows for greater utilization and aligns with SIMPAS's intended design.\nOur portfolio expands even further in 2023.\nBy the 2023 season, we'll offer 42 different products on that platform.\nThis range will continue to grow over time.\nAs we engage with growers, distributors, and retailers, we'll gain insight into their specific needs.\nAdditionally, we have third-party products from various companies eager to have their products registered and approved for the SIMPAS system.\nBased on last year's experience, we've observed that our SIMPAS users typically have farms twice the size of our SmartBox users.\nSmartBox users generally treat about half their field at full rate, so if they have 1,000 acres with 500 acres of corn, they'll apply insecticide and nematicide to those 500 acres, while the 500 acres of soybeans remain untreated.\nHowever, we're noticing that farmers using SIMPAS have farms twice the size, and with just our three available products, they're purchasing four times the amount in terms of revenue.\nThis aligns with our vision that SIMPAS would significantly increase utilization of multiple solutions compared to SmartBox.\nWe've calculated that at current corn prices, a mere 0.5 bushel per acre increase over a five-year period would cover the cost of a SIMPAS system.\nThis demonstrates that it's not a major investment when viewed from this perspective.\nWe anticipate SIMPAS solutions to yield increases in the double digits or higher.\nFor the 2022 season, despite the Delta variant's impact, we've managed to arrange several operations where we can conduct field demonstrations and bring in people from various locations, including Brazil, to observe the system's performance.\nThese demonstrations also showcase the return on investment.\nLastly, we've equipped our sales team with comprehensive SIMPAS information, enabling them to explain the system to everyone in the chain, from third parties to distributors, retailers writing prescriptions, agronomists inputting information, and demonstrating ROI to growers.\nWe've created an iPad-based resource covering five main areas: SIMPAS Solutions, Cartridges, the SIMPAS experience, and Logistics.\nEach of these topics branches out into additional tabs, resulting in what I call an A-to-Z guide with 32 different tabs for our sales team to use and share with retailers.\nFor example, if you examine the SIMPAS Solutions section, you can access information on any of our current product offerings.\nYou can also view the \"Coming Soon\" section to see the table I presented earlier.\nSimilarly, in the Business Builder section, a retailer can find answers to questions about prescriptions and business models, providing greater confidence that promoting SIMPAS benefits everyone involved.\nThis summarizes our current progress, and we'll continue to provide updates as we move forward.\nI'm continuously encouraging the team to refine their approach and offer regular updates on our projected status.\nBefore we open the floor for questions, I'd like to address a couple of inquiries that arose last quarter.\nOne question concerned the returns on our acquisitions.\nWe've discussed making acquisitions at 5 to 6 times EBITDA, compared to the industry standard of 10 to 12 times EBITDA, focusing on opportunities we believe will be beneficial while avoiding those we deem too expensive.\nOur track record of over 50 products, five manufacturing sites, three closed delivery systems, and eight businesses demonstrates our success in this area.\nWe analyzed the period from 2014 to 2020, which represents the down cycle from 2013 to present, considering the actual cash paid for these mixed businesses and product lines.\nExamining the incremental benefit using the current 2021 projection, which appears solid, we calculated the incremental EBITDA and found it falls within the 5 to 6 times range, with a return on capital employed of about 10%.\nIf we were to allocate current overheads from our existing business proportionally to these new acquisitions, the figure would shift to between 7 and 8 times.\nA second question pertained to our working capital management, focusing on how we make decisions, measure performance, and which metrics we use.\nThis can be broken down into three areas.\nFor external acquisitions, we employ a comprehensive model that considers product sales, cost of goods, assigned OpEx and interest, and working capital to project earnings per share over a 10-year period.\nWe then evaluate the internal rate of return, acquisition payback period, and the 10-year P&L to guide our acquisition decisions.\nRegarding internal investments like those mentioned in our new product pipeline, SIMPAS, or green solutions, we use a similar approach to acquisitions.\nWe project performance to maturity, typically within a five to seven year timeframe, assessing short-term, mid-term, and long-term returns to prioritize our internal growth initiatives.\nLastly, we make decisions about regional working capital deployment.\nOur more established businesses, such as our domestic operations or our 20-year-old Mexico business, tend to yield higher returns.\nWhen entering new territories, particularly in Central and South America, we often face longer credit terms.\nWhile we try to offset this with extended payment terms to our suppliers, we sometimes need to make strategic decisions.\nFor instance, we had limited involvement in Brazil previously, but in 2019 we acquired a business there and are currently expanding it, though it doesn't meet the same return standards as our more established operations.\nOverall, we consider the short-term, mid-term, and long-term returns to determine what's in the best interest of the company for all these decisions.\nWith that, Brock, we can now open the floor for any questions from the audience.\nSummary: ",

implement its growth strategy, delivering excellent sales results this quarter while maintaining pricing discipline.\nF&G's recent entry into the bank and broker-dealer channel has exceeded expectations, with strong momentum continuing into the fourth quarter.\nAdditionally, F&G's investment portfolio is performing well in the current market conditions.\nChris and his team successfully streamlined F&G's operations in the third quarter by agreeing to sell F&G Reinsurance to Aspida Holdings, an Ares Management Corporation subsidiary.\nThis divestiture was primarily motivated by the loss of tax benefits for this third-party offshore reinsurance platform following FNF's acquisition of F&G.\nAs part of the deal, F&G also established a mutually beneficial annuity flow reinsurance partnership.\nThe sale of F&G Reinsurance is an excellent outcome for F&G, its clients, employees, and FNF shareholders.\nThe deal is expected to be finalized before the end of the year.\nChris will soon provide more details on F&G's third-quarter performance.\nMoving forward, we remain dedicated to generating significant long-term value for our shareholders through our capital allocation strategy.\nWe recently announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per share, representing a 9% increase for the fourth quarter.\nAlong with this announcement, we declared our intention to target $500 million in share repurchases over the next 12 months, subject to market conditions.\nAs Randy mentioned, we achieved record adjusted pre-tax title earnings and our best quarterly adjusted pre-tax title margin since Q3 2003 in the third quarter, benefiting from the delayed spring selling season and sustained refinance momentum.\nIn Q3, we generated adjusted pre-tax title earnings of $528 million, a 30% increase compared to Q3 2019.\nOur adjusted pre-tax title margin was 21.2%, up 260 basis points from the previous year's quarter.\nWe saw a 40% increase in direct orders closed, driven by an 87% rise in daily refinance orders closed and an 8% increase in daily purchase orders closed, offset by a 16% decrease in total commercial orders closed.\nTotal commercial revenue was $216 million, down from $301 million in the same quarter last year, due to a 16% decrease in closed orders and a 14% decline in total commercial fee per file.\nIn Q3, total orders opened averaged 13,200 per day, with July at 13,300, August at 13,500, and September at 13,000.\nOctober saw total orders opened exceed 11,800 per day as we continue to observe a strong recovery in purchase activity and sustained strength in the refinance market.\nDaily purchase orders opened increased by 12% in the quarter compared to the previous year.\nIn October, daily purchase orders initiated showed a 15% increase compared to the previous year.\nDaily refinance orders opened saw an 83% rise compared to the third quarter of 2019.\nRefinance orders initiated daily in October increased by 71% compared to the prior year.\nThe total number of commercial orders opened grew by 4% compared to the third quarter of 2019.\nThroughout the quarter, we observed consistent growth in daily commercial open orders, with the third quarter showing a 32% sequential increase from the second quarter.\nDaily total commercial orders opened in October were up 1% compared to October 2019.\nOur third quarter was highlighted by significant accomplishments as we persist in investing in our digital technology initiatives, as mentioned by Randy.\nWe've been putting resources into technology and innovation aimed at enhancing our current systems and improving our customers' experience when working with FNF.\nOne such initiative is our StartSafe program, which reached a major milestone in the third quarter.\nWe delivered over 800,000 digital opening packages to buyers and sellers involved in residential purchase and refinance transactions, with a promising 60% completion rate.\nThe high completion rate indicates that consumers are prepared to embrace a new real estate experience and a different way of interacting with title companies.\nGiven the widespread pandemic and our current virtual environment, it's an opportune time to accelerate this adoption.\nWe will continue to focus on using technology to increase efficiency throughout the title process, which will better serve real estate agents and lenders, improve their productivity, reduce fraud, and enhance security.\nLooking ahead, we anticipate the fourth quarter to show seasonal moderation following an exceptionally strong third quarter.\nWhile predicting the impacts of COVID-19 on our business remains challenging, we will continue to actively manage our expense structure while investing in technology to further reduce costs and expand market share.\nF&G maintains its growth momentum following the second quarter's record sales of fixed indexed annuities.\nWe experienced robust sales in the third quarter while maintaining our pricing discipline.\nTotal retail sales of $1.1 billion in the third quarter represented a 34% increase from the previous year, with core fixed index annuity (FIA) sales reaching $815 million, up 38% from the prior year.\nWe see significant potential for growth as we continue to gain market share in our primary independent agent channel and make progress in new channels.\nIn late June, we successfully expanded into the financial institutions channel with one of the country's largest independent broker-dealers, and our efforts are already yielding results.\nWe generated $189 million in new annuity sales through this channel in the third quarter, and we believe we've only begun to tap into the opportunities in the bank and broker-dealer channels.\nWith strong sales results, we increased our average assets under management (AAUM) to $27 billion, driven by approximately $400 million in net new business flows during the period.\nRegarding spread results, our total product net investment spread was 261 basis points in the third quarter, while the FIA net investment spread was 347 basis points.\nOur spread results exceed historical trends and demonstrate our continued commitment to pricing discipline to achieve targeted spreads.\nThe solid spread result translated to adjusted net earnings of $74 million for the quarter.\nMost importantly, our investment portfolio continues to perform exceptionally well.\nAs of September 30, the portfolio's net unrealized gain position grew to $1.2 billion, increasing by approximately $600 million in the quarter.\nThe credit quality within the portfolio also remained strong.\nFor the nine-month period ending September 30, we incurred credit-related impairments, which we consider true economic losses, of only $17 million or six basis points of the total portfolio.\nThis falls significantly below our anticipated product pricing, indicating that the portfolio is performing according to expectations.\nWe remain assured of our financial strength and stability.\nOur robust financial position at the onset of the pandemic has enabled us to effectively manage economic challenges while expanding our operations.\nCredit impairments so far this year have led to a slight 5-point reduction in our RBC ratio.\nFurthermore, rating downgrades have caused a manageable 14-point decrease year-to-date, and we anticipate this trend to reverse as markets recover in the long run.\nDespite the expected cumulative impact of credit migrations and potential rating downgrades, we anticipate concluding the year with a robust RBC ratio meeting or surpassing our 400% goal.\nIn conclusion, our sales department is operating at peak efficiency.\nWe consistently generate and maintain stable net investment spread and earnings, and we're assured of our investment portfolio and capital position.\nWe achieved $3 billion in overall revenue during the third quarter.\nThe Title segment produced about $2.5 billion, F&G generated $442 million, and the Corporate segment contributed $50 million.\nNet earnings for the third quarter were $378 million, including $73 million in net recognized gains compared to $4 million in the same period last year, primarily due to mark-to-market accounting for equity and preferred stock securities, regardless of whether these were sold or retained in our investment portfolio.\nExcluding net recognized gains, our total revenue reached $2.9 billion, up from $2.2 billion in the third quarter of 2019.\nAdjusted net earnings from ongoing operations amounted to $435 million, or $1.48 per diluted share.\nThe Title segment contributed $391 million, F&G added $74 million, and the Corporate and Other segment reported an adjusted net loss of $30 million.\nExcluding $3 million in net recognized losses, our Title segment generated $2.5 billion in total revenue for the third quarter, an increase from $2.2 billion in the same period of 2019.\nDirect premiums rose by 11% compared to the third quarter of 2019.\nAgency revenue increased by 19%, while escrow, title-related, and other fees grew by 14% year-over-year.\nPersonnel expenses increased by 7%, while other operating costs decreased by 2%.\nOverall, the Title business achieved a 21.2% adjusted pre-tax title margin, marking a 260 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2019.\nInterest income in the Title and Corporate segments totaled $31 million, a $26 million decrease from the previous year's quarter due to lower short-term interest rates on our corporate cash balances and 1031 exchange business.\nIn September, we completed the issuance of $600 million in 2.45% senior notes due March 15, 2031.\nThe proceeds were used to repay all outstanding debt under the one-year term loan agreement signed in April, which provided the additional financing needed to finalize the F&G acquisition.\nF&F's outstanding debt stood at $2.7 billion on September 30, resulting in a debt-to-total capital ratio of 27.1%.\nOur title claims payments of $50 million were $27 million less than our $77 million provision for the quarter.\nThe current title reserve for claim losses is $55 million, or 3.7% above the external actuary's central estimate.\nWe continue to allocate 4.5% of total title premiums for title claims.\nLastly, our title investment portfolio totaled $5.3 billion as of September 30.\nThis $5.3 billion includes $2.5 billion in fixed maturity and preferred securities with an average duration of three years and an average A2 rating.\nIt also comprises $600 million in equity securities, $300 million in short-term and other investments, and $1.9 billion in cash.\nWe concluded the quarter with nearly $1 billion in cash and short-term liquid investments at the holding company level.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Debbie Young, the investor relations director for SCI, is speaking.\nI'll now hand it over to our CEO and chairman, Tom Ryan.\nWe wish you and your loved ones good health and safety.\nI'll then provide some insights on our 2021 forecast, acknowledging the significant uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic's effects, which could substantially alter our projections.\nBefore I start, I'd like to share a few thoughts about the past year.\n2020 has undoubtedly been one of the most unpredictable and difficult times in recent memory.\nLooking back on the past 10 months, I can confidently say that our results demonstrate our team's exceptional effort and the strength of our core business.\nI'm immensely grateful to our entire SCI team for their extraordinary dedication in 2020.\nDuring these challenging times, we remained intensely focused on our core mission: assisting our client families in finding closure and healing through grieving, remembrance, and celebration.\nWe prioritized the health, safety, and wellbeing of our SCI family.\nNot only did we avoid layoffs, mandatory furloughs, or pay cuts due to COVID-19's impact, but we also rewarded our frontline workers with hero bonuses and provided special bonuses to all employees not part of our annual incentive plan.\nIn 2020, our services were in higher demand than ever, and I'm proud that we could handle a significantly increased workload without disruptions, showcasing the strength of our scale.\nOne thing that became evident throughout 2020 is that our core business remains unchanged.\nWe didn't observe a major shift in consumer preferences, and our cremation rate remained stable.\nDespite severe restrictions on large gatherings in 2020, our customers clearly expressed their continued desire to memorialize and celebrate the lives of their departed loved ones.\nVirtual arrangements, live-streamed services, outdoor ceremonies, drive-through visitations, radio-broadcasted graveside services, and many other innovative memorialization and life celebration ideas have become standard practice for us.\nThe success and rapid adoption of these enhanced service offerings have emphasized the importance of innovation in our industry.\nWe plan to continue investing in technologies that improve our digital interactions with consumers, enhancing the customer experience from initial contact through the arrangement conference and beyond, while also improving our operational efficiency.\nAs the year progressed, our response to limitations on in-person meetings led to efficiencies in non-customer-facing areas.\nWe more effectively utilized our workforce through virtual training, our customer relationship management system, and other technological tools, reducing travel-related expenses.\nWe also lowered our lead cost per sale by accelerating the growth of digital leads and significantly improving our direct mail program, resulting in record growth.\nAll the lessons learned this year will make us a stronger company moving forward.\nAs a result, we're positioned to enter the post-pandemic world as a more flexible and efficient organization.\nNow, let's discuss the core experiences from late November and December.\nTo provide some context for the quarter's progression, our same-store funeral volumes increased by 7% in October, then rose to 13% in November, and reached an unprecedented 31% in December, the highest monthly growth rate we saw all year.\nDue to this late-quarter surge, we ended the fourth quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.13, compared to $0.60 in the previous year, significantly exceeding the range we projected in October.\nBoth funeral and cemetery segments saw margin improvements of over 600 basis points, driven by double-digit percentage growth in top-line revenue applied to a more streamlined cost structure.\nWe also benefited from a reduced share count and a lower tax rate.\nLet's examine the funeral operations for the quarter.\nTotal comparable funeral revenues grew by approximately $49 million or 10% during the quarter.\nBoth core and non-funeral home channels performed well, slightly offset by lower general agency revenues due to a decline in insurance-funded preneed funeral sales production.\nCore revenues increased by $53 million, driven by a 17% rise in the number of cases, partially offset by a 3.4% decrease in the funeral sales average.\nThe primary reason for the increase in services performed was the direct impact of COVID-19, and to a lesser extent, an increase in non-COVID related deaths such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, drug overdose, and suicide, possibly due to limited access to healthcare during 2020.\nWords cannot express the level of appreciation and respect I have for our frontline team.\nThe exceptional care you provided to a record number of client families during such a stressful time can only be described as heroic.\nThe 3.4% decline in the funeral sales average was due to local jurisdictions reimposing restrictions on gatherings, given the surge in deaths in November and December.\nThis resulted in a decrease in the number of cases with a service.\nThe cremation mix shift was a moderate 120 basis points and had minimal impact on the quarter-over-quarter funeral average decline.\nPreneed funeral sales production for the quarter was down 1.6% compared to the previous year, a significant improvement from our results in earlier quarters this year.\nWhile we saw record growth in production from our digital and direct mail leads, we continued to be hindered by a decline in preplanning seminars due to local restrictions and consumer reluctance to attend in-person gatherings at restaurants.\nFrom a profit perspective, funeral gross profit increased by $45 million, and the gross profit percentage rose 640 basis points to 27.5%, achieving a 92% incremental margin on our revenue growth.\nGrowth in our high incremental margin core business more than offset slight declines in our lower-margin revenue streams.\nWe continue to benefit from effective labor management, reduced services, and decreased non-customer and marketing expenses.\nMoving on to cemetery operations.\nCemetery revenue saw an $18 million or 18% increase in Q4.\nCOVID-19 effects led to more burials, contributing $25 million to atneed cemetery revenue growth.\nHigher preneed cemetery sales during the quarter accounted for $35 million of the revenue increase.\nQ4 preneed cemetery sales grew by $40 million or 16%, driven by increased leads from higher atneed services and burials.\nThe majority of growth, $25 million or 60%, came from a 12% increase in the number of contracts sold.\nLarge sales activity primarily accounted for the remaining $15 million growth.\nOur sales force has become more productive and efficient, utilizing our customer relationship management system better and improving conversion rates from marketing campaigns.\nConsumers remain highly receptive to preplanning discussions.\nI'd like to acknowledge our sales team's exceptional efforts.\nThey achieved a new company record of over $1 billion in cemetery preneed sales production for 2020.\nCemetery gross profits increased by about $49 million in the quarter, with the gross profit percentage rising 680 basis points to 39%.\nRevenue growth and strategic cost reductions drove margins beyond normal incremental levels.\nWe reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.91 for 2020, a 53% increase from 2019 in an unprecedented year.\nThe speed and effectiveness of vaccine distribution could significantly impact virus spread, hospitalizations, and death rates.\nThis, along with consumer willingness to make preneed arrangements, may substantially affect our 2021 results.\nWe undoubtedly served deaths in 2020 that were accelerated from future years.\nWhile precise timing of this acceleration is unpredictable, we've developed models based on IHME and CBC data, considering historical trends and current COVID-related deaths by age and comorbidity factors to estimate future impacts.\nBased on these assumptions, we project 2021 adjusted earnings per share to range between $2.50 and $2.90.\nWe've provided a wider range than usual due to COVID-19-related uncertainties.\nLet's examine our 2021 earnings per share guidance assumptions in detail.\nWe expect funeral volume to decrease compared to 2020 but remain mid-single-digit percentage higher than 2019 levels due to anticipated COVID-19 impacts in early 2021.\nWe anticipate double-digit year-over-year percentage increases through March, followed by lower comparable volumes for the rest of the year compared to the busy final nine months of 2020.\nWe predict funeral averages to decrease by low single-digit percentages in January and February, with favorable trends emerging as we compare to early 2020 COVID outbreak months.\nAlthough we expect year-over-year growth, we believe reaching 2019 levels will be challenging as people may remain hesitant to gather in large groups.\nWe anticipate preneed funeral sales production to recover in the second half of the year, growing in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range for the full year.\nCemetery atneed revenues should see significant year-over-year growth in Q1, followed by comparable declines in the last three quarters due to challenging 2020 comparisons.\nWe expect 2021 cemetery atneed revenue to decrease compared to 2020 but still show significant growth over pre-COVID 2019 levels.\nCemetery preneed sales production grew exceptionally in late 2020, and we expect this momentum to continue into early 2021.\nWe anticipate double-digit percentage growth for the first four months before facing challenging year-over-year comparisons starting in May.\nFor the full year, we expect preneed cemetery sales production to decrease by mid-single-digit percentages compared to 2020 but still show solid growth over 2019 levels.\nIn conclusion, our team delivered exceptional results despite facing unprecedented challenges.\nWe demonstrated commitment, professionalism, and adaptability in meeting these new obstacles.\nIt's a privilege to work with such outstanding individuals.\nLooking ahead, I'm very optimistic about our future prospects.\nWhile we don't expect COVID's impact to disappear completely, we believe its effect on our 2022 results will be less pronounced.\nWe anticipate a decline in case volume and atneed cemetery revenues, along with associated earnings and cash flow, due to the pull-forward effects of 2020 and 2021.\nHowever, the knowledge gained from this difficult COVID experience is expected to result in a more competitive and profitable operating platform in the coming years.\nWe project impressive earnings-per-share growth for 2023, approaching $3 per share, resulting from enhanced market share and a leaner infrastructure leveraging technology and a more efficient sales structure.\nAs the pull-forward impact diminishes and baby boomers enter their late 70s, we expect further acceleration in earnings growth.\nLooking to the future, we are investing in innovative technologies and services to stay relevant, improve digital customer experiences, and serve our clients more efficiently and effectively.\nAs I've done in previous quarters, I'll begin by updating you on our strong financial position that has helped us navigate these turbulent times.\nNext, I'll discuss our cash flow results for the fourth quarter and the entire year of 2020, followed by our capital allocation activities for the year.\nFinally, I'll provide some details about our expectations for 2021.\nMore importantly, when we reported our 2019 earnings a year ago, none of us could have predicted the challenges we'd face in 2020.\nThroughout the year, our frontline workers helped communities cope with the rapidly spreading virus with exceptional composure and grace, especially early on when there was more speculation than facts about the coronavirus.\nEven now, teams across our network are sacrificing personal time and being away from home to support colleagues and communities dealing with current COVID hotspots.\nNow I'll move on to the financial update.\nWe entered the pandemic with a strong financial position and favorable debt profile, and we continue to be well-positioned with significant liquidity of about $670 million at year-end, comprising approximately $230 million in cash and $440 million available on our long-term bank credit facility.\nDue to the higher EBITDA from strong Q4 results, our leverage remains low at 3.19x at year-end.\nLooking beyond the pandemic's effects, we still aim to maintain leverage between 3.5 and 4 times net debt to EBITDA.\nLet's discuss cash flow, which has remained resilient throughout 2020.\nCash flow in the fourth quarter exceeded expectations, bolstered by strong earnings performance related to the surge in COVID-related deaths in late November and December.\nWe generated $245 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, an increase of $88 million or 56% compared to the previous year.\nThis increase is mainly due to growth in cash earnings and a reduction in cash interest payments of about $28 million, primarily resulting from recent debt refinancing.\nWe also continue to benefit from deferred payroll tax payments under the CARES Act, which improved the quarter by about $13 million and the full year by about $41 million.\nThese positive inflows were partially offset by $25 million in higher cash tax payments due to increased earnings and a net use of preneed working capital, which we've seen all year due to growth in cemetery preneed property sales on an installment basis.\nLooking at the full year, we generated over $800 million in operating cash flow, an increase of $170 million compared to the previous year.\nLet's discuss how we allocated this free cash flow.\nIn the quarter, we had a robust capital program, deploying nearly $325 million to reinvest in and grow our businesses and return value to shareholders.\nWe invested $56 million in our businesses through maintenance and cemetery development capital spending, about $2 million more than the previous year's quarter but in line with expectations.\nFull-year spending was approximately $185 million, a 9% decrease from the previous year as we reduced or postponed certain expenditures during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, which we plan to make up for in 2021.\nWe deployed about $35 million toward acquisitions during the quarter, showing increased activity at year-end.\nFor the full year 2020, we allocated just over $100 million to both acquisitions and growth capex for new funeral home construction.\nLastly, we returned nearly $225 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter.\nGiven our strong liquidity, cash flow, and favorable leverage profile, we took the opportunity to allocate a substantial amount of capital to share repurchases in 2020.\nWe bought back about 2% of our outstanding shares in the fourth quarter, bringing the full-year reduction in outstanding shares to about 6%.\nNow let's discuss our outlook for 2021 regarding cash flow and capital deployment.\nTom explained the challenges in forecasting our 2021 results due to the evolving pandemic, but I'd like to highlight a few items to consider for cash flow from operations in 2021.\nWe'll incur three full quarters of regular payroll taxes totaling about $40 million, which we were able to defer in 2020 under the CARES Act.\nAdditionally, we'll need to pay half (about $20 million) of our deferred payroll taxes in the third quarter of 2021, with the remainder due in 2022.\nThese two items will collectively impact cash flow by $60 million in 2021 compared to 2020.\nFederal and state cash tax payments are expected to be about $25 million higher than in 2020, totaling approximately $160 million in 2021.\nThis increase is primarily due to the timing of cash tax payments associated with our stronger-than-expected Q4 2020 financial results, which will be paid in early 2021.\nWe continue to model an effective tax rate between 24% and 25% for 2021.\nRegarding capital deployment for the coming year, we expect maintenance and cemetery development capital spending to be between $235 million and $255 million, about $40 million higher than our pre-COVID spending levels as we proceed with projects deferred from last year.\nIn addition to these recurring capital expenditures of $245 million at the midpoint, we plan to allocate $50 million to $100 million for acquisitions and roughly $50 million to $60 million for new funeral home construction opportunities, which together are expected to generate low to mid-teen after-tax internal rates of return, well above our cost of capital.\nIn conclusion, 2020 presented the most challenging environment we've faced in a very long time.\nFortunately, we entered the year with a strong balance sheet that remained robust throughout.\nDespite the numerous unforeseen and unexpected challenges, 2020 has been an extremely successful year for our company.\nSummary: ",

The company's core business remained unchanged, and they prioritized the health, safety, and wellbeing of their employees.

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Mary Hall, our CFO, Robert Traub, our General Counsel, and Shane Hostetter, our Head of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer are participating remotely in today's meeting as we're all working from home.\nPresentation slides for our conference call are available.\nThe materials can be accessed in the Investor Relations area of our website at www.\nSince our previous quarterly conference call, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly altered the global landscape.\nOur main focus is safeguarding the health and well-being of our employees and customers, while maintaining business continuity to meet client demands.\nAll 34 of our global manufacturing facilities are operational and we are fulfilling our customers' requirements.\nI'm extremely impressed with the Quaker Houghton team's efforts in continuing to serve our clients and progress with our integration without any interruptions.\nDuring our previous conference call, we were aware that China was being affected by COVID-19, which began impacting us significantly in February.\nHowever, in the latter half of March, we started experiencing effects worldwide.\nAs March drew to a close, many of our customers, particularly in the automotive industry, had substantially reduced production or completely ceased operations.\nWe estimate that COVID-19 reduced our first quarter sales by approximately 4%.\nBoeing's temporary suspension of 737 MAX production also affected our sales, resulting in an approximate 1% decrease.\nThese two factors were the primary reasons for our volume decline in our pro forma comparisons.\nWe've conducted a detailed analysis of our gains, losses, and market share at both customer and product levels.\nThis evaluation continues to indicate that we gained market share, with an estimated 2% organic volume growth due to net share gains in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year.\nRegarding gross margins, you may remember our previous statements that Quaker Houghton's combined gross margins were expected to be roughly 1% lower than standalone Quaker.\nIn the first quarter comparison, this difference is only 0.5 percentage points.\nThis reduction indicates that our integration-related raw material savings are starting to materialize.\nAlthough crude oil prices were decreasing during this period, we haven't yet seen any significant benefits, as our raw material costs remained relatively stable.\nOverall, the first quarter results were slightly better than anticipated when considering the impact of COVID-19.\nOur first quarter pro forma adjusted EBITDA increased by 10% compared to last year, due to integration savings, the impact of the Norman Hay acquisition in the previous quarter, and additional cost control measures implemented to counter the global effect of COVID-19 on our volumes.\nThis situation has many similarities to what we experienced in late 2008.\nAs we did then, we quickly took action to reduce costs in various ways.\nWe've eliminated virtually all discretionary expenses.\nWe've implemented a hiring freeze, reduced executive pay, furloughed some positions, and cut our planned capital expenditures by over 30%.\nImportantly, we've reviewed our integration synergy plans in light of the current situation, taking additional actions and accelerating other synergies where possible.\nWe've now increased our guidance on synergy achievement.\nFor 2020, our new estimate is $53 million in cost synergies achieved, up from our previous estimate of $35 million.\nWe've also raised our total synergy estimate to be achieved by 2022 from $60 million to $75 million.\nWe've been asked if the pandemic has affected our integration process.\nThe integration has not been adversely affected in any way, particularly regarding timing.\nOur team deserves immense praise for managing plant closures, product transfers, and ERP implementations during these difficult working conditions.\nWe recently implemented our system at two locations entirely remotely due to current circumstances.\nOur two-year planning is proving beneficial, helping offset volume impacts during this integration period.\nDespite additional cost savings, we haven't compromised our business operations, customer service, growth potential, or strategic initiatives.\nWe anticipate the second quarter to be the most difficult.\nMany customers have significantly reduced or halted production.\nOur April revenues decreased by approximately 30%.\nWe expect a gradual, sequential improvement in business during the second half of the year.\nHowever, we don't anticipate business returning to pre-COVID-19 levels by year-end.\nDue to economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19, we're not providing specific guidance at this time.\nWe estimate the second quarter's adjusted EBITDA could be about half of the first quarter's.\nFor the full year, we project adjusted EBITDA to exceed $200 million.\nWe don't foresee any liquidity or bank covenant issues.\nIncreased synergies, cost-saving measures, improved gross margins, and working capital reductions are expected to help during this period of reduced volumes.\nLooking ahead to 2021 and 2022, I remain optimistic about significant increases in adjusted EBITDA as we complete integration synergies, gain market share, and benefit from gradual demand recovery.\nI'm proud of our team's performance in serving customers, meeting their needs, and successfully continuing our integration.\nOur employees are our most valuable asset, and ensuring their safety and well-being remains a priority.\nI'm pleased with our Quaker Houghton team and our ability to deliver for our customers now and in the future.\nMary will now review the key financial details for the quarter.\nThese are accessible on our website.\nWe've updated the risk factors in yesterday's first quarter 10-Q to address COVID-19-related issues, which should be reviewed alongside those in our 2019 Form 10-K.\nReconciliations are provided in the appendix of this investor presentation.\nWe've used a similar review format as in previous post-Combination calls, showing actual and non-GAAP results, as well as pro forma sales and adjusted EBITDA as if we had been combined with Houghton throughout the periods presented.\nPlease refer to Slides 6, 7, and 8 as I review some highlights.\nDuring our Q4 earnings call in early March, we noted ongoing challenges from global automotive and industrial weakness from late 2019, and a stronger U.S. dollar.\nAt that time, COVID-19 was largely considered a China-specific issue.\nAs March progressed, COVID-19 became a global pandemic, intensifying the existing auto and industrial weakness.\nWhile our actual sales increased significantly to $378.6 million in Q1 due to the inclusion of Houghton and Norman Hay, pro forma sales decreased by 3%, reflecting lower volumes and foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by additional sales from Norman Hay.\nDespite facing difficulties in the first quarter, the Company achieved positive cash flow and improved adjusted EBITDA, with a 10% increase on a pro forma basis, while non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.38 exceeded market expectations of $1.\nThe first quarter's gross margin of 35.4% decreased from 35.9% in the same period last year, aligning with our projections and previous statements.\nWe had earlier mentioned that the legacy Houghton business would have slightly reduced gross margins, partly due to the accounting approach for the Fluidcare chemical management division.\nOur calculations suggest that if Houghton had been included in the previous year's figures, the gross margin would have been roughly 1% lower.\nThis suggests an improvement in the current quarter's gross margin, primarily reflecting the procurement savings associated with the merger, as Mike discussed.\nThe chart on Slide 8 displays a reported operating loss of $12.4 million in the GAAP section, while the non-GAAP operating income in the middle section shows $36 million.\nThe primary non-GAAP adjustments include merger and restructuring expenses totaling about $10 million, along with a $38 million non-cash impairment charge in Q1 to account for the reduction in value of our Houghton trademark indefinite-lived intangible assets to their estimated fair value.\nThese assets were initially recorded at fair value when the Combination closed on August 1, 2019, and underwent impairment testing during the fourth quarter of 2019.\nHowever, due to recent changes in business conditions resulting from COVID-19, we determined that these assets required reevaluation, confirming that their carrying value exceeded their current estimated fair value by approximately $38 million.\nAs mentioned in our 10-Q, we will continue to reassess all our long-lived assets as business conditions evolve.\nIn non-operating items, we recorded a non-cash charge of $22.7 million for the final settlement and termination of legacy Quaker's U.S. defined benefit pension plan, a process we had previously disclosed.\nThe counterbalancing entry is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income/loss account within the equity section of the balance sheet.\nIn conjunction with this termination, the Company made a payment of approximately $1.8 million, subject to final adjustment.\nOur reported effective tax rate showed a benefit of 31.1% in Q1 2020, compared to an expense of 26.8% in Q1 of the previous year.\nAfter adjusting for all one-time charges and benefits, we estimate our effective tax rate would have been 22% this Q1 and 24% in Q1 last year.\nWe anticipate our full-year effective tax rate, excluding all one-time charges and benefits, to range between 22% and 24%.\nOur non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.38 decreased from $1.41 in Q1 last year, primarily due to the additional shares issued in the Combination, partially offset by the inclusion of Houghton and Norman Hay.\nCompared to the previous quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share increased from $1.34 in Q4 of 2019, which included Houghton and Norman Hay and the additional shares.\nSlide 9 illustrates the trend in pro forma trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA, which reached $239 million as of Q1, up from $234 million at the end of 2019.\nThis increase reflects the strong adjusted EBITDA performance in Q1 of $60 million, a 10% improvement from pro forma Q1 last year of $55 million, due to the inclusion of Norman Hay and the benefits of cost savings realized in the quarter from the Combination.\nSlide 10 provides an update on our leverage and liquidity.\nIt's worth noting that we withdrew most of the available funds from our revolving credit facility in March as a precautionary measure when COVID-19 became a global issue, creating significant uncertainty and volatility in all global markets.\nThis withdrawal was leverage neutral as the additional cash on our balance sheet directly offsets our debt.\nIn fact, our reported net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 3.40 times from our year-end level of 3.47 times, thanks to strong cash flow and the cost savings mentioned earlier.\nOur bank covenant ratio also improved from about 2.94 at year-end to 2.76 at the end of this quarter, as defined in our borrowing agreement.\nWe anticipate continued compliance with our bank covenants and have strong liquidity to navigate these uncertain times.\nOur capital allocation decisions reflect these priorities, including an approximately 30% reduction in previously planned capital expenditures.\nAs you're aware, we operate with a very asset-light business model and we also expect a release of working capital as sales decline to generate good cash flow, similar to what occurred during the global crisis in 2008/2009.\nOur cost of debt continues to benefit from declining interest rates and was estimated at approximately 2.4% on March 31, compared to about 3% at year-end.\nAs Mike mentioned, we're encouraged by the additional cost synergies realized to date and expected to be achieved overall.\nThe increase in expected realized synergies this year from $35 million to $53 million, combined with the cost reduction measures we've implemented to address the global crisis and our history of generating strong cash flow during economic downturns, all contribute to our confidence in our ability to weather this challenging period.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Let's start by reviewing the results summarized on Page 3.\nQ2 is anticipated to be difficult, but we've strengthened our cost-saving measures early in Q1 to prepare for the challenges ahead.\nWe concluded the quarter with a comprehensive strategy to navigate these uncertain times, concentrating on factors within our control such as operations, expenses, and most importantly, employee safety.\nWhile we're not completely out of danger operationally, a large majority of our facilities are operational as we enter Q3, which is beneficial for operating leverage compared to the previous quarter.\nRevenue trends are aligning with our initial projections for the quarter.\nOrganic revenue decreased by 16% and orders dropped by 21%.\nThe situation improved throughout the quarter, with a notable upturn in June.\nWe maintain a robust backlog across all divisions, boosting our confidence for the latter half of the year.\nConsidering the business climate in April and May, the quarter's profit margins were satisfactory.\nFollowing profit gains in Q1 despite lower revenue, we aimed for a 25% to 30% decremental margin for the entire year.\nWe're on track to surpass our initial full-year goal.\nIn addition to strict cost control and variable expense management, we implemented further structural cost-saving measures this quarter as part of our business reorganization, which will yield benefits in the second half.\nOur proactive working capital management, combined with our cost-saving initiatives, resulted in improved cash flow in both absolute terms and conversion rates.\nWe generated $78 million more in free cash flow compared to the same quarter last year.\nBased on our first-half performance and solid order backlog, we're reintroducing our annual adjusted earnings per share guidance of $5.00 to $5.25 per share.\nTo be clear, despite a strong backlog and recent positive trends, we still face demand uncertainty in our markets and aren't back to normal operations, but our teams have demonstrated their ability to manage costs and operations effectively, and we're prepared to achieve results under various potential scenarios in the second half.\nLet's examine the segment performance on Slide 4.\nEngineered Products had a challenging quarter, particularly in short-cycle and capital expenditure-dependent businesses like vehicle aftermarket, industrial automation, and industrial winches.\nWaste hauling and aerospace & defense showed more resilience, fulfilling orders from their strong backlogs.\nReduced volumes led to a margin decline compared to the very strong margin this segment posted in the same quarter last year, and we've taken structural cost actions in this segment to support its margin in the second half along with recovering volumes.\nFueling Solutions experienced continued strong activity in North America driven by demand for EMV compliance solutions.\nHowever, Europe and Asia declined due to COVID-related production and supply chain disruptions, as well as budget cuts and deferrals in response to falling oil prices.\nThe improved margin performance was commendable, with an 80 basis point increase due to better mix pricing and ongoing productivity measures.\nThe sales decline in Imaging & Identification was primarily driven by a steep drop in our digital textile printing business, which we anticipated due to significant disruption in global apparel and fashion markets caused by the pandemic.\nMarking & coding showed continued resilience with strong demand for consumables and fast-moving consumer goods solutions.\nThis is our highest gross margin segment, so decremental margins are challenging and require significant cost containment efforts, which the marking & coding business managed well, achieving a flat margin year-over-year.\nWe've taken proactive actions to manage the cost base in the digital printing business.\nAs a result of these actions and an increase in textiles consumable volumes, we expect performance to improve in the second half.\nPumps & Process Solutions demonstrated the resilience we expected.\nIts top line declined the least among our segments despite a challenging comparison from last year.\nStrong growth continued in biopharma and medical applications, with colder products posting record growth in the quarter.\nThis was offset by a moderate decline in industrial applications and a significant slowdown in energy markets.\nOur Plastics Processing business revenue declined in the quarter due to shipment timing, but we expect it to perform well in the second half based on a strong backlog.\nAs you can see, this segment continued to deliver solid margin performance, posting improved margins on declining revenue for the second quarter in a row.\nWe expect this segment to deliver flat or improved absolute profit for the full year.\nRefrigeration & Food Equipment declined as food retailers continued to delay construction and remodels due to peak utilization, and the commercial food service market remains severely impacted by restaurant and school closures in the United States.\nOur heat exchanger business showed resilience, particularly in non-HVAC applications.\nOn the margin side, negative absorption on lower volumes drove the margin decline.\nIn Q2, we took structural cost actions in this segment, which, paired with ongoing productivity and automation initiatives, yielded a materially improved margin performance in June.\nWe expect these benefits to continue accruing in the second half and anticipate this segment to deliver year-over-year growth in absolute earnings and margin in the second half of this year.\nI'll now hand it over to Brad.\nLet's move on to Slide 5.\nThe revenue bridge is displayed at the top of the slide.\nForeign exchange remained a significant negative factor in Q2, decreasing the top line by 1% or $24 million.\nWe anticipate foreign exchange to have less of a negative impact in the latter half of the year.\nThe effects of acquisitions were balanced out by divestitures during the quarter.\nThe geographical breakdown of revenue shows relatively stronger performance in North America and Asia compared to more substantial impacts across Europe and several developing markets such as India, Brazil, and Mexico.\nThe United States, our biggest market, experienced a 10% organic decline, with four segments showing organic decreases, partly counterbalanced by growth in retail fueling.\nThe entirety of Asia saw a 14% decrease.\nChina, which accounts for about half of our Asian business, showed initial signs of stabilization with an 11% year-over-year decline in Q2, an improvement from the 36% decline in Q1.\nImaging & Identification and Engineered Products grew in China, while Fueling Solutions decreased due to the end of the underground equipment replacement mandate and reduced demand from local national oil companies.\nEurope experienced a 19% decline with organic decreases across all five segments.\nTurning to the bottom of the page.\nOrders decreased by 21% organically across all five segments, but there are reasons for cautious optimism as we enter the second half of the year.\nFirstly, as shown in the box at the bottom, June orders saw a significant improvement from May's low point, with all five segments showing double-digit month-over-month sequential growth.\nSecondly, our backlog has increased by 8% compared to last year, driven by our longer-cycle businesses and the previously mentioned improvement within the quarter in our shorter-cycle businesses.\nWe believe we are in a strong position for the latter half of the year.\nLet's examine the bridges on Slide 6.\nI'll avoid going into excessive detail about the chart, but the negative top-line trend led to EBIT decreases, although our cost control and efficiency initiatives helped maintain overall margins at an acceptable decremental level.\nDuring the quarter, we implemented the $50 million annual cost reduction program, which focuses on IT infrastructure and back-office efficiency, and incurred additional restructuring charges that will increase the expected benefits.\nWe also performed well in the quarter on additional cost reductions to offset the under-absorption of fixed costs previously estimated at $35 million to $40 million.\nSome of these recent initiatives will continue to support margins in the second half of the year and into 2021.\nLooking at the bottom chart.\nAdjusted earnings declined primarily due to lower segment earnings, partially offset by reduced interest expense and lower taxes on decreased earnings.\nThe effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits, is approximately 21.5% for the quarter, unchanged from the first quarter.\nDiscrete tax benefits in the quarter were about $2 million, slightly lower than the same quarter last year.\nRightsizing and other costs amounted to $17 million in the quarter, or $13 million after-tax, related to several new permanent cost containment initiatives that we accelerated into 2020.\nNow turning to Slide 7.\nWe are satisfied with the cash generation in the first half of the year, with year-to-date free cash flow of $269 million, a $126 million or 90% increase over last year.\nOur teams have effectively managed capital in this uncertain environment.\nWe have observed strong collections on accounts receivable.\nWe continue to maintain inventory levels that support our backlog and order trends.\nQ2 also benefited from an approximately $40 million deferral of US tax payments into the second half of the year.\nCapital expenditures were $79 million for the first six months of the year, a $12 million decrease compared to the same period last year.\nMost of our ongoing growth and productivity capital projects were finished in the second quarter.\nTherefore, we expect to see continued year-over-year capital expenditure decreases in the second half.\nLastly, on Slide 8.\nDover's financial position remains robust.\nWe have been aiming for a prudent capital structure, and our leverage of 2.2 times EBITDA places us comfortably within the investment grade rating with a margin of safety.\nSecondly, we are operating with approximately $1.6 billion of current liquidity, consisting of $650 million in cash and $1 billion in unused revolver capacity.\nWhen commercial paper markets were disrupted at the beginning of the pandemic in March, we drew $500 million on our revolver as a precautionary measure.\nMarkets have since stabilized, and we reestablished our commercial paper program and fully repaid the revolver.\nIn Q2, we also secured a new additional $450 million revolver facility to further strengthen our liquidity position.\nAs of June, we haven't drawn any funds from either credit line.\nOur conservative financial structure, liquidity access, and robust cash flow have enabled us to largely maintain our capital allocation strategy.\nWe've invested nearly $250 million in profitable acquisitions this year and continue to seek attractive opportunities.\nWe're lifting our recent pause on share buybacks and will repurchase stock opportunistically if market conditions are favorable.\nI'm referring to Page 9, which shows an updated view of the demand outlook by business that we introduced in the previous quarter.\nWe're providing directional estimates of how we expect segments to perform in the second half compared to the second quarter, instead of full-year revenue guidance.\nI'll note that all of this is based on current market assessments and may change as the situation remains uncertain.\nIn Engineered Products, short-term businesses like vehicle service and industrial automation have shown improvement towards the end of the quarter, with trends improving globally.\nThe aerospace and defense sector continues to operate with a large backlog of defense program orders.\nWaste handling may face challenges due to industry capital expenditure tightening and municipal budget constraints after several years of strong growth.\nOrders slowed late in Q2 as customers paused their capital spending to manage cash flow.\nWe're closely monitoring the situation and have proactively started addressing costs in this business.\nFueling Solutions shows contrasting trends: North America, about half the business, remains strong in EMV conversion and non-integrated retailers' willingness to invest in their assets.\nIn Europe and Asia, integrated oil companies represent a larger portion of the network, and capital budget cuts due to oil price declines are negatively impacting retail network investments, plus we face a $50 million revenue decrease in China this year from the end of the underground equipment replacement mandate.\nThe Imaging & Identification outlook is improving.\nOur service and maintenance operations have resumed in the market and coding as travel restrictions were lifted, resulting in increased demand for printers.\nIntegration activities with the Systech acquisition are proceeding according to plan.\nWe're seeing some positive signs in digital textile printing, but we anticipate a challenging year as the global textile industry will take time to recover.\nPumps & Process Solutions is expected to show improved performance from here on.\nOur plastics and polymer businesses will fulfill their significant backlog in the second half.\nThe biopharma and medical sector is expected to continue its impressive growth.\nIndustrial pumps, a shorter-cycle business, is expected to start gradually recovering.\nA significant portion of demand in our pumps and precision components business is tied to maintenance, repair, and aftermarket services.\nThe oil and gas mid and downstream markets, primarily served by the precision components business, continue to slow due to deferred capital expenditure and refurbishment spending by refining and pipeline operators.\nIn Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we believe the worst is behind us for this segment.\nOrders were relatively stable for this segment and improved in June, resulting in a strong backlog that we're prepared to fulfill.\nWe also saw growth in restarting construction and remodel projects, leading to full bookings for refrigeration cases into Q4.\nAdditionally, Belvac is scheduled to begin deliveries against its significant backlog, which will boost segment margins.\nRecovery in volumes along with our cost-cutting measures should result in positive margin and profit trends for the rest of the year, leading to a second-half comparable profit increase for the segment.\nLet's move to Slide 10.\nDue to the uncertain COVID situation, we're cautious about forecasting top-line trends at this time, but all signs point to sequential improvement from here across most markets.\nOur proactive cost management approach in Q1 and Q2 has positioned us well for margin performance, and today we're improving our target for annual decremental margins to 20% to 25%.\nWe continue to work on restructuring actions, including those targeting benefits in 2021, and we're well-positioned to achieve our margin objectives.\nWe remain confident in the cash flow capacity of this portfolio and are reiterating a conversion target above 100% of adjusted net earnings and a cash flow margin target of 10% to 12%, compared to the 8% to 12% target we had last year.\nTo conclude, we've reintroduced earnings per share guidance due to our confidence in managing costs in an uncertain demand environment.\nWe have a capable team that understands the strategy.\nHowever, we're now focused on driving revenue growth, both organically and through acquisitions.\nWe have strong operating companies and a robust balance sheet to support them.\nThis isn't the time to be defensive and wait for the situation to improve, so we're equally focused on gaining market share and developing new products as we are on our main pillars of synergy extraction from our portfolio, all of which we continue to fund despite market challenges.\nWe have capital available for acquisitions and I fully expect to be active in the second half.\nLet's now move to the Q&A session.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We're delighted to accompany you as we enter 2021, and I genuinely wish for everyone's health and safety.\nAccompanying me on this call are our company's Chief Information Officer, Greg Zimmerman, and our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Peterson.\nThe year 2020 was unprecedented in our company's history since its establishment in 1997.\nAt the pandemic's onset, we recognized the importance of strengthening our financial position to ensure long-term liquidity.\nAmong our initial actions, we postponed a planned gaming venue investment of about $1 billion, along with deferring other uncommitted investments of roughly $600 million.\nWe also accessed our unsecured credit facility as a precautionary step and halted our monthly dividend payments to common shareholders.\nWe deemed these measures necessary due to the extremely challenging circumstances our tenants were facing.\nAs of today, our liquidity remains robust with over $500 million in cash reserves.\nThis substantial cash reserve indicates our readiness for a return to normalcy.\nNevertheless, as disclosed in our January 7 quarterly report, we generated positive cash flow in Q4 and expect this trend to continue.\nThe recent reduction of our credit facility balance reflects this positive momentum and shows our growing confidence.\nThroughout 2020, our team focused on addressing pandemic-related challenges, including monitoring tenant performance, assisting with reopening plans, and collaborating to ensure long-term stability for both our tenants and EPR Properties.\nThis strategy has proven successful with our non-theater tenants, with approximately 94% now open and significantly improved rent collections.\nAlthough our properties are still affected by local closures and capacity restrictions, performance and customer demand continue to improve, which we believe supports our thesis about people's desire for experiences.\nGreg will provide more details, but our theater tenants are still primarily challenged by limited film releases, which should improve as we progress through 2021.\nHowever, early global indicators suggest robust consumer demand when new releases are available.\nOverall, we're pleased with both the progress and trajectory of our recovery, as evidenced by the continued increase in cash collections entering 2021.\nWe made steady progress throughout the year.\nAs I've mentioned before, I'm very proud of how our team has responded to the significant challenges they've faced.\nLooking ahead to 2021, we're encouraged by the accelerated vaccine rollout.\nRecovery will be a gradual process, but we believe society is eager to return to normalcy.\nWe remain encouraged by the resilience shown by many of our tenants and expect theaters to follow a similar pattern when they reopen more widely and key titles are consistently released.\nAs the country begins to recover, we look forward to resuming our growth trajectory.\nThis process requires continued improvement and stabilization of our cash collections, allowing us to exit our existing debt covenant waivers.\nUpon achieving this goal, we'll focus on reinstating our common dividend and restarting our investment spending program.\nThe timing of these milestones depends on various factors, including effective vaccine deployment.\nHowever, as today's results indicate, our progress has significantly improved in early 2021, and we're optimistic about achieving our goals in the second half of the year.\nAt the end of Q1, our total investments were approximately $6.5 billion, with 356 properties in service and 94.2% occupancy.\nDuring the quarter, our investment spending was $22.8 million, entirely in our experiential portfolio, comprising build-to-suit development and redevelopment projects committed before the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFor the year, our investment spending totaled $85.1 million.\nOur experiential portfolio consists of 281 properties with 43 operators, is 93.8% occupied, and accounts for 91% of our total investments, or about $5.9 billion of the $6.5 billion total.\nWe have three properties under development.\nOur education portfolio comprises 75 properties with 12 operators and was 100% occupied at the end of the quarter.\nAs vaccine distribution accelerates, people are seeking safe and easily accessible ways to leave their homes and reconnect with friends.\nOur operators are working diligently to offer safe entertainment experiences that create memories.\nWe're observing that as consumers become more confident in safety measures and restrictions are eased, they're returning to our properties.\nI'll now update you on our tenants' operating status, deferral agreements, and rent payment timelines.\nAs of February 22nd, 60% of our theaters were open.\nAs previously noted, Cineworld decided to close all its U.S., U.K., and Ireland theaters due to the lack of major film releases from Hollywood.\nCurrently, none of our 57 Regal theaters are open.\nTheaters continue to face significant challenges from the lack of major film releases and capacity and concession restrictions imposed by state and local governments.\nThese challenges will gradually diminish as vaccination rates increase and restrictions are eased across the country.\nBased on the current vaccination pace, we anticipate major film releases and box office performance will begin to accelerate in the second half of 2021.\nThe 2021 film slate was strong before the pandemic.\nWith several 2020 films pushed to 2021, we believe the projected film slate will provide a robust content schedule for theaters to ramp up as vaccinations increase, normalcy returns, and consumers feel more comfortable returning to cinemas.\nMajor films currently scheduled for release beginning in May include Black Widow, Fast & Furious 9, Top Gun: Maverick, Jungle Cruise, Death on the Nile, A Quiet Place Part II, Dune, No Time to Die, Ghostbusters: Afterlife, and MI7.\nBox office strength is expected to continue into 2022, with Jurassic World: Dominion pushed to mid-2022.\nBased on consumer behavior in Asia and Hollywood's release schedule, we don't see evidence of structural changes in moviegoing habits due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn Asia, consumer demand rebounded quickly.\nChina's box office continues to perform well, even in weeks without new releases.\nDuring the Lunar New Year holiday, Detective Chinatown 3 achieved record-breaking opening day ($163 million) and opening weekend ($398 million) grosses, surpassing Avengers: Endgame.\nOver the Lunar New Year holiday, Detective Chinatown 3 and Hi, Mom each grossed over $620 million.\nIn January, Demon Slayer became Japan's highest-grossing movie ever.\nFurthermore, as demonstrated by the continued recovery and resilience of our other experiential tenants, which I'll discuss shortly, customers still desire engaging, affordable out-of-home experiences.\nOnce they know an operator is open and feel comfortable with new protocols, we see them returning to experiential assets.\nWe're confident the same will hold true for theaters as vaccinations increase and normalcy returns.\nAs we've stated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the studios' decision to postpone most major film releases to 2021 and 2022 is the strongest evidence of their commitment to the theatrical exhibition model.\nThe economics are straightforward.\nMajor films cost well over $100 million to produce, so studios need theatrical releases to maximize revenue for these pictures.\nOf the projected top 30 box office films scheduled for release from February 2020, only six were moved to non-theatrical release, and one other, Wonder Woman 1984, was released simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max.\nDuring these uniquely challenging times, studios took the opportunity to test alternative delivery channels and, for those with streaming services, to add subscribers.\nDespite restrictions on movement and theater operations in parts of the country, these releases achieved limited success.\nMost major films were held back from digital-only distribution to maintain theatrical releases in 2021, following trials with simultaneous or streaming-only releases of some big titles.\nDisney has confirmed its intention to release Black Widow in theaters, subject to conditions, demonstrating their belief in the power of theatrical releases for major films.\nSimilarly, Paramount has publicly stated that Top Gun: Maverick will have a theatrical release in July, depending on vaccine rollout progress.\nDespite COVID-19 challenges, the film industry recognizes that audiences prefer watching movies in theaters and don't consider PVOD a suitable alternative.\nThe decision to delay theatrical releases for most major films, even after experimenting with other options, shows that cinema remains the preferred medium for viewers and the most profitable format for studios.\nI'd like to provide an update on our other primary customer groups.\nAbout 94% of our non-theater operators are open, or closed as usual for seasonal businesses.\nThese establishments continue to operate with appropriate safety measures to meet state and local requirements.\nPerformance varies depending on COVID-19's impact in each area, but overall, our operators have shown resilience and exceeded expectations during this extended pandemic.\nAdditionally, we're seeing advantages in owning drive-to, value-oriented destinations.\nI'll now briefly update you on each of our property types.\nThe ski season has begun, with all our ski resorts open and performing well so far.\nAll our Topgolf locations, Andretti carting venues, and family entertainment centers are operational.\nAll but one of our U.S. gyms are open.\nRoughly 61% of our attractions had resumed normal operations before typical seasonal closures.\nAs mentioned previously, some attractions missed part or all of their season due to health regulations and financial feasibility issues with reduced capacity and shortened seasons.\nAll our cultural operators are open.\nExcept for the Kartrite Resort & Indoor Waterpark, all our experiential lodging properties are open.\nKartrite's reopening is subject to New York state's phased plans, with a target reopening in summer 2021.\nResorts World Catskills is operational.\nRegarding our education portfolio, all our early education centers are open.\nWe're seeing steady monthly increases in demand as COVID restrictions ease and parents return to work.\nAll our private schools remain open, using a mix of in-person, online, and hybrid teaching models.\nState and local requirements continue to influence each school's teaching approach.\nInconsistency in public school reopening plans has benefited private schools, and we believe parents still value private school education.\nWe've made progress in our strategy to reduce our overall education portfolio.\nIn December, we sold six private schools and four early childhood education centers, netting $201 million.\nThese assets were sold at cash and GAAP cap rates of 8.1% and 9% respectively, based on base rents.\nOver the past two years, we also collected average annual percentage rents of $6.3 million from three of the private schools based on total tuition levels, though these were scheduled to expire in the coming years.\nOverall, these assets proved to be an excellent investment, yielding an unlevered internal rate of return of 13% over our ownership period.\nWe also sold four experiential properties and two vacant land parcels for about $23 million.\nTotal disposition proceeds for the quarter were $224 million.\nDuring the quarter, we terminated all seven AMC transition leases and reclaimed the properties.\nWe're implementing plans for each location.\nIn December, we sold one of the transition lease properties for industrial use.\nWe're in various stages of negotiation to sell another five, which are expected to be repurposed for industrial, multifamily, office, retail, and theater uses.\nWe've also taken over management of two theaters: one transition lease property in Columbus, Ohio, and the former Goodrich Savoy in Champaign, Illinois.\nWe've hired a respected, experienced theater management company to operate both locations, which are now open for business.\nI'd like to update you on our cash collections and deferral agreements.\nCash collections have improved as businesses reopen.\nTenants and borrowers paid 46% of pre-COVID contractual cash revenue for the fourth quarter, compared to 29% and 43% in the second and third quarters, respectively.\nWe expect first quarter cash collections to significantly exceed fourth-quarter collections.\nJanuary collections were 66% and February collections are currently at 64% of pre-COVID contractual cash revenue.\nDue to COVID-19's ongoing impact, we reserved the outstanding principal loan balance of $6.1 million and the unfunded commitment of $12.9 million for one of our attractions operators during the quarter.\nCustomers representing about 95% of our pre-COVID contractual cash revenue, including our top 20 customers, are either paying their pre-COVID contract rent or interest or have deferral agreements in place.\nIn these deferral agreements, we've granted approximately 5% in permanent rent and interest payment reductions.\nHowever, we can't guarantee that additional permanent rent or interest payment reductions or other term modifications won't occur in the future, given the pandemic's continued adverse effects on our customers' finances, particularly with ongoing uncertainty in the theater industry.\nAs discussed, our exhibition partners have faced and continue to face significant challenges.\nThe lack of new releases and reopening restrictions have severely impacted box office performance since early 2020 and continue to dramatically affect projected box office results.\nWe've worked diligently with all our customers to create appropriate deferral and repayment agreements, aiming to facilitate efficient reopening and ensure their long-term viability while protecting our position as landlord.\nOur goal was to support them through a period of significantly reduced or no cash flow, allowing them to gradually return to stable cash flow.\nWe customized each agreement, considering the specific variables affecting each business and improving our position through various arrangements.\nThese agreements generally involve rent and mortgage payments starting and increasing throughout 2021 and, in some cases, beyond 2021.\nReimbursement of postponed sums typically begins in 2021, with repayment periods often extending beyond that year to provide customers financial flexibility, depending on the deferred amount.\nThe majority of our agreements require full repayment of all delayed rent.\nAs previously mentioned, we've granted rent concessions in a few instances, but generally received comparable or greater value through extended lease terms, additional security, or other benefits.\nIn most situations, our clients have continued to cover third-party expenses such as ground rent, taxes, and insurance.\nMark will provide more details on revenue recognition and cash collection implications for Q1 2021.\nI will discuss our quarterly and annual financial performance, which continued to be affected by COVID-19 disruptions, provide an update on our balance sheet and strong liquidity position, and conclude with some estimated forward-looking information.\nFor the quarter, FFO as adjusted was $0.18 per share compared to $1.26 in the previous year, while AFFO was $0.23 per share versus $1.25 in the prior year.\nThe previous year's operating results included the public charter school portfolio, which was sold in Q4 2019 and is reported in discontinued operations.\nQuarterly revenue from continuing operations totaled $93.4 million, down from $170.3 million in the prior year.\nThis decrease was attributed to accounting for various customer agreements impacted by COVID-19, similar to the previous quarter's discussion.\nWe wrote off $2.4 million in receivables during the quarter due to placing two additional customers on a cash basis of accounting, bringing the total write-offs for the year to $65.1 million, including $38 million in straight-line rent.\nThe closure of the Kartrite Resort & Indoor Waterpark due to COVID-19 restrictions resulted in lower other income and lower other expense of $7.4 million and $8.7 million, respectively.\nPercentage rents for the quarter were $3 million, down from $6.4 million in the previous year.\nThis reduction was primarily due to property closures caused by COVID-19 restrictions.\nAs mentioned last quarter, we define percentage rents as amounts exceeding fixed rent, not payments based on a percentage of revenue in lieu of fixed rent.\nThus, AMC and other theater tenants making cash payments based on revenue percentages against contractual rents in Q4 are recognized as minimum rent.\nQuarterly property operating expense of $16.4 million was slightly higher than the previous year, but increased by about $2.5 million from the last quarter due to increased vacancy, including the terminated AMC leases Greg described.\nTransaction costs for the quarter were $0.8 million, down from $5.8 million in the prior year.\nThis decrease was primarily due to lower costs related to transferring early education properties to Crème de la Crème.\nInterest expense increased by $7.9 million from the previous year to $42.8 million.\nThis increase was mainly due to our precautionary measure of drawing $750 million on our $1 billion revolving credit facility last March, providing additional liquidity during uncertain times.\nDue to improved collections and significant liquidity, including $224 million in net proceeds from property dispositions in Q4, we reduced the outstanding balance by $160 million to $590 million at year-end.\nAfter year-end, we used some of our cash to further reduce this balance by $500 million, resulting in a current balance of $90 million on our revolver.\nAs mentioned last quarter, we are paying higher interest rates on our bank credit facilities and private placement notes during the covenant relief period.\nThe next slide shows Q4 results reflecting the impact of the previously discussed receivable write-offs.\nThese write-offs totaled $0.03 per share for the quarter and $0.86 per share for the year.\nDuring the quarter, we had other items excluded from FFO as adjusted.\nGain on real estate sales was $49.9 million, and gain on insurance recovery, included in other income, was $0.8 million.\nWe recognized $22.8 million in impairment charges due to shortened expected hold periods on four theaters we plan to sell.\nWe also recognized net credit loss expense of $20.3 million, primarily due to fully reserving the outstanding principal balance and unfunded commitment related to notes receivable from one borrower, as Greg discussed.\nWe recognized severance expense of $2.9 million due to a previously announced executive retirement.\nOur full-year 2020 results were significantly impacted by COVID-19, with FFO as adjusted per share at $1.43 compared to $5.44 in the prior year, and AFFO per share at $1.89 versus $5.44 in the prior year.\nNote that the prior period results included the public charter school portfolio sold in 2019, with those results, including $24.1 million in termination fees, reported in discontinued operations.\nAs discussed last quarter, we've categorized our tenants and borrowers based on how we accounted for them in relation to our annualized pre-COVID contractual cash revenue of $624 million, consisting of cash rent, tenant reimbursements, percentage rents, and interest payments.\nThis annualized cash revenue excludes properties operated under a TRS structure.\nChanges in these classifications from last quarter were minor, but include a new category for sold properties, mostly previously classified under \"no payment deferral\".\nThere was a slight increase in the new vacancies category, primarily due to terminated AMC leases.\nRegarding our balance sheet and capital markets activities, our debt to gross assets was 40% on a book basis as of December 31.\nAt year-end, we had $3.7 billion in total outstanding debt, of which $3.1 billion is fixed-rate debt or debt fixed through interest rate swaps, with a blended coupon of approximately 4.6%.\nOur weighted average debt maturity is about five years, with no scheduled debt maturities until 2022 when only our revolving credit facility matures.\nAs previously announced, due to continued pressure on near-term quarterly results from COVID-19 impact, we further amended our bank credit facilities and private placement notes during the quarter to extend the waivers of four temporarily suspended covenants through the end of 2021, subject to certain conditions.\nThis amendment provides additional time and flexibility to work with our customers during this uncertain period.\nWe can choose to exit the covenant relief period early, subject to certain conditions, and there were no changes to the previously agreed interest rate schedules.\nWe believe we have sufficient liquidity to weather the market disruption caused by COVID-19.\nWe had over $1 billion in cash on hand at year-end.\nCash flow from operations was positive for Q4 at approximately $6 million.\nWe expect our operating cash flow to be substantially higher as we enter 2021.\nThis positive trajectory and our substantial liquidity gave us confidence to pay down our $1 billion line of credit to $90 million after year-end, while maintaining about $500 million in cash on hand.\nAdditionally, after year-end, we reduced the outstanding balance on our private placement notes by $23.8 million to $316.2 million due to certain property sales and in accordance with the recent amendment to those notes.\nThere was no prepayment penalty on this paydown.\nAs previously announced, we are not providing forward earnings guidance due to uncertainties created by the COVID-19 disruption.\nHowever, we'd like to update you on the expected ranges of contractual cash revenue we anticipate recognizing in our Q1 2021 financial statements, as well as our expected collections for the same period.\nDue to changes in the portfolio from permanent rent reductions, acquisitions, dispositions, occupancy level changes, and other factors, we're shifting from reporting against pre-COVID contractual cash revenue to current contractual cash revenue for guidance and future reporting purposes.\nThis slide shows a reconciliation of these amounts, starting with pre-COVID contractual cash revenue, including percentage rents, for both the quarter and annualized at $156 million and $624 million, respectively, then subtracting pre-COVID percentage rents of $4 million and $15 million, respectively.\nWe then make additional portfolio adjustments to arrive at current contractual cash revenue of $136 million for Q1 and $545 million annualized.\nNote that these amounts are before the impact of any temporary abatements or deferrals.\nThe expected range we anticipate recognizing in Q1 2021 is $98 million to $105 million, or 72% to 77% of such contractual cash revenue.\nAdditionally, we expect to collect between $87 million and $93 million in Q1 2021, or 64% to 68% of such contractual cash revenue.\nDifferences from the full contractual cash revenue amount relate to granted deferrals and associated accounting, as well as abatements.\nEPR is eager to put 2020 behind us and looks forward to consumers once again enjoying the experiences our properties offer.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The Investors section of sysco.com contains a copy of these materials.\nTo allow sufficient time for all questions, we request that each participant limit themselves to one question and one follow-up today.\nI hope you and your loved ones are keeping safe and healthy.\nI'll provide an update on our business transformation and share some highlights of our preparation for the anticipated business environment recovery.\nAs mentioned in previous calls, Sysco has taken quick and decisive action throughout the pandemic to support our customers' success during this disruptive period.\nWe've diligently managed our employee productivity, inventory efficiency, and business investments.\nWe've launched an ambitious business transformation to strategically reshape our company for long-term success.\nI'm happy to report that our business transformation is progressing as planned, and we're confident that the strategic initiatives will enable profitable future growth and set Sysco apart from our competitors.\nThe COVID situation has severely restricted our food-away-from-home sector customers and disrupted our market.\nGiven these challenges, we're pleased with our financial performance in the first half of fiscal 2021, and our second quarter results were generally in line with our expectations, considering the circumstances.\nAlthough our second quarter financial results declined compared to last year, we achieved a profitable quarter despite a 23% drop in top-line sales and funded investments to support our transformation.\nOur customers faced increasingly stringent operational restrictions during the second quarter, most notably in December when restaurant traffic and sales decreased.\nMoreover, our international segment has been severely impacted due to stricter regulations in the countries where we operate.\nAt Sysco, we're not accepting customer restrictions as an insurmountable issue.\nWe're doing more than ever to assist our customers in navigating this challenging environment.\nI'm pleased to announce that Sysco gained overall market share compared to the rest of the industry during the second quarter, reflecting the early progress of our transformation and our success in winning new business. We continue to secure significant business in the national account space, signing an additional $200 million in net new business this quarter, bringing our total to over $1.5 billion in net new contracted business since the pandemic began.\nFurthermore, throughout the second quarter, we began investing in preparation for the business recovery we anticipate will start in calendar year 2021.\nThese investments will increase in the third fiscal quarter, and Aaron will provide more details on this shortly.\nSecond quarter investments included those in our customers, our people, our working capital, and our technology.\nI'd like to highlight some examples of each of these deliberate choices.\nCustomer investments include our new Restaurants Rising campaign, which simplifies restaurant success and strengthens their future business prospects.\nNotably, we announced in November the elimination of minimum delivery requirements for regularly scheduled delivery days, offering operators significant flexibility in managing their business and making it easier to order what they need when they need it.\nAdditionally, we are not reducing delivery service days during the second COVID wave, a practice we know some competitors are currently implementing.\nWe see hope on the horizon, so we're prioritizing customer service.\nA small additional expense now is worthwhile for long-term customer loyalty and partnership.\nOur sales consultants are using the Restaurants Rising program to retain existing customers and help Sysco attract and serve new ones.\nBeyond the no order minimums commitment, Sysco's sales consultants are helping customers set up touchless menus, optimize delivery and takeout operations, and assisting with marketing programs to raise awareness of our customers' businesses, among other value-added services.\nI'm proud to report our Net Promoter Score increased by over 1,000 basis points in the quarter, largely due to the connections with our customers generated by the Restaurants Rising program.\nThis NPS increase was the largest quarterly increase in our company's history.\nImportantly, as shown on page seven of our slides, Sysco's customers have a 50% lower incremental closure rate compared to the industry average.\nLastly, we onboarded more new local customers in Q2 than in any single quarter in the past five years.\nIn addition to customer investments, we're investing in our people.\nWe're deliberately retaining drivers despite the December volume decline to ensure their availability for our anticipated volume recovery.\nDrivers are scarce nationwide, and while this investment will lead to some short-term increase in transportation costs, it will help ensure Sysco can maximize our share gains during the upcoming business recovery.\nAs you know, we made changes to our sales organization and compensation during the summer.\nOur employee retention has improved compared to historical rates, which will help with future sales productivity metrics.\nWe're beginning to invest in working capital to position the right products in the right locations in preparation for the upcoming business recovery.\nSysco offers the broadest inventory selection in the industry.\nOur ability to deliver products on time and in full during the upcoming volume recovery period is a key factor that makes Sysco the leading broadline distributor in the industry.\nWe have the financial strength and capacity to invest in products and inventory, while other foodservice distributors may struggle with sufficient cash flow to make similar investments in the coming quarters.\nWe're also offering payment plans in partnership with our customers to ensure their continuity.\nLastly, we're making strategic investments in our technology to enhance the customer experience.\nThis includes our Sysco Shop technology, new pricing software, and improvements to our supply chain systems.\nSysco's ability to invest in our customers, people, inventory, and technology while delivering a profitable quarter during this pandemic demonstrates the strength of our balance sheet and leadership team.\nI'd now like to provide an update on our business transformation.\nFirst, as previously mentioned, we're focused on advancing our customer-facing digital tools to improve the customer experience with Sysco and drive additional sales.\nOur top priority is enhancing our mobile ordering platform, Sysco Shop.\nNotably, we can now onboard new customers in less than 24 hours, a significant improvement.\nThe number of customer orders placed through Sysco Shop continued to increase substantially throughout the quarter.\nAdditionally, our new pricing software is now live in our first test region.\nWe're learning a lot through this regional pilot and remain on track to roll out the pricing system nationwide.\nThis effort aims to improve pricing transparency with our customers and drive additional sales and gross profit growth by optimizing prices at the customer item level.\nMoreover, by automating customer-level pricing, we'll free up time for our valued sales consultants to focus on value-added activities with customers, such as menu design, Sysco brand penetration, and other drivers of sales and margin.\nSecond, we're enhancing our go-to-market selling strategy by transforming our sales process.\nOur sales transformation has resulted in an improved, more customer-centric organizational structure.\nThe sales transformation is progressing well, and the team-based selling approach is gaining momentum.\nWe've established and developed new specialized sales roles.\nWe've introduced a sales coordinator position to help guide the combined sales teams across a specific region.\nAs previously mentioned, we've initiated our first cuisine-specific marketing strategy and are observing early indications of success with this customer segment through increased market share.\nThis initiative will be expanded to additional cuisine categories in the 2021 calendar year.\nFinally, Sysco has completed the regionalization of our field leadership structure at the beginning of our second quarter.\nI'm happy to announce that our new regional presidents are in position and are identifying quick opportunities to enhance our operations.\nThe typical tenure of our market and regional leaders exceeds 20 years, and these experienced and skilled leaders are highly capable of driving top performance within Sysco.\nExamples of quick improvements include optimizing our inventory selection across multiple physical locations and improving service to key customers by ensuring the most efficient physical location serves each customer site.\nTo be an outstanding company, you need to have an exceptional leadership team.\nI'm pleased that during the quarter, we made significant progress in enhancing our leadership team.\nAaron Alt has joined Sysco as our Chief Financial Officer.\nAaron is a proven finance executive with over two decades of experience in foodservice and retail leadership roles.\nHe has a history of transformation and value creation at large organizations across various industries.\nFurthermore, Tom Peck has joined Sysco as Chief Information and Digital Officer.\nTom has experience leading enterprise information technology strategy, services, operations risk, and cybersecurity for major global enterprises.\nIn his most recent position, he worked for a large global B2B distributor in the electronics industry, experience that is directly relevant to the transformational journey at Sysco.\nAdditionally, Tim Orting has officially started his role leading our International division.\nTim will be based in our London offices and will be responsible for driving profitable growth and operational excellence across our international locations.\nWith Tim joining Sysco, I was able to reduce my direct reports by four, allowing me to focus more of my time and energy on managing the company's strategy development and execution.\nJoel Grade has begun his new role leading business development and is actively involved in identifying new growth opportunities for Sysco.\nI'm pleased to say that the transition of Sysco's leadership team is now complete.\nWe have a strong management team that balances Sysco and foodservice industry expertise with top-tier experience from other sectors.\nOur new leaders join a talented and experienced Sysco leadership team.\nGreg Bertrand, the leader of our U.S. business, has over 35 years of industry experience, with 30 years specifically at Sysco.\nGreg's expertise and steady guidance in managing our largest business during the COVID disruption has been invaluable.\nI appreciate his leadership and the significant impact he has on our results.\nExcellent leadership teams collaborate on a shared agenda.\nOur transformation strategy has united this leadership team around a common purpose, and I am honored to work with them to set the standard for foodservice distribution for years to come.\nI report to you today with strong confidence that a business recovery is imminent.\nAs vaccine distribution progresses globally, the restrictions currently imposed on our customers will begin to ease.\nOur performance data shows that once these restrictions are lifted, consumers are eager and willing to dine out.\nAt Sysco, we are working to maximize our opportunity to recover faster than the industry.\nWe have a chance to gain market share, given our financial strength and our compelling business transformation.\nWe are prepared to do more than any other foodservice distributor in the industry to ensure our customers' success.\nOur customers' success will generate business growth for Sysco.\nOur industry-leading sales force has been motivated by the Restaurants Rising campaign to support our customers at levels higher than ever before in our proud history.\nOur warehouse and delivery associates are the best in the business, working diligently every day to ensure we deliver to our customers what they need when they need it.\nI am proud of their dedication during this challenging operational period.\nAt Sysco, our customers inspire us, and we will demonstrate equal determination in how we serve them.\nI am truly excited to be at Sysco.\nBefore joining Sysco, I saw from the outside a company with global scale, a strong competitive position, and excellent profitability and liquidity for the industry.\nNow that I'm on the inside, I see all of that plus a driven leadership team intensely focused on being prepared for the business recovery and then driving a customer and capability-led transformation.\nIn summary, I see numerous opportunities ahead of us to create shareholder value.\nI will begin today with second quarter results for the enterprise and our business segments, followed by an update on cash flow.\nSecond quarter revenue was $11.6 billion, a 23.1% decrease from the previous year, but unchanged from the prior quarter.\nSales had been trending ahead of Q1 through October and November as restrictions eased, but new lockdown measures during December reversed the earlier progress, particularly in the International segment.\nThere are a few additional metrics to note.\nFor the quarter, local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations decreased 19.7% while total case volume within U.S. Broadline operations decreased 23.7%.\nWe understand there is significant interest in the ongoing impact of COVID.\nThe situation varies by region.\nEurope entered lockdown in December and is expected to remain in varying degrees of lockdown for a substantial portion of the second half.\nHowever, since the week after the holidays, we have been observing signs of improvement in volume from our U.S. FS business, and SYGMA continues to grow.\nThis challenge will be addressed week by week, region by region for the next couple of quarters until vaccination is widespread and the business recovery takes hold.\nThe only commitment we can make is that we will be prepared and more competitive than ever.\nMoving down the P&L, gross profit decreased 25.8% to $2.1 billion in the second quarter.\nThe majority of the decline in gross profit was due to lower volumes resulting from COVID.\nWe observed a slight decrease in overall gross margin of approximately 67 basis points, with our rate coming in at 18.2%\nA few points to consider on this matter\nWe typically experience a seasonal decline in gross margin from the first to the second quarter, as was the case this year\nRemarkably, our largest segment US Foodservice and its partner segment SYGMA both maintained stable gross margin rates compared to the same pre-COVID quarter, despite challenging market conditions\nThe growth of our lower-margin national accounts business at SYGMA led to a business mix shift, which was the primary cause of the margin rate change\nOur enterprise margin was also affected by the International and other businesses, both of which experienced gross margin declines in the quarter for reasons that are being addressed\nOur expense structure changed during our second quarter, with adjusted operating expenses decreasing by 15.3% to $1.9 billion\nThis expense profile reflects a deleverage of our cost structure as sales remained down 23%\nThese outcomes are the result of some deliberate decisions\nFirstly, on the positive side, we targeted and achieved increased productivity in key areas such as our warehouse network\nWe also maintained our key transportation efficiency metrics despite significant fluctuations in case volume\nSecondly, we continue to make excellent progress towards our $350 million cost savings goal for fiscal 2021\nI can see the savings in the detailed income statement, and we continue to identify and pursue additional opportunities\nThirdly, but on the other side, we have deliberately chosen to use our financial strength to prepare for the business recovery before it occurs\nAs previously announced, we modified our sales consultant compensation to include both fixed and variable components to improve retention and focus on key operational metrics\nWe can see this change working in our market wins\nAdditionally, we brought back hundreds of employees in the second quarter to support our business model\nIn the third quarter and the latter half of the year, we plan to hire thousands more sales consultants, new business developers, culinary experts, and operations associates in anticipation of the upcoming business recovery\nWe aim to be ahead of the recovery curve, not playing catch-up, and we have the financial resources to do so\nLastly, as Kevin mentioned, we continue to make strategic investments in our capability development to support our transformation in pricing, customer experience, sales, vendor management, and personalization\nWhile we expect significant returns on these efforts in future quarters, the investment costs are offsetting part of our savings in the second quarter and will continue to do so in the latter half of the year\nWhen combined with the impact of slower openings in our International segment, we expect our third quarter results to be more challenging than initially anticipated\nHowever, as volume returns and grows, whether due to market recovery or our deliberate investments, we expect to move up the sales curve more rapidly than others and anticipate that over the next several quarters, the impact of the cost savings efforts, separate from ongoing investments, will become more apparent\nAt the enterprise level, adjusted operating income decreased by 63% to $234 million\nFor the second quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate of 16.8% was favorably influenced by the impact of stock option exercises\nAdjusted earnings per share decreased by 80% to $0.17 for the quarter\nLet's now examine our second quarter results by business segment, starting with the U.S. Foodservice operations\nSales were $8 billion, representing a decrease of 23.9% compared to the same period last year\nDespite the challenging environment, the business acquired a record number of new customers, as our sales teams were actively engaged and we deployed digital tools\nWe also saw growth in our national accounts customer base\nWithin the business, Sysco brand sales for the second quarter decreased by 165 basis points to 36.5% for total U.S. cases, driven by shifts in customer and product mix\nFor local U.S. cases, Sysco brand sales decreased by 455 basis points to 42%, which was driven by a product mix shift towards pre-packaged and takeaway ready products\nGross profit decreased by 24% to $1.6 billion for the quarter, while gross margin remained stable at 19.7% as the business successfully navigated the challenges of the COVID environment and addressed issues such as aged inventory for customers like cruise lines and product mix shifts away from higher margin categories like PP&E\nThe segment's adjusted operating expenses decreased by 18.9% to $1.1 billion and adjusted operating income decreased by 33% to $472 million\nMoving on to the SYGMA segment\nSales increased by 4% to $1.5 billion compared to the same period last year, driven by the success of national and regional quick service restaurants serving drive-through traffic\nThis marks the second consecutive quarter of sales growth in this segment\nWe continue to see new business wins in the SYGMA segment and are pleased with the overall improvement\nGross profit increased by 4.1% to $129 million for the quarter and gross margin remained unchanged from the previous year\nAdjusted operating expenses increased by 4% to $118 million and adjusted operating income increased by 5% to $11 million\nTurning to the International segment, our European, Canadian and Latin American businesses have been significantly impacted by recent shutdowns, which are more stringent than lockdowns in the U.S\nThe International Foodservice operation segment saw sales of $2 billion, a decrease of 32%, while gross profit decreased by 36.2% and gross margin decreased by 128 basis points\nThe decline in gross margin was due to unfavorable market mix, customer mix, product mix, and aged inventory\nFor the International segment, adjusted operating expenses decreased by 16% and adjusted operating income decreased by 175%, resulting in an operating loss of $55 million\nOur Other segment, which includes our Guest Worldwide business, remains challenged as hospitality occupancy rates remain low compared to previous year levels\nHowever, the business is performing better than many of its competitors and has secured several recent customer wins, including being named the preferred distributor for Renaissance Hotels, JW Marriott, and Westin Hotels through a new contract with Avendra in both the U.S. and Canada, and gaining access to all Marriott properties in North America, Central America, and the Caribbean\nWhile still in turnaround mode in a difficult hospitality environment, the business improved its underlying profitability during the second quarter\nCash flow from operations was $937 million for the first half of fiscal 2021\nFree cash flow was $788 million year-to-date, which aligns with our previously provided guidance\nNet capital expenditure for the first half of fiscal 2021 was $148 million, which was $235 million lower than last year as the company carefully evaluated its capital investment choices in light of COVID\nSysco maintains a strong financial position from a balance sheet perspective\nAt the end of the quarter, we had $5.8 billion in cash on our balance sheet, plus access to $2 billion of available borrowing capacity, totaling $7.8 billion\nOur cash and available liquidity ensure we have the stability and flexibility to make decisions that are in the best interest of the company\nWe continue to closely monitor our operating environment\nAs we assess reopening timelines and investment needs in line with our transformation, we will update our views on cash levels and capital structure opportunities in future calls\nAlthough this is a challenging operating environment for our customers, which will impact our results for the next quarter or two, Sysco remains firmly focused on aggressively managing its businesses, preparing for the business recovery, and developing customer-centric capabilities to accelerate long-term growth\nWe believe our strategy and transformational initiatives will create future value for our associates, shareholders, and customers\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Blake Krueger, Chairman and CEO, Brendan Hoffman, President, and Mike Stornant, SVP and CFO are participating in today's call.\nUnderlying performance figures exclude the newly acquired Sweaty Betty brand.\nReconciliations for these disclosures can be found in tables attached to the release.\nI trust everyone joining the call is in good health and safety.\nIn Q3, demand for our leading brands and products exceeded our projections and continues to grow rapidly.\nOur focus on strengthening consumer connections, enhancing digital and direct-to-consumer capabilities, and innovating in product design is yielding positive results.\nDespite supply chain issues limiting our ability to fully meet rising demand in the near term, I'm incredibly optimistic about our future and 2022 outlook.\nWe reported revenue growth of over 29% compared to 2020 and 11% versus 2019 earlier today.\nRevenue for the third quarter was approximately $637 million.\nGross margin increases drove strong earnings leverage.\nWe believe factory closures and logistics delays impacted Q3 revenue by at least $60 million.\nThe Wolverine Michigan Group saw a 13% year-over-year revenue increase, while the Wolverine Boston Group's revenue rose by over 33%.\nBoth groups surpassed their 2019 performance.\nThe company's adjusted earnings per share were $0.62, meeting expectations despite revenue shortfalls caused by macro supply chain issues.\nWe're confident in our ability to deliver accelerated future growth, supported by several fundamental factors.\nOur diverse brand portfolio and international distribution network reduce risk and provide strategic advantages in the current climate, as we're not reliant on any single product category, geographic area, consumer group, or distribution channel.\nWhile lifestyle changes have boosted demand for performance products, the underlying trends in this category are long-term and expected to continue.\nConsumers are increasingly prioritizing health and wellness, with activities like running, hiking, outdoor recreation, and exercise serving as primary drivers of this mindset.\nRunning participation in the U.S. has grown annually for the past five years.\nA large majority of new runners intend to continue running in the future.\nParticipation in various outdoor activities, including hiking, walking, and boating, has also increased, with over 20 million new hikers in the U.S. since 2015.\nNational Parks broke attendance records this past spring and summer, while new boat purchases and water activities reached a 13-year high.\nThe renewed interest in outdoor activities is expected to persist, especially as travel resumes.\nThe work category has also shown strong growth, supported by positive industry conditions and work wear fashion trends.\nWarehousing jobs have more than doubled since 2005, and construction companies are expected to hire hundreds of thousands of additional workers in the coming months.\nThe passage of a major U.S. infrastructure plan will further boost momentum in this category.\nWe've placed consumers at the center of our global strategy across all brands and product categories, changing how we bring products to market and operate the business.\nThis strategic focus led to our recent acquisition of Sweaty Betty, a trendy women's activewear brand that adds a significant direct-to-consumer business to our portfolio, with over 80% of revenue generated through DTC channels.\nIncluding Sweaty Betty, DTC e-commerce revenue more than doubled in Q3 compared to 2019, and our DTC stores are up over 35% versus that year.\nOur owned online business and our wholesale customers' online business now account for over 30% of global revenue.\nCombined with DTC businesses operated by our distributor partners worldwide, nearly 40% of our global revenue and a larger percentage of our pairs is now generated through consumer direct channels, enabling enhanced brand shopping experiences, valuable consumer insights and data, and a more efficient business model.\nWe continue to capitalize on fundamental consumer trends in the market.\nIn addition to our strong DTC business, these trends are reflected in continued strength in retail sell-through and a historically high order backlog extending into Q3 of 2022.\nWe remain optimistic about our outlook given these trends and our brand portfolio composition, which is overrepresented in trending performance and lifestyle categories.\nWe anticipate strong long-term consumer demand, especially for Saucony, Merrell, Sweaty Betty, our work brands, and Sperry, which will launch a line of active sport products next spring.\nBrendan Hoffman will provide additional insight on key brand performance during the quarter.\nMike Stornant will review our Q3 financial performance and updated outlook in more detail.\nI'll conclude with some final remarks.\nI'll now hand it over to Brendan.\nIn the third quarter, we acquired Sweaty Betty, a powerhouse brand operating in the global activewear market valued at over $200 billion.\nThe brand aligns with our key strategic priorities by offering industry-leading products, expanding our direct-to-consumer presence, and growing our international business.\nWe plan to leverage Sweaty Betty's best practices and apparel expertise across our portfolio.\nThe business grew over 50% in the third quarter, surpassing our expectations.\nLess than three months after welcoming Sweaty Betty to the Wolverine family, we're even more excited about the growth potential, product collaborations, and operational synergies ahead.\nSaucony delivered a strong Q3 performance, growing more than 40% over 2020 and 60% versus 2019, despite some supply chain challenges.\nSaucony.com sales increased by more than 50% and nearly tripled compared to 2019.\nThe brand has achieved global success, with all regions contributing significant growth.\nOutside the U.S. market, technical running and lifestyle performance in Europe was particularly strong, up 30% versus 2020.\nOur Saucony Originals lifestyle business continues to perform well, especially internationally.\nOur performance in Europe continues to accelerate, while the Asia Pacific region presents a significant opportunity for future growth, with the brand delivering over 60% growth in Q3.\nSaucony stores and online business are performing well in China as the brand's joint venture there gains momentum.\nSaucony continues to deliver a consistent flow of high-performance products and trend-right lifestyle offerings.\nThis has resulted in consistent robust growth for the brand over the past several quarters, and we expect this trend to continue into 2022.\nThe road running category leads the way, including recent launches of the new Ride 14, the brand's biggest franchise shoe, and Triumph 19.\nSaucony's trail running business also grew by more than 40% in the quarter.\nLet's focus on Merrell now.\nThe company is experiencing unprecedented demand and strong momentum across all global channels.\nDuring the third quarter, Merrell faced challenges due to factory closures in Vietnam, resulting in at least $25 million in lost revenue opportunities.\nDespite these obstacles, Merrell still managed to achieve mid-single-digit growth compared to 2020.\nMerrell's direct-to-consumer business grew moderately in the quarter, with merrell.com building upon its significant expansion from the previous year.\nMerrell stores also surpassed our expectations, indicating the brand's strength and consumers' renewed interest in in-store shopping.\nMerrell holds the top market share position for hiking in the U.S. and leads the category in many key global markets.\nWhile Merrell continues to enhance its established and market-leading core product lines, new innovative offerings are generating excitement and attracting new customers.\nThe Moab Speed and Moab Flight collections are revitalizing the performance category.\nThese products embody the brand's vision for fast, lightweight footwear suitable for trail and light hiking, building on the legacy of the world's best-selling hiking boot, The Moab.\nThis momentum is further enhanced by an increase in organic media coverage that spans both performance and lifestyle sectors.\nFor instance, Annie Leibovitz featured the Moab Speed in Vogue's September issue, pairing it with a Louis Vuitton outfit for a major photo shoot.\nAdditionally, Merrell was showcased on The Today Show during Q3, highlighting the Moab Speed, which aligns well with the brand's Step Further campaign promoting increased outdoor engagement.\nBoth collections have surpassed our expectations, and we are optimistic about the potential for new performance lines in 2022.\nMerrell's Lifestyle segment outperformed the brand's overall growth in Q3.\nWe are observing positive outcomes from our strategic emphasis on further positioning Merrell as a lifestyle brand.\nRecent brand health studies suggest that consumers are increasingly incorporating Merrell into their personal identities.\nThese trends are reflected in the strong performance of lifestyle products, including the Hydro Moc and the newly introduced Cloud all-day casual sneaker collection made with eco-friendly materials.\nAs mentioned in our Q2 call, Merrell launched its 1TRL capsule collection on merrell.com, targeting younger, fashion-forward consumers seeking authentic outdoor-inspired style.\nLooking forward, Merrell has significant growth potential globally, particularly in EMEA, which has been gaining momentum for several quarters, and in Asia Pacific where the China joint venture is just beginning to gain traction.\nOutdoor and performance trends are strong worldwide, and Merrell is capitalizing on its heritage and brand positioning.\nIn the third quarter, our work business accounted for nearly 20% of total revenue and the category continued to show strong growth with Wolverine, the leader in the U.S. work boot market, up over 16%, Cat Footwear up nearly 40%, and strong contributions from our smaller brands.\nAs Blake mentioned, we anticipate continued robust growth in the work category as we move into 2022.\nBased on the performance of Merrell, Saucony, Sweaty Betty, Wolverine and our other work brands, our performance business grew by nearly 30% compared to 2019 during the third quarter.\nThe Sperry brand maintained its steady recovery in Q3 with over 40% growth.\nThe brand's direct-to-consumer business increased by 25%, driven by ongoing e-commerce growth and strong Sperry store performance.\nAll product categories achieved strong double-digit increases in the quarter.\nThe overall boat shoe market showed significant growth, particularly in men's, and Sperry gained substantial market share in this key category.\nFrom a fashion perspective, there are clear indications that we are at the forefront of a boat shoe trend, with very encouraging demand from key retailers for the first half of 2022.\nYou may have noticed James Bond wearing a pair of our iconic boat shoes in No Time To Die.\nIn the coming months, Sperry plans to build on the momentum created by recent collaborations with Rowing Blazers and Netflix Outer Banks, as well as product capsules with John Legend and Rebecca Minkoff.\nThe brand is also well-positioned for the current seasonal women's boot business with strong demand and healthy inventory levels.\nSperry will capitalize on the easy on-off trend during Q4 with the new Moc Sider and Cozy Float collections.\nIn Spring 2022, the brand will introduce its new Sperry Sport collection, aligning with macro consumer trends by offering more trend-right, performance-based products for water activities.\nLooking ahead, our product lines are robust across the brand portfolio, and order demand continues to strengthen.\nWe have been adaptable and responsive in navigating the ongoing macro supply chain challenges to meet the increased demand we are seeing in nearly every brand.\nWe believe that strong products combined with more precise merchandising and consumer focus, as well as healthier inventory positions, will drive growth over the next year.\nOur direct-to-consumer channels remain a top priority and a source of opportunity for the business.\nWe have shifted to a more dynamic e-commerce operating model to enable faster implementation of technical enhancements and new commercial capabilities, which will also help us extend improved online functionality to our global online wholesale customers.\nIn addition to our global direct-to-consumer e-commerce business, we are seeing significant wholesale growth with our online retail customers.\nAs global economies have reopened, we have observed consumers shifting some of their spending back to brick-and-mortar stores.\nApproximately 50% of our footwear is now sold online in the important U.S. market.\nThis bodes well for the current brand operating model we are executing, including a more continuous product flow and best-in-class digital marketing content to benefit all channels.\nWe continue to evaluate our store fleet and believe there may be favorable and profitable opportunities for us to explore as we expand our footprint in key markets starting in 2022.\nI will now hand it over to Mike to review the third quarter financial results and our increased 2021 outlook in more detail.\nLet me begin by reviewing the company's strong third quarter financial performance, and then I'll discuss our revised outlook for 2021.\nThird quarter revenue of approximately $637 million represents growth of over 29% compared to the previous year and includes $39 million from the recently acquired Sweaty Betty business.\nOn a pro forma basis, Sweaty Betty grew over 50% compared to 2020.\nBased on increased consumer demand experienced across the portfolio during the quarter, the company was on track to deliver just under $700 million in third quarter revenue.\nHowever, as Blake mentioned, the unprecedented factory closures and other well-documented supply chain disruptions hindered our ability to meet this strong demand.\nDespite these challenges, Saucony and Sperry each achieved over 40% growth.\nMerrell was most heavily impacted by the factory closures in Southern Vietnam, yet still managed to deliver mid-single-digit growth.\nOur work business also continued to drive significant growth at over 20%.\nAdjusted gross margin improved by 330 basis points compared to the previous year, reaching 44.6% due to higher average selling prices, favorable product mix, and the addition of Sweaty Betty for nearly two months of the quarter.\nMerrell, Saucony, and Sperry all significantly exceeded gross margin expectations in the quarter, demonstrating their strong position in the marketplace and robust pipeline of relevant, trend-right products.\nSweaty Betty's high-end positioning, unique products, and favorable consumer trends are generating strong gross margins that enhance our core business performance in the third quarter.\nAir freight expenses totaled roughly $10 million during the quarter, with $7 million excluded from our adjusted results.\nIf the full air freight impact was included, our adjusted gross margin would have been 43.5%, still 220 basis points higher than the previous year.\nWe are still utilizing air freight when necessary to address exceptional supply chain delays specifically caused by COVID.\nAdjusted selling, general and administrative expenses of about $208 million were $56 million more than last year, mainly due to increased revenue, the addition of Sweaty Betty, and higher marketing investments.\nThe third quarter's adjusted operating margin was 12%, a 140 basis point improvement over last year and better than we anticipated.\nThis significant leverage on the company's revenue growth was a result of expanded gross margins and balanced operating expense management.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.62, compared to $0.35 in the prior year, representing a 77% increase or 3.5 times our revenue growth for the quarter.\nReported diluted earnings per share broke even and include several non-recurring or exceptional items totaling approximately $34 million related to bond retirements, $10 million for the Sweaty Betty acquisition, $17 million for legacy environmental matters, and $7 million for above-normal air freight costs.\nThe company and 3M agreed on a non-binding term sheet outlining proposed settlement terms for certain lawsuits related to our legacy environmental issue.\nTurning to the balance sheet, total inventory increased by approximately 26% compared to 2020, with Sweaty Betty accounting for 16 percentage points of that growth.\nCore inventory was up about 10% from last year but still lower than in 2019.\nOur inventory situation has improved over the past two quarters, particularly for Saucony, Sperry, and our work brands, but it's still not matching the higher demand.\nMerrell is still dealing with the aftermath of closed Vietnamese factories, which has put more strain on inventory levels.\nBased on current projections, inventory levels will continue to improve due to supply chain diversification, new factory additions, increased capacity for 2022, higher production orders placed in mid-2021, and other measures taken to counteract macro supply chain challenges.\nSince August 1, we purchased Sweaty Betty for about $410 million, financed through existing cash and borrowing from the company's credit line.\nWe also carried out important refinancing activities to support future growth and optimize our capital structure, including a bond refinancing and a new credit facility that provides additional liquidity and flexibility for investment in growth.\nAs a result of these recent actions, we've added a powerful growth brand to our portfolio while maintaining a very healthy balance sheet with total liquidity of approximately $800 million.\nI will now provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2021.\nFirst, let me highlight the strong demand indicators across our portfolio that support a very optimistic growth outlook for the coming quarters.\nOur order book is at historically high levels, providing clear demand visibility for our global wholesale and distributor businesses well into 2022.\nRetail sell-through continues to be robust.\nDespite shipment delays and supply chain disruptions, order cancellations have been minimal as retailers remain committed to our leading brands and product offerings.\nOur performance and work footwear brands continue to show positive momentum, and Sperry is now showing signs of a healthy recovery.\nSweaty Betty has become our fourth-largest brand and is driving accelerated growth.\nOur direct-to-consumer business trends remain strong, with year-to-date underlying e-commerce revenue nearly doubling compared to 2019 and year-to-date underlying store revenue up by mid-teens.\nDemand in our Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions is recovering well as we move into spring 2022, and we see near-term strength across many international markets.\nAll these indicators give us great confidence for the future.\nThe strength of new product offerings and improved go-to-market strategies across our portfolio will allow us to continue fueling growth despite the macro supply chain challenges that we expect to persist well into 2022.\nIn the short term, factory closures and a volatile logistics environment are having an unplanned negative impact on revenue for the last four months of 2021.\nAs a result, we are adjusting our fiscal 2021 outlook.\nWe now expect fiscal 2021 revenue of approximately $2.4 billion, representing growth of nearly 35% compared to the previous year and about 28% growth on an underlying basis.\nDespite the short-term supply chain impact, we still anticipate delivering up to 25% growth in the fourth quarter.\nWe expect ongoing cost pressure from higher freight and logistics expenses throughout the fourth quarter, and we will continue to invest in our future growth opportunities, including brand-enhancing marketing and key talent.\nWe now project full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.05 to $2.10 and fourth-quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.38 to $0.43, representing 100% growth over 2020 at the high end of that range.\nFull-year reported diluted earnings per share are now expected to be between $1.16 and $1.21.\nWe have a good view of the start of 2022 and are very enthusiastic about continued brand momentum as we enter the new year.\nWhile certain known supply chain challenges will persist, we still expect to deliver mid-teens underlying growth and mid-20s overall growth in the first quarter of 2022.\nWe remain highly confident in delivering double-digit underlying growth next year, and we believe Sweaty Betty significantly enhances the company's growth profile.\nOur healthy growth and strong financial performance in the third quarter demonstrate the company's strategic focus and accelerated brand investments.\nIn recent years, we've consistently invested in digital and direct-to-consumer capabilities, technology, talent, e-commerce, product innovation, and design.\nIn the third quarter, we made an important acquisition with Sweaty Betty, which will be a significant growth catalyst for our performance brands.\nOur product pipeline is robust, consumer demand is surging, and brand popularity and ongoing trends favor our offerings.\nWe are confident as we plan for double-digit growth in 2022.\nOur advantageous position today is a credit to our team's expertise and relentless work, especially over the past couple of years.\nThe global marketplace continues to be dynamic and fast-changing, and our people and company are excelling in this environment.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The initial quarter's performance was impressive, comparing favorably to both the previous year and the pre-pandemic period two years prior.\nSales increased by 39% compared to last year and 9% compared to two years ago, before the COVID-19 pandemic.\nEBITDA showed significant growth, rising 119% from the previous year and 62% from two years ago, providing a strong foundation for the 2022 fiscal year.\nThese results have bolstered our confidence, leading us to solidify and slightly raise our full-year projections, despite factoring in current challenges such as workforce issues, rising raw material costs, and supply chain difficulties.\nThe diversity of our global operations has proven beneficial, with Brazil and Asia performing exceptionally well in the first quarter.\nNorth American performance met expectations but was hampered by labor shortages, which are expected to persist through the second quarter before showing improvement in the latter half of the year.\nREPREVE sales continue to show strong growth, increasing 39% year-over-year and 27% compared to the pre-pandemic period two years ago.\nWe're observing increased customer commitment to recycled materials across various industries, resulting in numerous positive customer acquisitions recently.\nOur investment in EvoCooler technology is expected to yield long-term productivity benefits, with initial results meeting efficiency and output expectations.\nLabor challenges in the U.S. are being addressed through competitive compensation and benefits, as well as innovative solutions derived from employee feedback.\nDespite a strong start to the fiscal year, we acknowledge there's still considerable work ahead, but we remain optimistic about the future.\nOur robust first quarter results for fiscal 2022 exceeded initial projections, demonstrating the adaptability of our global business model and the dedication of our workforce.\nWe continue to navigate the recovery successfully, with Q1 revenues up 6% sequentially and 39% year-over-year, slightly surpassing our expectations.\nThe increased demand for our core products across all regions contributed to revenue growth, which translated into substantial year-over-year profit increases.\nWe faced several challenges during Q1, including supply chain disruptions due to global logistics issues and domestic labor shortages, but our team's swift actions prevented significant disruptions to our operations.\nIn Brazil, market volatility persisted due to rising freight costs from China, exchange rate uncertainty, and increasing textured yarn costs in Asia, all of which have driven up local market prices for textured yarn.\nInflation concerns in Brazil, reaching levels not seen in years, may impact demand but could also lead to increased consumption of locally produced yarns, potentially boosting our market share.\nIn the U.S. and Central America, we continued to adjust selling prices proactively to offset rising raw material and other costs.\nWe face additional challenges in this area as we observe rising prices for polyester and nylon raw materials due to recent increases in crude oil costs.\nThis difficult process is also being experienced by our customers, who, like us, are compelled to pass on their increased input costs to their own clientele.\nIn the United States, we encountered labor difficulties similar to many other businesses.\nWe view this as a chance to improve as an employer and are investing more resources in training and employee retention.\nFortunately, the termination of the federal subsidy in early September has brought more individuals back into the workforce, which we are taking advantage of.\nIt's important to note that COVID's impacts are still evident, particularly in our manufacturing facilities, resulting in the need to quarantine several employees.\nSadly, we have lost some employees to the virus, and our thoughts are with their loved ones.\nWe have experienced some delays in supply and extended lead times for certain products, but nothing significantly disruptive to our operations.\nIn Asia, we had a very positive start to the quarter with continued sales growth in our REPREVE brand and other value-added products.\nAs you know, there are concerns at the Chinese central government level regarding energy consumption and air pollution, which put some pressure on the business at the end of the quarter.\nWe are noticing some caution from customers and suppliers who are dealing with COVID lockdowns and energy restrictions.\nThe situation remains unpredictable and introduces some uncertainty in the short term.\nWe anticipate overcoming these challenges in the coming months as demand is typically strong leading up to the Lunar New Year, which falls at the beginning of February this year.\nReturning to the consolidated business.\nIt's encouraging to see the progress we've made towards our fiscal 2022 and long-term goals despite these multiple challenges.\nWe remain dedicated to maintaining a strong financial position, and our current balance sheet provides a solid foundation for executing growth-focused capital allocation priorities.\nBeyond financial matters, we continue to observe an increasing number of customers committing to producing products using recycled materials.\nDuring the first quarter, we delivered over 23 million hang tags to brand customers.\nAs shown on Slide 4, products made with REPREVE fiber accounted for 37% of consolidated net sales, up from 36% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.\nThis growth is regional and primarily evident in our Asia, U.S., and Central American revenues.\nOur REPREVE momentum into new textile sectors and multiple brand adoptions across Europe has been very strong.\nLast month, TenCate Protective Fabrics, a traditional workwear and industrial textiles company from the Netherlands, began marketing its Tecapro line of workwear using REPREVE, extending REPREVE beyond traditional fashion textiles into protective wear.\nThis marks the first time our multi-functional REPREVE inhibit value-added combination is being used in flame-retardant workwear, adding a sustainable element to a highly durable product.\nTenCate chose REPREVE inhibit for its quality, reliability, reputation, traceability, and transparency, and we're excited to help them communicate their sustainable and flame-retardant story through various co-marketing channels.\nREPREVE's presence in the Turkish market continues to grow, with a new line of denim by Mavi Jeans.\nMavi Jeans launched a nationwide TV commercial showcasing their adoption of recycled polyester in their new line of jeans.\nOther recent adoptions by European brands include French brand Jules and German brands Marc O'Polo, Duke, and Street One owned by CBR Fashion Group.\nOne of Inditex's brands, Massimo Dutti, has continued to roll out products using REPREVE RO.\nIn the U.S., we continued to see strong co-marketing in the menswear segment.\nHaggar has introduced a new line of suit separates in various fits under the name Smart Wash REPREVE suits.\nFrom conversations with employees, I know it's a proud moment when they see this iconic U.S. brand promoting their sustainability story, which is based on REPREVE, in stores like Kohl's or JCPenney or online.\nExpanding beyond the apparel market, our presence in the global home goods sector continues to grow, with the launch of several CD mattresses in Canada featuring REPREVE.\nNow turning to our operating segment performance during the first quarter.\nI'll provide some general comments before Craig discusses more specific details.\nOur polyester and nylon segments continued to show strength in the first quarter, benefiting from strong sales momentum and robust customer demand.\nOur commercial and manufacturing teams have done an excellent job navigating the previously mentioned challenges, and we remain optimistic about the sales mix and pricing dynamics for this segment going forward.\nThe Asia segment had another strong quarter, with volumes increasing due to new and existing customer program growth.\nShutdowns and uncertainty in Vietnam and Southeast Asia have not impacted us as much as other companies, as it's a smaller part of our business.\nWhile we anticipate some temporary slowdowns in China due to new shutdown mandates related to energy management, businesses are still operating, and the demand for sustainable yarns has never been higher.\nI'm confident that our team's continued focus on meeting the growing sustainability and value-added demands of their customers will help us navigate these challenges.\nAs evidenced by the financial performance, the Brazilian team has continued to perform exceptionally well.\nIn the initial quarter, robust pricing and product mix led to a sales increase exceeding 50% compared to the same period last year, resulting in a gross profit surge of over 100%.\nWe expect some moderation in profits from this area going forward, with the annual gross margin likely settling just under 20%.\nRecently, the U.S. Commerce Department concluded that polyester textured yarn imports from four Southeast Asian countries are being sold unfairly below market value in the United States. Anti-dumping duty rates ranging from 2% to 56% have been implemented.\nThe U.S. International Trade Commission will make its final ruling on this matter on November 30th.\nI'll now hand over to Craig.\nOur other financial metrics generally aligned with our projections regarding overall SG&A expenses, effective tax rate, and capital expenditures and working capital related to business investments and strong sales performance.\nTotal net sales grew by 38.5% from $141.5 million to $196 million, primarily due to the business recovery observed over the past five quarters of consecutive sales growth.\nThe Polyester segment's modest volume change was partly affected by the workforce challenges mentioned earlier by Al and Eddie.\nThe price and mix shift reflects recent selling price adjustments in response to rising input costs, although we haven't fully adjusted the portfolio to current cost levels.\nIn Asia, sales volume growth reflects successful new and existing customer programs on the REPREVE platform, while higher raw material costs were offset by a larger proportion of lower-priced products.\nIn Brazil, continued momentum in higher pricing and market share boosted revenues, with pricing up over 50%, leading to a significant increase in quarterly revenues for that segment.\nNylon showed stability with substantially higher sales and production volumes at the start of fiscal 2022.\nLet's move to Slide 6.\nThe Polyester segment showed considerable improvement in gross profit and margin, despite current labor inefficiency challenges and some pricing delays. The 260 basis point increase in gross margin is commendable given the current circumstances.\nThe Asia segment's volume growth resulted in a $2.4 million improvement in gross profit, as it continues its strong year-over-year growth trajectory and remains a key component of the global commercial model.\nIn Brazil, our competitive agility and commitment to delivering high value allowed us to maintain strong pricing levels and market share, doubling gross profit and improving margins by 910 basis points.\nFor a broader perspective on segment performance, slides 7 and 8 provide a two-year GAAP comparison.\nSlide 7 shows an 8.9% increase in consolidated sales compared to the same quarter two years ago, driven by a healthy mix of volume, pricing, and product mix across our segments.\nSlide 8 presents a gross profit overview for the two-year comparison. The Polyester segment showed strength despite the previously mentioned challenges. The Asia segment saw a 430 basis point increase in gross margin due to recent mix and efficiency gains, while Brazil's exceptional performance is highlighted by a doubling of gross profit.\nWe're pleased with the progress made across our portfolio in recent quarters.\nMoving to Slide 9, which provides an update on our balance sheet and capital allocation priorities.\nWe continue to have zero borrowings on our ABL revolver, with $74 million available as of September 26, 2021.\nWe plan to maintain our balanced approach to capital allocation, investing in innovation and organic growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and remaining open to share repurchases and M&A opportunities.\nI'm excited to announce that Unifi will host an Investor Day event in February 2022 at our North Carolina manufacturing facilities. We believe it's important for investors to see our world-class facilities firsthand. More details will be provided soon.\nHowever, we'll need to remain adaptable as we navigate various market dynamics. These include inflationary pressures, particularly in recycled input costs, energy shortages in Asia causing temporary slowdowns for some customers and suppliers, ongoing pandemic-related uncertainty, and persistent labor constraints in the U.S. Our team has done an excellent job managing these challenges, and I believe they will continue to do so.\nWe'll closely monitor these issues as we progress through each quarter.\nLooking ahead, we're encouraged by recent trends in our REPREVE and other value-added products. We remain optimistic about these developments, driven by our innovation and commercial teams, and expect long-term growth.\nOur strong first-quarter performance reflects our regional focus, global commercial model, innovation pipeline, and their potential even when faced with broader market challenges.\nFor the second quarter ending December 2021, we project net sales between $185 million and $190 million. Considering seasonally higher SG&A levels, some normalization of Brazil segment profitability, and recent oil price increases, we expect adjusted EBITDA between $14 million and $15 million.\nFor the full fiscal year 2022, we anticipate sales to exceed $750 million, representing a 12% or greater increase from fiscal 2021. We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow to between $65 million and $67 million. Our effective tax rate guidance remains between 35% and 40%, with capital expenditures ranging from $40 million to $44 million.\nWe will continue to focus on partnerships with global brands and retail leaders seeking to position themselves with sustainable products. As mentioned previously, we believe the importance and demand for sustainability will only increase, as evidenced by consumer behavior.\nWe remain committed to innovation and repositioning the business to drive long-term organic growth.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I trust everyone is doing well and staying safe.\nBryan Hanson, our Chairman, President and CEO, and Suky Upadhyay, our EVP and CFO, are joining me remotely today.\nWe're all aware that COVID is still a significant concern, given recent news, and we're monitoring the situation closely.\nNevertheless, we've observed notable improvements since our previous discussion, which I believe is evident to all.\nWhile the world hasn't returned to normal yet, travel is making a comeback.\nMore of our staff are back in the office, and I'm personally excited to attend the AAOS meeting in San Diego in about a month.\nI'm really looking forward to that event.\nWe have numerous impressive technologies to showcase there, and I'm thrilled it will finally be an in-person gathering again.\nOur team members, you, are the catalyst for the progress we've witnessed in our facilities and communities.\nI hope our investor community is continuing to stay safe and has had the chance to travel and reconnect with loved ones in recent months.\nThis is a chance for us to take advantage of some travel as we move towards a more normal environment, although we're not there yet and recognize this isn't happening uniformly across all regions.\nOverall, we're optimistic and doing our part to maintain this forward momentum.\nWe support our customers and their patients daily.\nWe're doing this cautiously, but it's a major priority for us as a mission-driven organization to be there for our customers so they can perform necessary procedures and ensure patients receive the care they deserve.\nThat leads us nicely into our Q2 call.\nMost importantly, we'll discuss our 2021 guidance going forward.\nI'll return later to wrap up the call with updates on our active portfolio management and product pipeline highlights.\nI'll wait to do that after he provides the guidance information.\nTo briefly set the stage, our overall performance in the quarter showed significant improvement from Q1 this year, across nearly all regions and product categories.\nAs recovery from the global pandemic continued, we saw a corresponding recovery in our procedures.\nWhile we anticipate some ongoing COVID-related challenges, we believe hospitals can manage them, and we expect the recovery to continue building sequentially throughout the second half of 2021.\nThe trend is positive.\nMy revenue and P&L commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted basis.\nI'll also provide constant currency revenue growth compared to 2019, which we believe is a more relevant comparison for this quarter.\nSecond quarter net sales were $2.027 billion, a reported increase of 65.3% and a 60.7% increase on a constant currency basis compared to the same period in 2020.\nCompared to Q2 2019, net sales were flat on a constant currency basis, with no significant impact from selling days.\nOverall, consolidated and regional results slightly exceeded the expectations we provided in our last quarterly call, with growth versus 2019 in the Americas and Asia Pacific and sequential improvement in EMEA.\nFor the quarter, the Americas grew 68.3% or 1.9% versus 2019.\nWe continue to see variability by country within the region, with the U.S. growing 66.2% or 3.3% compared to 2019.\nEMEA grew 80.5% but was down 7.3% versus 2019, with continued COVID pressure being a factor.\nWe saw improvement in EMEA as the quarter progressed and expect this trend to continue through the second half of the year.\nLastly, Asia Pacific grew 24.4% or 2.8% versus 2019 despite some unexpected challenges.\nWhile the region has been largely stable recently, it was impacted late in Q2 by channel inventory contraction in our knee and hip categories within China, in advance of the volume-based procurement (VBP) rollout.\nAdditionally, we saw a resurgence of COVID-19 in several markets, including Japan.\nDespite these challenges, the region continued to show growth.\nRegarding our business categories, the global knee business increased 72.2% but was down 6.3% versus 2019.\nIn the U.S., knees increased 77% and were flat compared to 2019.\nWhile we're seeing sequential improvement in large joint procedural volume recovery, the return to normalized market growth is taking longer than most anticipated.\nNevertheless, we remain encouraged by the team's execution and ongoing strong momentum for Persona and ROSA Knee.\nOur global hip business increased 39.9% but was down 2.8% versus 2019.\nIn the U.S., hip grew 46.6% or 3.1% compared to 2019.\nWe continue to see strong demand and positive feedback for the Avenir Complete hip, with ongoing adoption by both gold and platinum accounts.\nThe sports, extremities, and trauma category increased 53% or 10.8% versus 2019, driven by solid growth in sports medicine, CMFT, and upper extremities.\nWe continue to see strong surgeon registrations for the Signature ONE surgical planning system for shoulder procedures.\nOur dental and spine category grew 69.4% or 0.8% versus 2019, fueled by recovery in dental.\nNew products and improved commercial execution drove growth in the quarter, with strong contributions from implants and digital solutions in our dental business.\nLastly, our remaining division expanded by 105.9%, or 7.5% compared to 2019.\nThis indicates the persistent need for ROSA Robotics and substantial equipment purchases during the quarter.\nWe observed enhancements in both units sold and software revenue compared to Q2 2020, partly due to the introduction of our Partial Knee application.\nLet's discuss the profit and loss statement.\nWe reported a GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.67 for the quarter.\nOur GAAP diluted earnings per share showed a significant increase compared to a GAAP diluted loss per share of $1 in the second quarter of 2020.\nThe year-over-year rise in GAAP earnings was primarily due to higher revenue, counterbalanced by regular spending levels and in-process research and development investments during the quarter.\nFurthermore, the second quarter of 2020 included some one-time GAAP charges that didn't recur.\nThe adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.90 was considerably higher than the previous year, driven by the expected recovery of elective procedures following the pandemic-related decline in the second quarter of 2020.\nThe adjusted gross margin was 71.7%, aligning with expectations.\nOur adjusted operating expenses of $923 million increased sequentially from the first quarter due to higher variable selling costs related to increased sales and greater discretionary spending to support investments in commercial infrastructure and research and development innovation.\nImproved revenue performance and stable gross margins more than compensated for higher spending, resulting in a 26.2% operating margin, a slight improvement over the first quarter of this year.\nThe adjusted tax rate of 16.5% for the quarter was in line with our projections.\nRegarding cash and liquidity.\nOperating cash flows for the quarter were $453.9 million, with robust free cash flow of $358.7 million, and we concluded the second quarter with just over $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents.\nWe continue to make progress in reducing our debt and plan to make an additional $300 million in debt repayments in the third quarter.\nRegarding our financial guidance.\nWe are narrowing our guidance range to better reflect our year-to-date performance and a more informed view of the potential COVID impact.\nOur 2021 financial guidance is based on several key assumptions.\nWe assume no worsening of elective procedure trends due to COVID and anticipate continued procedure volume recovery in the second half of the year.\nHowever, recovery may not be uniform across regions or product categories.\nWe also expect to observe the usual seasonality impact in the third and fourth quarters, as seen in previous years.\nWith the narrowed guidance range, we now project reported revenue growth to be between 14.5% and 16.5% compared to 2020, with foreign currency impact remaining unchanged at approximately 150 basis points of tailwind for the full year.\nOn a constant currency basis, compared to 2019, we expect Q3 to grow sequentially over Q2, with continued improvement in the fourth quarter.\nRegarding the profit and loss statement.\nOur adjusted diluted earnings per share is now projected to be between $7.65 and $7.95, and we have narrowed our adjusted operating margin projection to 26.5% to 27% for the full year.\nOur updated earnings per share guidance reflects our performance to date, our expectation of improved growth in the second half, and the assumption that discretionary operating expenses will remain consistent with Q2 through the rest of the year.\nWhile operating margins are expected to decline sequentially in the third quarter, in line with lower sales revenue and steady investment levels compared to the second quarter, we anticipate overall second half operating margins to be stronger than first half operating margins.\nOur adjusted tax rate projection remains unchanged at 16% to 16.5% for the full year.\nLastly, our free cash flow estimates remain in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion.\nWe will continue to provide updates on market dynamics and financial expectations as we progress through the remainder of the year.\nTo recap, our Q2 performance slightly exceeded the expectations we had communicated to you throughout the second quarter.\nWhile we anticipate some ongoing COVID-related pressure, we have increased confidence in the recovery's momentum and our ability to execute in this environment.\nI will now briefly address three topics before we move to the Q&A session.\nFirst, I want to discuss execution and highlight some of our product and pipeline achievements.\nSecond, I'll talk about our progress in active portfolio management, which is a significant effort for us.\nThird, I'll discuss innovation and how we believe we can drive attractive long-term growth that will ultimately deliver value to our shareholders.\nLet's begin with our team's execution.\nI've said this before and I'll continue to say it: in areas that ZB could directly control over the past 18 months, the team has executed and delivered, and I'm very proud of their performance during a time of significant turbulence.\nIn Q2 and recent weeks, we've reached key milestones with our ZB products and solutions.\nROSA for Partial Knee was approved in April, as previously mentioned.\nThe first patient surgery was performed early in the quarter, and we've seen good traction and positive feedback for this technology so far.\nThis is important for us because ZB has a significant market share in partial knees, so we're excited about the possibilities, not just for revenue but also for potential patient impact in the surgical area.\nLooking at ROSA overall, we saw another strong quarter of market demand and traction for ROSA total knee in Q2, with placement momentum continuing broadly across the world, not just in the U.S. but internationally as well.\nWe aim to see strength in the U.S. and overseas, and we observed that mix again in Q2.\nWe also saw much stronger capital expenditures from our customers in Q2, resulting in a shift back to upfront sales of ROSA.\nMore of these events occurred in Q2 than we typically observe.\nThis reflects the robustness of capital budgets and people's inclination to acquire in this manner.\nIt's evident that hospitals are strongly focused on incorporating robotic systems into their operating rooms, whether through direct purchase or alternative arrangements.\nThe momentum and demand for this technology is undeniably strong.\nROSA remains a fundamental component of our ZBEdge suite of integrated solutions.\nThere's considerable excitement about the future expansion of indications and overall robotics adoption for ZB.\nRevision continued to show strong momentum during the quarter.\nThis product serves as an excellent entry point for us, allowing competitive conversions in revision surgeries and providing access to the surgeon's typical total knee procedures as well.\nThis is exciting not only for revision surgeries but also for opening doors to broader opportunities for converting their standard knee procedures.\nWe're thrilled to add another crucial variable to our ZBEdge portfolio of connected technologies: Persona iQ, set to be the first and only smart implant available.\nWe're still awaiting FDA approval for this product.\nWe're working closely with the FDA, providing any necessary information to move the process forward, and we're hopeful for approval in the near future.\nHowever, the ultimate timeline is at the discretion of the FDA.\nThis product is significant as it combines the trusted Persona implant design with Canary Medical's tibial extension, which incorporates sensor technology.\nThis combination will allow us to measure the patient's range of motion, step count, walking speed, and other mobility metrics from inside the body, which we believe will indicate post-surgery progress.\nThis advancement will help us complete the loop in our ZBEdge connected technologies.\nWe'll provide updates when we hear back from the FDA.\nUpon approval, we plan to launch the technology on a limited basis for one or two quarters before moving to a full launch.\nLet's discuss our active portfolio management efforts.\nWe have implemented the ZB portfolio management strategy and process, and have developed our capabilities in this area over the past 18 to 24 months.\nWe're excited about this phase of our organization.\nOur focus is on mission-centric M&A that increases our weighted average market growth.\nWe've already demonstrated this strategy through selective tuck-in acquisitions late last year.\nThese smaller deals were designed to fill portfolio gaps and improve our position in high-growth, high-priority markets like sports medicine, ASC, and sternal closure, where we believe we can succeed in attractive and profitable markets.\nThe planned spin-off of our spine and dental businesses is progressing on schedule.\nWe're encouraged by the energy and momentum surrounding NewCo as CEO Vafa Jamali builds his team and refines the corporate strategy.\nWe believe this will create two independent, stronger companies that will maximize value for both our customers and shareholders.\nLet's now discuss innovation and how we view our ability to drive attractive long-term growth and deliver value to all stakeholders, including our shareholders.\nWe're focused on transforming ZB from a provider of metal and plastic implants into a leading medical technology innovator.\nWe have numerous initiatives across various programs to achieve this, including several upcoming robotics launches, current and future smart implants, new functionality with mymobility, and the broader ZBEdge ecosystem of connected technologies.\nThese advancements will help us improve our product mix, increase our share of wallet, and drive competitive conversions.\nOver 70% of our new product development investment is directed towards ZBEdge and its connected technologies.\nOur exclusive partnership with Apple continues to be productive and collaborative.\nWe've also formed several other technology alliances that will drive future innovation benefiting patients.\nWe believe a fundamental shift is coming for ZB and our core markets, with technological advancements potentially changing the care paradigm for patients in the future.\nThe momentum in innovation is real, and we believe it will enable us to drive attractive long-term growth.\nMost importantly, it gives ZB the opportunity to positively impact patients' lives worldwide.\nI remain highly confident in the ZB team and our business momentum.\nDespite ongoing uncertainty due to the global pandemic, I believe we are well-positioned for success.\nOur strategy is working, and the transformation of our business is well underway.\nI'm excited about the value we can create for our shareholders going forward.\nYour commitment to safety is crucial, and your focus on fulfilling our mission is unparalleled.\nI remain incredibly proud of our collective achievements.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Scott Buckhout, CIRCOR's president and CEO, and Abhi Khandelwal, the company's chief financial officer, are accompanying me today\nOur statements may be affected by known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors, potentially leading to outcomes that differ significantly from what is expressed or implied in our remarks\nDetailed information about these factors can be found in CIRCOR's SEC filings, including Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which are available on our website\nCIRCOR performed well this quarter, delivering strong results despite challenges in the global supply chain\nWe're experiencing robust demand for our critical products, with year-to-date orders and backlog increasing by 11% and 15%, respectively\nThe Industrial sector saw particularly strong organic order growth of 28% this quarter, with our Industrial backlog up 30% year-to-date, surpassing pre-pandemic levels\nAlthough aerospace and defense orders decreased this quarter due to timing issues, we are well-positioned in growing commercial and defense programs and continue to introduce new products for our customers\nOur quarterly revenue increased by 2% organically, with operating margin improving by 80 basis points year-over-year and 240 basis points sequentially\nEarnings per share grew by 39% compared to the previous year\nIt's worth noting that our revenue and earnings this quarter were negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions that worsened during the last month\nSpecifically, we experienced delays in about $10 million worth of revenue due to supplier input delays, logistical constraints, and ongoing labor shortages\nThis reduced our organic growth by approximately 5 percentage points for the quarter\nOur teams are working to address these supply chain issues by finding alternative suppliers, redesigning products with higher-grade materials, and expediting shipping to meet our commitments to customers\nWe anticipate these challenges to persist through the fourth quarter, potentially impacting revenue by $15 million\nFor the entire year, we expect about $25 million in revenue to be delayed beyond 2021\nThis projection is incorporated into our updated full-year guidance, which Abhi will discuss later\nOur strategic focus remains on our people, accelerating growth, expanding margins, and improving free cash flow\nI'll highlight some of our key achievements from Q3 later in this call\nLet's begin by reviewing the financial highlights on Slide 3\nOrganic orders for the quarter totaled $194 million, representing a 15% increase compared to the previous year\nWe observed a significant year-over-year increase of 28% in the industrial sector, with growth across all regions\nOrders in the aerospace and defense sector decreased by 10% due to the timing of large defense orders\nOrganic revenue reached $191 million, a 1% increase from the previous year\nRevenue fell short of expectations by approximately $10 million due to the supply chain challenges Scott mentioned earlier\nAdjusted operating income was $19 million, or 10.1%, showing an improvement of 80 basis points from the previous year and 240 basis points from the last quarter\nWe achieved $0.50 in adjusted earnings per share, a 39% increase from the previous year, and generated $7 million in free cash flow\nMoving to Slide 4\nIndustrial organic orders grew by 28% compared to last year but decreased by 9% sequentially\nOrder growth was evident across all regions, with particular strength in North America and EMEA\nAftermarket orders increased by 42%, and our downstream aftermarket backlog is at its highest level since 2017\nOur book-to-bill ratio for both the quarter and year-to-date is 1.1%, indicating sustained end market demand\nIndustrial organic revenue rose by 3% compared to last year and 1% sequentially\nRegionally, we saw year-over-year improvements in EMEA, China, and India, partially offset by lower revenue in North America\nDespite a strong backlog from the first half, supply chain and logistical constraints became more challenging than anticipated late in the quarter\nThis negatively impacted revenue by $6 million, or 5 percentage points of organic growth\nAdjusted operating margin reached 8.7%, improving by 80 basis points compared to last year and 70 basis points compared to Q2\nThese improvements were driven by increased productivity and continued value-based pricing, which increased by 2%, partially offset by higher inflation\nWe anticipate further margin expansion in Q4\nLet's move on to Slide 5\nOrders for aerospace and defense were $54 million, showing a 10% decrease compared to the previous year and remaining unchanged sequentially.\nThe decrease in orders compared to the prior year was due to a large one-time defense order for the Dreadnought submarine in 2020 that was not repeated.\nThe recovery in commercial aerospace continues, primarily driven by narrow-body aircraft programs.\nWe have observed consecutive growth over the past three quarters.\nRevenue totaled $61 million, representing a 2% decrease year-over-year and a 2% increase from the previous quarter.\nThe slight decline in revenue was mainly attributed to reduced defense OEM shipments, partly offset by a 10% increase in commercial aerospace recovery and a 7% improvement in defense aftermarket revenue.\nLike the Industrial sector, aerospace and defense were also affected by global supply chain and logistical constraints, negatively impacting the quarter by $4 million or six percentage points of growth.\nThe operating margin for the quarter was 24.2%, showing an increase of 50 basis points year-over-year and a 430 basis point improvement from Q2.\nDespite challenging global conditions, we managed to expand our margin through pricing strategies, increased productivity, and a favorable mix of defense programs.\nWe anticipate the margin in Q4 to be approximately the same as the previous year.\nMoving to Slide 6.\nFree cash flow for the quarter was $7 million, showing improvement compared to the previous year but falling short of expectations.\nSpecifically, we had anticipated higher milestone collections on long-term projects, which were postponed to future quarters.\nWe will receive this cash in upcoming quarters as we finish these projects.\nWe decreased our total debt by $23 million compared to the previous year, ending Q3 with $445 million of net debt.\nDue to lower earnings and cash projections for the year, we now expect to improve our leverage by about 0.3 turns by year-end.\nWe will continue to allocate all generated free cash flow towards reducing debt.\nBeginning with fourth quarter guidance.\nWe project revenue to increase organically by 1% to 3%, which includes $15 million of delayed revenue due to ongoing global supply chain, logistics, and labor challenges.\nFor the Industrial sector, we anticipate Q4 orders to increase by more than 10%, with revenue expected to grow by 3% to 6% across most end markets.\nIn Aerospace and Defense, fourth quarter orders are projected to rise by over 50%, driven by large OEM defense programs.\nRevenue, however, is expected to be flat to down 5%, with double-digit growth in commercial aerospace and defense aftermarket, offset by lower deliveries on defense programs.\nWe anticipate adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 to $0.65 in the fourth quarter, with incremental and decremental margins of 30% to 35%.\nCorporate costs are expected to increase by $1 million compared to the previous year.\nWe project free cash flow of $10 million to $15 million in Q4, as we expect supply chain constraints to continue affecting our ability to complete ongoing projects and collect milestone billings from customers.\nDue to supply chain challenges in late Q3 and into Q4, we are revising our full-year guidance.\nOrganic revenue is projected to be flat to down 2%, reflecting $25 million of revenue delayed beyond the year.\nAdjusted earnings per share of $1.69 to $1.74 is lower due to this reduction in volume, and free cash flow is expected to be $4 million to $9 million.\nNow I'll turn it over to Scott to discuss our market outlook.\nLet's begin with our Industrial outlook on Slide 8.\nAs Abhi mentioned, we observed continued order strength across all Industrial regions in the third quarter, with year-to-date backlog surpassing pre-COVID levels.\nIn Q4, we anticipate another quarter of double-digit order growth, led by North America.\nWe expect growth in nearly all end markets, with commercial marine and downstream showing the most significant year-over-year improvement.\nRegarding revenue, we project modest year-over-year improvement with growth between 3% and 6%.\nOur short-cycle products are expected to increase by 6% to 9% overall, primarily driven by aftermarket growth between 8% and 11%.\nOur longer-cycle end markets are anticipated to be roughly in line with last year.\nMany of our midstream and downstream customers are prioritizing aftermarket projects in the near term, while our OEM project pipeline and backlog remain strong.\nIn commercial marine, we expect to see growth as shipbuilding activity in Asia continues to recover from historically low levels.\nFinally, pricing is expected to contribute approximately 2% as pricing actions implemented in Q2 and Q3 begin to impact our top and bottom line.\nTransitioning to the aerospace and defense sector.\nThird quarter orders remained stable compared to the previous quarter but decreased year-over-year, primarily due to a significant non-recurring order in the third quarter of 2020.\nWe anticipate a substantial rise in orders for the fourth quarter.\nThe growth compared to the previous quarter and year is attributed to major defense contracts, ongoing recovery in commercial aerospace, and robust medical sector expansion.\nAerospace and defense revenue in the fourth quarter is projected to remain unchanged or decrease by up to 5% compared to the previous year, mainly due to supply chain issues and the timing of deliveries for major defense programs.\nDefense revenue is expected to decline by 10% to 15% with reduced shipments for our OEM programs.\nConversely, government orders for defense spare parts and maintenance, repair, and overhaul services increased in the third quarter, and we predict aftermarket revenue growth of 10% to 15%.\nCommercial aerospace is forecasted to continue its recovery with 25% to 30% growth following three consecutive quarters of sequential order increases.\nRevenue from commercial aircraft manufacturers is projected to increase by 20% to 25%, primarily driven by the accelerated recovery in narrow-body aircraft production, particularly the A320.\nAftermarket revenue growth is expected to improve as aircraft usage continues to rise.\nLastly, pricing is anticipated to provide a net benefit of 3% for defense and 4% for commercial sectors.\nI would like to provide an update on our previously communicated strategic priorities for the third quarter.\nThese priorities continue to guide our team's daily efforts.\nWe are investing in growth.\nWe introduced eight new products in Q3 and are on track to launch 45 new products by the end of 2021.\nI will showcase two exciting new products on the next slide.\nOur teams are continuing to implement price increases in both Industrial and Aerospace and Defense sectors to counteract rising inflation.\nMany of these price increases are permanent and will contribute to future top and bottom-line growth.\nIn the Industrial sector, we raised prices or implemented surcharges on numerous product lines in Q2 and Q3.\nThis resulted in the additional pricing we're observing in Q3 and Q4.\nFor Aerospace and Defense, we typically align the duration of our customer contracts with our supplier contracts, which has helped us mitigate material cost inflation.\nFurthermore, we continue to employ value-based pricing where appropriate, particularly in the aftermarket.\nTo enhance margin expansion, we're making significant investments at two of our largest industrial facilities in the U.S. and Germany.\nWith the implementation of new modern equipment and processes, we expect improvements in safety, quality, and productivity.\nWe're making substantial progress with our 80/20 initiative.\nUsing this structured approach, we've developed a significant pipeline of growth and simplification opportunities and have already utilized 80/20 to implement strategic price increases at our U.S. facility.\nMore importantly, conversations with our teams reveal that 80/20 is becoming ingrained in our culture and business practices.\nBefore we proceed to Q&A, I want to highlight two recently launched products.\nThese products are particularly exciting as they demonstrate how CIRCOR is accelerating growth by leveraging our technical expertise to enter new, growing markets where we currently have no presence.\nFor several years, our team has been seeking opportunities to enter the green energy sector by utilizing our sealing technology and expertise in designing and manufacturing products for high-pressure gas storage and transport applications.\nThe first set of products is designed for applications in the hydrogen market.\nHydrogen Isolation Valves and Modular Dome Regulators are essential components of the control system on hydrogen gas transportation trailers.\nOur balanced isolation valve exhibits very low leak rates at extreme temperatures and pressures, while the Modular Dome Regulator, developed and manufactured in India, enables stable pressure control.\nWe are the first supplier to meet the latest EU transportation regulation for the balanced valve and have secured over $1 million in initial orders thus far in 2021.\nThe second new product I want to discuss is a switch module with kinetic sensors for landing gear position detectors on commercial aircraft.\nOur switch module, located inside the aircraft wheel, is engineered to detect the landing gear position and activate the electric motor, allowing the aircraft to taxi independently without engine power or towing.\nThis technology not only enables more efficient and safer ground transportation but also contributes to reducing carbon emissions by consuming less fuel.\nBoth of these new products exemplify how we're accelerating growth through new product development and expanding our portfolio into new markets.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:During today's management discussion, we will address non-standard financial measurements.\nAt hospitals where we offered NICU care, total births increased by 2.8% for comparable units, while our NICU days rose by 5.6%.\nImportant indicators like insurance mix and admission rates remain positive when compared to the previous year.\nNotably, MEDNAX's overall patient numbers, income, and adjusted EBITDA surpassed those of the same timeframe in 2019, indicating our business has now recovered beyond the significant negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic experienced in 2020 and early this year.\nMark will provide specifics on our comparisons to pre-pandemic levels.\nOur quarterly revenue of $493 million and adjusted EBITDA of $73 million exceeded our internal projections.\nGiven our performance, we now anticipate our 2021 adjusted EBITDA will surpass our previous internal estimate of over $240 million, and we now project 2021 adjusted EBITDA to reach at least $250 million.\nWe also confidently expect next year's adjusted EBITDA to exceed $270 million, barring any major external events.\nThis is a preliminary outlook for 2022, and we'll be better equipped to provide more precise guidance after completing our budgeting process, but I believe our business is gaining momentum.\nThe need for essential services provided by our affiliated clinicians has not only rebounded from last year's disruptions but continues to expand.\nWe also believe that our broader growth initiatives have contributed to this demand so far in 2021.\nI'll provide some details here as we see our growth focused in several areas.\nFirstly, we seek opportunities to expand or add practices, strengthen our hospital relationships, and directly improve care by coordinating various subspecialties that many patients need to access.\nSecondly, in our daily operations, we aim to provide the best round-the-clock support possible to our practices, combining patient service access initiatives, enhanced technology support, improved revenue cycle management efficiency, recruitment of top talent, and traditional focused managerial actions.\nThirdly, we look for acquisition opportunities that clearly strengthen hospital relationships, enhance our patient care and support, and demonstrate a clear growth trajectory within that acquisition.\nWhile acquisitions haven't been a major focus of our activities so far this year, they could play an equally important role as organic growth when we identify strategic opportunities.\nThe combined effect of these efforts is continuing to increase post-COVID.\nImportantly, this follows all of our reorganization activities pre-COVID.\nFor the year-to-date in 2021, we estimate that we have added approximately three percentage points to our adjusted EBITDA growth compared to 2020, beyond the pure same-store growth experienced by our affiliated practices.\nIn addition to these activities, we recently announced our investment in Brave Care, and I want to explain why this is a crucial component of our growth strategy.\nWe continue to believe that we are uniquely positioned to expand in the combined pediatric and primary emergent care sector.\nMEDNAX, operating under our pediatrics brand, has a significant presence in key markets with a high concentration of pediatricians, strong hospital relationships, and a large, expanding patient base, supported by established market management.\nOur acquisition of NightLight is flourishing, providing a foundation for future expansion.\nTo achieve substantial growth, we required the necessary resources and expertise.\nBrave Care offers advanced internal systems and patient-oriented technology, protocols, and processes that would have taken us years to develop independently.\nThe custom technology platform and operational systems developed by Brave's team over more than two years provide patients and their families with a smooth experience during visits.\nIt also offers excellent remote access for medical professionals through a user-friendly mobile app, giving parents constant access to resources.\nBrave Care's systems are fully integrated with all aspects of clinical operations.\nMy understanding of the Brave system's effectiveness is based on practical experience, not just theory.\nIt has been successfully implemented and is currently operational in their existing Northwest clinics.\nOur investment in Brave includes an operating partnership agreement that offers long-term incentives to assist us in planning, developing, equipping, and launching pediatric clinics in the coming years.\nWe will own and manage the clinics, with our team working in collaboration with Brave's team.\nBased on our current service areas, we anticipate the potential to establish over 100 pediatric clinics across our network within a few years.\nWe will keep you informed about how this plan unfolds as we move forward.\nWe expect our growth to involve both new developments and acquisitions, and we are already in talks with certain existing platforms that we believe align well with our strategic expansion plans.\nTo conclude, considering all these factors - our strong core of excellent patient relationships served by industry-leading clinicians, our robust financial position, our growth initiatives, efficiency, and a strategic expansion into primary and urgent care - I am confident in our diverse growth potential for 2022 and beyond.\nMark will now provide more details about our third quarter activities.\nI'll start by offering detailed volume comparisons to 2019 to expand on Mark's earlier remarks.\nI'll then review the status of various projects we've discussed this year, explain how they impact the income statement, and conclude with our current financial position and our approach to capital structure moving forward.\nCompared to the same period in 2019, our hospital volumes increased by 4.4% and office-based volumes rose by 2.8% on a same-unit basis for the quarter.\nIn hospital-based services, NICU days increased by 1.4%, pediatric intensive care grew by 42%, and pediatric hospitalist volumes rose by 14%.\nFor office-based services, maternal fetal medicine volume increased by 8.6%, while pediatric cardiology decreased by 9%, likely due to appointment deferrals during the Delta variant surge.\nOur G&A expenditure in the third quarter decreased by approximately $4 million compared to the previous quarter.\nThis reduction mainly stems from lower operational and legal costs, as well as savings from our R1 agreement, which are expected to increase further in the fourth quarter.\nRegarding the transfer of our revenue cycle activities to R1, our metrics so far indicate no disruption in service to our practices.\nThe third quarter's DSOs and cash collection performance aligned with our expectations and the previous quarter's results.\nI want to emphasize that under our agreement terms, we've realized immediate G&A savings reflected in our current P&L.\nWe also anticipate benefiting from future improvements in RCM performance, yield, and revenue enhancements over time.\nIn Q3, we finished providing support services related to the PSA arrangement linked to the sale of our anesthesia organization last year.\nOur third quarter G&A still shows a comparable cost run rate to what we were previously incurring, and we'll refine our views on an appropriate G&A level as we complete our 2022 budget.\nYou'll notice that our reimbursement for those costs in Q3, recorded in our investment in other income line, significantly decreased.\nIt amounted to $0.5 million this quarter compared to about $9 million in the same period last year.\nNevertheless, the robustness of our core operations more than made up for this decrease, enabling both year-over-year and sequential growth in adjusted EBITDA.\nOur transformational and restructuring expense in the third quarter was $4.2 million, mainly reflecting the cost of terminating other third-party agreements as part of the R1 transition.\nOverall, within our updated internal projection of 2021 adjusted EBITDA, we expect our fourth quarter G&A expense to remain stable or decrease compared to the third quarter, largely due to anticipated RCM cost savings.\nThis supports our previous view that the second half G&A will be lower than the $137 million we spent in the first half of the year.\nRegarding our capital structure, we continued to improve our leverage position in the third quarter.\nWe generated $67 million in operating cash flow, which surpassed our investments in capex, acquisitions, and our Brave Care transaction.\nBased on our September 30th debt of $642 million and our 2021 adjusted EBITDA expectation, our net leverage stands at approximately 2.5 times.\nWe anticipate this to decrease by year-end based on fourth quarter cash flows.\nDuring the quarter, we also reduced our revolving credit facility capacity from $1.2 billion to $600 million, all of which is currently available to us without any remaining covenant restrictions.\nAs many of you know, we have $1 billion in outstanding 6.25% coupon senior notes due in 2027, making our debt structure relatively inefficient given our cash position and current net leverage.\nSince our notes are callable in January 2022, we will be evaluating the most suitable debt structure for our size, profitability, and growth in capital plans.\nAlthough we haven't made any decisions yet, I expect we'll be able to achieve significant savings in interest expense once we determine the most appropriate capital stack for our business as it exists today and in the foreseeable future.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These statements are prone to various known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and additional factors, including those detailed in MFA's annual 10-K report for the year ending December 31, 2019, and other filings it may submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time.\nI'd like to acknowledge our entire MFA team once again before we start.\n2020 was undoubtedly a challenging year in many respects, but our team persevered through the difficulties and didn't give up.\nThis group never quits.\nI believe we made remarkable progress in the latter half of 2020, particularly in the fourth quarter.\nThe fourth quarter of 2020, from a macro perspective, was largely a continuation of the third quarter.\nInterest rate volatility remained low, and the Fed's accommodative monetary policy continued to bolster risk assets, with little sign of significant change in 2021.\nThe short-term end of the yield curve remains firmly anchored, in line with the \"lower for longer\" narrative.\nTwo-year rates briefly touched the high teens in mid-November but have barely reached double digits so far in 2021.\nThe yield curve continues to gradually steepen, with the 10-year rate increasing by 23 basis points in the fourth quarter and nearly 45 more since the year's end.\nWith the spread between 2-year and 10-year rates at about 125 basis points, this isn't considered a steep yield curve by historical standards, but it has steepened by roughly 45 basis points since the end of the year.\nThis isn't surprising given recent political developments, as expectations of additional stimulus continue to raise inflation concerns.\nI can't help but smile when I hear recent discussions about higher rates, considering that 10-year rates were above 3% less than two and a half years ago, compared to the current 135 basis points.\nWhile we're off the lows, at least for 10-year rates, let's be realistic: we're still in an extraordinarily low interest rate environment.\nAgency origination dominated non-conforming production for much of 2020, but even a slight increase in agency-eligible mortgage rates has led to increased production of non-QM and business purpose loans in recent months, with rates at particularly low levels and credit spreads very tight, there are no cheap assets available.\nHowever, these market conditions have pushed yields on issued securities to record lows.\nSo while it's a challenging period for assets, it's an extremely favorable one for liabilities.\nMFA has capitalized on this opportunity to secure low-cost, long-term, non-recourse debt, which will significantly reduce future interest expenses.\nAdditionally, a robust housing market, combined with our ability to actively manage residential mortgage credit assets, has been reflected in our financial results, as we've achieved better-than-expected outcomes on credit-sensitive assets, resulting in reversals of previous credit reserves and sales of REO properties at attractive prices.\nPlease refer to Page 4.\nWe reported GAAP earnings of $0.08 per share in the fourth quarter.\nThese results were driven by continued price appreciation of loans held at fair value and further improvement in credit, leading to credit loss reserve reversals.\nHowever, fourth-quarter earnings were reduced by expenses related to the accelerated discount in connection with our payoff of the $500 million, 11% Apollo/Athene senior note in September and October.\nWe also resolved the outstanding warrant position of Apollo/Athene during the fourth quarter through direct warrant repurchases and a warrant exercise via a combination of cash and cashless exercise.\nThere are no more outstanding warrants, and the overall dilution associated with these transactions was less than 4%.\nOur GAAP book value would have increased by approximately 2.4% for the quarter if not for these warrants.\nEconomic book value, also negatively impacted by 3.9% due to the warrants, remained unchanged at $4.92 during the fourth quarter as our loans held at carrying value appreciated further.\nWe repurchased 14.1 million common shares for a total purchase price of slightly over $50 million during the quarter at an average price of less than 80% of September 30 GAAP book value and less than 75% of economic book value.\nWe considered these purchases to be among the best available investments in the fourth quarter.\nOur leverage decreased slightly over the quarter to 1.7:1, primarily due to the payoff of the Apollo/Athene debt.\nWe paid a $0.075 dividend to shareholders on January 29.\nPlease turn to Page 5.\nOur net interest income for the fourth quarter nearly doubled compared to the third quarter, despite slightly lower overall interest income, as our interest expense reductions began to significantly impact results.\nInterest expense reductions are due to some repo borrowing cost spread reductions, securitizations that replaced repo and non-mark-to-market financing with substantially cheaper funding, and the payoff of the Apollo/Athene note.\nThe impact of these efforts was not fully reflected in the fourth quarter, as they were implemented at various points within the quarter.\nWe also took advantage of a strong housing market to strategically liquidate REO properties, which we primarily acquired through the resolution of nonperforming loans purchased years ago.\nThese sales totaled over $270 million for the year and were executed at prices well above our carrying value.\nWe believe that our efforts since emerging from forbearance at the end of June have benefited stockholders, as our total shareholder return was 62% from June 30 to December 31.\nWe clearly still have work to do, but we are committed to continuing to rebuild shareholder value.\nWe illustrate our investment portfolio and summarize our asset-based financing on this slide.\nThe investment portfolio has not changed significantly since September 30.\nWe added $111 million of loans in the fourth quarter.\nTo review this pie chart, the loans held at carrying value on our balance sheet are represented in three slices of the pie chart.\nThe purple section, PCD, or purchased credit deteriorated loans, is accounting terminology for reperforming loans and other seasoned performing loans.\nThe gray section, business purpose loans, represents fix-and-flip and single-family rental loans.\nThe red section represents non-QM loans.\nOn the financing side, 67% of our asset-based financing is non-mark-to-market.\nWith the SFR securitization that we closed at the beginning of February, this figure is now over 70%.\nPlease turn to Page 7.\nContinuing the theme of aggressively capitalizing on available market opportunities, we've executed three additional securitizations on $1.2 billion of UPB at successively tighter levels.\nAs shown on this page, AAA yields on bonds sold in the most recent two deals were below 1%, and the blended cost of debt sold was in the low ones, in some cases almost 200 basis points lower than the cost of borrowing we replaced.\nIt's also worth noting that while some of the financing we replaced with these securitizations was non-mark-to-market, the securitized debt is similarly non-mark-to-market, nonrecourse, and term.\nSo we actually increased the amount of this more durable financing while substantially lowering the cost.\nBonds sold generated cash of between 91% and 94% of UPB, which also produced approximately $250 million of additional liquidity.\nPlease turn to Page 8.\nPage 8 provides details of the repurchase and exercise of the previously outstanding warrant position.\nThrough a straight repurchase of warrants on December 10 for $33.7 million and an exercise through a combination of cash and cashless exercise on December 28, we were able to limit the dilution of warrants granted, which was 7.5% at the time of grant, to less than 4%.\nApollo/Athene holds 12.3 million shares or about 2.7% of outstanding shares, and we continue to maintain a strong partnership with both Apollo and Athene.\nThat said, we believe that eliminating any uncertainty around an outstanding warrant position should positively impact our stock.\nPlease turn to Page 9.\nWe announced on our third-quarter earnings call that our board had authorized a $250 million stock repurchase program, and we executed this during the open-window period in the fourth quarter by purchasing 14.1 million shares at an average price of $3.61, which was accretive to GAAP and economic book value by $0.03 and $0.04, respectively.\nAdditionally, the $33.7 million warrant repurchase was included under this plan.\nIn total, we deployed almost $85 million during the quarter and still have $165 million available under this authorization.\nPlease turn to Page 10.\nWe declared the redemption of our $100 million 8% senior notes maturing in 2042.\nThese $25 face value bonds were issued a decade ago in 2012.\nThis redemption, finalized shortly after the year's end, will result in $8 million annual interest expense savings.\nWe recorded a non-cash charge of $3.1 million in Q4 for unamortized costs associated with the bond issuance.\nThese $25 face value bonds were primarily sold to individual investors, similar to 20 companies, hence the relatively high issuance expense.\nPlease refer to Page 11.\nIn terms of positive news and to show it's not just about financial figures, I'm pleased to share two significant honors for MFA.\nMFA was included in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the second consecutive year.\nWe were acknowledged as one of 380 public companies across 44 countries and regions for our dedication to and support of gender equality.\nFurthermore, MFA has been recognized as a Great Place to Work by the Great Place to Work Institute.\nThis recognition is based on confidential employee feedback gathered through an engagement survey conducted by this organization.\nThis important validation of our workplace culture is a testament to our employees.\nThe management doesn't make MFA a Great Place to Work, our people do.\nIf management has a role, it's merely to recruit excellent individuals, and our team collectively shapes our culture.\nIn today's remote work environment, this recognition is also a crucial differentiator for us in recruitment, as almost all hiring is now done virtually.\nWhile we've certainly appreciated the support of Apollo, Athene, and our other financing partners during the challenging times of forbearance and over the past six months, we're pleased to end 2020 with a significantly more robust mix of financing and having repaid most of our higher-cost debt.\nMoreover, the execution of the warrant transactions has eliminated, with a relatively modest solution, a potential source of uncertainty in our future results.\n2020 was undoubtedly a year of significant and unusual events, and while earnings have stabilized since June, there were some residual non-recurring items in Q4 that I will discuss further shortly.\nMSA entered 2021 with all significant items related to the forbearance period financing effectively behind us.\nOur ongoing efforts to pursue securitization and other forms of non-mark-to-market financing have reduced our borrowing costs and generated liquidity while maintaining relatively low leverage.\nThese efforts are already significantly benefiting net interest spreads, and we expect this trend to continue for at least the short to medium term.\nLet's now turn to the specifics of our Q4 results.\nNet income attributable to common shareholders was $37.6 million or $0.08 per share.\nNet income includes $25.3 million or $0.06 per common share of expenses recognized on the repayment of the senior secured term loan from Apollo/Athene.\nRemember that as we chose to account for this financing at fair value, GAAP required us to allocate a portion of the day 1 loan-to-value or approximately $14 million of the associated warrants.\nThis was recorded in shareholders' equity, while the remaining loan value of about $481 million is recorded on our balance sheet as a liability.\nDue to changes in interest rates and market spreads, the fair value of this liability decreased in Q3.\nHowever, as the loan was repaid at par, rather than at fair value, expenses are recorded on payoff related to the reversal of prior unrealized gains and the difference between par and the previously recorded carrying value.\nThe subsequent execution of the associated warrant transactions didn't directly impact earnings, but they did result in modest book value dilution, as Craig has already discussed.\nApart from the impact of the senior secured debt repayment and warrant transactions, our quarterly results primarily reflect the ongoing recovery in residential mortgage asset valuations, a net reduction in our CECL credit loss reserves, and the previously mentioned improvement in net interest income.\nSpecifically, the key factors affecting our results are as follows: net interest income for Q4 was $19.4 million, nearly double Q3, and reflects the following.\nFirstly, higher net interest spreads, primarily on our residential whole loan portfolio as the impact of financing initiatives begin to take effect.\nThe payoff of the senior secured debt increased net interest income by approximately $12 million.\nAs Craig mentioned, we redeemed our 8% senior notes in early January 2021.\nQ4 net interest expense includes a non-cash charge of $3.1 million for unamortized deferred expenses that we incurred when this debt was originally issued in 2012.\nAdditionally, future quarterly interest expense will be $2 million lower as a result of this note redemption.\nI'd also like to point out that since exiting forbearance in June, we've lowered our cost of funds across our entire portfolio by 140 basis points to 3.1% as of December 31, 2020, and this decreases even further to 2.9% with the senior note redemption.\nFurthermore, we reduced our overall CECL allowance in our current value loans to $86.8 million, mainly reflecting lower estimates of future unemployment used for credit loss modeling purposes, but also partly due to lower loan balances.\nThis reversal and other net adjustments to our CECL reserves positively impacted net income for the quarter by approximately $16 million.\nAfter the initial significant increase in CECL reserves taken in Q1 when uncertainty related to COVID-19 economic impacts was at its highest, we have reduced our CECL reserves by almost $60 million in the past three quarters.\nActual charge-off experience to date remains very modest, with less than $2.5 million of net charge-offs taken in 2020.\nNevertheless, we continue to take a cautious approach in making our estimates for credit losses given uncertainty in the U.S. economic outlook as the timeline to a post-COVID-19 impacted economy remains unclear and given the current political environment.\nOnce again, our loans at fair value performed strongly this quarter.\nNet gains of $49.8 million were recorded, including $30.9 million of market value increases and $18.9 million of interest payments, liquidation gains, and other cash income.\nBy the end of 2020, our fair value loan portfolio had recovered all of the market value declines that were recorded in the first quarter.\nLastly, our operating and other expenses were $20.4 million for the quarter.\nThis reflects a lower run rate than we would normally expect primarily due to adjustments to lower incentive compensation accruals that were finalized in the fourth quarter.\nWe continue to estimate that annualized G&A expenses to equity should run at about 2% each quarter.\nPlease turn to Page 13.\nThe fourth quarter for the non-QM space was a continuation of the third quarter's trends.\nOrigination volume increased over the quarter, and loan premiums paid have risen to levels seen prior to the pandemic.\nWe were able to purchase approximately $80 million in the fourth quarter and are on track to purchase over $100 million in the first two months of 2021.\nWe observed an increase in prepayment speeds over the quarter as mortgage rates for non-QM loans have decreased in recent months.\nThe reduction in rates lagged conventional loans as non-QM originators had to rebuild capacity after reducing staff at the onset of the pandemic.\nWe finalized a minority investment in one of our origination partners in the quarter, providing the necessary capital for them to grow originations.\nWe believe the strategy of aligning our interests with select origination partners will allow us to effectively grow our portfolio over time, while ensuring loan quality.\nWe executed two additional securitizations in the fourth quarter, bringing the amount of collateral securitized in 2020 to approximately $1.25 billion.\nAs Craig mentioned previously, the securitizations have lowered our financing costs and at the same time have provided additional stability to our borrowings.\nSecuritization, combined with a non-mark-to-market term facility, has resulted in over 75% of our non-QM portfolio financed with non-mark-to-market leverage.\nWe expect to continue to be a programmatic issuer of securitizations.\nPlease refer to Page 14.\nA significant percentage of our borrowers in our non-QM portfolio have been impacted by the pandemic.\nMany of our borrowers are small business owners who were affected by nationwide shutdowns.\nWe implemented a deferral program at the onset of the pandemic to help our borrowers navigate through the crisis.\nThrough our services, we granted almost 32% of the portfolio temporary payment relief, which we believe helps position our borrowers for long-term payment performance.\nAfter June, we switched to a forbearance program instead of a deferral as the economy reopened.\nForbearance programs instituted are now largely determined by state guidelines.\nFor clarity, the deferral program adds the missed payments to the loan's maturity as a balloon payment.\nAt the end of the forbearance period, missed payments must be repaid.\nIf the full amount cannot be paid in one month, the borrower may spread the owed sum over a longer timeframe.\nDelinquencies improved in Q4 compared to Q3, with 60+ day delinquencies decreasing by nearly 1%.\nAbout 30% of delinquent loans made a payment in December.\nThe current situation is unusual, as despite economic stress and higher unemployment, home values have increased due to low supply and mortgage rates supporting the market.\nOur focus on lower LTV loans should reduce losses if delinquencies rise.\nOften, borrowers unable to afford their debt payments will sell their home to recover their equity.\nLet's move to Page 15.\nOur $1.1 billion RPL portfolio has been affected by the pandemic but continues to perform well.\n81% of our portfolio remains under 60 days delinquent.\nWhile 19% of the portfolio is 60+ days delinquent, over 24% of these borrowers still make payments.\nQ4 saw increased prepayment speeds due to historically low mortgage rates.\nAlthough 30% of our RPL borrowers were impacted by COVID, we've collaborated with servicers to assist borrowers, resulting in improved delinquency levels over the quarter.\nLet's examine Page 16.\nOur asset management team continues to enhance the performance of our NPL portfolio.\nThe team has worked through the pandemic with our servicing partners to optimize portfolio outcomes.\nThis slide shows results for loans purchased before the end of 2019, thus owned for over a year.\n36% of loans that were delinquent when purchased are now either performing or fully paid.\n45% have either liquidated or are REO to be liquidated.\nWe've significantly increased REO property liquidations, selling 87% more properties than a year ago.\n19% remain in nonperforming status.\nOur modifications have been successful, with almost three-quarters either performing or fully paid.\nWe're satisfied with these results, which continue to surpass our initial purchase assumptions.\nLet's move to Page 17.\nQ4 continued the 2020 trend of large principal paydowns in our fix-and-flip portfolio.\nA robust housing market, supported by record-low mortgage rates and limited inventory, has enabled many borrowers to complete projects and sell quickly in a strong market.\nThis, along with our portfolio's maturity (average loan age of 17 months), resulted in $141 million in principal payments in Q4 and about $650 million for all of 2020.\nWe anticipate this trend continuing in 2021.\nMSA's fix-and-flip portfolio decreased by $118 million to $581 million in UPB at Q4's end.\nPrincipal paydowns were $141 million, equivalent to a 59 CPR quarterly paydown rate annualized.\nWe advanced about $11 million in rehab draws and converted $3 million to REO.\nWe resumed purchasing fix-and-flip loans in Q4, acquiring approximately $15 million UPB of new loans.\nThe average Q4 yield for the fix-and-flip portfolio was 5.97%.\nAll our fix-and-flip financing is non-mark-to-market debt with 18 months remaining.\nAfter a $40 million decrease in Q3, seriously delinquent fix-and-flip loans increased by $19 million in Q4 to $162 million.\nQ1 delinquency trends have been positive, with delinquencies approaching Q3 levels.\nSimilar to Q3, improved economic expectations and a strong housing market led to a reduction in fix-and-flip loan loss reserves.\nLoan loss reserves decreased by $4 million to about $18 million at Q4's end.\nLet's examine Page 18.\nSeriously delinquent fix-and-flip loans increased by $19 million in Q4 to $162 million.\nDuring the quarter, $25 million of loans were fully paid off, $3 million improved to current or 30 days delinquent status, and $3 million converted to REO, while $50 million became new 60+ day delinquent loans.\nDespite the Q4 increase in delinquencies, we're pleased that levels have declined from Q2 2020 highs and with the continued strong full payoffs from seriously delinquent loans.\nAs mentioned, Q1 delinquencies are trending down, closer to Q3 levels.\nAbout two-thirds of seriously delinquent loans are either completed projects or bridge loans requiring little to no work, meaning these properties should be generally salable.\nAdditionally, roughly 15% of seriously delinquent loans are already listed for sale, potentially reducing time to resolution.\nWhen seriously delinquent loans pay off in full, we often collect default interest, extension fees, and other fees at payoff.\nFor loans with significant property equity, these can be beneficial.\nSince inception, we've collected about $2.6 million in such fees across our fix-and-flip portfolio.\nWe believe our experienced asset management team provides a significant advantage in loss mitigation, and non-mark-to-market financing of our fix-and-flip portfolio allows efficient handling of delinquent loans.\nWe believe recent economic trends, particularly the strong housing market with robust home price appreciation, combined with our loss mitigation efforts, can lead to acceptable outcomes on delinquent loans.\nLet's move to Page 19.\nOur single-family rental loan portfolio continued to perform well in Q4.\nThe portfolio yielded 5.27% in the quarter, excluding prepayment penalties (a feature of almost all our rental loans recorded in other income).\nIncluding these, the SFR portfolio yield was 5.99% in Q4.\nPrepayments increased to a three-month CPR of 33%, primarily due to payoffs on some three-year balloon loans approaching maturity.\nQ1 prepayments have trended back to mid-teen CPR levels.\n60+ day delinquencies slightly increased to 5.6% in the quarter.\nWe resumed rental loan acquisitions in Q4, purchasing $12 million of loans.\nAs Craig mentioned, we closed our first securitization consisting solely of business purpose rental loans in early February.\nApproximately $218 million of loans were securitized.\nWe sold about 91% of the bonds at a weighted average coupon of 106 basis points.\nThis transaction reduces the underlying asset funding rate by over 150 basis points and increases the percentage of non-mark-to-market SFR financing to 77%, up from 23% at Q4's end.\nI believe MFA has made significant progress since July 1st last year.\nSubstantial asset price appreciation drove earnings and book value.\nWe've made considerable progress in transitioning asset-based financing from expensive durable debt to equally durable but significantly cheaper securitized debt, paying off other expensive debt, repurchasing MFA common stock at material book value discounts, and most recently, settling and eliminating the outstanding warrant package.\nSignificant market uncertainties persist as the country and world continue facing challenges related to the pandemic, politics, and monetary and fiscal policy, but MFA is well-positioned to navigate these uncertainties, respond to opportunities, and we're taking proactive steps to further position our company for future success.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Dale Gibbons and Tim Bruckner, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Credit Officer, are accompanying me on the call today.\nI'll start by giving an overview of our quarterly performance and how we're managing the business in the current economic climate, after which Dale will delve into the Bank's financial results.\nI'd like to highlight three key trends from this quarter that will persist throughout the year: PPNR strength, credit provisioning costs, and balance sheet expansion.\nThese trends will collectively support earnings growth, capital accumulation, and dividend distribution throughout 2020 and 2021.\nWestern Alliance generated $93.3 million in net income and $0.93 in earnings per share for the second quarter, representing a 12% increase from the previous quarter.\nTangible book value per share rose to $27.84, a 4.2% increase from the previous quarter and a 12.9% year-over-year growth.\nThese results were driven by record operating pre-provision net revenue of $194.7 million, showing a 27.7% year-over-year increase and a 19.1% quarter-over-quarter rise, with strong operating PPNR ROA growth of 18 basis points to 2.56%, boosted by $13.9 million in Payment Protection Program net fees.\nThese outcomes demonstrate that Western Alliance's core business maintains strong long-term earnings potential amid current economic and market instability, supporting significant ongoing capital accumulation, providing financial flexibility for balance sheet growth, and accommodating changes to credit loss allowances or economic outlook revisions.\nWe recorded a $92 million provision for credit losses this quarter, compared to $51.2 million in Q1, mainly due to changes in macroeconomic forecast assumptions and net charge-offs of $5.5 million.\nDale will provide more details on the specific drivers of our provisions, but our total loan ACL to funded loan ratio now stands at 1.39% or $347 million.\nContinuing our strong balance sheet momentum from 2019, loans increased by $1.9 billion this quarter to $25 billion, while deposits grew by $2.7 billion to $27.5 billion.\nExcluding PPP, loans grew by a more modest $117 million, while deposits showed strong growth of approximately $1.6 billion.\nThe lower adjusted loan growth reflects subdued demand, for which we reduced our marketing efforts and focused on low-loss, high-quality loan segments, in addition to helping our clients with their PPP applications.\nWe are optimistic about our pipeline and our opportunity to continue growing in low-risk asset classes.\nThroughout the crisis, we've continued to attract new high-quality relationships to our bank at favorable pricing and terms that wouldn't have been available to us under different circumstances.\nThis quarter's positive operating leverage supported our expanding PPNR, as our strong efficiency ratio improved significantly to 36.3% compared to the previous year.\nBecoming more efficient during this economic uncertainty provides additional flexibility to maintain PPNR.\nGoing forward, we will continue investing in new product offerings and infrastructure to maintain operational efficiency, but Q2 levels are temporary and will eventually return to a sustainable level in the low-40s.\nNevertheless, our branch-light business model and National Business Lines strategy continue to give us a competitive edge.\nFinally, supported by our healthy PPNR generation, Western Alliance remains well capitalized with a CET1 ratio of 10.2%, positioning us strongly to address the challenges ahead in this uncertain environment.\nLet's now provide an update on Western Alliance's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe continue to follow CDC protocol and state-by-state return to work guidance as our organization returns to the office.\nAs I mentioned in our Q1 earnings call, WAL's unique credit risk management strategy focuses on establishing individual borrower-level strategies and direct customer dialogue to develop long-term financial plans.\nOur approach to payment deferral requests involves finding resourceful ways to partner with our clients, while assessing their willingness and capacity to support their business interests.\nWe ask our clients to work closely with us, contributing liquidity, capital, or equity as an integral component of modified payment plans.\nOur approach collectively uses the resources of the borrower, government, and bank's balance sheet to develop solutions that extend beyond the six-month window provided for in the CARES Act.\nSince April 1, WAL has funded $1.9 billion in PPP loans, providing quick liquidity to over 4,700 clients and benefiting more than 150,000 employees.\nAt quarter end, $2.9 billion or 11.5% of loans had been modified, with most of these loans receiving principal and interest deferrals.\nExcluding the Hotel Franchise Finance segment, where we implemented a unique sector deferral strategy, the bank-wide deferral rate is approximately 5%.\nThe majority of our borrowers chose to use their own resources or PPP funds to sustain their businesses through the COVID crisis.\nI'll provide an update on the portfolios most impacted by COVID later, but I wanted to highlight that in our Hotel Franchise Finance portfolio, our sophisticated hotel sponsors continue to see value in and support their properties, with 92% of deferrals achieved by posting additional liquidity as part of future payment deferrals.\nOur differentiated deferral strategy gives our customers the runway to resolve their liquidity issues and allows appropriate time for recovery.\nUnlike the one-size-fits-all approach of big banks, we set the expectation that the responsibility for solving long-term cash flow problems remains with our client base.\nIn our Gaming book, all borrowers continued to make interest payments as 90-day principal-only deferrals were approved for 37% of the portfolio.\nCurrently, 95% of our clients are open for business and experiencing a strong rebound in demand.\nThese facts and our daily conversations with our people and clients give me confidence that our credit mitigation strategy and proactive approach to managing risk segments is proving effective and positions Western Alliance to emerge from the pandemic in better shape than our peers.\nDale will now walk you through our financial performance.\nWestern Alliance generated net income of $93.3 million or $0.93 per share over the last three months.\nAs mentioned, net income was affected by increased provision expense for credit losses, driven by the adoption of CECL in Q1 and changes in the economic outlook during the quarter.\nNet interest income rose by $29.4 million, primarily due to loan growth and lower rates on liabilities, as interest expense was reduced by half.\nOperating non-interest income decreased by $5.2 million to $11.1 million from the previous quarter as lower levels of financial activity generated fewer fees.\nWe also benefited from several non-operating items during the period, including recovering approximately 40% or $4.4 million of the mark-to-market loss on preferred stock holdings we recognized in Q1.\nAdditionally, we restructured bank-owned life insurance, resulting in a $5.6 million increase as we surrendered and reinvested lower-yielding policies.\nThis gain should also moderately increase BOLI revenue going forward.\nFinally, non-interest expense declined by $5.7 million, primarily due to a $3.3 million increase in deferred compensation expense related to PPP loan originations, plus a 52% decrease in deposit costs and a 64% reduction in business development and travel expenses.\nContinued strong balance sheet momentum, combined with careful expense management, drove operating pre-provision net revenue of $194.7 million, up 27.7% year-over-year.\nWe believe this is the most relevant metric for evaluating the Bank's ongoing earnings power.\nOur strong PPNR covered an 80% increase in provision costs from Q1 to $92 million, while driving earnings per share up 12% to $0.93 on a linked quarter basis.\nTurning to our interest drivers, investment yields increased by 4 basis points from the prior quarter to 3.02%.\nHowever, the overall quarterly portfolio yield decreased by 32 basis points from the previous year due to the lower rate environment.\nLoan yields decreased by 45 basis points, with declines across most loan types, mainly driven by the 83 basis point reduction in one-month LIBOR during the quarter.\nYield reductions were partially offset by an average yield of 5.02% on our PPP loans.\nLooking ahead, we anticipate loan yields will move towards the quarter-end spot rate of 4.66%.\nThe cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased by 50 basis points to 0.40% in the second quarter, fully benefiting from our quick actions to lower deposit rates following the Federal Reserve's two rate cuts in March.\nAt the end of the quarter, the spot rate for all deposits was 0.20%.\nWhen considering all funding sources, including non-interest-bearing deposits and borrowings, total funding costs decreased by 34 basis points.\nThe quarter-end spot rate for total funding costs is 0.31%, higher than the quarterly average due to the mid-quarter issuance of subordinated debt at 5.25%.\nWe believe funding costs have stabilized at these levels, as no further actions from the Federal Reserve are expected.\nShowcasing our business model's adaptability, net interest income grew by 10.9% or $29 million to $298.4 million in Q1 despite transitioning to a much lower rate environment during the quarter, representing a 17% increase year-over-year.\nOur issuance of PPP loans, combined with robust balance sheet growth and immediate measures to reduce interest-bearing deposit costs, offset the decline in prime and LIBOR rates.\nDuring Q2, PPP lending supported our net interest margin as SBA fees were recognized, resulting in a 5.02% loan yield in this segment.\nWe predict that most PPP loans will be forgiven within eight months of origination.\nOf the $43 million in PPP loan fees received from the SBA, net of origination costs, one-third ($13.9 million) was recognized in the second quarter.\nNet interest margin decreased by 3 basis points to 4.19% during the quarter, as the yield on earning assets fell by 34 basis points but was counterbalanced by an equal improvement in funding costs.\nOur significant deposit growth and increasing cash reserves will continue to exert downward pressure on the NIM until the excess liquidity can be utilized, which we expect to take two to three quarters.\nRegarding our asset sensitivity, our interest rate risk profile has significantly decreased over the past year, and we are now asymmetrically positioned to benefit from any future rate increases, as 70% of our loan portfolio is effectively fixed-rate due to floors on variable-rate loans being largely triggered.\nOur estimated change in net interest income for a 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is 4.2% over the next year, and we now project zero net interest income at risk if rates decrease.\nMoving on to operational efficiency, our efficiency ratio improved by 550 basis points to 36.3% on a quarter-over-quarter basis, continuing to demonstrate our industry-leading operating leverage.\nAs mentioned earlier, the improvement in non-interest expense is due to a $3.3 million increase in deferred compensation expense related to PPP loan originations, a 52% reduction in deposit costs, and a 64% decrease in development and travel expenses.\nAdjusting for PPP net loan fees and interest, the efficiency ratio for Q2 would have been 38.4%.\nFurthermore, our branch-light model has allowed us to identify two locations that we are converting from full-service offices to loan production facilities.\nOur core underlying earning power remained robust, with pre-provision net revenue ROA increasing by 18 basis points from the previous quarter to 2.56%, while return on assets remained stable at 1.22%.\nAlthough we expect 2.56% to be a high point as elevated liquidity will suppress the margin, we believe we will continue to maintain industry-leading performance.\nThis provides significant flexibility to fund ongoing balance sheet growth, capital management actions, or any credit demand.\nOur balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter, with loans increasing by $1.9 billion to $25 billion, and deposit growth of $2.7 billion bringing our deposit balances to $27.5 billion at quarter-end.\nThe loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 90.9% from 93.3% in Q1, as our strong liquidity position continues to provide us with balance sheet capacity to meet all funding needs.\nOur cash position increased to $1.5 billion as deposit growth continues to outpace credit expansion.\nWhile this negatively affects the margin in the short term, we believe it provides us with inventory for good credit growth as demand resumes.\nNotably, during the quarter, we issued $225 million of bank-level subordinated debt to ensure ample capacity to support our growth trajectory by strengthening our total capital ratio.\nLastly, tangible book value per share increased by $1.11 over the previous quarter to $27.84, representing an increase of $3.19 or 13% over the prior year.\nThe majority of the $1.9 billion loan growth was driven by increases in C&I loans of $1.6 billion, residential loans of $154 million, and construction loans of $138 million.\nResidential and consumer loans now make up 9.8% of our loan portfolio, while our construction loan concentration continues to decrease and is now at 8.8% of total loans.\nExcluding PPP loans, loan growth was $117 million, which was affected by line paydowns from draws during Q1 and offset by growth in residential and construction loans.\nHighlighting our continued focus on growth in low-risk assets, tech and innovation loans remained flat overall, while within the category, capital call and subscription lines grew by $35 million, mortgage warehouse loans increased by $325 million, and residential mortgages grew by $165 million.\nCorporate finance loans decreased by $233 million compared to the increase we saw in Q1 as borrowers repaid their line draws, reducing utilization rates from 38% to 17%.\nAll loan growth was fully funded by deposit growth.\nWe continue to believe our ability to profitably grow deposits is both a key differentiator and a core value driver for our firm's long-term value creation.\nNotably, year-to-date deposit growth of $6.1 billion exceeds the annual deposit growth of the Company in any previous calendar year.\nDeposits grew by $2.7 billion or 10.9% in the second quarter, driven by increases in non-interest-bearing DDAs of $2.3 billion, which now comprise over 44% of our deposit base.\nPPP loan-related deposits grew by $1.1 billion, and savings and money market accounts increased by $845 million.\nHOAs contributed to total deposit growth by adding $136 million, and Tech & Innovation increased by $262 million as capital raising activity during the quarter was active.\nExcluding PPP-related deposits, growth would have been $1.6 billion or 6.5%.\nRegarding asset quality, special mention loans increased by $292 million and non-performing loans rose by $53 million during the quarter.\nHalf of the increase in special mention loans is from the hotel portfolio.\nGenerally consistent with our previously discussed Tech & Innovation rating guidelines, these loans were downgraded as we do not have a clear view of more than six months of remaining operating liquidity.\nThese borrowers are current, however, as they made loan prepayments that we required for us to consent to a deferral modification.\nOur other borrowers in this segment are also paying as agreed or provided cash payments that, when combined with the payment deferral, have no additional debt service requirement until sometime in 2021.\nSecondly, we've identified an event planning and leisure sub-segment, in which the business models are essentially dependent on social distancing relief, and in some cases, the resumption of group events.\nOf the $150 million total exposure to this sector, $60 million has been moved to special mention and $40 million to non-performing.\nWhile the portion moved to special mention has over a year of current liquidity, it was downgraded as the revenue models have been sharply impaired.\nThe loan moved to non-performing now has limited remaining liquidity.\nThe remainder of the migration to special mention is fairly spread out among our clients throughout our metropolitan markets where liquidity has tightened.\nThese loans are generally collateralized by a variety of assets that include real property.\nOften, a loan may be downgraded to special mention due to liquidity concerns, even though collateral coverage may be substantial.\nMigration to special mention has minimal correlation with ultimate credit losses, as less than 1% has progressed to charge-off over the last five years\nOur credit loss allowance increased by $86 million this quarter, with balance sheet mix changes releasing $4.2 million in reserves and outlook adjustments accounting for $96.2 million, including $5.5 million in net charge-offs\nThe entire net reserve increase was due to updates in CECL macroeconomic outlook assumptions, which have stabilized since April despite declining from March 31\nThe loan loss allowance, excluding held-to-maturity securities, was $347 million or 1.39% of funded loans, a 25 basis point increase\nThe current reserve increase reflects our best estimate of the future economic environment at quarter-end, considering government stimulus programs and credit migration actions\nWe've adopted the Blue Chip Economic Forecasts consensus outlook, which aligns closely with management's view of a recession and recovery\nNet credit losses of $5.5 million were recognized this quarter, primarily from small business and C&I borrowers\nTotal loan ACL to funded loans rose 25 basis points to 1.39% in Q2, as loan loss provision expense of $87.3 million significantly exceeded net loan charge-offs\nOur lower consumer exposure continues to result in lower total loan losses compared to most other banking companies\nI'll now briefly update you on the current status of exposures to industries generally considered most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic\nIn the last two weeks of the quarter, Tim Bruckner, the credit administration team, and I conducted the most comprehensive quarterly portfolio review in the Bank's history\nThe review covered 95% of WAL's outstanding loan balances, excluding purchased residential mortgages\nOur $2 billion Hotel Franchise Finance business, focused on select service hotels, comprises about 8.2% of the loan portfolio\nThese borrowers' financial flexibility is maximized by partnering with financially strong institutional operators with deep industry experience, expertise, and conservative underwriting structures focused on loan to cost\nOccupancy rates are in line with national averages, currently around 46%, which have tripled from April lows of about 15% and are now close to fully covering estimated operating expenses\nSelect service hotels are estimated to cover amortizing debt service at approximately 55% occupancy\nDespite a 55% drop in revenue per available room, select service hotels have managed to reduce their cost structure by over 40%, allowing the typical hotel to operate at breakeven\nNearly 85% of our hotel portfolio is either paying as originally agreed or on proactive payment deferral plans extending into 2021\nWe're optimistic about the portfolio's trajectory and believe our proactive deferral strategy will lead to relatively stronger credit performance, given the active support demonstrated by our sponsors through substantial upfront payments made to receive deferral plans\nTo support this strategy, we nearly doubled the portfolio's reserve this quarter and increased the ACL to loans ratio by 93 basis points to 1.95%\nThe investor-dependent portion of our Technology & Innovation segment primarily focuses on lending to established growth companies with successful products and strong investor support, providing greater operational and financial flexibility in this environment\nOverall, significant sponsor support and an active fundraising environment continue for these growth firms\n81% of loans have over six months of remaining liquidity, up from 77% in Q1\nAdditionally, over 50 clients have successfully raised

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These potential issues and various elements could negatively impact our operations and future performance.\nFor additional details about these risk elements, please consult our SEC filings, including our 10-K and 10-Q reports.\nShould you need a copy, these documents can be accessed in the Investor Relations area of our website at dukerealty.com.\nThe current conditions in our industry are the most favorable we've ever experienced.\nWe've experienced three consecutive quarters of demand reaching or nearing record levels, and projected market rent growth has increased from around 10% to mid-teens nationally, with some areas seeing increases up to 35%.\nThis quarter, we initiated approximately $350 million in new developments, anticipating strong value creation and returns, and we've once again increased our full-year guidance on new project starts.\nDecreasing capitalization rates and increasing rents continued to outpace rising material costs, enabling us to improve our profit margins.\nOur development pipeline now boasts margins exceeding 60%, and our core portfolio achieved record rent growth of 22% on a cash basis from second-generation leasing activities.\nThese quarterly outcomes and our improved forecast for the remainder of the year led us to raise key elements of our 2021 guidance, including year-over-year core FFO growth now expected to reach 13.8% and AFFO per share growth of 11.6%.\nGiven these results and our positive outlook for the rest of the year, we've increased the dividend by nearly 10%.\nMark will provide a detailed explanation of these changes shortly.\nI'll begin by discussing market fundamentals and then review our overall operational performance.\nIndustrial net absorption reached 121 million square feet, just one million square feet short of the all-time record.\nThis significantly outpaced new supply, as completions totaled about 79 million square feet.\nThe positive net absorption over deliveries this quarter reduced vacancy to 3.6%, establishing another record low.\nThese robust market conditions led to a 10% increase in nationwide asking rents during the third quarter compared to the previous year.\nCBRE now forecasts demand for the full year to be in the mid-300 million square foot range, likely surpassing the all-time 2016 record of 327 million square feet.\nCompletions for the year are expected to total about 270 million square feet.\nNational asking rents for the full year are projected to increase in the mid-teens, with some markets like Northern New Jersey and Southern California potentially seeing increases of 30% to 35%.\nThe response to supply chain disruptions is still in the early stages of a long-term boom for our sector, with CBRE reaffirming approximately 1.2 billion square feet of projected aggregate demand over the next five years.\nRising inventory levels, safety stock, consumer spending, and online shopping trends are driving much of this demand.\nDemand by occupier type remains diverse, with e-commerce and logistics services companies continuing to account for roughly 60% of our activity, though e-commerce contribution is about 10% lower compared to 2020 and 3PL contribution is about 10% higher than this time last year.\nIt's also worth noting that Amazon's share of demand this year is approximately 10% of overall total demand, down from 18% in 2020.\nRegarding our own portfolio, we had a very strong quarter, executing leases for 9.5 million square feet.\nThe quarter's robust leasing activity led to ongoing rent increases in our portfolio, with 35% growth on a GAAP basis and 22% in cash, despite only 25% of transactions occurring in prime coastal markets\nOur portfolio's estimated mark-to-market value on a GAAP basis is now projected to be 28%\nWe initiated $349 million worth of new developments in the quarter, comprising two million square feet across six speculative projects and two build-to-suits\n80% of this development volume was concentrated in our prime coastal markets\nOur team has successfully continued leasing our speculative projects, as demonstrated by the stabilization of seven new developments during the quarter and an increase in the development pipeline's occupancy to 60%\nTo illustrate our success in leasing speculative projects, the $897 million worth of projects we completed through September 30 this year saw an increase in occupancy from 39% at the start of construction to 90% upon completion\nFor all our speculative developments initiated since early 2019, we've achieved an average lease-up time of less than two months after project completion\nOur team's ongoing ability to swiftly lease speculative development projects will be a crucial factor in our future growth\nRegarding the development pipeline\nAt the end of the quarter, our development pipeline totaled $1.1 billion, with 86% allocated to prime markets and 60% pre-leased\nWe now anticipate a value creation of over 60% from this pipeline, primarily due to rapid increases in rents and land values\nWe're proud to remind everyone that we aim to develop only to LEED certification standards\nWe expect the percentage of our total NOI from LEED-certified properties to approach 25% by the end of 2022\nTo mitigate construction-related risks, our teams have taken measures such as contracting for steel nearly a year in advance, resulting in only minor delays in a few projects\nThe outlook for new project starts is promising, as reflected in our revised guidance with a midpoint increase of $175 million\nLooking ahead, we own or control land, mainly in coastal infill markets, that could support approximately $1 billion in annual starts over the next four years, assuming continued robust supply and demand dynamics\nIt's worth noting that the market value of our owned land is about double its book value, and we've typically held this land for only about two years\nLand we control and plan to acquire in the coming quarters is also priced below market value\nThe favorable land values will continue to support high development margins and strong long-term returns\nOverall, we believe we are well-positioned to maintain our industry leadership and achieve growth through new development\nDuring the quarter, we generated $738 million from dispositions, including outright sales and contributions to joint ventures\nThe outright sales included our entire remaining portfolio in St. Louis, three buildings in Indianapolis, and one in Chicago\nThis activity also included the initial two tranches of Amazon property contributions to our newly formed joint venture with CBRE Global Investors\nThe aggregate pricing reflected an in-place capitalization rate of 4.8%, slightly inflated by a higher 5% cap rate for the St. Louis portfolio, where pricing was affected by anticipated rent decreases due to upcoming tax abatement expirations\nWe acquired one facility in the third quarter for $24 million, a 63,000-square-foot property in the San Gabriel Valley submarket of Southern California\nThis quarter's activities have further reallocated our portfolio's geographic distribution based on Net Operating Income to about 40% in prime coastal markets.\nShortly after the quarter ended in early October, we finalized the divestment of a 517,000-square-foot Amazon facility located in Columbus, Ohio.\nThis transaction marks our final property sale for the year.\nI'll now hand over the call to Mark, who will discuss our financial performance and updated projections.\nThe quarter's Core Funds From Operations was $0.46 per share, showing a 15% increase from $0.40 per share in the third quarter of 2020.\nAdjusted Funds From Operations reached $151 million for the quarter, up from $135 million in the same period of 2020.\nCash-based same-property Net Operating Income growth for the three and nine-month periods ending in 2021, compared to identical timeframes in 2020, was 3.8% and 5.3% respectively.\nThe rise in same-property Net Operating Income for 2021's third quarter versus 2020's third quarter was primarily attributed to rent increases, partially counterbalanced by a 0.8% drop in occupancy within our same-property portfolio, due to an exceptionally high occupancy comparison of 98.6% in 2020.\nOur financial position is robust, with ample resources to support our expansion.\nAt the quarter's end, we had $273 million in sale proceeds held in 1031 exchange accounts, earmarked for upcoming building and land acquisitions.\nWe concluded the quarter with decreased leverage due to significant property sales, but plan to return to recent leverage levels by year-end as we continue to expand through development.\nGiven our consistently strong operational results, we've revised our 2021 core Funds From Operations guidance to between $1.71 and $1.75 per share, up from the previous range of $1.69 to $1.73 per share.\nThe $1.73 midpoint of our updated core Funds From Operations guidance represents a nearly 14% increase over 2020.\nWe've raised our cash-based same-property Net Operating Income growth guidance to a range of 5% to 5.4%, up from the previous 4.75% to 5.25% range.\nWe continue to surpass our projected performance for speculative developments, both in leasing speed and rental rates achieved, while maintaining a solid list of build-to-suit prospects and land sites at various stages of due diligence and approvals.\nBased on these prospects, we've revised our development start guidance to between $1.3 billion and $1.45 billion, up from the previous range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion.\nWe've adjusted several other guidance components based on our more optimistic outlook, as detailed in the range of estimates exhibit included in our supplemental information available on our website.\nTo conclude, I'm extremely proud of our team's performance in leasing, capital deployment, and development initiations.\nWe began the year with strong growth expectations and have surpassed all of them, resulting in nearly 14% growth in core Funds From Operations at the revised midpoint.\nOur shareholders should be very satisfied with our dividend increase of $0.025 per share.\nThis 9.8% increase marks our seventh consecutive year of annual dividend growth, representing an increase of over 65% during that period.\nLooking ahead to the next few years, our operational platform is ideally positioned to capitalize on the numerous growth drivers benefiting the logistics sector.\nThese drivers, combined with the undersupply of new available warehouse space, will enable us to maintain high occupancy rates and rent growth while generating substantial profit margins on our development pipeline exceeding $1 billion.\nAs a result of these factors, we believe we can sustain earnings growth of approximately 10% for the foreseeable future.\n[Operator Instructions] Sean will now begin taking questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Patti Poppe, our CEO, and Chris Foster, our Executive VP and CFO, are with us today.\nThese declarations are founded on projections, predictions, and current information accessible to leadership.\nWe suggest you examine our Form 10-Q quarterly report for the period ending September 30, 2021.\nOur non-GAAP core earnings this quarter were $0.24 per share.\nWe are maintaining our 2021 non-GAAP core earnings per share forecast of $0.95 to $1.05, and we don't anticipate issuing equity this year.\nWe still project an 8.5% rate base growth and a 10% long-term earnings-per-share increase.\nChris will soon provide more financial details.\nAs demonstrated at Investor Day, our seasoned team is committed to safely delivering clean energy daily.\nWe have a highly advanced PSPS algorithm that improves year after year.\nWhen we applied our current model to past utility-caused fires from 2012 to 2020, it would have prevented 96% of structural damage.\nThis year, we implemented enhanced power line safety measures to address wildfire risks due to extreme drought.\nFrom late July to mid-October, we observed a 46% reduction in CPUC reportable ignitions in high-risk fire areas and an 80% decrease in ignitions on enabled circuits.\nThese improved safety measures enhance the security of our system and customers.\nWe're fulfilling our 2021 wildfire mitigation plan using our lean operating system, implementing it company-wide to achieve predictable results for customers and investors.\nIn addition to regular operational, financial, and regulatory updates, I'd like to discuss the work done and changes made since 2019 to improve our system's safety and resilience.\nLet's begin with slide 4, showing how we've enhanced our PSPS program since 2019.\nIn 2019, we had seven events affecting over 2 million customers.\nSince then, we've installed about 1,300 weather stations, 500 high-definition cameras, and over 1,100 sectionalizing devices to better identify where PSPS is necessary.\nOur 2021 PSPS algorithms are based on more detailed weather forecasts, and we're using Technosylva software to incorporate machine learning into our fire spread modeling for real-time risk assessment.\nWe continuously improve our approach to address safety risks while minimizing customer disruption.\nSlide 5 shows that our model, when applied to 2012-2020 data, would have prevented 96% of structural damage from fires caused by overhead electrical equipment in our service area.\nThis year, we faced extreme drought conditions in our service area, leading to fire spread on non-red flag warning days.\nWe evaluated these risks and identified areas needing focus.\nGuided by former CAL FIRE and local fire authority staff now working for PG&E, we implemented additional wildfire mitigation in high-risk fire areas.\nSlide 6 displays the results of our safety focus.\nWe've compared data since implementing enhanced powerline safety settings against recent three-year averages.\nWe've seen a 46% reduction in CPUC reportable ignitions in high-risk fire districts from late July to mid-October.\nOn circuits where we first implemented enhanced powerline safety settings, we've seen an 80% decrease in ignitions over the same period.\nWe're working to reduce customer impact from these new necessary protocols.\nWe've optimized protective device settings on all circuits with enhanced powerline safety settings and adjusted our circuit restoration procedures.\nThese improvements make outages smaller and quicker to resolve while still eliminating ignition risk.\nWe're openly communicating our commitment to preventing significant fires in communities with enhanced powerline safety settings.\nLet me illustrate with a story.\nOn October 11, we initiated a PSPS event affecting about 20,000 people.\nWinds arrived as predicted, and in 33 instances outside PSPS zones and high-wind areas, our lines automatically de-energized due to unpredictable disturbances, mitigating potential risks.\nWe know our protocols are effective.\nWe'll continue working around the clock to make these solutions less disruptive to customers while ensuring their safety.\nOur experience since implementing these settings in late July will guide our 2022 planning.\nAs we continue to keep people safe daily, I want to discuss the risk reduction work we've completed since 2019.\nLet's start with slide 7, focusing on our enhanced inspections.\nWe're on track to complete enhanced inspections on 0.5 million assets in high-risk fire areas in 2021.\nThese inspections are scheduled annually for all assets in Tier 3 and every three years for all assets in Tier 2.\nThe bottom of this slide shows points about our routine inspection program, which receives significant internal attention but isn't well-known outside PG&E.\nAs shown in the green box, we conduct annual vegetation management inspections across our entire system and patrol conductors twice yearly in high-risk fire areas.\nIn 2021, we plan to complete 1800 miles of enhanced vegetation management work, which, combined with our 2019 and 2020 efforts, totals over 6,000 miles by year-end.\nWhile we focus on keeping people safe through inspections and vegetation management, we're also working on long-term system hardening.\nWe've achieved significant progress on our long-term 10,000 mile underground power line project over the past quarter.\nOur engineers are currently planning the work, which will be reflected in our upcoming wildfire prevention strategy for 2022.\nWe aim to involve the entire community in the underground power line initiative, and we're succeeding in this effort.\nWe're collaborating with various stakeholders through an advisory group that includes representatives from environmental organizations, labor unions, telecommunications companies, consumer advocacy groups, and local tribes, among others.\nThrough our Request for Information process, we're gathering innovative ideas for engineering, equipment, and construction from leading experts worldwide.\nWe're continuing to strengthen our system, as shown here, and we'll provide updates on our approach to this work as we further develop our underground power line program.\nAs a preview, I'll share one project we finished this year.\nWe completed the underground installation of power lines in Santa Rosa in September, which will prevent power shutoffs for 11,000 customers during high-risk weather conditions.\nThis is just one of many projects we're undertaking.\nWe implemented this solution because it's the best option for our customers in that area.\nWe're focusing on straightforward solutions that address our customers' needs.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we'll provide more information about our underground power line plans in early 2022.\nAt PG&E, we use lean operating systems across the entire company to effectively implement our wildfire prevention strategy.\nThese quick 15-minute meetings provide daily insights into our most important metrics, help us identify issues, and quickly develop plans to support our teams closer to our customers, giving us better control and predictability in our operations.\nAs you're aware, we faced challenges this summer with the Dixie fire and its impact on our customers.\nI'll reiterate what we've said since Investor Day: we believe our actions regarding the Dixie fire were those of a responsible operator, and we're confident in the framework established by AB 1054.\nAB 1054 created a wildfire fund to provide liquidity for settled claims, set a maximum liability cap for reimbursement by investor-owned utilities, and established enhanced prudency standards for determining reimbursement amounts.\nWe're reflecting this perspective in our financial statements, which show a gross charge of $1.15 billion.\nWe've recorded an offsetting $1.15 billion receivable that demonstrates our confidence in cost recovery.\nAs I emphasized, PG&E is working diligently every day to deliver clean energy safely.\nWe're expanding on the mitigation programs we initiated in 2019.\nWe're remaining flexible to address current conditions.\nWe're improving our performance across the entire organization.\nFor instance, our team recently responded to an atmospheric river weather event that brought some of the highest rainfall totals observed in a 48-hour period, ranging from 16 inches at Mount Tam to 5 inches in downtown Sacramento.\nThe strongest wind gust recorded was 92 miles per hour at Mines Tower in Alameda County, with at least a dozen other locations experiencing gusts greater than 69 miles per hour.\nDespite these challenging conditions, we completed our work without any serious safety incidents while restoring service to 632,000 of the 851,000 affected customers within 12 hours.\nI'm very proud of our team's safe and swift response.\nNow, I'll turn it over to Chris to discuss financial and regulatory matters.\nAs Patti mentioned earlier, our financial plan remains on track and is supported by our regulatory framework.\nI'll start with the key points, then provide more details.\nToday, we're announcing that we no longer anticipate needing equity in 2021.\nWe're reaffirming our non-GAAP core earnings per share guidance for this year and plan to issue our 2022 guidance during our Q4 earnings call.\nAdditionally, we're seeing progress on recovering costs related to previous wildfire risk reduction investments, which will help strengthen our balance sheet.\nLet's begin with the share count used for Q3 2021 and year-to-date GAAP and non-GAAP core earnings per share.\nWe're in a GAAP loss position for both Q3 2021 and year-to-date 2021 due to our grantor trust election this quarter.\nConsequently, we're required to use basic shares outstanding to calculate both GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP core earnings per share for Q3 and year-to-date.\nOur full-year guidance has always assumed a GAAP positive year, and our full-year non-GAAP core earnings per share of $0.95 to $1.05 per share reflects our fully diluted share count.\nSo there's no impact there.\nI'll start with our Q3 results.\nWe remain on track for the 2021 non-GAAP operating earnings per share of $0.95 to $1.05.\nThis is calculated using our fully diluted share count I just mentioned, consistent with our assumption when we initiated guidance.\nSlide 9 shows our results for the third quarter.\nNon-GAAP core earnings per share for the quarter were $0.24.\nWe recorded a GAAP loss of $0.55 including non-core items.\nThis quarter, we recorded a $1.3 billion charge we previously guided to as a result of our grantor trust election.\nAs you may recall, this charge is expected to reverse over time as the Fire Victim Trust sells shares.\nMoving to slide 10.\nAs Patti mentioned, we took a $1.15 billion charge this quarter for the Dixie fire.\nWe also documented $1.15 billion in offsetting receivables.\nThe receivables indicate our belief in cost recovery based on current information.\nWe recognize a receivable when recovery is deemed probable under accounting standards, but we haven't yet determined probable recovery for amounts exceeding insurance for the 2019 Kincaid and 2020 Zogg fires.\nAs a result, we haven't recorded offsetting receivables for those fires.\nSlide 11 compares non-GAAP core earnings per share, showing $0.24 for Q3 2021 versus $0.22 for Q3 2020.\nThe increase in EPS was due to various factors including rate base earnings growth, using basic share count, and lower wildfire litigation costs, partially offset by a timing-related tax decrease.\nWe anticipate a stronger fourth quarter due to regulatory revenue timing and efficient work execution.\nWe are maintaining our non-GAAP core earnings per share guidance of $0.95 to $1.05.\nWe plan to complete an $860 million AB 1054 securitization transaction this month.\nOur rate-neutral securitization has been approved by the CPUC, and we expect to start issuing bonds early next year after resolving final legal steps.\nRegarding regulatory matters, we've requested cost recovery for about 80% of unrecovered wildfire-related costs, with decisions, settlements, or interim rates for roughly 60%.\nWe filed a settlement agreement for our 2020 wildfire mitigation and catastrophic event application, with a $1.04 billion settlement considered reasonable.\nIn September, we filed for recovery of $1.4 billion in additional wildfire mitigation and catastrophic event costs, mostly from last year.\nWe filed an off-cycle cost of capital application for rates starting January 2022, addressing the disconnect between lower interest rates and increased costs for California utilities.\nWe recently filed for transportation electrification investments to support underserved communities and California's greenhouse gas reduction goals.\nWe're requesting about $225 million from 2023 through 2030 for EV Charge 2, which will support 16,000 new charging ports.\nWe're delivering on our 2021 financial plan, focusing on reducing wildfire risk while effectively managing the business long-term.\nWe've eliminated our 2021 equity need and continue to improve our balance sheet while making necessary clean energy investments.\nWe're excited about PG&E's future and the value we're creating.\nOur wildfire risk reduction efforts are progressing, and we have protections in place for investors and the communities we serve.\nOur PSPS protocols and enhanced powerline safety settings are effective in reducing ignitions during high-risk conditions.\nWe're adapting our approach based on lessons learned to best serve customers and investors.\nWe're committed to delivering on financials and implementing processes for a high-performing utility.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Andy Simanek oversees investor relations at Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\nFor financial data presented in non-GAAP terms, we've provided comparisons to equivalent GAAP figures on our website.\nUnless specified otherwise, all revenue growth rates mentioned in this call are year-over-year comparisons adjusted for currency effects.\nI'm impressed by how resilient our customers, partners, and employees have been.\nI'm proud of how Hewlett Packard Enterprise continues to meet our global communities' needs during these unusual and changing times.\nHPE had an outstanding third quarter, with strong order growth, improved margins, and record-breaking free cash flow.\nI'm pleased to see our unique product lineup resonating in the market and our edge-to-cloud strategy driving improved performance across our business units.\nGiven our strong Q3 results and confidence in our market momentum, we're raising our fiscal year 2021 earnings per share and free cash flow projections, and resuming stock buybacks.\nQ3 revenue was $6.9 billion, aligning with our forecast and typical seasonal patterns.\nOur Q3 orders saw robust double-digit year-over-year growth, and our year-to-date order volume has risen 11%, demonstrating the appeal of our edge-to-cloud offerings.\nWe substantially improved our non-GAAP gross and operating margins, leading to year-to-date increases of 28% in non-GAAP operating profit and 27% in earnings per share compared to last year.\nWe generated record-breaking year-to-date free cash flow of $1.5 billion, a $1.1 billion increase from last year, surpassing our initial October forecast.\nI'm especially glad we achieved these results while managing industry-wide supply constraints through proactive inventory measures, close collaboration with suppliers, and implementing targeted response plans using our top-tier engineering capabilities.\nThe pandemic's effects continue to speed up the shift we predicted years ago towards an edge-centric, cloud-enabled, and data-driven world.\nThe need for secure connectivity, faster data insights, and ubiquitous cloud experiences is greater than ever.\nWe anticipate these trends will persist.\nDigital transformation has evolved from a priority to a strategic necessity.\nTo help our clients transform their businesses and prepare for the future, we've focused on strengthening key areas that are gaining significant market traction.\nWe received a record number of orders in both our intelligent edge and high-performance compute and mission-critical solutions divisions.\nDue to strong demand and execution, these growth sectors now account for nearly 25% of our total company revenue.\nOur intelligent edge business gained momentum again in Q3, with 23% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by record new orders.\nStrong customer demand for secure connectivity has resulted in a backlog five times larger than at the end of Q3 last year, as clients increasingly seek solutions to gather, connect, analyze, and act on data at the edge.\nWe're capitalizing on this demand by continuing to invest and innovate at the edge.\nIn June, we introduced new AI ops, IoT, and security features for our Aruba Edge Services Platform (ESP), designed to streamline network operations, maximize IT efficiency, and simplify network extension from the edge to the cloud.\nOur Aruba ESP continues to gain popularity among customers in various industries.\nDuring the third quarter, clients including Save A Lot, Monument Health, and Circa Resort and Casino all standardized their networks on Aruba ESP.\nIn our high-performance compute and mission-critical solutions business, revenue increased 9% year-over-year, driven by record new orders.\nWe also generated a record order book, now exceeding $2.5 billion.\nThe exponential growth in data, along with AI and big data analytics, is driving increased demand for high-performance computing and mission-critical capabilities across enterprises of all sizes.\nTo meet this demand, we enhanced our artificial intelligence capabilities by acquiring Determined AI, a startup that provides a comprehensive software stack for training AI models faster at any scale using its open-source machine learning platform.\nWe continue to see more customers accessing our high-performance computer solutions as-a-Service through HPE GreenLake.\nWith our HPE GreenLake Cloud Services for HPC, customers gain powerful specialized computing and AI capabilities with a sustainable cloud experience.\nFor example, in Q3, HPE was awarded a $2 billion contract to be fulfilled over 10 years with the National Security Agency to deliver high-performance computing solutions through the HPE GreenLake platform.\nThis service will help the National Security Agency efficiently process data and uncover new insights in sustainable ways.\nOur core businesses saw robust year-over-year order growth, as well as strong profitability and free cash flow in the quarter.\nYear-to-date, compute and storage orders have increased by mid-single digits, with Q3 operating margins of 11.2% and 15.1%, respectively.\nWe continue to offer more of our core capabilities as-a-Service.\nIn Q3, we introduced unified compute operations as-a-Service through our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform.\nThis new cloud-based management service simplifies provisioning and automates compute infrastructure management wherever it's located.\nOur storage business is evolving into a cloud-native, software-defined data services business through organic innovation and strategic acquisitions.\nIn May, we launched new cloud data services available through HPE GreenLake, as well as the new HPE Alletra cloud-native data infrastructure.\nJust this week, we finalized the acquisition of Zerto, a leader in cloud data management and protection, offering advanced data recovery services that will soon be available as-a-Service through HPE GreenLake.\nThis acquisition immediately positions HPE GreenLake in the high-growth data protection market with a proven, scalable solution.\nHPE pioneered the delivery of an as-a-Service cloud experience on-premises, in colocation facilities, or at the edge with HPE GreenLake four years ago.\nToday, our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform has over 1,100 customers.\nOur annualized revenue run rate this quarter reached $705 million, up 33% year-over-year, driven by strong as-a-Service orders growth of 46% year-over-year.\nOrganizations across various sectors, including retail, healthcare, financial services, and the public sector, are adopting HPE GreenLake.\nFor instance, we helped Liberty Mutual transition from traditional capital-intensive IT spending to a new pay-as-you-go model, creating an on-premises cloud experience that provides transparency into consumption while improving their ability to adapt to capacity demands.\nThey standardized critical workloads on HPE Synergy delivered through HPE GreenLake, resulting in a smaller data center footprint and significant cost savings, including a monthly unit rate well below public cloud alternatives.\nWe're also seeing the power of the full HPE edge-to-cloud portfolio as customers turn to HPE for integrated solutions combining secure connectivity, data insight capabilities, and cloud experiences.\nWoolworths Group, Australia and New Zealand's largest retailer, chose HPE GreenLake to power its new Wpay payment platform.\nThey needed a solution combining powerful mission-critical architecture with scalability and improved cost efficiency for Wpay and its merchant partners.\nDelivered through HPE GreenLake, their solution leverages our complete edge-to-cloud portfolio, including HPE Aruba, HPE NonStop, HPE Primera, and HPE Synergy.\nHPE Pointnext Services also provided expertise to support the company's digital transformation.\nI believe this exemplifies the strength of our HPE edge-to-cloud portfolio.\nTo maintain our leadership in cloud services and accelerate our pivot to as-a-Service offerings, we're constantly innovating.\nWe made several exciting announcements at HPE Discover in June.\nI'm particularly enthusiastic about our new HPE GreenLake Lighthouse offering, a secure cloud-native stack built with HPE Ezmeral software to autonomously optimize various workloads across hybrid environments, reducing deployment time and operating costs.\nWe unveiled Project Aurora as part of our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform to enhance enterprise security.\nProject Aurora constantly checks and verifies the integrity of hardware, free operating systems, platforms and workloads, while also identifying sophisticated threats.\nTo expand our capabilities, we purchased Ampool, a company that develops data platforms.\nAmpool will enhance the analytics capabilities of HPE Ezmeral, providing improved performance for engineers and business analysts.\nI'm pleased with HPE's Q3 and year-to-date results, which show significant progress in our transition to an edge-to-cloud company.\nOur market success drives us to accelerate our transformation, which is crucial for our continued growth.\nThis transformation is my top priority.\nOur mission to improve how people live and work is more crucial than ever in this pivotal time.\nOur strategy to become the leading edge-to-cloud company is proving highly relevant, and our products are succeeding in the market.\nDriven by our mission, strategy, and product range, we can help create a more digital and inclusive world.\nWe must develop new digital transformation strategies that align with our ESG goals and those of our customers, leading to improved business results and social impact.\nWe remain committed to being a positive force and a valuable partner for our customers.\nWe will persist in delivering innovative solutions to our customers and generating value for our shareholders.\nI'm thankful for our exceptional team and optimistic about what lies ahead.\nPlease join our virtual Security Analyst Meeting on October 28 to learn more about our market position, priorities, and future outlook.\nI'll begin by summarizing our financial performance for Q3 of fiscal year 2021.\nAntonio has already covered the key points on Slides 1 and 2.\nNow, I'll discuss our Q3 results, starting with Slide 3.\nI'm happy to report strong demand across all our business segments.\nQ3 saw accelerated order growth, significant improvements in gross and operating margins, and strong cash flow generation.\nFollowing last quarter's strong performance, we achieved Q3 revenues of $6.9 billion, a 3% increase from the previous quarter, aligning with typical seasonal patterns and our projections that accounted for anticipated supply chain issues.\nWe're taking proactive steps and collaborating with our top-tier suppliers to minimize disruptions and create customized recovery strategies.\nI'm particularly proud of our non-GAAP gross margin, which reached a new record of 34.7%, up 40 basis points sequentially and 420 basis points year-over-year.\nThis improvement results from our strategic focus on higher-margin software-based offerings, strong pricing strategies, and cost reduction efforts.\nAs previously mentioned, we continue to invest in high-growth, high-margin areas of our portfolio, both in R&D and sales, particularly in Aruba Software and as-a-Service, which increased our non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter.\nWe also recorded two one-time charges totaling $28 million for a legal settlement and bad debt related to a suspected fraud involving a channel partner in APJ.\nDespite these investments and one-time charges, our non-GAAP operating margin was 9.8%, up 190 basis points year-over-year, resulting in a 25% increase in operating profit compared to last year.\nWe remain focused on improving business efficiency.\nIn other income and expense, we benefited from improved operational performance in H3C and significant gains from increased valuations in our Pathfinder venture portfolio.\nAs a result, we now expect other income and expense for fiscal year '21 to be an income of approximately $50 million.\nWith strong performance across the business and despite two unexpected one-time charges, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.47, a 31% increase year-over-year and above the high end of our Q3 outlook range.\nQ3 cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion, with free cash flow of $526 million.\nThis brings our year-to-date free cash flow to a record $1.5 billion, up $1.1 billion from last year, primarily due to increased operating profit.\nLastly, our strong business performance allows us to provide significant returns to our shareholders.\nWe paid $157 million in dividends this quarter and are announcing a Q4 dividend of $0.12 per share, payable in October.\nWe're also resuming share buybacks due to increased free cash flow generation and improved visibility.\nI'll discuss capital allocation more broadly when we review the outlook.\nLet's now turn to our segment highlights on Slide 4.\nOur growth businesses, now representing nearly 25% of our total company revenue, are performing exceptionally well with record order levels.\nIn the Intelligent Edge segment, we accelerated our top-line momentum with record order levels and 23% year-over-year revenue growth.\nSwitching grew over 20% year-over-year, while wireless LAN faced more severe supply constraints and grew in the mid-single digits.\nAdditionally, Edge-as-a-Service offerings grew by triple digits year-over-year, reflecting growth in enabling software platforms and Network-as-a-Service.\nWe continue to see strong operating margins at 15.8% in Q3, up 540 basis points year-over-year, which included a $17 million one-time legal settlement that impacted margins by 2 points.\nSilver Peak continues to perform well, contributing 7 points to Intelligent Edge growth.\nWe've also started generating significant revenue synergies by cross-selling the Aruba portfolio, reinforcing the benefits of the Silver Peak acquisition.\nIn HPC and MCS, demand strengthened further with record order levels.\nRevenue grew 9% year-over-year as we continue to achieve customer acceptance milestones and deliver on over $2.5 billion of awarded contracts, including the $2 billion, 10-year contract with the NSA that Antonio mentioned.\nWe remain on track to meet our full-year and three-year revenue growth CAGR target of 8% to 12%.\nIn compute, revenue grew 4% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting normal seasonal patterns despite anticipated supply chain constraints.\nOperating margins of 11.2% were up 190 basis points from last year, due to disciplined pricing and cost structure optimization in this segment.\nIn Storage, revenue grew 1% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter, surpassing normal seasonal patterns, driven by strong growth in software-defined offerings.\nNimble grew 10% year-over-year, with continued strong dHCI momentum, growing double digits year-over-year.\nAll-Flash Arrays grew by over 30% year-over-year, led by Primera.\nThe shift towards more software-rich platforms helped drive Storage operating margins to 15.1%, up 10 basis points year-over-year, offset by ongoing investments in our cloud data services.\nRegarding Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, revenue grew for the third consecutive quarter year-over-year as reported, with both order and revenue growth expected for fiscal year '21.\nIn HPE Financial Services, revenue was flat year-over-year and sequentially.\nWhile our bad debt loss ratio increased slightly to 94 basis points this quarter, it was entirely due to a one-time $11 million reserve charge related to the previously mentioned suspected fraud in APJ by a channel partner.\nExcluding this one-off event, our bad debt loss ratio would have improved to just 61 basis points, in line with pre-pandemic levels.\nCrucially, we are seeing cash collections continue to improve beyond pre-pandemic levels.\nOur operating margin increased to 11.1%, a 300 basis point improvement from the previous year.\nOur return on equity of 18.3% exceeds the 15% plus target established at SAM.\nThe key metrics of our expanding as-a-Service business are shown on Slide 5.\nSince our Analyst Day last October, we've made substantial progress by acquiring over 200 new enterprise GreenLake customers, bringing the total to over 1,100, and increasing our TCV by more than $1 billion to a current lifetime TCV exceeding $5 billion.\nIn Q3 specifically, our ARR reached $705 million, showing a 33% year-over-year increase as reported, while total as-a-Service orders grew by 46% compared to the previous year.\nIt's noteworthy that our ARR mix is becoming increasingly software-focused as we develop our GreenLake Cloud Platform, which is enhancing our margin profile.\nWe plan to provide more information about our software and services mix at our analyst day later this fall, which I believe will emphasize the significant value added by GreenLake.\nOverall, based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I'm very pleased with this business's performance and progress towards achieving our ARR growth target of 30% to 40% CAGR from FY '20 to FY '23.\nSlide 6 illustrates our revenue and earnings per share performance to date, clearly showing the strong recovery from last year and consistent momentum over the past three quarters.\nThe demand environment is continuously improving.\nThrough the operational execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we have increased non-GAAP earnings per share in Q3 by 31% compared to the previous year.\nMoving to Slide 7.\nWe achieved another record non-GAAP gross margin rate in Q3 of 34.7% of revenues, up 40 basis points sequentially and 420 basis points from the previous year.\nThis was achieved through strong pricing discipline and a favorable shift towards high-margin, software-rich businesses such as intelligent edge and next-generation storage offerings.\nWe have also benefited from the new segmentation implemented at the start of fiscal year 2020, which provides us with much better visibility into each business unit and enables improved resource allocation and discipline to drive operating leverage.\nProceeding to Slide 8.\nWe have significantly expanded our non-GAAP operating profit margin from pandemic lows to 9.8%, which is a 190 basis point increase from the prior-year period.\nWe are realizing further productivity benefits and delivering the expected savings from our cost optimization plan, while simultaneously increasing our investment in R&D and field selling costs, which are vital to fuel our long-term innovation engine and revenue growth targets.\nAs previously mentioned, Q3 operating expenses also included one-time charges not included in our guidance, totaling $28 million for a legal settlement and a likely forgery involving a partner.\nExcluding these one-off charges, our operating margin would have been 10.2%.\nMoving to Slide 9.\nWe generated record year-to-date levels of cash flow with $2.9 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.5 billion of free cash flow, an increase of $1.1 billion year over year.\nThis was primarily driven by increased operating profit.\nI'd like to emphasize that this year, our free cash flow seasonality will differ from previous years.\nWe anticipate increased financial services volume, including more than $150 million in Q4 financing for a very large deal that is predominantly GreenLake and will benefit our ARR margins for years to come.\nWe also have further restructuring payments and growing working capital needs as we continue to increase our inventory levels in light of the disruption in the global IT supply chain.\nTurning to Slide 10, let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified balance sheet.\nAs of July 31, the operating company net cash balance turned positive due to our strong free cash flow.\nFurthermore, we made additional progress during the quarter, securitizing over $750 million of financial services-related debt through the ABS market.\nRefinancing higher cost unsecured debt with ABS financing allows us to increase access to financing markets at a lower cost of debt capital, as well as diversify and separate our balance sheet between our operating company and our financial services business.\nIn summary, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensure we have ample liquidity to run our operations, continue investing in our business to drive growth, and return capital to shareholders.\nNow turning to our outlook on Slide 11.\nI'm very pleased to announce that we are once again raising our full-year guidance to reflect the continued momentum in the demand environment and our strong execution.\nThis marks the fourth guidance increase since SAM in October 2020.\nWe now expect to deliver fiscal year '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.88 and $1.96.\nRegarding the supply chain, as indicated last quarter, industrywide tightening somewhat constrained our supply as expected.\nWe continue to take proactive inventory measures where possible.\nOur efforts are reflected in inventory balances that increased $1.3 billion year to date, also indicating the strengthening demand environment and substantial order book we have across the business.\nWe expect the challenging supply chain conditions to persist until at least mid-2022 and have factored these into our revenues, costs, and cash flow outlook.\nFrom a top-line perspective, while we remain cautious given the challenging supply chain environment, we are very pleased with the accelerating Q3 order momentum across all segments of the business.\nSpecifically for Q4 '21, we expect revenue to exceed our normal sequential seasonality from Q3 and are comfortable with current consensus levels.\nFor Q4 '21, we anticipate GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.14 to $0.22 and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44 to $0.52.\nAdditionally, given our record levels of free cash flow year to date and confidence in our raised outlook, I'm very pleased to announce that we are also raising fiscal year '21 free cash flow guidance to $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, a $600 million increase at the midpoint from our original SAM guidance, with the top end of this free cash flow guidance range at the peak levels attained in fiscal year '19.\nAs you may recall, at the end of the first half of fiscal year 2020, we suspended our share buybacks to preserve liquidity in light of the global pandemic disruption.\nAlthough we continue to operate in a challenging supply environment, our order momentum and improved cash flow generation visibility give us confidence to reinstate our share repurchase program.\nWe are targeting up to $250 million of share repurchases in Q4 of fiscal year '21, and we'll update investors on our capital management policy for fiscal year '22 at SAM in October.\nAs a reminder, we always follow a disciplined, return-based capital allocation framework to maximize long-term shareholder value.\nOur top priority remains delivering sustainable profitable growth through both organic and inorganic M&A investments while remaining committed to paying dividends to our shareholders.\nAdditionally, we will consider opportunistic share buybacks when we see a favorable return for doing so.\nTo conclude, I am very proud of the progress we have made year to date in fiscal year '21.\nIt's evident that our edge-to-cloud strategy is resonating with customers and driving improved momentum across all of our businesses.\nOur growth businesses in the Intelligent Edge and HPC/MCS have accelerated top-line performance with record levels of orders.\nOur core business of Compute and Storage is showing momentum with robust orders and improved margins, and our as-a-Service ARR is accelerating.\nAll of this translates to improving revenue momentum, strong profitability growth, and record levels of free cash flow.\nWe look forward to concluding our fiscal year much leaner, better resourced, and positioned to capitalize on the strong demand environment.\nLastly, as Antonio mentioned, we look forward to having you join us for our virtual Securities Analyst Meeting in late October, where we will provide an update on our strategy, business insights, and financial outlook.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Susie Lisa, senior vice president of investor relations at CVS Health, is speaking.\nOur website is broadcasting this call, which will be available for replay for one year.\nCVS Health had a significant year in 2021.\nWe surpassed our financial targets.\nWe made progress on our strategy and delivered increased value to our customers, playing a vital role in the country's COVID-19 response.\nWe concluded a robust 2021 with another strong quarterly performance.\nWe surpassed our adjusted earnings per share expectations for the fourth consecutive quarter, achieving $1.98 in Q4 2021 and $8.40 for the entire year.\nWe're starting 2022 with significant momentum.\nWe're offering personalized, interconnected, and increasingly digital healthcare solutions.\nWe're reaching millions of customers across our businesses and community health locations throughout the United States.\nCVS Health is becoming more integral to people's daily health routines.\nNow, let's discuss our performance.\nIn 2021, CVS Health increased adjusted revenue by 8.8% to $292 billion.\nWe achieved adjusted operating income of $17.3 billion, an 8.1% increase year-over-year.\nWe also boosted adjusted earnings per share by 12%.\nWe generated robust cash flow from operations, totaling nearly $18.3 billion for the year, surpassing our most recent guidance of at least $13.5 billion.\nThis strong performance sets us up well for 2022.\nAt this early point in the year, we're maintaining our full-year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $8.10 to $8.30.\nOur projection accounts for increased COVID testing volume and front store sales in our retail business compared to our investor day forecast, offset by the earlier-than-expected timing of vaccine boosters in Q4 2021.\nShawn will provide more details about our results and guidance soon.\nOur 2021 performance showcases our ability to anticipate, deliver, and surpass consumers' healthcare expectations.\nConsumers are driving significant changes in healthcare, and we continue to engage successfully with individuals in various settings and on their terms, including virtually, at home, and in their local communities.\nCustomers and clients are experiencing the superior value of our integrated health solutions, particularly those addressing the most common, expensive, and complex health conditions, such as diabetes, cancer, and chronic kidney disease.\nLet's look at the segment highlights.\nIn healthcare benefits, we achieved 9.4% adjusted revenue growth for 2021, driven by our performance in government services.\nWe had another strong year of Medicare growth across all product lines.\nTotal Medicare Advantage membership increased by 9.8% year-over-year, adding over 265,000 new members in 2021 and exceeding our initial growth expectations.\nDue to our strategic focus on dual-eligible special needs plans, enrollment nearly doubled in 2021.\nOur full-year medical benefit ratio of 85% aligned with our guidance expectations.\nFor 2021, overall healthcare service utilization was consistent with normalized historical baseline levels.\nLooking ahead to 2022, we had an impressive annual enrollment period in our Medicare business.\nFor the second consecutive year, we grew all Medicare product lines, with growth rates exceeding industry averages in all categories.\nWe increased total Medicare Advantage membership by 11.6% compared to the previous year, reflecting increases of over 15% in individual and 6% in group Medicare Advantage year-over-year.\nWe also led the industry in absolute Medicare PDP net membership growth, adding nearly 295,000 net new members, while the overall PDP market continues to decline.\nWe had a solid 2022 selling season in our national accounts commercial business.\nWe expect to grow membership in the low single digits for the full year and maintained strong client retention of 96%.\nOur success is driven by our competitive cost structure, integrated benefit designs combining medical and pharmacy, and products and services utilizing CVS Health capabilities, such as Transform Care Diabetes and Virtual Primary Care programs.\nMembership enrollment was lower than expected in the eight ACA individual exchanges we entered this year.\nWe continue to build this business gradually, with select geographic expansion, focused price discipline, and the appeal of co-branded Aetna CVS Health offerings.\nConsistent with our prior guidance, we don't expect this offering to contribute significantly to our financial results in 2022.\nOverall, our deep understanding of consumer needs, innovative product portfolio, and service excellence will drive growth in our healthcare benefits segment.\nOur comprehensive range of products and benefit designs addressing consumers' whole health needs remains a key differentiator and fueled a strong selling season.\nFor 2022, we forecast 7% to 9% revenue growth and 15% to 17% adjusted operating income growth.\nIn pharmacy services, we delivered 7.8% revenue and 20.6% adjusted operating income growth in 2021.\nWe continue to be a consultative partner to our clients and members.\nWe're delivering industry-leading cost trends and savings, service excellence, a broad product portfolio, and a commitment to transparency.\nWe consistently create value for our customers and clients with our better-than-market drug trend.\nWe continue to enhance our utilization programs to ensure access to the most clinically appropriate therapeutics.\nFor 2022, we achieved a client retention rate of over 98% and drove $8.8 billion of net new business revenue.\nWe are a leader in specialty pharmacy, delivering revenue growth of 12.3% for the fourth quarter and 9.3% for the full year versus prior period.\nOur specialty pharmacy programs drive value in the marketplace and differentiate us as we pair programs with digital capabilities to deliver a convenient and connected experience.\nFor pharmacy services in 2022, we expect 6% to 8% revenue growth and 7% to 9% adjusted operating income growth, as we create long-term value for our clients and members.\nOur retail segment plays a crucial role as a community health destination for millions of Americans.\nThis division surpassed both industry standards and our projections in 2021\nOur revenue grew by 9.8% compared to the previous year, reaching just over $100 billion, marking a significant milestone for this CVS Health division\nWe achieved an exceptional 24% growth in adjusted operating income during 2021\nBoth pharmacy sales and the number of prescriptions filled increased by approximately 9% compared to the previous year\nThis growth was primarily driven by customers who visited CVS Health for COVID-19 vaccinations\nThroughout 2021, CVS Health conducted over 32 million COVID-19 tests and administered more than 59 million vaccines\nMore than 35% of the COVID-19 vaccines administered in 2021 were given during the fourth quarter\nOur efforts to test and vaccinate Americans for COVID demonstrate the strong relationships we're building with consumers, leading to new customers seeking various health services at CVS Health\nFront store sales showed robust growth throughout 2021, increasing by 8.4% compared to the previous year\nThese sales were driven by consumer demand for over-the-counter COVID-19 tests, as well as cough and cold remedies, beauty products, and personal care items\nWe sold more than 22 million OTC COVID-19 tests, with about 70% of sales occurring in the fourth quarter\nWe are advancing our plan to optimize our retail portfolio by transforming our stores into three formats: primary care clinics, enhanced health hubs, and traditional CVS pharmacy locations\nWe are implementing our strategy to reduce store density based on consumer health and purchasing needs, omnichannel preferences, and demographic shifts in the United States\nFor 2022, as I mentioned earlier, considering the earnings outperformance and early administration of vaccine boosters in 2021, we are maintaining our 2022 guidance\nThis guidance now suggests retail revenue will be plus or minus 1% compared to the previous year, with a low 20% decrease in adjusted operating income growth\nShawn will provide more detailed information\nOur digital strategy aims to deliver an exceptional experience for consumers by creating a more integrated and seamless health journey\nWe are making progress in establishing a new standard for digital healthcare for consumers\nCVS.com is one of the leading health websites, with over 2 billion visits in 2021, representing an increase of nearly 55% compared to the previous year\nOur digital capabilities for health-related interactions such as COVID testing and vaccines, prescription services, and sales of health and wellness products have significantly increased consumer engagement across all CVS Health businesses\nWe now serve 40 million customers digitally, an increase of approximately 10% in just the last six months\nIn 2021, we introduced several new digital health services powered by advanced analytics to personalize the user experience\nWe simplified the process of joining our CarePass program, reaching 5.6 million subscribers in the quarter, an increase of more than 40% compared to the previous year\nWe integrated CarePass for our Aetna Commercial members and are pleased with the adoption rate we're observing\nWe also streamlined the CarePass enrollment process for all consumers, which is driving further growth in subscribers\nFor our HealthHUB and MinuteClinic patients, we simplified and digitized the check-in process\nOur self-service digital tool allows individuals to complete traditional paperwork before their appointment\nNearly 80% of patients are already using this feature\nAt our investor day, we pledged to provide a superior healthcare experience for consumers that will improve health outcomes, reduce costs, and expand access to care\nWe are taking several steps to realize our vision for healthcare\nWe're enhancing our care delivery capabilities, optimizing our retail portfolio, and further diversifying the health products and services we offer\nWe're driving this evolution through both internal initiatives and by seeking to execute capability-focused M&A for complementary health services\nWe will connect with consumers in more locations and in more ways, on their terms, using a digital-first, technology-forward approach, as well as an enhanced omnichannel health experience\nThese strategic moves will accelerate the growth of our core businesses\nIn all our efforts, we will prioritize the consumer's needs\nWe remain committed to delivering on our sustainability promises for our shareholders, customers, and communities\nWe recently launched CVS Health Zones, aimed at promoting health equity and addressing social determinants of health in high-risk communities\nWe are partnering with trusted national and local organizations to tackle the six key social determinants of health through local investments\nOur goal is to provide communities with the resources needed to address gaps in care for specific health conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease\nHealth Zones is now active in five locations, with additional markets planned for 2022\nWe remain committed to environmental sustainability and have pledged to reduce our overall impact by cutting greenhouse gas emissions across our operations and supply chain, and decreasing resource consumption, particularly paper and plastic\nIn December, CVS Health was included in the 2021 S&P Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index for the ninth consecutive year and the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the third consecutive year\nOur financial performance, execution, portfolio of assets, and unique strategy all create strong momentum for 2022 and a clear path to achieve low double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth over time\nI'd also like to acknowledge the ongoing contributions of our colleagues who have played a crucial role in helping our nation overcome the pandemic\nI am proud of our past and current efforts to make a difference\nOur fourth quarter results demonstrate the continued strong performance delivered in the first three quarters of the year, as we once again exceeded our expectations for revenue, cash flow, and adjusted earnings per share\nWe maintained our focus on growth, operational execution, and supporting the communities we serve as the effects of the pandemic continue\nLooking at the enterprise as a whole\nTotal fourth quarter adjusted revenues of 76.6 billion increased by 10.6% compared to the previous year\nWe reported adjusted operating income of 4.1 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.98, representing increases of 40.8% and 52.3% compared to the previous year, respectively\nFor the full year 2021, we reported total adjusted revenues of 292.1 billion, an increase of 8.8% compared to the previous year, reflecting strong growth across all business segments\nWe delivered adjusted operating income of 17.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $8.40, up approximately 8.1% and 12% year over year, respectively\nWe generated significant cash flow from operations of nearly 18.3 billion\nThis marks a record year of cash flow from operations for CVS Health and reflects the strength of our financial results, accelerated collections, and focused improvements in our working capital position\nFocusing on the healthcare benefits division.\nFourth quarter adjusted revenue grew 10.1% year-over-year to $20.7 billion, primarily due to increased membership in government services and reduced COVID-19 investments, slightly counterbalanced by the health insurer fee repeal.\nAdjusted operating income surged by over 230% year-over-year to $510 million, mainly because of lower COVID-19 investments and improved core performance, partially offset by higher COVID-related medical expenses compared to the previous year.\nThe adjusted medical benefit ratio improved by 130 basis points year-over-year to 87%, primarily due to reduced COVID-19 investments, partially counteracted by the health insurer fee repeal.\nThe omicron variant led to increased COVID testing and treatment costs in Q4, but this was mostly balanced out by lower non-COVID expenses, especially in Medicare and Medicaid.\nDays claims payable at quarter-end was 49, lower than Q3 as anticipated, aligning with typical seasonal patterns and historical levels.\nWe remain assured of our reserve adequacy.\nIn the pharmacy services division, Q4 revenues increased by 8.2% year-over-year to $39.3 billion, driven by higher pharmacy claims, specialty pharmacy growth, and brand inflation, partially offset by ongoing client price improvements.\nTotal pharmacy membership grew by about 400,000 lives sequentially, indicating sustained growth in government programs.\nTotal pharmacy claims processed rose by 8.2% compared to the previous year.\nRoughly half of this growth came from new business in 2021, with COVID-19 vaccinations and new therapy prescriptions also contributing to the year-over-year increase.\nAdjusted operating income grew 16.8% year-over-year to $1.8 billion, driven by improved purchasing economics from our group purchasing organization's products and services, and specialty pharmacy growth.\nOur retail long-term care segment delivered outstanding revenue and adjusted operating income growth compared to the previous year, surpassing our expectations.\nQ4 revenue increased by 12.7% year-over-year to $27.1 billion, a $3 billion increase.\nThis increase had two main components: about 60% came from COVID-19 vaccine administration and testing, front store sales including over-the-counter COVID test kits and related products, and strong COVID-related prescription volume. The remaining 40% was due to sustained pharmacy growth and strong front store sales trends, partially offset by ongoing pharmacy reimbursement pressure.\nThis robust revenue growth resulted in adjusted operating income of $2.5 billion.\nThis quarterly result was 38% higher than the previous year and significantly exceeded our projections.\nThe increase in adjusted operating income was driven by COVID-19 vaccine administration, strong pharmacy and front store sales, and a $106 million antitrust legal settlement gain, partially offset by ongoing but stable reimbursement pressure and business investments, including minimum wage increases and store improvements.\nThe quarter's improved performance versus our expectations had two main components: about 75% came from vaccines, mainly third-dose boosters originally expected in Q1 2022, and the remaining 25% from increased demand for over-the-counter and diagnostic COVID-19 testing, along with stronger underlying front store sales.\nRegarding cash flow and the balance sheet, our liquidity and capital position remained strong at the end of Q4, with full-year cash flow from operations of nearly $18.3 billion and over $3.8 billion in nonrestricted cash.\nWe paid down $2.3 billion in long-term debt in Q4 through a proactive liability management transaction, bringing the total long-term debt repaid since the Aetna acquisition to $21 billion net.\nWe also returned over $2.6 billion to shareholders through quarterly dividends in 2021.\nOur consistent outperformance in 2021 provides solid momentum for 2022, despite ongoing COVID-related uncertainties such as new variants, vaccine and testing protocols, and government testing initiatives.\nWe are maintaining our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $8.10 to $8.30.\nThis represents 2% to 5% growth compared to our revised 2021 adjusted earnings per share baseline of $7.92.\nWhen considering the adjusted earnings per share baseline and year-over-year growth, keep in mind that our 2021 baseline of $7.92 excludes items we don't forecast, includes the annualized impact of increased minimum wage, and now includes a net favorable COVID-19 component of approximately $0.30 per share.\nCVS Health continues to lead the nation's COVID-19 pandemic response, demonstrating the strength of our integrated business model, consumer engagement, and local community health destinations.\nWhile our Retail segment guidance remains unchanged, we expect COVID-19 testing volumes to remain higher than anticipated at investor day, offset by a reduced outlook on vaccines.\nIn 2022, we anticipate vaccine volumes to decrease by 70% to 80% and in-store diagnostic testing volumes to decline by 40% to 50% compared to 2021. We expect modest full-year volume growth for over-the-counter test kits versus 2021.\nOur vaccine outlook doesn't include any impact from a potential fourth COVID-19 booster, and we expect the contribution of COVID-19 vaccines to be more concentrated in the first half of the year.\nCOVID-19 remains a challenging aspect of our guidance due to factors such as potential surges, new testing or vaccine protocols, legislative changes, and OTC test kit dynamics.\nWe expect 2022 interest expense to be approximately $2.3 billion.\nWe are buying back shares to offset dilution, expecting diluted share count to remain roughly flat compared to 2021.\nWe anticipate an effective income tax rate of about 25.6%, consistent with 2021.\nWe expect continued strong cash flow from operations in 2022, updating our guidance range to $12 billion to $13 billion.\nCapital expenditures are projected to be between $2.8 billion and $3 billion, focusing on technology and digital enhancements to improve consumer experience and community locations.\nWe remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings while having flexibility for strategic M&A.\nIn conclusion, CVS Health's strong 2021 performance is expected to continue into 2022 as we execute our strategy.\nWe have established our leadership in healthcare delivery as a trusted partner to consumers and communities.\nWe will continue to drive improvements that reduce care costs, enhance access, build engagement and convenience, ultimately helping people lead healthier lives.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Certain risks and uncertainties, as disclosed in our SEC filings, may affect our outcomes.\nWe will refer to non-GAAP financial metrics during our discussion today.\nOur company experienced another exceptional quarter, marking our fifth consecutive quarter of outstanding performance since reopening our venues last spring. This continued strong showing is a direct consequence of the fundamental changes we implemented in our operational approach last year.\nAfter reopening, we intensified our efforts to attract our most loyal customers.\nWe optimized our cost structure and adopted a more efficient business approach that impacted all aspects of our operations.\nOur record-breaking third quarter performance and consistent results over the past five quarters are attributed to our transformed business model and disciplined operational approach.\nThese remarkable results have significantly improved our free cash flow and strengthened our financial position, with our leverage decreasing to 2.5 times by the end of the third quarter.\nDue to our robust financial standing and growth prospects, our Board of Directors has approved a $300 million share repurchase program, allowing us to return a portion of our substantial free cash flow to shareholders.\nLet's examine the operational performance that made this possible.\nFor the second consecutive quarter, revenues surpassed both 2019 and 2020 levels, establishing a new third-quarter record. Strong flow-through resulted in an adjusted EBITDAR exceeding $340 million, also a third-quarter record.\nOur quarterly EBITDAR was 42% higher than the third quarter of 2020 and 60% higher than the same period in 2019, with company-wide operating margins surpassing 40% for the second straight quarter.\nOur third-quarter margin increased by nearly 400 basis points compared to last year's record and is up more than 1,400 basis points from 2019.\nEvery segment of our business contributed to this exceptional performance, as we set new third-quarter EBITDAR records in all three of our operating segments.\nIn our Las Vegas Locals segment, revenues grew 35% compared to last year, and EBITDAR increased by almost 60%. Operating margins exceeded 54% and have been at or above 50% every quarter this year.\nDowntown Las Vegas posted a record third-quarter EBITDAR of $13.2 million with margins of 31%. This represents a substantial improvement from the EBITDAR loss reported a year ago and is up double digits compared to our record third quarter 2019 results.\nIn our Midwest and South segment, we set new third-quarter records for both revenues and EBITDAR, with EBITDAR growing 22% over the prior year and 42% from 2019.\nThis strong performance was widespread, with 11 of our 17 regional properties setting new EBITDAR records for the third quarter.\nAcross the country, of the 26 properties that were open for the entire quarter, 21 grew EBITDAR by double digits compared to last year, with 18 setting new third-quarter EBITDAR records.\nAs mentioned earlier, the record levels of revenues, EBITDAR, and margins we have produced throughout 2021 result from deliberate actions taken since reopening last year, including focusing on the right customers, transforming our operating model, and implementing new capabilities and refinements throughout our business. We continue to implement initiatives and technologies to enhance customer convenience, build loyalty, streamline processes, and reinforce our operating efficiency.\nAn example of this is our BoydPay cashless technology, now available at 11 properties in four states. While initially focused on our slot product, we are rapidly expanding BoydPay's capabilities to other areas, both gaming and non-gaming.\nIn the coming weeks, we will extend BoydPay to most of our restaurants in Las Vegas. Additionally, we recently launched a field trial for BoydPay at table games in Nevada, with Pennsylvania soon to follow.\nOur aim is to create a tool that simplifies wagering and payment for non-gaming amenities directly from our guests' smartphones. We're making excellent progress toward this goal and expect BoydPay to be available at every Boyd Gaming property next year, pending regulatory approvals.\nWe're also utilizing technology to generate new revenue opportunities and enhance the guest experience in other ways. For instance, in Nevada, we recently relaunched Boyd Sports, offering an unparalleled selection of betting opportunities through the most comprehensive wagering menu in the state.\nWe're pleased with the customer response so far, seeing strong increases in activity from both new and reactivated guests.\nWe have additional organic growth opportunities available across our operations, beyond these new initiatives.\nMany of our hotels nationwide have been operating below capacity since reopening due to labor shortages.\nConsequently, we've been unable to accommodate numerous rated customers with established gaming histories.\nAs the job market stabilizes, we'll be able to make more hotel rooms available, driving gaming revenue growth from these customer segments.\nIn Downtown Las Vegas, we expect continued growth as city tourism recovers and Hawaiian visitation improves, along with opportunities for future growth in mid-week business and meeting and convention business.\nWe anticipate further recovery in visitation across our portfolio as restrictions are lifted, COVID numbers improve, and travel resumes.\nIn addition to organic growth opportunities, we are well-positioned for further gains in the digital space.\nWe consider online gaming, particularly online casinos, as a strategic growth opportunity for our company.\nWith gaming operations in 10 states and a strong player loyalty program, we have the foundation to create a robust digital complement to our land-based casino operations.\nOur iGaming operations have started well in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey, where our Stardust-branded online casinos have shown strong results since launching in April.\nExpanding our iGaming operations is a strategic priority, and we plan to further develop our online casino capabilities and geographic presence over time.\nIn sports betting, our partnership with FanDuel continues to grow, with our current focus on Louisiana where we're preparing to launch sports betting at our five properties by year-end, pending regulatory approval.\nOnce live, this will extend our partnership with FanDuel to six of our nine regional states.\nWe expect our digital operations, including sports, casino, and social casino, to generate over $20 million in EBITDAR this calendar year.\nDigital is currently a profitable business for us and will become an increasingly important part of our overall strategy in the coming years, generating additional revenue and EBITDAR, expanding our customer base, and building loyalty among our guests by providing another engagement opportunity.\nWe continue to benefit as a 5% equity partner in FanDuel's accelerating expansion across the country and their position as a leading online sports and casino operator.\nSince our last call, FanDuel launched new sports betting operations in Arizona and Connecticut, and expects to go live in Maryland, Washington State, and Wyoming by year-end.\nWith sports betting operations in 15 states by year-end, FanDuel is a clear leader in digital gaming expansion, and we are participating in its success as both an equity owner and partner.\nWhile the digital opportunity is substantial, we also have strategic opportunities to expand our traditional gaming operations.\nConstruction on the Wilton Rancheria tribe's Sky River Casino in Northern California is progressing, with steel structures topped off last month and rapid advancement in both exterior and interior construction.\nThe project remains on schedule and within budget, with Sky River set to open early in the fourth quarter of next year.\nIn Louisiana, we continue to advance development plans for a new land-based facility at Treasure Chest Casino, featuring expanded gaming space and significantly upgraded non-gaming amenities.\nTreasure Chest has been a strong performer for years, and this project will allow us to further enhance the already successful property.\nSince releasing our first ESG report earlier this year, we've assembled teams of corporate and property executives to focus on several strategic ESG initiatives, including reducing water and energy consumption, lowering our carbon footprint, encouraging employee volunteerism and workplace giving, enhancing workforce diversity, and refining our responsible gaming efforts.\nWe look forward to providing an update on our progress in next year's ESG report.\nWe continue to support our communities during times of need, as demonstrated after Hurricane Ida struck South Louisiana in late August.\nTo assist South Louisiana communities with recovery efforts, Boyd Gaming made a significant contribution to our partners at Second Harvest Food Bank, helping them provide essential food and water to thousands of local residents immediately after the storm.\nWhile our properties were closed due to the storm, we continued to provide full compensation and benefits to our Treasure Chest and Amelia Belle employees.\nWe provided immediate financial assistance to all affected employees and are offering additional support through our Team Member Crisis Fund as needed.\nBeing a responsible corporate citizen and supporting our communities have always been fundamental to our company's values. We were proud to maintain this commitment after Hurricane Ida and will continue to do so as a key part of our ESG philosophy.\nFollowing our fifth consecutive strong quarterly performance, we are very optimistic about our future and our ability to expand our operations.\nOur revised operational model and targeted customer focus are yielding exceptional outcomes.\nIn just nine months, our company-wide EBITDAR has surpassed $1 billion, with margins significantly higher than pre-closure levels.\nWe believe this level of performance can be maintained and that we will retain much of the margin improvements achieved over the past 18 months.\nOur free cash flow has more than doubled and our financial position is stronger than ever, allowing our Board to approve a new share buyback program. We also have opportunities for additional growth on the horizon.\nAs the pandemic subsides, we expect more visitors to return to our establishments.\nWith the normalization of the job market, we'll be able to reopen more hotel rooms, increasing our capacity to accommodate profitable guests. We'll also leverage our nationwide presence, extensive customer database, and FanDuel partnership to further expand our digital operations.\nWe are in a strong position for future success.\nWhile our recent achievements are a result of our revised operational strategy, they are also attributable to the entire Boyd Gaming team's efforts.\nOur employees are effectively implementing the strategy that is producing these outstanding results.\nI cannot overstate their dedication and hard work over the past 15 months in dealing with the COVID pandemic and an uncertain environment.\nIt is a privilege to lead this team, and we anticipate continued growth and success in the coming months and years.\nThe results for the third quarter and year-to-date have been exceptional.\nOur performance reflects a transformed operational approach implemented after reopening our properties in the third quarter of last year, focusing on building loyalty and efficiently serving our core customers.\nThis operational philosophy fundamentally changed how we conduct our business, including reassessing our marketing approach and scrutinizing every aspect of our operations.\nAs evidenced by our results, we have consistently executed this strategy for five quarters, generating revenues that now exceed 2019 levels with significantly higher EBITDAR across our business.\nAs Keith mentioned, we are optimistic about our future, as we have multiple avenues for continued growth and confidence that we will maintain higher margin levels.\nCurrently, we are in a stronger financial position than ever before in our history.\nOur total EBITDAR over the past 12 months exceeds $1.2 billion, and our leverage at the end of the third quarter was 2.75 times, expected to decrease further by year-end.\nDue to our strong operational performance, we are now generating substantial free cash flow, approaching $700 million over the past 12 months.\nTo demonstrate our confidence in the company's future, our Board authorized a $300 million share repurchase program.\nThis amount is in addition to the $61 million remaining from a previous approval.\nGiven our substantial and growing free cash flow, we will continue to invest in opportunities that generate high returns for our company.\nThese growth opportunities will be balanced with returning capital to shareholders and maintaining current leverage levels over the long term.\nWe have concluded our remarks and are now ready to address any questions.\nSummary: ",

(CFO), and Smadar Lavi (VP of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations)\nActual results in the future may vary significantly from projections due to various risks and uncertainties\nRefer to the Risk Factors section in Ormat Technologies' annual and quarterly SEC filings for details on potential risks and uncertainties\nThe company will present non-GAAP financial metrics like adjusted EBITDA during the call\nNon-GAAP measures should not be viewed in isolation from GAAP financial statements as they are calculated differently\nDoron, you may begin the call\nOrmat had a successful quarter\nWe made progress on expanding our Electricity and Energy Storage segments through organic growth and acquisitions this quarter\nWe expanded the McGinness Complex in Nevada beyond initial plans and ramped up generation at the Puna plant in Hawaii\nWe also acquired two operating power plants and two other assets to support future growth\nIn Energy Storage, we continued business development efforts and started construction on two new storage projects\nOur progress reinforces our goal of growing our geothermal, energy storage and solar portfolio to over 1.5 gigawatts by 2023\nWe see 2021 as a foundation-building year to accelerate future growth\nOur increased backlog, sales pipeline, and portfolio growth in Electricity and Energy Storage support our target of over $500 million annual adjusted EBITDA by late 2022\nLet's review the Q2 financial results on Slide 5\nTotal Q2 revenue was $146.4 million, down 16% year-over-year, mainly due to lower Product segment backlog\nQ2 gross profit was $52 million with a 35.4% margin, down 200 basis points year-over-year due to Electricity segment issues\nTemporary problems at Olkaria, Steamboat and Brawley complexes reduced Electricity gross profit by about $8 million\nYear-to-date gross margin was 40.1%, similar to last year\nNet income attributable to shareholders was $13 million or $0.23 per share, versus $23 million or $0.45 per share last year\nThe Q2 effective tax rate was 22.6%, lower than 33% last year due to changes in valuation allowances\nWe expect a full-year 2021 effective tax rate of about 33% barring one-time impacts\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased 13.6% to $84.5 million, impacted by lower gross profit and higher legal costs in G&A\nOn Slide 6, Electricity segment revenue rose 4% to $134 million from new capacity at Steamboat, McGinness Hill and Puna\nSteamboat had a brief mechanical issue and Brawley had an injection well leak that reduced generation\nProduct segment revenue fell 83% to $7.4 million, 5% of total revenue, due to lower backlog\nEnergy Storage revenue grew 124% to $5.6 million, 4% of total revenue, driven by the Pomona acquisition and new Vallecito facility\nOn Slide 7, Electricity gross margin fell to 37.4% due to repair costs and lack of insurance recovery compared to last year\nProduct gross margin was 20.1% versus 20.6% last year\nEnergy Storage had positive gross margin versus negative last year, mainly from the Pomona acquisition\nOn Slide 8, adjusted EBITDA fell 40% to $84.5 million from lower gross profit and higher legal costs\nElectricity provided 94% of adjusted EBITDA, Products 4%, and Storage 2%\nAdjusted EBITDA reconciliation is in the appendix\nOn Slide 9, net debt was $1.40 billion as of June 30, 2021\nAs of June 30, the company's cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaled approximately $330 million, down from $537 million at the end of the previous year\nThe company also held $46 million in marketable securities\nThe ninth slide outlines how funds were used over six months, demonstrating the company's capacity to reinvest, manage debt, and distribute dividends to shareholders\nThese actions were financed through operational cash flow and the company's robust liquidity\nAs of June 30, 2021, the company's long-term debt stood at $1.4 billion, excluding deferred financing costs, with the repayment schedule detailed in Slide 30 of the appendix\nThe debt carried an average interest rate of 4.9%\nIn July, the company secured two new corporate loans totaling approximately $175 million, including $50 million in green bonds from HSBC bank\nThese funds were utilized to acquire Terra-Gen\nOn August 4, 2021, the company's Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, to be paid on September 1, 2021, to shareholders of record as of August 18, 2021\nThe company anticipates maintaining the same dividend amount for the following quarter\nThis concludes the financial summary\nMoving to Slide 12, we'll examine our operational portfolio\nCompared to the previous year, our power plants increased electricity generation by about 2.4%\nThe second quarter saw ongoing contributions from Steamboat, which began operations in mid-2020, along with additional output from McGinness Hill for roughly one month and some generation from Puna, which is operating at reduced capacity\nThese gains were partially offset by continued curtailment and poor performance at the Olkaria power plant, as well as other operational issues in the US, which I'll elaborate on shortly\nWe've recently completed the expansion of our McGinness Hill facility, which now provides electricity for approximately 6,000 homes and reduces CO2 emissions by about 63,000 tons, showcasing the geothermal industry's highest efficiency and safety standards\nWith the newly acquired assets, our electricity portfolio has grown to one gigawatt, an increase of 83 megawatts in the second quarter\nAs shown on Slide 13, Puna resumed operations in November 2020\nWe've increased Puna's output to approximately 28 megawatts following turbine repairs, up from 20 megawatts reported in our previous quarter\nWe anticipate reaching 30 megawatts by year-end\nWe're continuing discussions with HELCO and the PUC regarding a new PPA, while still selling electricity under our existing agreement, which remains in effect until the end of 2027\nMoving to Slide 14, I'll address some challenges we faced this quarter in several of our operational assets\nStarting with the known issue in Kenya, our revenue from the Olkaria complex decreased year-over-year due to ongoing curtailment and reduced resource performance\nThese factors have led to a decrease in generating capacity of about 25 megawatts\nThis capacity reduction lowered our quarterly gross margin by approximately $2.7 million\nWe're working to restore the complex's generating capacity through our ongoing drilling campaign in Kenya and are optimistic about increasing production by year-end\nWe expect a similar quarterly revenue reduction until full capacity is restored\nWe also encountered a mechanical failure at our Steamboat Complex, resulting in revenue loss and expenses that reduced gross margin by about $2 million\nThe Steamboat complex has now returned to full operation\nAt the Brawley Complex, a leak in an injection well and a pump failure in a production well reduced generating capacity to three megawatts\nWe're working to restore full production at Brawley\nThe second half of 2021 will be affected by the underperformance of the Olkaria and Brawley power plants, and we've adjusted our annual guidance accordingly\nTurning to Slide 15, we finalized the acquisition of Terra-Gen assets in July\nThis acquisition added approximately 67.5 megawatts of net generating capacity to our portfolio\nWe also acquired a greenfield development asset near Dixie Valley with significant resource potential and an underutilized transmission line capable of carrying 300-400 megawatts of 230-kilowatt electricity, connecting Dixie Valley to California\nWith this acquisition, we now operate 10 plants in Nevada, generating a total of 443 megawatts\nThe proximity of these plants to population centers in Nevada and California is significant\nCalifornia continues to lead in promoting renewable energy adoption, with existing supportive mandates and requirements, and more under consideration\nCalifornia utility companies are increasingly seeking cost-effective and dependable renewable energy sources.\nThe acquired transmission lines became more crucial due to this trend.\nLet's examine Slide 16 for an update on our order backlog.\nAlthough our product segment's performance is still affected by the reduced backlog at the year's start, we're beginning to observe promising indications of improvement.\nWe've noticed clear signs of progress in this business, including an increase in our backlog, which reinforces our belief that this is a temporary situation.\nAs of August 4, 2021, our product segment backlog grew by 59%, increasing $22 million to reach $59 million, compared to $37 million in early May this year.\nWe secured several contracts during the quarter, including one with Star Energy Geothermal to provide products for a new 14-megawatt Salak geothermal power plant in Indonesia, and another to supply equipment for a project in Japan.\nDespite recent improvements in this segment, we expect continued weakness in our product revenue throughout 2021 and have modified our annual guidance accordingly.\nThe weakness in the product segment is partially offset by steady improvement in our Energy Storage segment.\nAs mentioned earlier and discussed on Slide 17, this business is becoming an increasingly significant part of our overall results.\nThis quarter, our projects on both the East Coast and in Texas experienced higher revenues due to increased market prices.\nThe Storage Segment once again generated positive EBITDA, and we initiated construction on two new projects in Ohio and California.\nLet's move to Slide 18.\nAs previously mentioned, California is implementing supportive mandates and experiencing growing demand for affordable and reliable renewable energy.\nA recent example is the CTC ruling requiring electrical load service entities (LLCs) to procure 11.5 gigawatts of new clean electricity by 2026.\nOne gigawatt of this procurement must provide thermal power with an 80% capacity factor, produce zero onsite emissions, and be weather-independent.\nGeothermal energy is particularly well-suited to meet these requirements, with its 95% capacity factor and flexible thermal generation.\nGeothermal energy not only complements intermittent resources effectively but also serves as a natural replacement for baseload fossil fuels and nuclear generation.\nCalifornia's efforts to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045 through extensive deployment of renewable energy and energy storage resources have enabled us to secure new geothermal contracts, such as the one we signed this quarter with CPA for the 14-megawatt Heber South geothermal power plant in Imperial Valley, California.\nWe also issued our first request for the 26-megawatt Heber 2 and are actively seeking opportunities for our storage platform.\nLet's examine Slides 20 and 21.\nAs we've communicated, 2021 will be a significant growth year, primarily focused on geothermal projects.\nThis expansion supports our robust growth plans, which are expected to increase our total portfolio by nearly 50% by the end of 2023.\nOur medium-term goal for the electricity segment is to add 240-250 megawatts by year-end 2023, on top of the 80 megawatts added since the beginning of 2021.\nIn our rapidly expanding energy storage portfolio, we plan to accelerate growth and increase our portfolio by 200-300 megawatts by year-end 2022.\nAchieving these growth targets is expected to help us reach an annual run rate of over $500 million in adjusted EBITDA toward the end of 2022, which we anticipate will continue to grow as we proceed with our plans in 2023 and beyond.\nSlide 22 showcases 13 ongoing projects that make up the majority of our 2023 growth objectives.\nAlthough we're experiencing some delays in the permitting process, we remain on track to meet our growth target for the end of 2023.\nLet's look at Slides 23 and 24, which focus on the second layer of our growth coming from the energy storage segment.\nSlide 23 illustrates the energy storage facilities we've announced or begun constructing.\nWe've initiated construction on two new projects: Boeing grant and Pomona.\nThe other projects included in our growth plan are at various stages of development, and their launch will require site control and execution of an interconnection agreement, all subject to economic justification.\nAs shown on Slide 24, our energy storage pipeline extends to over two gigawatts and includes 36 potential projects, primarily in Texas, New Jersey, and California.\nMoving to Slide 25, the significant growth in both our electricity and storage segments will necessitate substantial capital investment over the next couple of years.\nTo fund this growth, we have over $750 million in cash and available lines of credit.\nOur total expected capital expenditure for the remainder of 2021 is approximately $280 million, as detailed on Slide 31 in the appendix.\nOverall, Ormat is well-positioned with excellent liquidity and ample access to additional capital to fund future initiatives.\nWe anticipate total revenues between $650 million and $685 million, with Electricity segment revenues between $585 million and $595 million.\nWe expect Product segment revenues between $40 million and $60 million.\nEnergy storage revenue guidance is projected to be between $25 million and $30 million.\nWe anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be between $400 million and $410 million.\nWe expect annual adjusted EBITDA attributable to minority interest to be approximately $31 million.\nAs noted in the previous quarter, adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2021 includes insurance proceeds of approximately $10 million.\nOperator, please proceed.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The quarterly outcomes continue to showcase the distinct advantages of Western Alliance's National Commercial Business Strategy, positioning it as a leading growth-oriented commercial bank capable of consistently delivering superior balance sheet and earnings growth with excellent asset quality throughout economic cycles.\nThis period, the bank achieved record-breaking net revenues, pre-provision net revenue, and earnings per share, while improving net interest margin, attaining the highest return on tangible common equity in its history, and restoring asset quality to pre-COVID levels.\nIn the second quarter, Western Alliance generated total net revenues of $506.5 million, net income before merger and restructuring charges of $236.5 million, and adjusted earnings per share of $2.29, representing a 20.5% increase from the previous quarter.\nThese results were enhanced by a $14.5 million reversal of credit loss provision, reflecting our outstanding asset quality performance.\nRobust balance sheet growth persisted, with loans increasing by $2 billion, excluding PPP loans, or 29% on an annualized basis compared to the previous quarter, and deposits rising by $3.5 billion or 37%.\nOur deposit and loan pipelines are highly active, with total assets now reaching $49.1 billion.\nNet interest income amounted to $370.5 million, an increase of $53.2 million or 16.8% for the quarter, as substantial balance sheet growth, rising net interest margin, and deployment of excess liquidity significantly boosted earnings.\nSignificant loan growth resulted in a 5.5% or $1.5 billion increase in average loan balances compared to the previous quarter.\nFurthermore, following the completion of the AmeriHome acquisition on April 7, we incorporated $4.5 billion in held-for-sale mortgages, primarily GSE-qualified, representing 12.4% of our average interest-earning assets with a yield of approximately 3.21%, as an alternative to cash or mortgage-backed securities.\nOptimizing our mix of interest-earning assets helped expand the net interest margin from 3.37% to 3.51% in the second quarter.\nFee income reached a record $136 million, accounting for 27% of total revenue, as we began integrating and optimizing AmeriHome's mortgage banking activities throughout Western Alliance.\nMortgage banking-related income totaled $111.2 million in the second quarter, demonstrating our ability to adjust market share as gain-on-sale margins fluctuate to maintain earnings.\nIt's worth emphasizing that AmeriHome's business model attracted us primarily due to its low-cost and flexible mortgage production and servicing ecosystem.\nTheir model leverages complementary correspondent and consumer direct channels to support and enhance value across Western Alliance's commercial businesses while minimizing risk.\nBusiness-to-business correspondent mortgage lenders possess multiple business levers and the flexibility to sustain earnings throughout interest rate and economic cycles.\nDespite evolving mortgage sector fundamentals, AmeriHome continues to meet our expectations and contributed $0.39 to earnings per share in Q2.\nWe have adjusted AmeriHome's balance sheet to align with Western Alliance's capital levels, maintaining a servicing portfolio of $57.1 billion in unpaid balances.\nWe have increased the number of correspondent sellers by 57 to 819 and capitalized on market dislocations to create value.\nIn the second quarter, following the April transaction closure, AmeriHome generated $20.7 billion in loan production, 25% above levels for the same period a year ago and only 3.6% lower than Q1, with 47% coming from traditional home purchases.\nThe gain-on-sale margin was 64 basis points for the quarter, consistent with 2019's 63 basis points.\nGiven the flexibility of AmeriHome's business model, we maintain our full-year guidance of $1.41.\nAsset quality continued to improve this quarter as the economic recovery broadened.\nTotal classified assets decreased by $43 million in Q2 to 49 basis points of total assets, which is lower than Q1 2020 levels both relatively and in absolute dollar amount, just as the pandemic's impact was beginning to be felt.\nFor the quarter, net loan charge-offs were zero.\nWestern Alliance stands as one of the most profitable banks in the industry, with a return on average assets and a record return on average tangible common equity of 1.86% and 28.1% respectively, which will continue to support capital accumulation to maintain strong capital levels.\nTangible book value per share slightly decreased to $32.86 from $33.2 as goodwill and intangibles doubled to $611 million in Q2, primarily due to recognizing the AMH platform value.\nDale will now guide you through the financial performance details.\nFor the quarter, Western Alliance generated adjusted net income of $236 million or $229 million adjusted earnings per share, increasing 22.9% and 20.5% from the previous quarter.\nThis includes a reversal of credit provisions of $14.5 million, as mentioned by Ken, and excludes pre-tax merger and restructuring expenses of $15.7 million related to AmeriHome.\nExcluding certain charges, pre-provision net revenue of $277 million increased by 37% compared to the previous quarter.\nTotal net revenue grew by $169.5 million to $506.5 million during the quarter following the AmeriHome acquisition, representing over a 50% increase from the previous quarter.\nNet interest income increased by $53 million to $370.5 million during the quarter, a 24% year-over-year rise, primarily due to significant balance sheet growth and the allocation of liquidity into higher-yielding assets.\nAverage earning assets grew by $4.1 million, while the proportion of lower-yielding cash held at the Fed decreased from 15% to 4.4%.\nNon-interest income rose by $116.3 million to $136 million compared to the previous quarter, now accounting for 27% of total revenue, largely due to $111 million in mortgage banking-related income from AmeriHome.\nWithin this category, net loan servicing revenue was negative $20.8 million due to accelerated amortization of servicing rights caused by high refinance activity, but was significantly outweighed by gains from mortgage loan sales.\nIn the second quarter, pre-AmeriHome WAL contributed $24.8 million or 18% of non-interest income, compared to $19.7 million in the first quarter, bolstered by $7 million in income from equity investments.\nNon-interest expense, including merger and restructuring charges, increased by $94.5 million, mainly due to the AmeriHome acquisition, which raised compensation costs as approximately 1,000 new members joined the WAL team, along with new expenses related to loan servicing and origination.\nThe benefits of AmeriHome to our strategy of expediting and optimizing the deployment of excess liquidity into higher-yielding assets are becoming apparent, as we added $4.5 billion in loans held for sale yielding 3.2%, as opposed to cash yielding 10 basis points.\nInvestment yields improved by 10 basis points from the previous quarter to 2.47%, while loan yields, excluding HFS, decreased by 11 basis points on a linked quarter basis due to an ongoing shift towards residential loans and a slight reduction in non-commercial real estate loan returns.\nInterest-bearing deposit costs remained unchanged from the previous quarter at 22 basis points.\nThe total cost of funds increased by 8 basis points to 27 basis points due to the issuance of $600 million in subordinated debt and the assumption of AmeriHome borrowings.\nThe spot rate for total deposits, including non-interest bearing deposits, was 11 basis points.\nFunding costs are expected to have generally stabilized at these levels.\nAs a result, net interest income grew by $53.2 million to $370.5 million during the quarter, a 24% year-over-year increase, as average earning assets rose by $4.1 billion.\nThe proportion of cash in average interest-earning assets decreased from 15% to 4.4% during the quarter, leading to a 14 basis point expansion to 3.51%.\nExcluding the impact of PPP loans, the margin would have increased by 22 basis points.\nThe efficiency ratio increased to 44.5% from 39% in the first quarter, primarily due to the addition of AmeriHome employees and higher incentive compensation costs.\nAs mentioned in our first quarter call, we anticipated the efficiency ratio to rise to the mid-40s as a result of the acquisition.\nPre-provision net revenue increased by $75 million or 37% from the previous quarter and 35.4% from the same period last year.\nThis resulted in a pre-provision net revenue return on assets of $231 million for the quarter, an increase of 28 basis points compared to $203 million in the first quarter.\nThis continued strong performance and leading capital generation provides significant flexibility to fund ongoing balance sheet growth, capital management actions, or meet credit demands.\nBalance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans held for investment increased by $1.3 billion or 4.6% to $30 billion, and deposit growth of $3.5 billion brought balances to $41.9 billion at quarter-end.\nOverall, total assets have grown by 54% year-over-year as we approach the $50 billion asset level.\nBorrowings increased by $1.2 billion over the previous quarter to $1.8 billion, primarily due to a $600 million subordinated debt issuance and the assumption of AmeriHome borrowings.\nTangible book value per share decreased by $0.16 from the previous quarter to $0.3286 but increased by 18% year-over-year, driven by the AmeriHome acquisition of intangible assets that were largely offset by Q2 earnings and the issuance of 700,000 shares of common stock from our ATM for $70 million.\nDespite heightened competition and pricing pressure, we continue to generate consistent strong organic loan growth from our flexible national commercial business strategy.\nLoans held for investments grew by $1.3 billion in the quarter, or $2 billion excluding PPP payoffs of approximately $700 million.\nThe majority of growth this quarter was driven by a $2 billion increase in residential real estate loans, which now comprise 17% of total loans as we aim to deploy excess liquidity and integrate new flow arrangements from the recent Galton and AmeriHome transactions.\nThis was complemented by growth in capital call lines of $162 million and construction and land loans of $89 million.\nRegarding deposits, we continue to observe broad-based core deposit growth across business channels.\nIn the second quarter, deposits increased by $3.5 billion or 9.2%, primarily due to a $2.6 billion rise in non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts, which now make up 48% of total deposits, and a $534 million increase in savings and money market deposits\nSignificant factors contributing to deposit growth during the quarter included market share gains in mortgage warehouse, strong performance from regional commercial clients, successful fundraising activities, technological innovations, and seasonal inflows from homeowners association banking relationships\nOur asset quality showed considerable improvement this quarter\nClassified assets decreased by $43 million in the second quarter, reaching $238 million, which represents 49 basis points of total assets\nThe total classified assets ratio dropped by 16 basis points to 49 basis points, reflecting ongoing improvement in clients affected by COVID-19\nSpecial mention loans decreased by $69 million during the quarter, now representing 1.35% of funded loans\nNet credit losses for the quarter were minimal, totaling only $100,000 or zero basis points of average loans, compared to a $1.4 million net loss in the previous quarter\nThe loan allowance for credit losses decreased by $16 million from the previous quarter to $264 million, due to improved credit trends, more favorable macroeconomic forecasts, and loan growth in portfolio segments with low expected loss rates\nOverall, the total loan allowance for credit losses to funded loans ratio decreased by 9 basis points to 88 basis points, or 91 basis points when excluding PPP loans\nFor comparison, the loan allowance for credit losses to funded loans ratio was 84 basis points at the end of 2019, before the adoption of CECL\nGiven our industry-leading return on equity and assets, we continue to generate substantial capital to support organic growth and maintain regulatory capital ratios\nOur tangible common equity to total assets ratio of 7.1% and Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.2% were negatively impacted this quarter by the AmeriHome acquisition and robust asset growth\nWe issued 700,000 shares under our ATM shelf during the quarter and completed a $242 million credit linked note transaction to reduce risk-weighted assets, as we continue to explore ways to optimize our capital levels to support ongoing growth\nWe also completed $844 million in mortgage servicing rights dispositions and have already finalized our expected Q3 mortgage servicing sales\nCapital levels are expected to increase from this point forward\nIncluding our quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.25 per share, our tangible book value per share decreased by $0.16 for the quarter to $0.3286, compared to an 18% increase over the past 12 months\nI will now turn the call back to Ken for concluding remarks\nAt the midpoint of the year, I'd like to reflect on our performance\nWe utilized excess liquidity and significantly boosted our net interest income\nYear-to-date, non-PPP loans have grown by $3.6 billion, while deposits have increased by $10 billion, which is 2.75 times the amount of loan growth, providing us with an opportunity to deploy liquidity and expand net interest income\nAmeriHome has exceeded Q2 guidance and is on track to meet full-year projections\nAsset quality has improved, with substandard, special mention, and non-accrual loans decreasing, and nearly zero net charge-offs for the quarter\nReturn on tangible common equity was 28.1% for the quarter\nPPNR, a key indicator of the company's earnings power, grew by 37.1%, and we executed several capital raising transactions as Dale mentioned earlier\nFor the second half of the year, we anticipate loan and deposit growth to continue at a rate of $1 billion to $1.5 billion per quarter\nNet interest income is expected to grow quarter-over-quarter as additional liquidity is deployed into loans and investments, offsetting the interest drag from the new subordinated debt and credit linked note issuances\nNIM will face some pressure as competition, interest rates, and loan mix push loan yields downward\nPPNR will follow net interest income and fee income growth, continuing to rise throughout the year\nAsset quality is expected to remain stable, with net charge-offs tracking similar to the previous quarter's performance\nWe maintain our belief that we will reach a $9 earnings per share run rate by the end of the year\nLastly, we will implement a growth-based capital strategy to support above-trend balance sheet expansion\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Let's begin by addressing the necessary preliminaries.\nThese elements are elaborated in the Company's SEC documents and recent press statement.\nReproduction or redistribution is prohibited without our explicit consent.\nThis call aims to examine our Q2 2021 outcomes as outlined in yesterday's press release.\nThe worldwide COVID crisis is ongoing.\nHowever, with increased vaccine availability, there's guarded optimism as domestic travel seems to be recovering and aircraft order backlogs are beginning to increase.\nDespite ongoing uncertainties, our attention has shifted towards resuming growth.\nWe all acknowledge the unprecedented nature of the past 18 months.\nThe global health crisis necessitated Hexcel to implement rapid and decisive restructuring measures, which we accomplished.\nWe also utilized the reduced production periods to enhance cost-effectiveness and efficiency.\nThese actions have positioned us to emerge from the pandemic more streamlined and efficient for a robust recovery.\nOur team's response to these challenges has been exceptional, as evidenced by the results we reported in last night's press release.\nOur strong start to the year continued into Q2, with results meeting or slightly surpassing our projections.\nWe achieved impressive margin performance despite lower year-over-year sales, due to a favorable margin mix from increased carbon fiber sales.\nCoupled with efficiency improvements and reduced overhead costs, we delivered $0.08 of adjusted earnings per share for the quarter.\nRecall that in Q2 2020, we also reported $0.08 of adjusted EPS.\nHowever, this was on sales that were nearly 17% higher in constant currency.\nThis showcases how the cost control measures we swiftly implemented in 2020 and continue today are significantly impacting the enduring value we provide to our shareholders.\nAs we predicted last quarter, we believe inventory reduction is largely complete as we enter the second half of the year.\nSpecifically, inventory reduction for the A320 and 737 MAX is essentially finished.\nWide-body aircraft still have some inventory to use up, which we expect will take a few more months to align with announced production rates.\nWe're encouraged by airlines like United placing orders with commercial aerospace OEMs as revenue passenger kilometers continue to rise globally.\nJune saw increased deliveries for both Airbus and Boeing, which we believe further indicates that we, along with our customers, are beginning to recover from this pandemic-induced downturn.\nHowever, while we anticipate gradual increases in production rates in the coming months, we recognize that it will take time for rates to return to 2019 levels.\nEven with vaccines restoring confidence in travel, uncertainties remain due to new COVID-19 variants spreading.\nUS air travel is steadily increasing but remains about 25% below pre-pandemic levels.\nEuropean travel is improving, but the recovery is slower with flights still about 50% below pre-pandemic levels.\nSo while we see some encouraging signs and are planning for increased demand and a gradual recovery, we acknowledge that the pandemic's effects on commercial aerospace and our business are likely to persist for some time.\nNevertheless, we're very optimistic about the future and take pride in our relentless pursuit of continuous improvement.\nWith this in mind, we've fully utilized this period to strengthen our customer relationships, which have never been stronger, to further enhance our processes, and to expand our broad portfolio and commitment to ongoing innovation.\nIn May, we announced plans to construct a flagship center of excellence for research and technology in the US to support next-generation developments in advanced composite technologies.\nWhen it opens in 2022 at our Salt Lake City Campus, it will be our largest innovation and product development center in North America and a showcase for our advanced composites technologies.\nEventually, about 150 scientists and other employees will work at the new center, including many experienced and talented R&T employees currently based in Dublin, California.\nWe plan to sell the California property, with the proceeds expected to fund a significant portion of our construction costs for the new center.\nWith approximately 100,000 square feet of laboratory and office space and state-of-the-art testing equipment, it will allow us to expand our research to further develop new products and processes and provide even greater opportunities to collaborate with our customers on the latest advanced composites technologies to deliver innovative solutions and support future growth.\nDesign work is well underway and we expect to break ground in the fourth quarter of this year.\nWe're excited to make this investment in innovation today to ensure our continued leadership tomorrow.\nI look forward to inviting many of you to visit once the site opens towards the end of next year.\nI recently completed tours of all our US locations to conduct site readiness reviews.\nWhat I discovered during these site visits was extremely encouraging.\nOur workforce is engaged, focused, and highly motivated for a return to growth.\nThe quality of site leadership and shop floor teams across our plants is truly exceptional.\nI was shown numerous examples of increased productivity, significant process enhancements, and a long list of continuous improvement projects our team has implemented across our manufacturing facilities during the pandemic to reduce costs, further enhance worker safety and job quality, and to position Hexcel to expand margins as growth returns.\nThe supply chain's ability to ramp up remains a concern for us and we are working very closely with our suppliers to successfully overcome any challenges that arise.\nThe same focus applies to our labor requirements, which I'm pleased to say are growing once again.\nAt present, we have been successful in attracting the necessary workforce.\nWe expect more hurdles ahead, which we plan to tackle through vigorous hiring, strategic planning, and maintaining close alignment with our clients.\nAllow me to present some key outcomes from this quarter.\nAerospace revenue of $154 million saw a decrease of nearly 25% compared to the same period last year.\nDemand for narrow-body aircraft is rebounding rapidly, with Q2 sales reaching their peak since Q1 2020.\nRevenue from Other Commercial Aerospace, including regional and business aircraft, dropped 27% compared to 2020.\nBusiness jets comprise the largest segment of this sector, and while sales are recovering, they remain lower than the previous year.\nSpace and defense revenue was approximately $107 million, showing relatively stable year-over-year performance, mainly affected by pandemic-related production delays.\nAs you're aware, we have substantial involvement in both the Lockheed Martin F-35 and Sikorsky CH-53 K programs, which have received new orders in the past month.\nThese will continue to be important programs for us, along with over 100 other defense and space initiatives in this sector.\nIndustrial revenue was about $60 million for the quarter, representing a 15% decline in constant currency.\nWind energy sales, the largest subsector in Industrial, decreased by 44%, reflecting ongoing weak demand and the previously announced closure of our wind blade prepreg production facility in North America last November.\nHowever, strong sales in other industrial markets, such as automotive and recreation, helped counterbalance the reduced wind energy sales during the quarter.\nThroughout the pandemic, we've maintained a strong focus on cash management, and in the first half, our free cash flow was nearly $30 million compared to just over $33 million for the same period in 2020.\nSustainability is central to Hexcel's mission.\nWe innovate and produce modern lightweight advanced composite materials that enable the development of more aerodynamic, fuel-efficient aircraft, resulting in significantly lower emissions compared to older generation aircraft.\nMore broadly, responsibility has long been one of our four core values, calling on us to strive to be good corporate citizens in the communities where we operate.\nWe continue to build on our sustainability objectives outlined in our sustainability report, first published several years ago, and we're now excited to participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).\nInitially, we'll submit the CDP report selectively to some of our customers this year, with plans to share next year's submission publicly.\nWe understand that many of our investors assess our progress in sustainability, particularly our ongoing efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nYou can be assured of our continued strong focus and actions on this topic.\nAs a reminder, year-over-year comparisons are in constant currency.\nThe majority of our revenue is in dollars.\nHowever, our cost base is a mix of dollars, euros, and British pounds due to our significant manufacturing presence in Europe.\nConsequently, when the dollar strengthens against the euro and pound, our sales translate lower, but our costs also translate lower, resulting in a net benefit to our margins.\nConversely, a weak dollar negatively impacts our financial results.\nWe hedge this currency exposure over a 10-quarter horizon to protect our operating income.\nQuarterly revenue totaled $320.3 million.\nThe year-over-year sales decrease reflects reduced production rates by our commercial aerospace customers in response to the pandemic, combined with continued supply chain destocking.\nIt's worth noting that in Q2 2020, OEM production rates were only beginning to be reduced midway through the quarter, and supply chain destocking had not yet begun significantly.\nThis context is important when evaluating year-over-year sales comparisons.\nLet's examine our three markets.\nCommercial aerospace accounted for approximately 48% of total second-quarter sales.\nQ2 commercial Aerospace sales of $153.7 million decreased 24.8% compared to Q2 2020, with destocking continuing.\nWe believe the substantial destocking is now behind us as we enter Q3 2021, and our narrow-body production is generally aligned with OEM production rates.\nHowever, our widebody sales are still facing some lingering supply chain adjustments expected to conclude by the end of summer.\nSpace and defense represented 33% of Q2 sales, totaling $106.9 million, a 2.7% decrease from the same period in 2020.\nWhile the demand outlook remains favorable for composite secular growth to enhance performance and extend capabilities, quarter-to-quarter sales can fluctuate, as we experienced in Q2.\nLockheed Martin has publicly stated that F-35 deliveries in 2021 will be lower than initial expectations due to pandemic-induced disruptions, which impacts the supply chain and our deliveries.\nSales were also softer due to some short-term pandemic-related interruptions affecting other programs, including several space-oriented platforms with customers outside the United States.\nIndustrial comprised 19% of Q2 2021 sales.\nIndustrial sales totaled $59.7 million, decreasing 15.1% compared to Q2 2020.\nWind demand remained subdued, while other industrial markets, including automotive and recreation, saw growth in Q2 2021.\nWind energy represented approximately 45% of Q2 industrial sales.\nOn a consolidated basis, gross margin for Q2 was 19.3% compared to 14.5% in Q2 2020.\nThe strengthening gross margin benefited from a higher mix of carbon fiber sales and production in the quarter.\nOur margin recovery won't be a completely smooth quarterly progression, as it will be impacted at times by step-ups in the utilization of major assets such as precursor and carbon fiber lines.\nQ2 selling, general and administrative expenses increased 24.3% or $7 million in constant currency year-over-year.\nExpenditures on research and technology fell by 3.2% when adjusted for currency fluctuations.\nRestructuring expenses in Europe were the primary component of the other expense category.\nThe second quarter of 2020 saw unusually low SG&A expenses due to pandemic-related restructuring actions, including temporary salary reductions and non-recurring decreases in stock compensation accruals.\nCompared to the pre-pandemic second quarter of 2019, SG&A expenses in the second quarter of 2021 are approximately 21% or $8.4 million lower.\nBy the end of the second quarter, we have essentially achieved our goal of $150 million in annualized overhead cost savings.\nAs we shift towards increasing sales and production, we aim to maximize efficiency and minimize costs while preparing for substantial growth.\nThe second quarter's adjusted operating income was $19.3 million, demonstrating strong variable margin performance and effective overhead cost control.\nExchange rates had a positive impact of about 70 basis points year-over-year.\nLet's now examine our two segments.\nThe Composite Materials segment accounted for 75% of total sales and achieved a 9.6% operating margin, up from 6.3% in the same period last year.\nAfter adjusting for non-recurring costs, the current period's adjusted composite materials operating margin was 10.7%, compared to 8.9% in Q2 2020.\nThe Engineered Products segment, which includes our structures and engineered core businesses, represented 25% of total sales and achieved a 7.4% operating income margin, or 7.6% adjusted operating margin, compared to a 2.6% adjusted operating margin in the second quarter of 2020.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 18.8%.\nThe ongoing pandemic and resulting mix of results across our operating countries is expected to continue affecting the Company's overall effective tax rate throughout 2021.\nYear-to-date net cash generated by operating activities amounted to $38.9 million.\nWorking capital used $19.6 million year-to-date, mainly due to increased receivables.\nCapital expenditures on an accrual basis in the second quarter of 2021 were $3.8 million, compared to $11.5 million in the same period of 2020.\nWe continue to manage capital expenditures tightly, focusing on improving existing asset efficiency and new technology flexibility.\nFree cash flow for the second quarter of 2021 was $35.8 million, compared to $51.8 billion in the same period last year.\nStrict cost control and reduced capital expenditures are supporting free cash flow generation.\nAt the end of the second quarter of 2021, liquidity consisted of $115 million in cash and an undrawn revolver balance of $543 million.\nOur liquidity remains well above the bank covenant minimum of $250 million, and we have no near-term debt maturities.\nOur revolver matures in 2024, and our two senior notes mature in 2025 and 2027 respectively.\nThe revolver amendment executed in January 2021 restricts our share repurchase program through March 31st, 2022.\nDividends remain suspended at present.\nOur Board continues to regularly evaluate capital allocation priorities.\nAs stated in our earnings release, we are not providing financial guidance at this time.\nHowever, I'd like to reinforce and expand upon the financial outlook shared during the First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call.\nWe still anticipate 2021 annual sales to be lower than 2020 and below the current market consensus due to recent adjustments in commercial aerospace production rates.\nOur previously stated expectations remain largely unchanged, including the anticipation of additional restructuring costs in the remaining quarters of 2021, expected to be below first and second quarter levels.\nWe continue to expect the fiscal year 2021 adjusted operating margin percentage to be in the low single digits.\nCapital expenditure in 2021 will continue to be managed closely and is expected to be at a similar level to 2020 for the full year.\nWe anticipate generating positive free cash flow in 2021 and further reducing debt levels.\nWe expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 25% in 2021.\nLastly, reiterating some broad context from the first quarter's earnings call in April, we continue to target strong mid-teens-plus operating margins once we achieve sales in the range of $1.8 million to $1.9 million, and we aim to exceed prior peak margins when we return to previous peak sales levels.\nWe believe the worst is behind us and are cautiously optimistic about a continued and steady recovery during the remainder of 2021, which will propel us into 2022 when we expect significant growth to return, extending into 2023 and beyond.\nWhile some of this growth will undoubtedly come from pent-up demand for air travel, much of it will also come from airlines ready to replace older, less efficient aircraft with more aerodynamic and fuel-efficient solutions as the world demands long-term reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.\nNo company has a broader or more vertically integrated portfolio of strong, durable, and lightweight advanced composite solutions that lead to fewer emissions than Hexcel.\nThe market is demanding lighter, yet high-performing materials, and we anticipate strong demand for our entire portfolio, from carbon fiber to prepreg to engineering core, for many years to come.\nFurthermore, no team is better prepared to meet a quick ramp-up than our Hexcel team.\nOver the past several months, as demand contracted, we planned for the inevitable rebound.\nWe have become more efficient, more cost-effective, and more competitive than ever before.\nThroughout the downturn, we have improved our processes to ensure continued gains, especially in employee safety, quality, and on-time delivery.\nCertainly, risks lie ahead, particularly within the supply chain and the availability of raw materials and labor.\nIt comes down to staying focused and aligned with our customers, which we intend to do.\nI'm excited about the path ahead.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These remarks indicate current participant expectations, though actual outcomes may differ.\nAdjusted financial measures are expected to be discussed during the call.\nThe company started fiscal '22 with positive momentum after a challenging pandemic year.\nEach quarter, employees worked diligently to improve financial results, narrowing the gap to pre-pandemic levels and returning to profitable growth.\nThe company entered the pandemic year in a strong position, following 11 consecutive quarters of comparable sales growth in footwear businesses.\nThe company's performance in a difficult environment demonstrates the strength of its retail and branded concepts, Footwear Focus strategy, and ability to capitalize on opportunities.\nFiscal '22 has begun exceptionally well, with first-quarter results significantly surpassing expectations.\nBetter-than-anticipated results across all divisions, led by Journeys' record first-quarter revenue and profitability, contributed to the company's outperformance.\nDespite ongoing pandemic impacts, recovery accelerated monthly in Q1, reflecting strong execution, temporary boost from U.S. government stimulus, and pent-up demand as the economy reopened faster than expected.\nKey highlights from the quarter will now be outlined.\nRevenue and operating profit surpassed pre-pandemic levels, increasing 9% and 125% respectively compared to Q1 Fiscal '20, despite stores being open for less than 90% of possible operating days due to closures in the U.K. and Canada.\nIncreased operating profit and pre-pandemic share repurchases resulted in outstanding Q1 earnings per share of $0.79, compared to a loss of $3.65 last year and positive earnings of $0.33 two years ago, on an adjusted basis.\nRecord first-quarter digital revenue and profit were achieved as the company continued to capitalize on the accelerated shift to online spending, sustaining last year's 64% growth and adding another 43% on top of that.\nAdditional highlights include reaching the highest store traffic numbers compared to pre-pandemic levels as vaccine rollout increased shopper confidence, improving gross margin by nearly 500 basis points year-over-year due to strong full-price selling, significantly leveraging SG&A compared to pre-pandemic levels, and achieving greater capital efficiencies through effective inventory and capital spending management, resulting in a healthy balance sheet and solid cash position.\nEvery business in every channel contributed to exceeding expectations, with stores delivering the largest gain.\nThe company has always known customers enjoy its differentiated store experience and exceptional in-person service, and it has been exciting to see strong brands attract enthusiastic shoppers back as economies reopen.\nThe combination of store and e-commerce results led to the quarter's strength.\nThe online business, building on a strong pre-COVID-19 foundation, generated double-digit operating margins due to a focus on full-price selling, disciplined marketing spend, and shipping-and-return policies to reinforce profitability.\nTo accelerate digital capabilities, Parag Desai was promoted to the newly created position of chief strategy and digital officer.\nIn this role, Parag will drive greater synergies and integrate systems and digital best practices across the e-commerce portfolio, while working with divisions to deepen consumer insights and CRM capabilities.\nDigital investments have been generating strong results, and Parag's appointment is expected to accelerate progress in taking advantage of omni-channel opportunities presented by the pandemic.\nJourneys led the way with record first-quarter revenue and profit, achieving 75% operating income growth compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nSeveral factors contributed to Journeys' exceptional Q1 performance, beginning with superb execution by its merchant team.\nThe pandemic has highlighted Journeys' industry-leading ability to anticipate, identify, and secure the most popular brands and styles for teen customers.\nThe right assortments and effective consumer engagement drove strong demand and full-price selling, including later in the quarter when the company captured a significant share of increased consumer spending following government stimulus checks and tax refunds.\nJourneys' store team executed excellently, achieving higher conversion rates and increased transaction size, capitalizing on improving store traffic to drive store revenue above pre-pandemic levels.\nJourneys' online team delivered e-commerce sales that more than doubled pre-pandemic levels, with new website visitors increasing by almost 30% and generating nearly 50% of Q1 online revenue.\nThe Journeys team accomplished this while skillfully managing supply chain disruptions that persisted throughout the quarter.\nJourneys' casual product offerings resonated strongly with consumers as comfort remained the dominant fashion choice during the pandemic.\nWhile teens always have a significant amount of fashion athletic footwear, Journeys is especially well-positioned to deliver non-athletic or casual footwear when fashion trends shift in that direction.\nCurrent teen fashion trends are diverse and align with many of Journeys' brand strengths.\nFashion athletic grew nicely year-over-year, but casual growth outpaced it, including a strong start to the sandal season.\nSchuh delivered a commendable performance under difficult circumstances in the U.K.\nStores were open for less than 20% of possible operating days due to government-mandated lockdowns from Christmas until after Easter.\nDespite substantial loss of store days, revenue approached Q1 levels from two years ago, and operating income exceeded pre-pandemic levels, including some one-time gains.\nThe Schuh team successfully leveraged its best-in-class digital capabilities throughout the pandemic to capitalize on the shift to online purchasing.\nIn Q1, direct comps grew by over 70% on top of last year's 90% growth, constituting more than 80% of Schuh's total revenue.\nSchuh had the most advanced digital capabilities among the company's retail businesses pre-COVID-19, which have strengthened over the past year through enhanced CRM capabilities, including more robust prospecting.\nSignificant operational changes were implemented to facilitate digital growth, including reconfiguring the DC and labor model, extending next-day delivery deadlines, and using stores as mini DCs for e-commerce order fulfillment.\nMany trends driving Schuh's business were similar to Journeys, but with a greater emphasis on fashion athletic styles.\nSchuh's operations were officially certified as carbon-neutral by Carbon Footprint Ltd, reflecting the team's long-standing commitment to social responsibility.\nThis achievement was realized ahead of schedule and provides a roadmap for other businesses in the company to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and work with partners to reduce the carbon footprint of products sold.\nJohnston & Murphy's first quarter marked another positive step in its recovery.\nAs vaccines rolled out, consumers began returning to social activities more quickly than expected.\nRetail store traffic improved each month, digital sales grew by almost 20% attracting new customers, and wholesale revenue increased.\nThe recovery plan focuses on new product technology and innovation, with 90% of new product development centered on expanding casual offerings.\nQ1's success was driven by high demand for newly developed casual styles, led by the athletic-inspired Amherst and Activ8 collections, supported by a new holistic marketing campaign.\nContinued gains in golf shoes and apparel further validated the success of extending J&M beyond its dress shoe roots.\nWhile sales lagged pre-pandemic levels, these trends are encouraging, and recovery is expected to accelerate as America returns to offices, likely beginning in earnest during summer and moving into fall.\nLicensed brands are beginning to realize benefits from the Levi's footwear license and Togast acquisition that closed in January 2020.\nRevenue more than doubled to record Q1 levels, and operating profit improved considerably versus pre-pandemic levels as Levi's footwear was well-received across various retail channels.\nThis progress reinforces excitement about the potential to create value by combining powerful brands with fully integrated footwear sourcing capabilities.\nMomentum from Q1 has continued into May, though Q2 is typically the lowest volume quarter as attention turns to summer activities.\nGovernment stimulus and pent-up demand are expected to eventually subside, but Journeys' strength is anticipated to continue, Schuh's strength to build with the reopening of U.K. stores and economy, and Johnston & Murphy's recovery to progress, with another significant improvement likely occurring when people return to work in the fall.\nVaccine rollout progress should benefit store traffic in the second half of the year, and a substantial portion of digital business captured during the pandemic is expected to remain, resulting in much higher e-commerce penetration compared to fiscal '20.\nA more normalized back-to-school season is anticipated, with a significant return to in-person learning and a more typical holiday season.\nSome COVID-19 impacts will persist, but consumers are in a strong position to spend due to increased savings and ongoing government support.\nAlthough stimulus has been beneficial, our strong results are primarily due to our robust business portfolio and the strategic focus on footwear we adopted a few years ago.\nThe speed of our recovery reinforces our confidence that our pre-pandemic strategy remains the correct approach moving forward.\nWe are enthusiastic about the potential to maintain our digital growth and take advantage of industry consolidation to further increase our market share.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has presented us with an opportunity to accelerate our business transformation, as evidenced by our results.\nFirst quarter results significantly surpassed both our projections and last year's performance across all areas.\nWe believe comparing our current performance to our pre-pandemic fiscal 2020 results provides the most meaningful assessment, as fiscal 2021's results are too distorted for useful comparisons.\nSince fiscal 2020, our business has evolved with e-commerce and the licensed brand segment becoming larger components of our total operations, partly due to the Togast acquisition and strong Levi's sales.\nThese changes result in a lower overall gross margin rate due to direct shipping costs and expanded wholesale volume, but this should be more than offset by reduced SG&A from these businesses and our cost-cutting initiatives once business normalizes post-pandemic.\nWhile these shifts will alter the P&L structure, they positively impact operating margins and result in a less capital-intensive business model.\nReturning to the first quarter, I'm happy to report continued sequential improvement in our operating results since the pandemic began.\nRevenue exceeding pre-pandemic levels, combined with well-managed SG&A, led to significantly higher operating income compared to fiscal 2020, with Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $0.79 versus $0.33 in fiscal 2020.\nRegarding specific quarterly results, consolidated revenue was $539 million, up 9% from fiscal 2020, driven by continued e-commerce strength (up 144% versus fiscal 2020) and strong performance from Journeys and licensed brands compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nWe did not provide overall or store comp results for Q1 due to our comp policy, which excludes stores closed for seven consecutive days. We believe overall sales is a more meaningful metric.\nDigital sales increased to 25% of our retail business compared to 11% in fiscal 2020, led by improvements in Journeys' penetration, Schuh's ability to capture lost store sales online, and J&M's double-digit growth compared to fiscal 2020.\nLicensed brands revenue grew 122% versus fiscal 2020.\nConsolidated gross margin was 47.8%, down 160 basis points from fiscal 2020.\nIncreased shipping costs to fulfill direct sales pressured the gross margin rate across all our businesses, accounting for 150 basis points of the overall decline, mainly due to Schuh's higher level of digital sales resulting from store closures.\nWhile e-commerce puts pressure on our gross margin rate, it comes with a lower cost structure and a higher operating income rate.\nJourneys' gross margin increased 130 basis points due to lower markdowns in stores and online.\nSchuh's gross margin decreased 1,030 basis points, largely due to higher shipping expenses from the shift in channel mix, as e-commerce accounted for a significant portion of its revenue in the quarter.\nJ&M's gross margin decrease of 200 basis points was due to more closeouts at wholesale and higher markdowns at retail, but showed significant sequential improvement.\nThe combination of lower revenue at J&M, typically our highest gross margin business, and the revenue growth of licensed brands, typically our lowest gross margin business, negatively impacted the overall mix by 90 basis points.\nAdjusted SG&A expense was 44.3%, a 340-basis-point improvement compared to fiscal 2020, due to leverage from higher revenue and ongoing expense management efforts.\nGovernment programs provided property tax relief and rent abatements, while we achieved ongoing rent savings on renewals.\nThe next largest areas of savings came from reduced store selling salaries, driven by effective use of workforce management tools to improve conversion despite wage pressure.\nThese savings were partially offset by increased incentive compensation due to improved profitability and higher marketing expenses needed to drive traffic to stores and online.\nOur organization has been focused on reducing occupancy costs for many years, given the shift of traffic online, and we've made even greater progress during the pandemic.\nIn Q1 this year, we negotiated 48 renewals and achieved a 29% reduction in cash rent or 27% on a straight-line basis in North America.\nThis follows a 23% cash rent reduction or 22% on a straight-line basis for 123 renewals last year.\nThese renewals are for even shorter terms, averaging about two years compared to the three-year average we've seen recently.\nWith over 40% of our fleet coming up for renewal in the next 24 months, this will remain a key priority for us moving forward.\nIn summary, the first quarter's adjusted operating income was $18.8 million versus fiscal 2020's $8.4 million.\nJourneys, Schuh, and licensed brands all achieved higher operating income compared to fiscal 2020.\nOur adjusted non-GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was 36%, reflecting the impact of foreign jurisdictions where no income tax benefits were recorded.\nRegarding the balance sheet, Q1 total inventory was down 18% compared to fiscal 2020 on sales that were up 9%, with all divisions showing improvement.\nOur ending net cash position was $214 million, $32 million higher than the fourth quarter's level, driven by strong cash generation from operations.\nCapital expenditures were $12 million, focused on digital and omnichannel initiatives, and depreciation and amortization was $11 million.\nWe closed 17 stores and opened one during the first quarter.\nDue to limited visibility into the business impact of the pandemic, we will not provide guidance for the second quarter or full fiscal 2022.\nHowever, I'd like to share some high-level thoughts on how we expect the upcoming quarter to unfold.\nAs mentioned, we believe it's best to use the pre-pandemic fiscal 2020 as the reference point.\nQ1 revenue benefited from stimulus and new Levi's business, with headwinds from store closures at Schuh.\nWhile J&M's trend is improving, it remained lower than fiscal 2020.\nExpenses in Q1 benefited from rent abatements and some government relief programs.\nSelling salary dollars were lower in the quarter as Schuh stores were open for less than 20% of the quarter.\nAs we move into Q2, we continue to feel the tailwind of stimulus in May but expect it to diminish as we progress through the quarter.\nAs we enter back-to-school season late in Q2, we assume schools will return to in-person learning this fall, which should result in a more normalized back-to-school selling season for Journeys and Schuh.\nAround the same time, we expect more customers to begin returning to their offices, which should further benefit J&M's trend.\nRegarding Q2 specifics, starting with revenue, we expect higher revenue compared to fiscal 2020 levels.\nThis is mainly due to growth at Journeys, Schuh stores coming back online, and continued strength from the Levi's business.\nJ&M's trajectory is expected to improve but remain below fiscal 2020's level.\nDirectionally, the overall sales increase for Q2 compared to fiscal 2020 could be slightly less than the 9% increase we experienced in Q1.\nOur outlook does not account for additional store closures or restrictions from COVID-19 beyond what we know today.\nGross margin rates for Q2 will be below fiscal 2020 levels but better than the 160-basis-point decline we experienced in Q1.\nThe sequential improvement is expected to come from better margins at Schuh, which will have a lower penetration of e-commerce compared to Q1.\nHigher e-commerce adoption and increased shipping expenses continue to impact our rates compared to fiscal '20.\nWe expect J&M's pressure and the influence of licensed brand growth on our business model to persist into Q2.\nThe adjusted SG&A rate for Q2 is anticipated to be similar to that of fiscal '20.\nWe won't experience the significant SG&A leverage seen in Q1 due to reduced benefits from rent abatements and government relief programs.\nIncreased revenue and ongoing cost-cutting measures will lead to improvement compared to fiscal '20, but this will be counterbalanced by higher performance-based compensation.\nOur EVA program rewards year-over-year improvements, and last year's lack of incentive compensation will affect every quarter this year.\nWe predict operating income to be near breakeven for Q2, typically our lowest volume quarter, making substantial profits challenging.\nDue to operating income being close to breakeven in Q2, we anticipate minimal tax expense.\nThe expected annual tax rate is around 32%.\nWe'd like to mention that various expense reductions, such as rent abatements, occurred in the latter half of fiscal '21 during the pandemic, which we don't anticipate repeating this year.\nWe're making progress in restructuring our cost base, with rent expense being a crucial element, due to the accelerated shift from physical stores to digital channels and the pandemic's impact.\nWe have a proven track record of reducing our cost base.\nWe identified $43 million in expense savings during fiscal '19 and '20, and eliminated $9 million in stranded costs following the Lids divestiture.\nIn fiscal '21, during the pandemic, we reduced our adjusted SG&A expense by over 15%.\nWhile some reductions were temporary, significant permanent savings were also achieved.\nCost reduction has become a core competency for Genesco.\nOur initial goal for this year is to identify $25-30 million in operating expense savings, approximately 3% on an annualized basis.\nThese savings will come from reduced occupancy costs, selling salaries, and lower IT, transportation, and marketing expenses from ongoing procurement initiatives.\nThese savings are before accounting for increased digital sales expenses, minimum wage increases, new cost pressures, and inflation, which may be temporary or permanent.\nWe've made significant progress on targeted savings and will provide updates throughout the year.\nThis cost-saving initiative is part of a multifaceted strategy to transform our business into a more capital-efficient model.\nCombined with reduced capital expenditures on stores, fewer lease obligations, and efficient inventory use, this will improve return on invested capital and increase operational flexibility.\nThe team should be proud of their achievements and remains committed to executing our footwear-focused strategy.\nOur footwear-focused strategy, implemented a few years ago, is proving effective and is the foundation of our strong performance.\nOur company aims to create and curate leading footwear brands representing style, innovation, and self-expression, becoming the go-to destination for consumers' favorite fashion footwear.\nOur strong strategic positioning in specialty consumer markets, close customer connections, and enduring leadership positions make each of our footwear businesses unique, with shared synergies strengthening them collectively.\nWhile we're best known for our retail platform, we also have a valuable business owning and licensing brands, providing another avenue for future growth.\nOur opportunity lies in accelerating digital and omnichannel potential in our retail businesses and significantly growing our brand portfolio.\nWe operate in an industry undergoing substantial change due to increased consumer adoption of digital commerce, positioning us for transformational change.\nWe made significant progress in fiscal '20, with the pandemic accelerating this change despite its challenges.\nJourneys' understanding of teens and access to desired merchandise uniquely positions it to serve this fickle customer base and navigate the inherent shifts in fashion footwear for this market segment.\nSchuh occupies a similar position in the UK.\nBoth brands have exceptional merchandising abilities and a strong focus on customer service.\nThey serve as key omnichannel distribution partners for the most relevant youth footwear brands.\nTheir overlapping vendor bases allow for stronger brand relationships, highlighted by joint global summits and exclusive product collections.\nVendor scale, product insights, and consumer knowledge provide great synergies and facilitate sharing of strategic and operational initiatives.\nA prime example is Schuh's successful entry into the kids' business, leveraging Journeys' expertise and success.\nJohnston & Murphy, the cornerstone of our branded business, has a leadership position built on 170 years of brand equity.\nThis heritage, ability to adapt to evolving customer fashion needs, and established omnichannel expertise provide a strong foundation for post-pandemic recovery.\nLicensed brands complement our owned brands, allowing us to leverage our footwear expertise across well-known brands with strong equity and access additional distribution tiers.\nOur branded businesses benefit from shared wholesale relationships and product trend inspiration exchange.\nThe global sourcing platform spanning J&M and licensed brands provides significant benefits.\nFor example, licensed brands design, develop, and source one-third of the casual footwear sold in J&M factory outlets, including the top-selling style.\nOur branded platform offers the most promising avenue for future growth.\nThis platform leverages our robust direct-to-consumer capabilities and well-developed wholesale channel relationships, allowing us to add footwear brands that can utilize this infrastructure and capitalize on the trend of brands going direct to consumer.\nSuccessful license integration is evidenced by our success with Levi's and the enhanced capabilities Togast added to our footwear sourcing platform.\nWe benefit from a North American shared services platform in areas like technology, logistics, finance, and HR, with size and scale becoming increasingly important in our technology and digitally driven retail sector.\nWhile Journeys and Johnston & Murphy maintain separate brand identities, they share most retail systems and services, providing significant cost-sharing and enhanced benefits.\nFrom point-of-sale software to merchandising systems, loss prevention, and real estate, the retail technology and infrastructure of these two concepts are largely integrated.\nThe wholesale technology infrastructures of J&M and licensed brands are also significantly integrated.\nAs we look ahead, further leveraging these synergies within and across platforms is crucial in delivering increased value on top of the six strategic growth pillars driving our footwear-focused strategy.\nThese six pillars, established before the pandemic, emphasize continued investment in digital and omnichannel capabilities, deepening consumer insights, driving product innovation, and reshaping our cost base.\nWe'll provide updates on our progress with these pillars and corresponding strategic initiatives in future calls, as they are driving growth and profits for Genesco.\nWe've taken care of our customers and employees during the pandemic, starting the year on a strong foundation that allowed us to grow and create significant value in our company.\nWe've added four qualified and experienced directors to our board in recent months, whose perspectives will be invaluable in shaping our future.\nGenesco is on the right path, our strategy is working, our future is bright, and I've never been more excited about the people and potential in our business.\nSummary: ",

3%, compared to our previous estimate of a 5% to 6% decline\nWe believe we're making good progress towards returning to our pre-pandemic profitability and margin levels over the coming quarters, with the pace of improvement depending on the evolving trends of COVID and the Delta variant\nOur expectations include a slight improvement in COVID mortality in the third and fourth quarters\nIn many aspects, this quarter's results aligned with our expectations, showing declining mortality impacts, solid underlying premium trends, and further strengthening of our robust capital position\nThis quarter also featured some areas that exceeded our expectations\nNotably, we saw continued excellent returns from our alternative investment portfolio, benefiting from strong financial markets and economic growth\nWe also witnessed record quarterly operating income for Colonial Life, along with an impressive recovery in sales\nAdditionally, we experienced favorable underlying benefits from our Closed Block business lines, including long-term care and the Closed Disability Block\nIn addition to the positive trends observed this quarter, I'm pleased that our indicators continue to support our expectation of generating slightly positive growth in premium income in our core business segments this year, with further improvement anticipated in 2022\nSales trends are emerging as expected in our primary business lines within Unum US\nColonial Life showed very strong results this quarter with over a 50% increase from the previous year, indicating consumer interest in our basic financial protection products\nIt also highlights the resilience of Colonial Life's agency model, which faced significant challenges in the early stages of the pandemic\nBesides sales trends, we remain very encouraged by the strong persistency levels across most of our business, providing a solid foundation for growth\nFinally, we're seeing an increase in natural growth, primarily from higher wages in many economic sectors, as we continue to rebuild premium income that was impacted by the sharp rise in unemployment in the first half of 2020\nThe current environment is quite favorable for our core business\nWe often discuss wage inflation, but it's important to note the renewed recognition of the need to prepare for unexpected events\nIn a competitive job market, employers are seeking to ensure they offer competitive benefits packages for current and prospective employees\nRegarding our capital position at the end of the quarter, it remained very healthy, with holding company cash of $1.7 billion and a weighted average risk-based capital for our traditional U.S. insurance companies at 375%\nBoth of these measures exceed our targets and provide substantial flexibility for us moving forward\nAdditionally, this quarter we successfully completed a 30-year debt issue and redeemed a shorter high-coupon maturity, allowing us to further extend our debt stack while reducing the overall coupon\nLeverage remains at approximately 26%, providing further capital flexibility\nThis strong capital position creates options for us as we look to create value for our shareholders\nOur deployment strategy will primarily focus on continuing to invest in the growth of our core business segments, both organically and through capability-driven acquisitions\nWe appreciate our position in the employee benefits market and are focused on investing to grow our core franchise\nWe also expect to consistently return capital to shareholders through dividends, which will increase by 5.3% with the dividend to be paid this month\nWe have funds exceeding these needs, so we are constantly evaluating how to best deploy or retain this capital\nA key consideration is how we can use these funds to mitigate the challenge to our current share price from the legacy of our long-term care block\nOur aim is to help reduce the long-term care discount in our stock\nIn the future, this funding would be used in any risk transfer transaction we explore for a portion of this block, should that become an option for us\nWhile we are clearly optimistic about the future, we recognize that some areas of our business continue to be impacted by the pandemic\nResults in our short-term disability line and leave services continue to be affected by COVID-related claims, which remain persistently high\nThe group life and AD&D business within Unum U.S. returned to profitability in the second quarter after recording losses in the previous two quarters, as COVID-related mortality in the U.S. declined significantly from the peak levels experienced late last year through early 2021\nWe are now observing that the Delta variant is affecting a younger, unvaccinated population with different dynamics from what we have seen so far from COVID-19\nRecently updated estimates for COVID-related mortality for the third quarter and second half of 2021 indicate persistently high counts and only a marginal improvement relative to the second quarter\nWe continue to monitor these trends closely and are incorporating them into our plans\nThere is room for optimism, however, as we have begun to see employers considering their potential role in increasing vaccination rates\nAs we look at growth in our enterprise, the efficiency measures we've implemented have freed up funds that we're reinvesting in new products and capabilities to address today's critical business and workplace challenges\nDuring the quarter, we launched our new Total Leave and behavioral health solutions, and we've secured our first sales for both offerings\nOn the digital front, platforms like My Unum and Colonial Life's improved portal are steadily providing more self-service, real-time capabilities for clients and customers\nNew technology we're testing will enhance the digital enrollment experience, automate processes, and allow people to interact with us in new ways\nEqually important is our work to strengthen our culture and engage our employees across the enterprise\nWe've taken steps during the quarter to accelerate and expand our inclusion and diversity initiatives, and we've broadened the scope of our social justice fund to support even more groups facing discrimination\nThese and many other efforts have helped Unum be recognized among the Points of Light Civic 50, and in Forbes Best Employers for Diversity, Best Employers for Women, and Best Employers for New Graduates\nWe're also pleased to receive another perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index and to be named a best place to work for disability inclusion\nThese efforts and accomplishments reflect the strong culture we have built\nWe take pride in how it has assisted us in overcoming the difficulties of the past 18 months and how our team's dedication will drive us forward.\nSteve will now provide details on the second quarter outcomes.\nI'll begin with the Unum US division, which reported adjusted operating income of $179.3 million for the second quarter, up from $115.7 million in the first quarter.\nThese results improved considerably due to the decrease in COVID-related deaths in our group life business, which I'll elaborate on shortly.\nWe also observed increased operating income from the supplemental and voluntary line, while income in the group disability line decreased compared to the first quarter.\nIn the Unum US segment, the group disability line reported operating income of $59.9 million in the second quarter, down from $64.1 million in the first quarter.\nThe main reason for the change was reduced net investment income, largely due to fewer bond calls.\nPremium income remained relatively stable between the two quarters and increased 1.1% year-over-year.\nThe group disability benefit ratio for the second quarter was 74.7%, similar to the first quarter's 74.8%.\nWe anticipate the benefit ratio will likely stay at this level in the near future due to the impacts we're observing from COVID and the Delta variant, which we now expect will continue through the latter half of the year.\nAdjusted operating income for Unum US group life and AD&D showed a marked improvement in the second quarter, reaching $5.2 million compared to a loss of $58.3 million in the first quarter.\nThis improvement aligns with our expectations and is mainly attributed to the significant reduction in COVID-related deaths in the U.S., which decreased from about 200,000 nationwide observed deaths in the first quarter to approximately 52,000 in the second quarter.\nWe estimate that we incurred roughly 800 excess claims from COVID in the second quarter, compared to an estimate of 2,050 COVID claims in the first quarter.\nOur average claim size increased by about 10% in the second quarter as we experienced a shift towards younger, working-age policyholders who typically have higher benefit amounts.\nNon-COVID-related mortality had minimal impact on results this quarter compared to the first quarter, as lower incidence was offset by higher average claim size.\nLooking ahead to the third quarter, we currently expect nationwide COVID-related deaths to be around 40,000, compared to approximately 52,000 experienced in the second quarter.\nAssuming the shift in demographics continues towards younger, working-age individuals with higher average benefit amounts, we estimate third quarter group life operating income to show a slight improvement over second quarter results to approximately $15 million.\nWe are closely monitoring the impacts emerging from the COVID variants, which have led to increased estimates for second half mortality expectations.\nMoving on to the Unum US supplemental and voluntary lines.\nWe saw an improved quarter with adjusted operating income of $114.2 million in the second quarter, up from $109.9 million in the first quarter.\nExamining the three primary business lines.\nFirst, we continue to be very satisfied with the performance of the individual disability recently issued block of business, both in the second quarter and throughout the pandemic.\nAlthough the benefit ratio increased to 48.4% in the second quarter from 42.4% in the first quarter, it continues to perform well compared to our pre-pandemic experience, with favorable new claim incidence trends and recovery levels.\nThe voluntary benefits line also recorded a strong level of income.\nThe benefit ratio increased in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, though it remained consistent with pre-pandemic results.\nThe benefit ratio in the group critical illness line increased, counterbalancing the improved experience in the life lines of business.\nLastly, utilization in the dental and vision line was higher this quarter, as was the average cost per procedure, pushing the benefit ratio to 77.1% in the second quarter compared to 73.2% in the first quarter.\nDental and vision utilization has been unpredictable since the significant decline in utilization we experienced in the second quarter of 2020.\nSales for Unum US overall decreased 3.1% in the second quarter year-over-year, compared to a decline of 10.3% in the first quarter.\nFor the employee benefit lines, which include LTD, STD, group life, AD&D and stop loss, total sales declined by 3.1% this quarter.\nWe observed good activity and results in the core markets for group disability and group life.\nWhile large case sales were down year-over-year, we are seeing a good level of quote activity in the group markets, which has returned to pre-pandemic levels.\nSales trends in our supplemental and voluntary lines showed similar improvement in the second quarter relative to the first quarter.\nFor this quarter, total sales declined 3.1% year-over-year compared to the 22.3% decline in the first quarter.\nOur recently issued individual disability sales increased 4.9%, and dental and vision sales increased 2.4% year-over-year.\nVoluntary benefit sales were down 7% in the quarter, which aligns with our view that these sales will take longer to recover.\nLarge case DB sales in particular have a longer sales cycle and are more concentrated around January one effective date.\nPersistency for our major product lines in Unum US remained in line to higher this quarter relative to the first quarter of 2020, providing a good tailwind for premium growth for the full year and into 2022.\nWe have also seen favorable trends and natural growth in our employee benefits lines primarily from higher wage growth at this point.\nShifting to the Unum International segment.\nAdjusted operating income for the second quarter was $24.8 million compared to $26.4 million in the first quarter and $15.1 million in the second quarter of 2020.\nThe primary driver of these results is in our Unum UK business, which generated adjusted operating income of £16.8 million in the second quarter compared to £18.6 million in the first quarter and £10.1 million in the second quarter of 2020.\nWe are pleased with these results, which showed improved underlying benefits experience particularly in our group life line.\nThe reported benefit ratio in Unum UK, which showed an increase to 82.5% in the second quarter from 75.3% in the first quarter was impacted by the increase in inflation in the U.K. in the second quarter compared to the first quarter.\nHigher inflation triggers higher inflation-related benefits to certain of our policyholders as well as higher net investment income from the inflation index linked yields in our investment portfolio.\nThe rapid increase in inflation in the U.K. from the first to second quarter did distort somewhat the timing of these two factors and produced a net negative impact of slightly less than £3 million to adjusted operating income this quarter.\nThis short-term impact to income is expected to balance out over the course of the year.\nOverall, we are very pleased with the results in our International business with benefit ratios adjusted for inflation for Unum UK improving both on a sequential and year-over-year basis.\nPremium growth for our International businesses was also favorable this quarter compared to a year ago.\nLooking at the growth on a year-over-year basis and in local currency to neutralize the benefit we saw from the higher exchange rate, Unum UK generated growth of 3% with strong persistency and the ongoing successful placement of significant rate increases on our in-force block.\nUnum Poland generated growth of 12.4%, a continuation of the low double-digit growth this business has been producing.\nWith this growth, our Unum International in-force premium is now at its highest level.\nLastly, we are very pleased with the results generated by Colonial Life, with adjusted operating income of $95.8 million in the second quarter compared to $73.3 million in the first quarter.\nThis record quarterly income level was primarily driven by improved benefits experience and higher net investment income.\nThe benefit ratio saw an improvement to 51.7% in Q2 from 55.4% in Q1 due to better experience in life insurance as COVID-related deaths decreased.\nPerformance in accident, sickness, disability, cancer, and critical illness lines also enhanced compared to Q1.\nNet investment income rose sequentially, mainly due to increased income from bond calls.\nWe expect adjusted operating income to settle in the low to mid-$80 million range in Q3 as some favorable trends moderate.\nColonial Life's sales activity rebounded impressively this quarter, growing 53.7% year-over-year.\nWhile this strong recovery comes after a COVID-impacted period last year, it marks a return to growth as in-person sales resume and digital capabilities expand.\nAs anticipated, premium income dropped 4.3% year-over-year and will likely continue to show negative comparisons for a few quarters until sales volumes recover sufficiently.\nColonial Life's persistency shows a positive trend at 78.3% for H1 2021, nearly one percentage point higher than last year.\nThe Closed Block segment's adjusted operating income was $111.2 million in Q2 compared to $97 million in Q1, both exceptionally strong quarters for this segment.\nThis quarter's results benefited from high net investment income due to increased miscellaneous investment income and favorable benefits results in long-term care and Closed Disability Blocks.\nThe LTC block's interest-adjusted loss ratio decreased slightly to 74.6% in Q2 from 77.7% in Q1, both better than the long-term expected range of 85% to 90%.\nOver the past four quarters, the LTC benefit ratio was 70%, excluding the Q4 2020 reserve assumption update impact.\nWe continued to see higher mortality in the claim block in Q2, estimating counts were about 5% above expectations.\nLTC claims incidence rose slightly in Q2, but higher claim recoveries mitigated the financial impact.\nWe expect the LTC interest-adjusted loss ratio to remain slightly favorable to our long-term assumption range in H2 as mortality and incidence trends normalize from COVID impacts.\nThe Closed Disability Block's interest-adjusted loss ratio was 69.6% in Q2 and 68.9% in Q1.\nThe retained block's experience, mainly reflecting the active life reserve cohort and certain smaller claims blocks, performed better than expected due to fewer submitted claims.\nOverall, the Closed Block segment had a very strong quarter driven by higher miscellaneous income and favorable underlying benefit experience.\nWe estimate quarterly operating income for this segment will typically range from $45 million to $55 million, assuming normal investment income and claim trends.\nThe Corporate segment's adjusted operating loss was $48.5 million in Q2 compared to $38.9 million in Q1.\nWe anticipate Corporate segment quarterly losses will moderate to the low to mid-$40 million range in H2.\nOur investment portfolio is showing very favorable overall credit trends.\nThere were no downgrades of investment-grade securities to high yield this quarter, and we had net upgrades in ratings, generating a small capital benefit.\nOur internal watch list of potential credit concerns is now lower than it was pre-pandemic in early 2020.\nWe saw high miscellaneous investment income from bond calls again this quarter as companies refinance higher coupon debt to take advantage of lower interest rates and tight spreads.\nInvestment income from bond calls was about $10 million higher this quarter compared to historical averages.\nThis has been extremely volatile and hard to predict quarter-to-quarter.\nWhile bond calls boost current period investment income, replacing lost yields is challenging in the current low interest rate environment.\nWe continue to see strong performance in alternative investment asset valuations, totaling $51.9 million in Q2 following $35.9 million in Q1.\nBoth quarters significantly exceed the expected quarterly positive marks of $12 million to $14 million.\nThis quarter's strong returns primarily reflect the period ending March 30, 2021, due to typical reporting lags in these investments.\nHigher returns came from all three main sectors: credit, real estate, and private equity, reflecting strong financial markets and economic growth.\nPredicting quarterly miscellaneous investment income returns is difficult, but we're seeing continued favorable trends in bond call premiums so far in Q3.\nThe company's financial position remains strong, providing significant flexibility.\nThe risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. insurance companies improved to about 375%, and holding company cash was $1.7 billion at the end of Q2, both well above our targets.\nWe successfully completed a debt offering in Q2, issuing $600 million of 30-year senior notes with a 5 1/8% coupon, our lowest ever for a 30-year issue.\nThe proceeds were used to redeem $500 million of 4.5% notes due in 2025.\nThis transaction extended our debt duration and reduced the overall coupon on our outstanding debt.\nOur leverage ratio is currently 26.2%, providing additional financial flexibility.\nThe NAIC's finalization of C1 factor changes will have a less significant impact on our capital position than previously expected, now estimated at less than $70 million instead of $225 million.\nWe're revising our 2021 outlook upward, now expecting a 1% to 3% decline in after-tax adjusted operating earnings per share relative to 2020, compared to our previous 5% to 6% decline projection.\nOur underlying performance remains healthy, but COVID and the Delta variant will continue to influence results.\nWe're pleased with the company's operational performance in this extraordinary environment and believe we're well-positioned to benefit from improving business conditions while remaining vigilant as the pandemic continues.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Jeff Jones, our President and CEO, and Tony Bowen, our CFO, are participating in today's call.\nWe will be discussing some figures using non-GAAP measurements.\nThese statements are based on current data and management's expectations as of now, but do not guarantee future results.\nOur actual outcomes may vary significantly from what is stated.\nMore information about these risks can be found in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2019 and other SEC filings.\nWe request that participants ask only one question with a follow-up during Q&A, after which they can rejoin the queue.\nIn our last quarterly update, we shared our goals to digitize our entire business and provide our expertise to consumers in innovative ways, and we're observing some positive outcomes.\nWe're committed to providing Assisted clients with improved quality and value, and we're progressing towards our goal of maintaining market share in this category.\nOur Virtual product, Tax Pro Go, is experiencing increased demand.\nWe continue to expand our DIY client base.\nClient satisfaction ratings have improved across all products following a year of exceptional growth.\nWe're making progress in small business, including another strong quarter from Wave.\nWhile I'm satisfied with these initial results, we've identified areas for improvement in DIY performance for the latter half of the year, which I'll address later.\nI'll start by sharing our perspective on the tax industry.\nThen I'll discuss our tax season results so far, our expectations for the remainder of the season, and provide an update on small business.\nTony will then review our third quarter results and share additional thoughts on our financial outlook for the fiscal year.\nLet's begin with the industry.\nOverall filing trends align with our expectations.\nCurrently, the increase in DIY mix is less pronounced than last year.\nDespite speculation that the second year of the new tax law would cause more Assisted filers to switch to DIY, we're not seeing evidence of this in our data or the industry's, and the shift has actually slowed down.\nRegarding our performance, I'd like to update you on our progress in the key areas we discussed last quarter.\nWe're focusing on leading the industry with transparent upfront pricing, improving our standard operating procedures, and digitizing how tax pros serve clients through Work Center.\nIn pricing, we've strengthened our approach to upfront transparency this year with a new price estimator tool to help our tax pros provide more accurate initial estimates to clients.\nTransparent upfront pricing is a key feature of our recently launched No Surprise Guarantee, which also includes three audit assistance and a mid-year tax check-in for clients across all our products.\nWe've enhanced Work Center, which digitizes how our tax pros serve and communicate with clients, providing an improved experience.\nThese efforts are yielding results, with higher retention rates for both new and returning clients, as well as better conversion rates.\nClient survey scores for price-to-value ratio increased by 3 points and overall quality by 2 points. Considering the 9-point improvement in these scores last season, these results are remarkable.\nThis has led to a significant improvement in client trajectory compared to the same time last year.\nWith much of the season still ahead, we're confident in achieving our goal of maintaining market share in the Assisted category.\nTax Season '20 marks the second year of Tax Pro Go, an innovative product that allows clients to access our tax pros' expertise conveniently via mobile device.\nThis year, we redesigned the client experience to streamline the product flow, simplify pricing, and facilitate easier connections with our expert tax pros.\nWe're also highlighting this product's advantages in our marketing, which is driving increased demand for Tax Pro Go and mobile usage.\nThese efforts are showing results, with improvements in key client service metrics and strong client growth.\nAlthough we're still in the early stages with this product, its continued growth gives us confidence that we can meet unmet needs and attract new clients to our brand.\nIn DIY, we've maintained our challenger strategy of investing in product and user experience improvements, competitive pricing that provides value to clients, and communicating this value to increase awareness and persuade DIY consumers to switch to H&R Block.\nWe continue to use AI and machine learning to enhance ease, speed, and personalization in our product.\nWe've enhanced the visibility of Online Assist, offering DIY customers instant access to tax professionals via chat, phone, and screen sharing.\nThis offering is competitively priced and backed by the unparalleled knowledge of our extensive network of tax experts.\nOur service quality has been exceptional this season, with most customers connecting to a Tax Pro within 60 seconds.\nThese combined efforts have resulted in a significant improvement in our net promoter scores, which have risen by more than 3 points.\nThis increase is noteworthy, especially considering the 9-point jump we experienced in the previous year.\nOur product has garnered several third-party accolades, including top rankings from thestreet.com for best online tax software and NerdWallet's recognition for best software for straightforward tax returns.\nWhile we're pleased with our product improvements and the value we're providing to customers, we believe we can enhance both our volume and average net charge in the latter half of the year, and we've already implemented appropriate measures.\nInitially, we adjusted our marketing strategy to generate more new client demand.\nSecondly, we fixed an issue on a crucial online page that prevented customers from selecting different products, which had negatively impacted monetization.\nAfter resolving this issue, we've observed a 4% increase in net average charge for DIY services.\nWe're certain that we've made the right adjustments and anticipate stronger performance in the second half of the year.\nWe project that our DIY client growth will align with the industry average by year-end.\nTurning to our small business segment, starting with tax services.\nWe've showcased our expertise through new tools and a revamped user experience.\nWe're beginning to see results from these new initiatives but expect it will take time to increase awareness of our small business expertise.\nAt Wave, we continue to innovate to streamline financial management for small business owners.\nDuring this quarter, Wave made significant progress on its strategic roadmap in several areas.\nWe're experiencing growing demand for Wave advisors, which offers clients personalized assistance from our in-house bookkeeping experts.\nIn our payroll service, we're expanding full-service capabilities to more states, automatically filing clients' state and federal payroll taxes.\nFor our payment services, we've streamlined the client onboarding process to help customers select the right product and gather essential information earlier.\nThese enhancements are driving Wave's impressive performance, which continued this quarter with year-over-year revenue growth exceeding 40%.\nIn conclusion, we're on track to meet our financial goals for the year by digitally transforming our business, improving client growth in Assisted services, innovating in Virtual offerings, enhancing our award-winning DIY product, and expanding our small business services.\nWe've clearly identified areas for improvement and are focused on executing our plans in the second half to deliver stronger results by the end of the season.\nI'll now turn the call over to Tony.\nAs a reminder, we typically report a loss in the fiscal third quarter due to the seasonal nature of our tax business.\nTherefore, third quarter results are not indicative of our full-year performance.\nRegarding revenue, we experienced a year-over-year increase of $51 million or 11%, reaching $519 million.\nThis growth was primarily attributed to higher tax preparation fees resulting from increased volume in Assisted and DIY services, as well as the acquisition of over 200 franchise locations this year, which continues to be a sound investment.\nThe volume increase also led to higher royalties and increased revenues from our Tax Plus products.\nIn addition to growth in our tax business, Wave contributed $11 million, representing a year-over-year increase of more than 40%.\nTotal operating expenses rose by $65 million or 11% to $672 million.\nThe majority of this increase was anticipated, driven by Wave, higher compensation due to increased Assisted volumes, and planned investments in our technology roadmap.\nWe also recorded an additional $19 million in marketing expenses during the quarter, which was entirely due to shifting recognition from Q4 to Q3, not an increase in spending.\nDue to this timing shift, we expect marketing expenses to be lower in Q4.\nI'll discuss our full-year outlook, including expectations for operating expenses, later in the call.\nInterest expense was $26 million, an increase from the previous year due to higher draws on our line of credit.\nThe changes in revenue and expenses resulted in an $18 million increase in pre-tax loss from continuing operations.\nThe GAAP loss per share rose by $0.08 to reach $0.66.\nWe have started reporting both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share as of the previous quarter.\nThe adjusted loss per share increased by $0.07 to $0.59, primarily due to higher pre-tax losses and fewer outstanding shares, partially counterbalanced by an enhanced tax benefit.\nIt's worth noting that while a reduced share count is advantageous on an annual basis, it negatively affects earnings per share in quarters when we report a loss.\nNo alterations were made to accrued contingent liabilities related to Sand Canyon in discontinued operations this quarter.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain consistent.\nOur top priority is ensuring sufficient liquidity for our operational needs, taking into account our seasonal fluctuations.\nWe began this year in a strong financial position after generating over $500 million in free cash flow during fiscal year 2019.\nWe then make strategic investments in our business that we believe will create value for our clients, ultimately benefiting our shareholders.\nMaking wise investments to foster sustainable growth continues to be a crucial part of our capital allocation strategy.\nFinally, we distribute excess capital through quarterly dividends and share buybacks.\nWe have raised our quarterly dividend for four consecutive years, resulting in a 30% increase over that period.\nIn the third quarter, we bought back 2.8 million shares for $66 million at an average price of $23.35.\nSo far this year, we have repurchased a total of 10.1 million shares for $247 million at an average price of $24.36.\nMoving forward, we will continue to take an opportunistic approach to share repurchases.\nI would now like to share our financial outlook for the remainder of the year.\nRegarding the tax industry, we continue to expect overall return growth of about 1%, with Assisted volume remaining flat to slightly up and DIY growing around 3%.\nThis aligns with the trends we've observed over the past few years.\nFor H&R Block, as Jeff mentioned, we anticipate DIY client growth in line with the category and an improvement in client trajectory in Assisted as we maintain market share in that category.\nThis would mark the third consecutive year of overall client growth.\nIn terms of pricing, we expect the net average charge in Assisted to remain consistent with last year, following a year in which we adjusted prices.\nIn DIY, we saw a decrease in net average charge during the first half of the season due to the product issue Jeff discussed.\nWe've addressed this issue, and combined with expected growth in Online Assist, we anticipate an improved mix in the second half, resulting in a net average charge similar to last year.\nIn line with our previous outlook, we expect these client growth and net average charge expectations, along with Wave, to result in revenue growth of 1.5% to 3.5%.\nFor the full year, we expect revenue to grow faster than EBITDA, leading to a decline in EBITDA margin compared to fiscal year 2019.\nThis year, we incurred approximately $15 million in unplanned one-time expense increases due to legal costs and Refund Advance fees, which will also impact our margin.\nDespite these expense increases, we still expect EBITDA margin to fall within our previously provided range of 24% to 26%.\nGiven our year-to-date results, this full-year outlook implies a significant increase in EBITDA in the fourth quarter.\nThis will be achieved through continued revenue growth and a reduction in certain fourth-quarter expenses related to the timing of marketing expense recognition mentioned earlier and lower compensation due to reduced accrued bonuses.\nAs we stated last quarter, we expect a tax rate of 19% to 21% due to favorable settlements with tax authorities during the second quarter.\nThe rest of our financial outlook remains unchanged, with total depreciation and amortization of $165 million to $175 million, of which $70 million to $80 million will be amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions.\nThis amortization expense reflects both Wave and tax office acquisitions and is excluded from earnings per share for non-GAAP reporting.\nWe continue to anticipate interest expense of $90 million to $100 million and capital expenditures of $70 million to $80 million.\nIn conclusion, I'm confident in our plans for the second half of the tax season, and we are on track to meet our financial objectives for the fiscal year.\nTheir commitment to providing assistance and instilling confidence in our clients and communities is what makes H&R Block the outstanding company it is today.\nOverall, I'm enthusiastic about the progress we're making towards our long-term goals and I'm confident we're taking the necessary steps to achieve our objectives for the fiscal year.\nI look forward to sharing more information with you when we report our full-year results in June.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:To access the slides, please navigate to the investor relations section of jabil.com.\nThe entire audio of this call will be available for playback on our website after it concludes.\nThese claims involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from current expectations and forecasts.\nA comprehensive list of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2021, as well as other filings.\nI'd now like to discuss our impressive quarterly performance and exceptional results.\nThe team achieved $400 million in core operating income on approximately $8.6 billion in revenue, yielding a core operating margin of 4.7%.\nThese outcomes were largely due to widespread strength in several key sectors, including healthcare, industrial and semi cap, and mobility, which is typical for our first fiscal quarter.\nIt's important to mention that our team accomplished all of this despite the turbulent global supply chain situation.\nIn conclusion, we delivered robust results, expanded in crucial markets, and effectively managed a complex global supply chain, clearly showcasing Jabil's capabilities through our scale, tools, team, and connections.\nShortly, Mike and Mark will provide more details about the quarter and discuss our improved outlook for the year.\nBefore I hand over the call, I'll share some insights from Jabil's procurement and supply chain team, which may be useful for modeling our year.\nIn essence, demand continues to exceed supply, especially regarding semiconductors, an issue that has persisted since 2019.\nNevertheless, Jabil continues to utilize top-tier tools and relationships to maximize our allocation and maintain production in our factories to the best of our ability.\nThus far, we have been highly successful.\nLooking ahead, we anticipate ongoing supply chain challenges, which have been factored into our guidance, similar to previous quarters.\nWe expect some improvement towards the latter half of the fiscal year, but the general consensus is that demand will remain higher than supply for the next six months.\nAs Adam just noted, Q1 was an outstanding quarter.\nThe team delivered strong performance in three areas: revenue, core operating income, and core diluted earnings per share.\nOur results surpassed expectations due to a combination of continued end-market strength and excellent operational execution by the entire Jabil team, along with reduced tax and interest expenses.\nFirst quarter net revenue was $8.6 billion, representing a 9.4% increase compared to the same quarter last year.\nGAAP operating income was $350 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.63.\nCore operating income for the quarter reached $400 million, a 9.6% year-over-year increase, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.7%.\nCore diluted earnings per share was $1.92, representing a 20% improvement over the same quarter last year.\nLet's now examine our first quarter segment results on the next slide.\nOur DMS segment revenue was $4.7 billion, an 11.1% increase compared to the same period last year.\nThe strong year-over-year performance in our DMS segment was widespread, with growth across our healthcare, automotive, and mobility businesses.\nThe segment's core margin was 5.4%.\nOur EMS segment revenue totaled $3.9 billion, a 7.4% increase compared to the same period last year.\nOur EMS segment showed robust year-over-year growth across various sectors, including digital print and retail, industrial and semi cap, as well as 5G wireless and cloud businesses.\nThe segment's core margin reached 3.8%, showing a 40 basis point improvement from the previous year, demonstrating the team's effective performance.\nLet's now discuss our cash flows and balance sheet.\nDuring the first quarter, inventory days decreased by five days sequentially to 66 days.\nThe leadership team remains highly focused on this metric, especially given the current market conditions.\nOver time, we anticipate our inventory days will stabilize below 60.\nThe first quarter saw operational cash usage of $46 million, with net capital expenditures amounting to $73 million.\nWe concluded the quarter with a total debt-to-core EBITDA ratio of about 1.3 times and cash reserves of $1.2 billion.\nWe bought back roughly 2.1 million shares, equivalent to $127 million, in the first quarter.\nLet's move on to our second quarter forecast on the following slide.\nWe project a 4% year-over-year increase in DMS segment revenue to $3.8 billion, while EMS segment revenue is expected to grow 14% year-over-year to $3.6 billion.\nFor the second quarter of fiscal '22, we anticipate total company revenue to range between $7.1 billion and $7.7 billion.\nWe estimate core operating income to fall between $290 million and $350 million.\nGAAP operating income is projected to be between $266 million and $326 million.\nWe expect core diluted earnings per share to range from $1.35 to $1.55.\nGAAP diluted earnings per share is anticipated to be between $1.19 and $1.39.\nThe second quarter's tax rate on core earnings is estimated to be around 24%.\nI'd now like to briefly discuss our balanced portfolio of businesses across various end markets.\nCurrently, both segments are performing exceptionally well.\nIn September, I pointed out several long-term sustainable trends in key markets such as Healthcare, Automotive, Cloud, Semi-Cap, 5G Infrastructure, and related connected devices, as well as power generation and energy storage.\nWe continue to expect these trends to drive strong growth for the rest of FY '22 and beyond.\nOur electric vehicle business is particularly outperforming despite global supply chain challenges as the shift to ED accelerates.\nNotably, the broad-based growth associated with these trends is expected to lead to significant year-over-year core operating margin improvements in both segments.\nThese factors give us confidence in our ability to deliver strong financial results for FY '22.\nOur balanced capital allocation approach is aligned with and focused on creating long-term shareholder value.\nI'd like to extend my wishes for a safe and joyful holiday season to all of you.\nI also want to acknowledge the team's hard work and unwavering commitment, which led to solid results in our first fiscal quarter.\nOur team not only delivered a favorable first quarter, but the diversity of our business was crucial to the results, with each sector making significant contributions to both our customer solutions and our financial performance.\nThe four sectors in our DMS segment prioritize margins while providing stable cash flows, whereas the four sectors in our EMS segment emphasize cash flows while offering consistent margins, creating a well-balanced and complementary structure that drives Jabil's performance.\nA closer examination reveals underlying trends in specific sectors and markets where we have established a significant presence.\nWe anticipate these markets will fuel our growth, with the majority occurring organically as we concentrate on emerging opportunities such as 5G, electric vehicles, personalized healthcare, cloud computing, and clean energy.\nOur commercial portfolio is deliberately crafted and we consider it to be exceptional.\nEach segment of our business possesses specialized knowledge, providing us with a crucial set of valuable capabilities.\nThe most significant aspect is how we combine these capabilities with precision and speed to serve our customers.\nOur approach is further strengthened by smooth collaboration across the organization, coupled with our distinctive Jabil structure.\nWhen executed correctly, we simplify complex processes for many of the world's most notable brands.\nWe accomplish this while addressing a vast market where products need to be manufactured and supply chains require optimization.\nA key result of our strategy is that our performance becomes increasingly less reliant on any single product or product line over time, enhancing our resilience, particularly during periods of macroeconomic disruption and fluctuating demand.\nI will now provide an update on our fiscal '22 financial plan, which demonstrates the company's continued earnings potential.\nWe have raised our core earnings per share forecast to $6.55 for the year, an increase of $0.20 from our September outlook.\nWe have also increased our revenue projection to $31.8 billion, up from our initial estimate of $31.5 billion.\nAdditionally, we are committed to generating free cash flow exceeding $700 million, while maintaining a core margin of 4.5% for the year as we navigate this challenging environment.\nAlongside these strong figures, it's important to note that our future direction is well-understood throughout the company, and our objectives remain clear.\nPut simply, our current approach is proving effective, which reflects positively on how our team is managing the business.\nShifting focus from financials, I'd like to discuss purpose.\nAt Jabil, purpose serves as our guiding principle.\nWhen considering purpose, we focus on our behaviors, such as ensuring employee safety, practicing servant leadership, promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion, protecting the environment, and giving back to the communities where we operate.\nIt's worth noting that our team's demonstration of these behaviors is exemplary.\nIn conclusion, we are making steady progress and maintaining a consistent strategy.\nAs a team, we value our role as a responsible and dependable partner to those we serve.\nOverall, I'm pleased with our past achievements, but I'm even more optimistic about our future.\nIn essence, at Jabil, we excel at manufacturing products and consistently solving problems.\nI encourage each of you to be authentic without fear or anxiety as you support one another.\nTo all participants on this call, I wish you a safe and peaceful holiday season.\nBefore we start our Q&A session, I'd like to remind everyone that we cannot address customer or product-specific questions.\nWe are now prepared to begin the Q&A portion of the call.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Accompanying me on the call are our Chief Executive Officer, Corie Barry, and our Chief Financial Officer, Matt Bilunas.\nWe will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial metrics during this call.\nWe are announcing exceptional third-quarter financial results, with sales reaching $11.9 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.08, showing a 1% increase from last year and an 84% rise compared to two years ago.\nIn a constantly changing environment, our leadership continues to implement innovative operational methods, while our staff persistently provides outstanding support for our customers' technology requirements in knowledgeable, efficient, and convenient ways.\nOur comprehensive channel capabilities and our unique ability to inspire and assist across all technology areas position us advantageously to capitalize on opportunities in the current climate and beyond.\nWe are taking advantage of robust customer demand as more individuals continue to work, entertain, cook, and socialize at home on a long-term basis.\nDomestic comparable sales growth increased by 2% on top of last year's 23% growth.\nFrom a product perspective, appliances, home theater, and mobile phones were the primary contributors to our comparable sales growth this quarter.\nProduct availability saw continuous improvement throughout the quarter.\nWe are experiencing limited supply in certain areas such as appliances, gaming, and mobile phones.\nHowever, as with the previous quarter, we don't believe this significantly restricted our overall sales growth.\nAlthough we have encountered and continue to face supply chain difficulties, including delays and increased costs, we are proactively managing a situation we've been dealing with for several quarters, as our industry has been facing disruptions and supply constraints since the early stages of the pandemic.\nOur merchandising, demand planning, and supply chain teams made strategic sourcing and inventory decisions early in the year to prepare us well for the holiday season.\nWe are resourcefully adapting to the constantly changing environment by taking actions such as accelerating product flow, modifying store assortments based on availability, and securing additional alternative transportation.\nWe have long-standing, deep relationships with our transportation and logistics vendors, who have been incredibly supportive as we navigate these challenges.\nFurthermore, through our close partnerships with product vendors, we have significant visibility into and can influence the status of products in the supply chain process.\nWe face varying degrees of inventory and supply chain challenges every holiday season, and this year will be no exception.\nHowever, we entered the fourth quarter with 15% more inventory year-over-year and feel confident in our ability to serve our customers throughout the holiday season.\nAs anticipated, we experienced a more promotional environment for many of our products compared to last year.\nWhen compared to two years ago, we still observed a less promotional environment during the third quarter.\nFrom a sales channel perspective, results were similar to the previous quarter.\nCustomers are returning to stores while also choosing to interact with us digitally and via phone and chat at much higher rates than before the pandemic.\nOnline sales accounted for 31% of domestic revenue compared to 16% in Q3 of fiscal 2020, growing by more than $2 billion during that time.\nOur app saw a 19% increase in unique visitors compared to last year, and phone and chat sales continued to rise versus last year and two years ago.\nWe maintain our position as an industry leader in fast and convenient product fulfillment for our customers.\nDuring the third quarter, we achieved our fastest small product delivery times ever.\nCompared to last year, same-day delivery increased by 400%, and we nearly doubled the percentage of products delivered within one day.\nBased on a third-party analysis of competitor websites, we lead in one-day-or-less published shipping time across a sample of high-volume ZIP codes and high-demand items.\nIn addition to partnering with a diverse set of delivery partners, we also strategically utilized our employee delivery capability, with more than 400 stores now offering employee deliveries and almost 60% of our customers living within 10 miles of an employee delivery location.\nWe also offer an industry-leading in-store pickup experience.\nWe have the broadest assortment of consumer electronics products available for pickup by far, and the process is incredibly fast.\nIn Q3, more than 90% of online orders available for product pickup were ready within 30 minutes of the order being placed.\nCustomers clearly value the option to pick up their products at our stores, as the percentage of online sales picked up at our stores remained high at 42%, even with our fast home delivery options, with one-third of our store-pickup customers choosing our convenient curbside option.\nOur customer NPS for order pickup in Q3 improved compared to last year and two years ago.\nIn fact, over the past year, 31% of all our purchasing customers bought online and picked up in-store at least once.\nThese strong Q3 results and our market-leading omnichannel capabilities are due to our exceptional associates across the company and the investment decisions we've made in recent years in supply chain, store operations, our people, and technology.\nOur business has clearly changed dramatically in the last two years, with digital sales more than doubling pre-pandemic levels and growth in phone, chat, and in-home sales.\nCustomers are initiating their research and shopping online and then expanding to all forms of digital and physical shopping depending on their specific needs.\nStores are crucial to our customer experience and need to be even more efficient and must keep pace with greater customer expectations.\nFor instance, we know customers sometimes seek in-person assistance to answer questions, while at other times, they prefer using digital tools to learn about products or pick up their orders in our stores.\nWe have made the right investment decisions to position ourselves as a leader in omnichannel retailing.\nWhile we are proud of our progress, there are even more opportunities ahead of us.\nIt is more important than ever to build on our position of strength and truly become a customer-obsessed company.\nThis means putting the customer at the heart of all we do by anticipating their needs, listening, learning, and applying those insights to create long-term relationships and seamless experiences.\nThis led us to launch Best Buy Totaltech last month.\nTotaltech is an innovative new membership program, leveraging our strengths across merchandising, fulfillment, installation, tech support, and product repair - unique capabilities that customers value and no one else can match.\nOur membership program offers product discounts and periodic access to hard-to-get inventory, free delivery and installation, free technical support, free product protection, and many other benefits.\nLet me provide a concrete example of how the offer can come to life.\nA Totaltech member purchases a 65-inch TV and receives a $150 member discount.\nShe gets the TV delivered and mounted on her living room wall.\nThe following month, she buys a new iPhone for her daughter.\nAs long as she maintains her membership, she gets two years of product protection on the TV she bought and two years of AppleCare+ protection for the phone.\nA few weeks later, she can't connect her laptop to her printer, so she uses a dedicated chat line with Geek Squad who resolves the issue by remotely accessing her computer, allowing her to continue her productive day of working from home.\nAs a member, she received all these benefits for $199 per year.\nAs you can see, members not only receive significant savings but can also be confident that whatever their technology needs are, we will be there to help.\nThe goal is to create an experience that makes it inconceivable for members to purchase their tech from anyone else, driving a larger share of consumer electronics spend to Best Buy.\nWe successfully rolled out the program nationally and online and converted more than 3 million former tech support members.\nIt's very early as we just launched last month, but so far, we continue to see behaviors that we intend to drive and that we observed in the pilot, including more frequent interaction and higher incremental spend than non-members.\nGiven the breadth of the offer, it is resonating well across all customer demographics, and our new members are skewing younger than our former Total Tech Support membership program.\nNPS numbers across all channels are higher than for non-members as well.\nImportantly, our employees believe in and love articulating the value of membership to our customers.\nAs we've discussed in previous calls, we are in the midst of multiple store pilots and tests.\nWe are always piloting concepts, but right now, we are very focused on piloting and testing to build a framework that will move us from a retailer primarily focused on its stores to a true omnichannel one that provides equal focus on all the ways customers shop with us.\nI will provide a few updates on our progress.\nWe launched phase 1 of our virtual store pilot last month.\nFor this, we built out a physical store in one of our distribution centers with merchandising and products that is staffed with dedicated associates, including vendor-provided expert labor.\nIt has no physical customers.\nInstead, customers interact with our experts via chat, audio, video, and screen sharing depending on their preference and are able to see live demos, displays, and physical products.\nIt is early, and we have not rolled out all the product categories yet, but initial results are showing much higher conversion rates, as well as higher average order value than we see with historical chat interactions.\nIn Charlotte, we have made significant progress rolling out the market pilot designed to leverage all our assets in a portfolio strategy across stores, fulfillment, services, an outlet, lockers, our digital app, and both in-store and in-home consultation labor.\nWe launched our new outlet featuring all product categories in addition to a new services hub model and remodeled eight stores.\nIn Houston, we are continuing to see strong results from our experiential store pilot and plan to roll out aspects of this more broadly in stores across the country as we enter next year.\nThese are not the only pilots happening, and thus, they aren't the only pilots that will influence where we go as a company.\nFrom Northern California to Houston to The Bronx, we are assessing new formats and learning our way to the right physical model.\nWe're testing and adapting our workforce strategies in various markets to align with evolving customer shopping patterns.\nThis involves using technology in stores with less staff and developing a more adaptable workforce.\nWe're creating a team that can provide expert assistance across product categories in-store and online, as well as handle tasks like curbside pickup and work flexibly across different stores or distribution centers.\nI'd like to emphasize our unique capacity to both motivate and assist our customers through our consultation and Geek Squad services.\nWe employ nearly 3,000 consultants and designers who offer complimentary consultations in homes, stores, and virtually.\nThese consultations consistently receive high Net Promoter Scores, typically over 80.\nNotably, they also foster longer-term customer relationships, with over 85% of participants expressing intent to continue shopping with their consultants.\nRegarding product support, when issues arise with products, delivery, or installation, it's often unexpected and emotionally charged.\nOur research shows that customers prioritize quick responses, transparency, fast and quality repairs from a trusted provider.\nOur Geek Squad offers industry-leading capabilities that generate high Net Promoter Scores and drive additional revenue for Best Buy immediately and over time.\nAbout 20% of our phone and computer repair customers buy additional products on the day of their repair.\nOur data indicates that customers who have phone or computer repairs are much more likely to make a purchase in the following year.\nWe've been adapting our vendor partnerships to respond to changing customer shopping habits.\nOur in-store vendor experiences are crucial to our customer experience and remain a significant competitive advantage.\nWe've extended many of these in-store experiences to digital platforms.\nOur vendors collaborate with us to provide expert training and tools for our consultants and designers.\nImportantly, our vendors are increasingly directing sales leads from their own websites to our consultants and designers.\nWe're leveraging our unique Geek Squad capabilities to strengthen and expand our vendor partnerships.\nWe're the largest physical location for Apple-authorized repair services in the nation, including same-day iPhone repairs, attracting new customers as one-third of these Apple repair customers are new or re-engaged Best Buy customers.\nWe recently launched Samsung-authorized phone repair service nationwide.\nAbout 30% of our stores will offer same-day, in-store repairs by Samsung-certified Geek Squad agents using Samsung parts, diagnostics, and tools.\nPhone repair is a universal need, and this expansion allows Best Buy to repair most phones in the market.\nWe're also beginning to leverage our industry-leading buy-online-pick-up-in-store experience in partnerships with our vendors.\nCustomers buying select items on samsung.com can now pick up their products at their local Best Buy store.\nShoppers purchasing certain TV brands on amazon.com can pick up their TVs at local Best Buy stores.\nFor many vendors, we use our supply chain expertise to transport their products from the country of origin to our distribution centers.\nThis helps our vendors and increases our inventory visibility and scale.\nWe've been investing in our advertising business, building new capabilities to help vendors effectively reach our customers.\nBest Buy's relevance, customer relationships, and first-party data have grown along with customers' technology needs and our ability to meet them.\nThese are examples of value we can provide to vendor partners that many other retailers cannot.\nWhile focusing on our core consumer electronics and appliance categories, we're expanding our assortment in newer categories where we can leverage our ability to commercialize new technology.\nWe've created a robust online experience for electric transportation, with sales in this category more than doubling in Q3.\nWe're expanding our online assortment of electric bikes fourfold and plan to stock them in physical stores next year.\nWe're expanding our assortment in categories like outdoor living as more consumers look to upgrade their outdoor spaces.\nWe recently acquired Yardbird, a leading direct-to-consumer company specializing in premium sustainable outdoor furniture.\nWe're excited to use our merchandising and supply chain expertise to scale this business online and in physical locations nationwide.\nWe also made an exciting acquisition in the health space.\nOur Best Buy Health strategy focuses on three areas: consumer health, active aging, and virtual care.\nTo accelerate our work in virtual care, we acquired Current Health, which developed a leading remote patient monitoring platform.\nWith their platform and Best Buy's scale and expertise, we aim to create a comprehensive care ecosystem for customers' healthcare needs.\nWhile the healthcare industry is evolving quickly, it adopts new practices more slowly than other industries like retail.\nVirtual care is a nascent space with significant potential, but it will take time and investment to develop and scale our offerings.\nTechnology developments are driving initiatives across our company.\nWe're investing significantly in technology to transform our operations and customer service.\nWe're using electronic sign labels to highlight member pricing and product availability in stores.\nWe've launched communication enhancements for our appliance delivery service, allowing customers to track their deliveries in real-time.\nWe're piloting next-day delivery of appliances and large TVs in select markets.\nWe're

are just a few examples of how our digital and technology teams are improving customer and employee experiences.\nWe're also investing in fundamental technology capabilities like data analytics and cloud migration to drive efficiency and effectiveness.\nI want to express my gratitude to our employees who have dealt with rapidly changing store operations during the pandemic.\nThey've created safe environments for customers and provided excellent service despite challenging circumstances.\nWe've increased the number of pilots and tests in the field as we evolve our operating model, introducing significant change.\nI'm grateful for our associates' dedication and resourcefulness.\nOur in-store Net Promoter Score in Q3 increased compared to last year and two years ago, despite these disruptions.\nRegarding our ESG efforts, we recently announced our founding membership in the Race to Zero initiative, aiming to accelerate climate action in the retail industry.\nThis builds on our existing efforts to reduce our carbon footprint.\nWe've made significant progress in reducing our emissions by 61% since 2009 and aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040.\nOur focus has shifted towards implementing circular economy principles in our operations and with our customers.\nIn the third quarter, we successfully collected and recycled over 48 million pounds of electronic devices, preventing them from ending up in landfills.\nLast quarter, we helped customers reduce their carbon footprint and save on energy bills by selling more than 5 million ENERGY STAR-certified products.\nWe extended the life of over 600,000 devices through our trade-in program, repair services, and outlet stores, keeping them out of landfills.\nThese efforts are highly valued by our customers and vendors, and our capabilities in this area are unmatched in scale and scope.\nOur year-to-date performance has been exceptional, and I'm incredibly proud of our teams' execution.\nWe're anticipating a strong holiday season, well-equipped with popular tech products and convenient delivery options.\nWe introduced some Black Friday deals in mid-October with a price guarantee, and recently made almost all Black Friday deals available.\nWe're offering free next-day delivery on thousands of items throughout the holiday season.\nCustomers can also conveniently pick up their purchases in-store or curbside.\nLooking ahead, we recognize the significant and lasting changes in consumer behavior.\nNew terms like \"home nesting\" and \"virtual care\" have emerged to describe how our homes have become central to our lives, affecting how we work, entertain, receive healthcare, and connect.\nThere has been a substantial increase in the adoption of technology associated with this lifestyle shift.\nWe're observing shorter upgrade cycles as technology evolves and people continually optimize their home environments.\nThe demand for convenience and personalized experiences has driven rapid change.\nWe've consistently believed that true omnichannel retailing would create unique experiences allowing us to engage and retain customers seamlessly.\nWe've continuously invested in these experiences, defining omnichannel beyond just stores and online to include our unique service, virtual, and in-home capabilities.\nWe're confident that technology will play an increasingly important role in consumers' lives.\nGiven our current and future omnichannel capabilities, we're well-positioned to capitalize on a larger, more diverse consumer electronics market and serve customers who will use and upgrade their devices more frequently.\nWe plan to share more details about our initiatives, financial model, and long-term targets at an investor event next March.\nOur strong financial results reaffirm our belief in technology's growing importance and our unique position to serve customers.\nWe achieved positive comparable sales growth in each month of the third quarter, despite comparing against last year's extraordinary 23% growth.\nOur enterprise revenue of $11.9 billion exceeded our guidance, driven by better-than-expected comparable sales growth of 1.6%.\nOur non-GAAP gross profit rate and SG&A expense were in line with expectations.\nCompared to last year, enterprise revenue grew by $57 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased by $0.02 to $2.08, with a lower share count providing a $0.12 per share benefit.\nOur non-GAAP operating income rate decreased by 30 basis points to 5.8% due to investments in our new Totaltech membership.\nCompared to two years ago, total revenue grew by over 20%, with domestic store revenue remaining flat and online revenue growing by almost 150%.\nOur enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate was 160 basis points higher this quarter than two years ago.\nIn our domestic segment, revenue increased by 1.2% to nearly $11 billion, driven by a 2% comparable sales increase, partially offset by store closures.\nThe main contributors to comp sales growth were appliances, home theater, and mobile phones.\nComputing sales were slightly down year-over-year but still up nearly $1 billion from two years ago.\nServices comparable sales declined by 5.6%, primarily due to our new Totaltech membership, which includes previously stand-alone revenue-generating services.\nIn our International segment, revenue decreased by 7.8% to $925 million, mainly due to exiting Mexico and a 3% comparable sales decline in Canada, partially offset by foreign currency benefits.\nThe domestic gross profit rate decreased by 60 basis points to 23.4%, due to lower profit margin rates and services margin rates, partially offset by higher profit sharing revenue from credit card arrangements.\nThe international non-GAAP gross profit rate increased by 240 basis points to 25%, driven by improved product margin rates in Canada and the exit from Mexico.\nDomestic non-GAAP SG&A increased by $9 million but improved by 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue, with higher advertising and technology investments offset by last year's donation and lower incentive compensation.\nWe ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in cash and a 15% higher inventory balance than last year.\nWe completed acquisitions of Current Health and Yardbird for approximately $485 million, funded with cash.\nWe returned $577 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nFor Q4, we expect comparable sales growth between -2% and +1%, a non-GAAP profit rate about 30 basis points below last year, and an 8% increase in non-GAAP SG&A dollars.\nFor the full year, we expect enterprise revenue between $51.8 billion and $52.3 billion, comparable sales growth of 10.5% to 11.5%, a slightly higher non-GAAP gross profit rate than last year, and SG&A growth of approximately 9.5%.\nWe anticipate a non-GAAP effective tax rate of about 20% and capital expenditures between $800 million and $850 million.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Our strategy execution continues to progress as we reshape and position the company for long-term, profitable growth, as evidenced by our second quarter results.\nConsolidated revenues saw a 1% sequential increase to $142 million, driven by a 28% rise in international Fluids Systems and 15% growth in Industrial Solutions rental and service revenues, which offset the anticipated decrease in Industrial Solution product sales mentioned in our previous call.\nThe second quarter yielded $7 million in EBITDA.\nLet's examine the segment details.\nOur diversification efforts in the Industrial Solutions business are proving valuable as we expand our reach in power transmission and other industrial markets.\nAs expected, following an exceptionally strong first quarter in product sales, segment revenues decreased 15% sequentially to $45 million in Q2, with site access product sales dropping to $10 million.\nThe product sales decline was partly counterbalanced by a 15% sequential increase in rental and service revenues, which contributed $33 million in Q2, including a record $25 million from power transmission and other industrial markets, showing strong performance in both the US and UK.\nIndustrial Blending revenues fell to $2 million in Q2, reflecting the expected impact of product transition with our main customer.\nThe lower revenue led to a slight decrease in Industrial Solutions operating margins to 22% in Q2, generating $15 million of EBITDA.\nLooking at our first half 2021 performance, it's noteworthy that power transmission and other industrial markets contributed $75 million to our Site and Access Solutions revenues.\nThis $150 million annualized run rate represents a 30% improvement over the 2018 peak of $115 million, demonstrating our continued market penetration progress.\nMeanwhile, our traditional upstream oil and gas market accounted for less than 20% of first half 2021 segment revenues, reflecting reduced industry activity and our focus on more stable industrial markets.\nIn the Fluids Systems segment, revenues increased 11% sequentially, benefiting from project initiations and early recovery signs in certain international markets following COVID-related disruptions in the previous four quarters.\nOur international revenues grew 28% sequentially to $35 million in Q2, primarily due to improvements in Europe and North Africa.\nIn North America, revenues saw a modest increase to $62 million, with a 19% improvement in the US largely offset by the seasonal decline in Canada.\nDespite revenue growth and positive earnings from our international operations, the Fluids segment remained below EBITDA breakeven in Q2, affected by high operating expenses, including employee severance and ongoing inventory rationalization costs.\nThe quarter was also impacted by an unfavorable sales mix on US land, which we expect to normalize in the future.\nWe secured two significant fluids contracts in Q2, including a three-year award in Thailand for land-based drilling and completion fluids, marking our entry into the Southeast Asian market.\nThis contract is expected to generate approximately $25 million in revenue over three years, with work commencing in Q3.\nAdditionally, we won a contract in the Gulf of Mexico to continue providing drilling fluids, reservoir drilling fluids, and related services for two deepwater drillships, anticipated to generate about $30 million in annual revenue.\nWe believe these contract awards result from our ongoing focus on providing advanced technology and exceptional customer service.\nAs global energy market activity improves, we are well-positioned to capture our share of the value chain while restructuring our costs to drive profitable growth and deliver satisfactory returns on capital.\nI'll now pass the call to Gregg for a more detailed financial analysis of the second quarter.\nI'll start by detailing the segment and consolidated financial results for the quarter before providing an update on our short-term outlook.\nIndustrial Solutions segment total revenues decreased 15% sequentially to $45 million in Q2, comprising $43 million from Site and Access Solutions and $2 million from Industrial Blending.\nThe sequential decline primarily reflects the anticipated $10 million reduction in product sales following the exceptionally strong Q1 performance, along with a $3 million decrease in Industrial Blending product sales.\nRental and service revenues grew 15% sequentially, reaching $33 million in Q2, our strongest quarter in nearly two years.\nThe sequential growth was driven by strong demand in both the US and UK, with the US benefiting from several large-scale utility projects completed in Q2.\nDue to the $8 million revenue decline, Industrial Solutions segment operating income fell by $3 million sequentially to $10 million, contributing $15 million of EBITDA in Q2.\nCompared to Q2 of last year, Site and Access Solutions business revenues increased by $16 million or 59%.\nThis increase includes an $11 million or 50% improvement in rental and service revenues and a $5 million increase in product sales.\nExamining the first half of 2021 for Industrial Solutions, we continue to see a significant shift in our segment revenue mix.\nSpecifically, the power transmission market now contributes over half of our Industrial Solutions segment revenues, while our historical E&P market activity accounts for less than 20%.\nShifting our focus to Fluids Systems.\nThe segment's total revenue grew by 11% sequentially, reaching $97 million in Q2.\nIncome from U.S. land operations increased by $10 million or 24% sequentially, benefiting from a 16% rise in market rig count and an expanded market share of about 20%.\nEvery U.S. land region contributed to the sequential revenue growth.\nRevenue from the Gulf of Mexico slightly decreased, contributing $8 million in Q2.\nIn Canada, revenue followed the usual seasonal pattern during spring breakup, dropping 61% sequentially to $5 million in Q2.\nOutside North America, we're beginning to observe early signs of recovery, especially in Europe and North Africa.\nInternational revenue grew by $8 million sequentially to $35 million in Q2 as delayed projects resumed, though COVID-related restrictions continue to hamper customer activity, particularly in the Middle East.\nWhile our international Fluids business performance met expectations, our U.S. operations were negatively affected by higher expenses and an unfavorable sales mix in the quarter.\nCompared to last year, our Fluids Systems revenue increased by $22 million or 30%.\nU.S. land revenue rose by $21 million or 74%, significantly outpacing the 16% increase in market rig count during this period.\nThe substantial revenue growth mainly reflects our increased market share, improved customer spending per well, higher barite sales, and continued expansion into stimulation chemicals.\nGulf of Mexico revenue declined by $6 million or 44% year-over-year, primarily due to changes in customer drilling and completion plans, including a strong contribution from completion fluids in the previous year's quarter.\nInternational revenue improved by $6 million or 22% year-over-year, benefiting from new project initiations and recovering customer activity in several European markets and Algeria, while the Middle East remains about $2 million below last year's levels due to ongoing COVID challenges.\nSG&A costs totaled $23 million in Q2, including $6.9 million in corporate office expenses, reflecting a $2 million increase from both the previous quarter and Q2 of last year.\nThe sequential and year-over-year increase is mainly due to higher long-term incentive expenses, including awards tied to our relative share price performance, as well as the April 1 reinstatement of certain austerity measures, such as company matching contributions to our U.S. retirement plan.\nInterest expense slightly decreased to $2.2 million in Q2, with nearly half representing non-cash amortization of facility fees and discounts.\nOur weighted average cash borrowing rate on outstanding debt is approximately 3.5%.\nQ2 includes a $400,000 income tax expense despite reporting a pre-tax loss.\nWe are currently unable to recognize tax benefits on our U.S. losses, so the income tax expense primarily reflects taxes on foreign earnings.\nOur net loss in Q2 was $0.07 per share, compared to a net loss of $0.06 per share in Q1 and a net loss of $0.29 per share in Q2 of last year, which included $0.09 of charges.\nShifting to cash flow.\nNet working capital changes used $7 million of cash in Q2 as we saw DSOs return to a more typical level from the unusually strong performance in the previous quarter.\nWith higher working capital, cash used in operating activities was a modest $2 million for the quarter.\nInvesting activities again used less than $1 million of cash in Q2, with $2 million of capital investments largely offset by proceeds from sales of used mats from our rental fleet and other underutilized assets.\nWe concluded Q2 with a total debt balance of $78 million and a cash balance of $35 million, resulting in a modest 14% debt to capital ratio and 8% net debt to capital ratio.\nConsequently, the convertible notes are now classified as long-term debt in the June 30, 2021 balance sheet.\nNow focusing on our near-term outlook.\nLooking ahead, we are encouraged by improving long-term fundamentals in both business segments, but we continue to face significant inflationary pressures on raw materials and transportation.\nWe are also closely monitoring the evolving situation with COVID variants worldwide.\nIn the Site and Access Solutions business, while we are pleased with the strong growth rate in targeted end markets, we expect near-term market activity in the utility sector to experience the typical seasonal slowdown seen in past years as utility companies reduce project activity during periods of high electricity demand associated with elevated summer temperatures.\nAlthough we continue to execute our geographic expansion efforts, we anticipate that Q3 rental and service revenues will return to near Q1 levels.\nLooking beyond Q3, we remain encouraged by the robust pipeline of opportunities as we execute our growth strategy.\nRegarding product sales, while sales timing is unpredictable, we anticipate revenues to remain stable compared to Q2 in the short term, with the fourth quarter likely benefiting from increased utility sector activity at year-end.\nWe anticipate a slight decrease in Q3 revenues for the Industrial Solutions segment, expecting them to be around $40 million.\nDue to a seasonal decline in rental project activity and ongoing growth strategy investments, we predict operating margins will drop to the low to mid-teens in the third quarter, likely representing the year's weakest quarterly results.\nAfter Q3, we expect both revenues and operating margin to improve in Q4, driven by year-end product sales demand and our increasing presence in power transmission and other industrial markets.\nIn Fluids Systems, we anticipate our international markets will continue to recover in the latter half of 2021, eventually returning to pre-COVID levels by year-end.\nDue to lingering COVID effects, particularly in the Middle East, we expect international revenues to increase by approximately 10% in Q3, with a more significant improvement in Q4.\nWe also anticipate strong quarter-over-quarter growth in North America in Q3, led by a robust recovery in Canada from the seasonal low and continued improvements in U.S. land operations.\nFor the Gulf of Mexico, we expect Q3 revenues to remain similar to the second quarter, as the start-up of a second deepwater drillship in Q3 will likely offset the decline in completion fluids products excluded from the recent contract award.\nOverall, we anticipate our Fluids segment revenues will grow by a low-teens percentage in Q3, potentially bringing the segment close to breakeven operating income for the quarter, with a return to positive income expected in Q4.\nRegarding capital expenditures, we expect spending to remain relatively limited in the near term, with investments focused on growth opportunities within the Industrial Solutions segment.\nWe anticipate corporate office expenses to increase by approximately $1 million from Q2 levels, mainly due to the timing of long-term performance-based incentive expenses and the full removal of salary austerity measures implemented in 2020.\nI am satisfied with the ongoing progress we made in the second quarter.\nLooking forward, we face clear market challenges, including significant cost inflation and uncertainty regarding the impact of COVID variants worldwide.\nNevertheless, we remain optimistic about the long-term market fundamentals in all key industries we serve, which we believe offers opportunities for sustainable and profitable growth over time.\nFurthermore, with our low debt level and capital-light Fluids business model, we are well-positioned to fund growth objectives and generate strong free cash flow in the long run.\nOur main priorities remain unchanged, starting with the expansion and diversification of the Industrial Solutions business.\nAs we continue to implement our strategy, we are pleased with the growing market recognition of our unique value proposition in the multi-billion dollar power transmission market.\nBenefiting from strong utility sector growth, our Industrial Solutions segment contributed 35% of our first-half revenues while consistently generating strong profitability and returns.\nExpanding this business remains our top priority, including broadening our geographical reach and investing in necessary capital to support our targeted growth plans.\nRegarding Industrial Blending operations, while we are disappointed by the change in outlook from our primary customer for disinfectants and cleaning products demand, it's important to note that we view this reduction in near-term demand as a typical challenge for a new business.\nOver the past year, the surge in cleaning product demand related to COVID provided us an opportunity to quickly enter the Industrial Blending market and showcase our agility and capabilities.\nDuring a period of extreme urgency, our ability to act quickly, execute every aspect of the manufacturing process, and deliver quality, consistent products was highly praised by our customers.\nOur immediate priority for this business remains unchanged: to leverage our proven capabilities to build a diversified industrial and specialty chemical blending business.\nIn Fluids Systems, we are proud of our global team's efforts in reshaping the business while maintaining high-quality service for our customers.\nInternationally, with the worst of COVID hopefully behind us, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from what many expect to be a strong multi-year growth cycle.\nIt's worth noting that before COVID, our international operations maintained a long history of stable and profitable performance.\nDespite the challenges of the past 18 months, we've continued to strengthen our global relationships, expanding in key markets where we expect to play a significant role in the future.\nWe've also added to our extensive experience in geothermal drilling, a small but growing area that we believe will benefit from the energy transition.\nWe expect our international Fluids growth will outpace the North American market in the coming years, driven primarily by our extensive geographical footprint in the EMEA region and our expanding presence in Asia Pacific.\nIn the U.S. Fluids business, while the market outlook continues to improve, we are taking further actions to adjust the business for what we expect to remain a structurally smaller market in the future.\nAdditionally, with the U.S. oil and gas industry now benefiting from stronger commodity prices, our near-term focus also includes implementing much-needed price increases.\nWe expect both our cost and pricing actions in U.S. land operations will continue through the second half of the year as we aim to generate consistent cash flow and acceptable return on invested capital.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Fresh variables surface periodically, making it impossible to anticipate every potential factor.\nDuring our discussion today, Allan will highlight key points from Q3, discuss our pandemic response and the robust new home market, then summarize our strategic goals for upcoming quarters.\nBob will provide a more detailed analysis of our Q3 performance and share our projections for Q4 and the entire year.\nI'll return to update you on our land expenditures and financial position, after which Allan will conclude.\nOur Q3 financial performance was exceptional, with growth in both home completions and profit margins resulting in nearly 40% expansion in adjusted EBITDA.\nWe also recorded our highest Q3 net income in over a decade.\nRegarding sales, after enduring challenging conditions in April, we saw improved demand in May, which intensified in June, leading to our strongest June sales rate in ten years.\nThese combined results have set us up for a robust conclusion to our fiscal year.\nIn our previous update, we outlined our initial pandemic response, emphasizing our focus on the wellbeing of our staff, customers, and business partners.\nThis remains our top concern, influencing every aspect of our operations.\nBeyond our safety measures, throughout Q3, we evaluated and modified numerous operational and financial practices.\nThese adjustments yielded three main outcomes.\nFirstly, we maintained liquidity by keeping our credit line fully drawn until quarter's end.\nAlthough this increased our interest costs for the quarter, it ensured we had ample cash to handle any potential disruptions in closings.\nWith strong sales and a clearer operational outlook, we've fully repaid the credit line and don't plan to use it except for seasonal liquidity needs.\nSecondly, we temporarily halted land acquisitions to apply new COVID-related risk criteria to our assessments.\nThis brief pause in land spending contributed to increased liquidity during the quarter.\nMore importantly, it allowed us to reevaluate every proposed deal against new risks to employment, household income, and supply.\nWhile this review led us to abandon a few positions, we were able to confirm and renegotiate most pending transactions.\nMoving forward, we're confident our land pipeline supports our growth objectives.\nThirdly, we enhanced the company's cost structure.\nAs we adapted to a new work environment, we identified opportunities to improve our cost structure without compromising our ability to sell and construct an increasing number of homes in the coming quarters.\nThis was crucial to us as we observed demand rebounding rapidly.\nBefore the COVID-19 outbreak, the new home market was thriving, supported by wage growth, low unemployment, low mortgage rates, limited housing supply, and high consumer confidence.\nIn late March, the pandemic disrupted this momentum.\nIn April, industry-wide demand plummeted.\nHowever, as you've heard and read, housing demand began recovering swiftly, and by June, was arguably stronger than before the pandemic.\nThis raises two critical questions for both you and us.\nWhat caused this unexpected increase in demand?\nIs this trend sustainable over time?\nThe answers will become clear as time passes.\nHere's our perspective on what's driving it and why it might continue.\nMortgage rates, already low, have decreased even further.\nThis benefits buyers by enhancing affordability and making new homes more accessible to all buyer groups, particularly first-time homeowners.\nThe shift to remote work and education has prompted a significant reevaluation of housing requirements.\nCustomers are informing us that new homes offer important benefits over most apartments and existing houses, including additional space, more adaptable layouts, and improved outdoor living areas, as well as being move-in ready without requiring expensive cleaning or time-consuming renovations.\nThe move towards remote work seems to be long-lasting.\nDespite some difficulties associated with working from home, both workers and companies have experienced a substantial productivity boost due to the elimination of commuting time.\nKnowledge workers, in particular, can work from various locations, which is likely to increase demand for new homes.\nThis could be the turning point that demographers have anticipated for years, marking the moment when homeownership-resistant millennials recognize the inevitability and desirability of owning a home.\nWhile this observation is more speculative, millennials make up about 25% of the U.S. population, so their housing preferences must be closely monitored.\nDespite the numerous challenges posed by the pandemic, we see no reason to alter our long-term balanced growth strategy, which aims for a double-digit return on assets by increasing EBITDA faster than revenue from a more efficient and less leveraged balance sheet.\nAs we convert our long-term assets into cash and increase the proportion of lots controlled through options, we will generate sufficient liquidity to both expand the business and continue reducing our long-term debt to below $1 billion.\nTo conclude, I want to express our company's support for eradicating prejudice, discrimination, and injustice in our nation.\nWe have shared on social media platforms a letter I wrote to our employees expressing both my personal views and our company's commitment to addressing these issues within our organization and in our communities.\nI am extremely pleased with our team's enthusiasm to learn about and openly discuss these matters.\nWe are implementing measures that will allow us to share the advantages of greater inclusion and diversity with our employees, customers, business partners, and shareholders.\nI am confident that our efforts can make a positive impact.\nAs Allan mentioned earlier, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased by nearly 40% compared to the previous year, reaching $54 million.\nThis performance was driven by strong results across our key metrics.\nSpecifically, compared to last year, we increased homebuilding revenue by 10% to $532.5 million, benefiting from an 8% rise in closings along with a 3% increase in our Average Selling Price (ASP).\nOur gross margin, excluding amortized interest, impairments, and abandonments, improved by approximately 180 basis points to 21.2%, driven by higher margins on spec homes and our ongoing efforts to simplify products and reduce incentives.\nThis margin excludes $2.3 million in impairments and abandonments related to our reunderwriting process.\nSelling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased by 50 basis points to 11.7%, even with $1.4 million in one-time charges associated with improving our ongoing cost structure.\nTotal GAAP interest expense increased by about $2.1 million, primarily due to our decision to maintain a fully drawn revolver for nearly the entire quarter for liquidity purposes.\nNevertheless, our cash interest expense decreased by $3.7 million as a result of our previous debt retirements and refinancing activities.\nOur quarterly tax expenditure amounted to approximately $5 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 24%.\nWe generated $15.3 million in net income from ongoing operations, or $0.51 per share this quarter, which is an increase of $3.6 million compared to the previous year.\nWith improved market visibility, we are now able to provide guidance on our expectations for the full year and fourth quarter.\nWe anticipate adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2020 to increase by 5% to 10% compared to the previous year, with significant gross margin improvement compensating for the reduced number of home closings.\nThis would mark our second-highest EBITDA performance in ten years.\nThe pandemic has affected various operational metrics in the fourth quarter, particularly in terms of timing.\nFor instance, our starting backlog is roughly the same as last year, but the completion stages differ significantly.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak influenced the timing of both orders and spec starts during the quarter, resulting in a larger portion of this backlog being delivered in the first quarter of fiscal '21 instead of the fourth quarter of this year.\nConsequently, we expect our backlog conversion ratio to be in the low-70% range, as opposed to the high-80% range of last year.\nOur margin projections reflect the strong demand observed during the third quarter and our efforts to reduce costs.\nWe anticipate gross margins to increase by at least 100 basis points to approximately 21%, and SG&A expenses to decrease by more than 5% in absolute dollar terms.\nWith our reassessment completed, we expect cash expenditure on land to accelerate, likely surpassing $100 million.\nAt the start of the third quarter, we possessed or controlled over three years' worth of land supply based on our trailing 12-month closings.\nThis position allowed us to temporarily halt land spending, evaluate the demand environment, and reassess ongoing land deals.\nThis process resulted in modest land acquisition and development expenditures during the quarter, totaling just under $56 million.\nHaving completed our reassessment process and observed improvements in demand, we have resumed our regular land acquisition and development activities and expect to return to more normal spending levels in our fiscal fourth quarter and into fiscal 2021.\nNaturally, we will maintain a disciplined approach given the ongoing spread of the coronavirus and the potential long-term economic impacts of the pandemic.\nOur strategy involves maintaining a land position representing at least three years' supply, with an increasing portion controlled through options, enabling us to better leverage our spending, enhance return on assets, and mitigate risk.\nWe concluded the third quarter with over $400 million in liquidity, more than twice the amount at this point last year.\nThis included more than $150 million in unrestricted cash and no outstanding balance on our credit line.\nWith a resilient business model that balances pre-sold and spec homes, and an expanding land position supported by a larger share of options, we anticipate generating sufficient liquidity to both reduce our debt and grow our business in the coming years.\nWe have no major debt maturities until 2025, and our clearly defined deleveraging plan includes $50 million term loan repayments annually for the next three years.\nFollowing our upcoming September repayment, we will have just over $100 million remaining to achieve our goal of reducing our total debt to below $1 billion.\nThe third quarter of fiscal 2020 was highly successful.\nWe increased the number of closings and improved margins, driving growth in both revenue and profitability.\nWe also implemented measures to enhance our business operations and ongoing cost structure.\nThese results, combined with the strong sales momentum we experienced in the latter half of the quarter, position us to achieve the objectives of our balanced growth strategy.\nWhile operating during the pandemic has presented and will continue to present numerous challenges, I am extremely proud of our team for taking decisive actions to enhance long-term shareholder value.\nTheir efforts give me confidence that we have the right people, strategy, and resources to navigate this dynamic environment and execute our plan in the coming years.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I will provide a comprehensive overview of our overall performance for the quarter.\nOur remarks will be based on adjusted figures, and all comparisons will be made to the third quarter of fiscal 2021 unless stated otherwise.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2022, RPM achieved unprecedented consolidated EBIT and sales, despite challenging year-over-year comparisons.\nThese achievements were made possible by our global team members who persevered through extremely difficult operational conditions, including persistent raw material and workforce shortages, significant disruptions related to the Omicron variant during the third quarter, and substantial increases in wages and transportation costs.\nThe growth in our consolidated adjusted EBIT was propelled by three of our four divisions: construction products, performance coatings, and specialty products, which successfully converted price adjustments and operational enhancements into improved bottom-line results.\nThe consumer group stands out as an exception.\nWith our primary raw material expenses increasing by over 40% on average compared to last year, our consumer group will need to implement substantial price increases, which are scheduled for the end of this month.\nWe've acted swiftly to address supply chain issues by rapidly expanding in-house resin production at a manufacturing facility we acquired in September.\nFurthermore, our ongoing investments in the fastest-growing sectors of our business have resulted in accelerated growth for our high-performance building, construction, and coating systems.\nConstruction and industrial maintenance activities are thriving, energy markets have rebounded, and consumer demand remains robust.\nThanks to three years of exceptional effort by our team members in implementing our MAP to Growth operational improvement program, we've made structural enhancements to RPM while preserving our entrepreneurial culture, which is fundamental to RPM's success.\nConsequently, our performance coatings group and construction products group are operating at unprecedented levels of sales, EBIT, and margins in the third quarter.\nOur specialty products group is moving towards similar performance with record sales and EBIT, and improving profit margins.\nWe're also making significant progress in our consumer business.\nIn summary, we're taking an offensive approach nearly everywhere, investing in accelerating organic growth, substantial increases in capital expansion, particularly in areas such as Nudura ICF, roof restoration coatings, and several of our consumer product lines, all of which are building positive momentum as we enter the fourth quarter and transition into fiscal 2023.\nIn the third quarter, we generated total net sales of $1.43 billion, representing a 13% increase compared to the $1.27 billion reported in the same quarter of fiscal 2021.\nOrganic sales growth was 13.4% or $170.1 million.\nAcquisitions contributed 1.4% to sales or $17.8 million, while foreign exchange had a negative impact, reducing sales by 1.8% or $23.4 million.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share remained steady at $0.38, matching the figure from the same quarter last year.\nOur consolidated adjusted EBIT increased by 0.8% to a record $80.6 million, compared to $79.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021.\nComparing fiscal Q3 '22 to the pre-pandemic Q3 of FY '20, sales, EBIT, adjusted EBIT, net income, diluted EPS, and adjusted diluted earnings per share all experienced double- or triple-digit growth.\nSimilar to the first and second quarters of fiscal '22, our third quarter results demonstrate the advantages of our diversified business portfolio, where weakness in one segment is generally counterbalanced by strength in others.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2022, three of our four operating segments - construction products group, performance coatings group, and specialty products group - achieved strong double-digit sales growth.\nCombined sales in these three segments rose by 19%, while sales in the Consumer segment increased slightly.\nExcluding the Consumer segment, the rest of RPM delivered exceptional adjusted EBIT growth of 97%.\nOur consumer group continued to be disproportionately affected by inflation and Omicron-related labor and supply chain disruptions, particularly during December and January.\nThe fluctuation in availability led to inefficiencies and continued to adversely affect conversion expenses, causing a fourth consecutive quarterly decrease in adjusted EBIT for our consumer division.\nWe will discuss the steps we're implementing to tackle these issues impacting this division later in the presentation.\nOur construction products division achieved record-breaking third quarter net sales of $482 million, representing a 21.7% increase compared to the same period in fiscal 2021.\nInternal sales growth was 23.2%, while acquisitions contributed 2.2% to the increase.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted sales by 3.7%.\nThe construction products group's record revenue growth was primarily attributed to the division's success in marketing its unique restoration solutions, which offer specific benefits compared to new construction given the current shortages in raw materials and labor.\nThese ongoing challenges have also accelerated the adoption of the division's innovative building envelope products.\nThe fastest-growing businesses within the construction products group are those offering roofing systems, insulated concrete forms, commercial sealants, concrete admixtures, and repair products.\nThe division's international operations achieved strong revenue growth in local currencies, which was diminished by the strengthening U.S. dollar.\nThe construction products group's adjusted EBIT for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 increased by 89.7% to a record $35.1 million.\nDespite facing a challenging comparison to the previous year, the construction products group managed to significantly increase both adjusted EBIT and EBIT margin to record levels for the third quarter, due to improved product mix, volume growth, and operational enhancements.\nThese factors, combined with price increases, helped offset the impact of higher raw material costs.\nOur performance coatings group achieved record net sales of $270.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, representing a 19.6% increase compared to the same period last year.\nOrganic sales grew by 17.8% and acquisitions contributed 3.4%, which were partially offset by a 1.6% negative impact from foreign currency translation.\nThe performance coatings group maintained its momentum with all North American businesses achieving double-digit organic sales growth.\nThe group's businesses in emerging markets experienced rapid growth, while its European companies continued their steady recovery.\nThe strong top-line performance was driven by increased industrial maintenance spending, recovery in energy markets, and price increases.\nThe best-performing businesses within the performance coatings group were those providing polymer flooring systems, corrosion control coatings, and raised flooring systems.\nAdjusted EBIT increased by 89.9% to a record $26.8 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2022.\nThe increase in adjusted EBIT was attributed to volume growth, operational improvements, and a more favorable product mix.\nAdditionally, the adjusted EBIT margin reached a record high for the third quarter.\nThe specialty products group reported record net sales of $189.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, an 11.9% increase compared to the same period in fiscal 2021.\nOrganic sales grew by 11.9% and acquisitions added 0.8%, which were offset by a 0.8% negative impact from foreign currency translation.\nThe specialty products group achieved record sales due to strong performance across nearly all of its businesses, with the highest growth coming from those serving OEM and food additive markets.\nFurthermore, this division's sales of disaster restoration equipment rebounded after securing the supply of semiconductor chips and adapting its products to accommodate them.\nThis exemplifies how our businesses rapidly adapt to challenges, showcasing a key advantage of RPM's entrepreneurial culture.\nThis business faced a challenging comparison to the prior-year period when demand for its restoration equipment was unusually high due to Winter Storm Uri.\nAdjusted EBIT reached a new high of $26.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, showing a 5.4% increase compared to the $25.3 million adjusted EBIT from the same period last year\nThe unprecedented adjusted EBIT was primarily attributed to enhancements in operations\nOur consumer division reported record-breaking net sales of $491.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, representing a 2.9% increase from the same quarter in fiscal 2021\nOrganic sales grew by 3.6%, which was partially counteracted by a 0.7% unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates\nAs expected, the segment's revenue growth was partly due to its successful mitigation of severe alkyd resin shortages by utilizing the newly acquired Texas manufacturing facility from September\nDuring the third quarter, unreliable shipping and supply issues, stemming from labor shortages caused by the omicron variant, particularly in December and January, posed challenges to sales and productivity\nThe consumer group also faced a challenging comparison to the previous year's period, when sales surged by 19.8% and adjusted EBIT soared by 48.6% due to heightened demand for home improvement products during the initial phase of the pandemic\nThe third quarter of fiscal 2022 saw adjusted EBIT of $17.2 million, a 63.9% decrease compared to the $47.8 million adjusted EBIT reported in the same period of the previous year\nInflation has had a more significant impact on the consumer group than other RPM segments due to the nature of its products and the markets it serves\nRaw material inflation, in particular, has been the most substantial factor affecting EBIT\nPrice increases and operational improvements partially offset these factors, as the consumer group is currently investing in capacity and process enhancements to meet customer demand and strengthen its supply chain\nThe consumer group continues to implement price increases to catch up with the inflation experienced over the past four quarters\nIt's worth noting that we have substantial liquidity, allowing us to fund internal growth initiatives, make acquisitions, provide cash dividends to investors, and repurchase our shares\nOur strong liquidity position was bolstered by a $300 million bond offering completed in January\nWe also repurchased $15 million of our common stock during the third quarter\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we anticipate that our operations and those of our suppliers will be affected by ongoing supply chain challenges and raw material shortages, which will impact revenues and productivity\nThe strengthening U.S. dollar will negatively affect the translation of our results in international markets\nFurthermore, the war in Ukraine is creating supply and inflationary pressures, which Frank will discuss shortly\nWhile it's too early to determine, rising interest rates may lead to a slowdown in business and consumer spending in the coming months\nDespite these challenges, we expect to generate consolidated sales growth in the low teens for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to a challenging prior-year period when fourth-quarter sales grew by 19.6%\nWe anticipate low-teens sales growth across all four of our operating groups, driven by strategic investments to capitalize on market opportunities and industry trends\nWe project that consolidated adjusted EBIT for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 will increase in the low teens compared to the same period last year when adjusted EBIT rose by 10.6%\nWe expect earnings to continue being affected by raw material, freight, and wage inflation, as well as the impact on sales volumes from operational disruptions caused by raw material shortages\nOur consumer group will be disproportionately impacted by these issues\nThe consumer group's EBIT margins have deteriorated throughout all three quarters of this fiscal year due to inflationary pressures, which have a greater impact on this segment than RPM's other divisions\nWe are continuing efforts to counteract these factors by enhancing operational efficiencies, implementing additional price increases to keep up with inflation, and expanding manufacturing capacity to improve resilience\nSummary: ",

lower carbon energy, particularly in solar power as a key renewable source.\nThe demand for silver in energy applications has been growing steadily.\nAccording to the United States Energy Information

increase in silver demand for energy use.\nThe second point stresses the need for a dependable supply chain to facilitate the transition to solar power.\nThis requires silver to be mined in reliable countries.\nCurrently, the majority of silver is extracted in China, Peru, and Mexico.\nHecla possesses the largest silver reserves of any mining company in the United States and produces over 40% of all silver mined in the country.\nWe are considered the most reliable silver producer.\nOur third point highlights Hecla's outstanding performance in ESG matters, with our employee safety record being 40% better than the national average.\nWe are also carbon neutral for Scope 1 and 2 emissions due to our industry-leading low emissions, which allow us to use offset credits at a minimal cost.\nThe final point, which will be the main focus of this call, is Hecla's excellent operational and financial performance over the past year.\nBeyond our safety and environmental achievements, our most significant accomplishment was implementing the new underhand closed bench (UCB) mining method at Lucky Friday.\nLast year, we extracted 86% of our ore using the UCB method, but we refrained from discussing it until late in the year to ensure we fully understood its effectiveness.\nWe wanted to confirm its ability to improve seismicity management, control dilution, and assess its impact on our workforce.\nWe're now at a stage where we can focus on optimizing the method rather than questioning its viability.\nThe UCB method has clearly proven successful, contributing to a 75% increase in Lucky Friday's silver production compared to 2020.\nWe anticipate a further 20% increase in silver production for 2022, with even more growth expected in 2023 as the mine consistently produces 5 million ounces annually.\nAlthough Lucky Friday has been operating for 80 years, this new mining method represents a fundamental change for the long-standing mine.\nHistorically, Lucky Friday has never sustained production above 2.5 million ounces.\nHowever, with higher grades at deeper levels and the new mining method, production is set to double while costs remain relatively stable.\nAs a result, Lucky Friday is expected to generate two to three times more free cash flow than in the past.\nThis innovative mining method and our commitment to enhancing safety and efficiency allow Lucky Friday to offer growth in silver production without the risk of substantial capital investment.\nIn the current inflationary environment, achieving growth with minimal capital expenditure is rare and significantly reduces risk.\nLauren will provide more details about the method, and I encourage you to review our technical report filed as an exhibit to the 10-K, which describes the method and offers insights into Lucky Friday's robust economics.\nThe addition of a strong Lucky Friday in 2021 contributed to a record financial year, with revenues of $807 million and adjusted EBITDA of $279 million.\nCash flow from operations reached $221 million, while free cash flow was $111 million, marking the second-highest figures in our history.\nOur performance over the past two years has enabled Hecla to generate over $200 million in free cash flow and enhance our common stock dividend policy by lowering the realized silver price threshold to $20 per ounce.\nConsequently, approximately 20% of our free cash flow was distributed to shareholders last year.\nWe invested slightly less than $50 million in drilling, as we resumed our exploration activities at our sites following the slowdown in 2020 due to COVID-19.\nAs a result, our silver reserves increased by 6% compared to the previous year, reaching 200 million ounces, the second-highest in our history.\nGreens Creek's reserves stand at 125 million ounces, their highest level since 2002 and a 12% increase from 2020.\nThe chart on the left illustrates that we not only replaced mining depletion but also converted 26 million ounces of resources to reserves.\nOur gold reserves at the end of 2021 totaled 2.7 million ounces, the second-highest in our history, as shown in the graph on the right.\nWhile our company-wide measured and indicated resources decreased mainly due to reserve conversions, we saw an 8% increase in silver inferred resources, reaching 490 million ounces, with gains at Greens Creek, Lucky Friday, and San Sebastian.\nWe expect to continue growing our reserves and resources, allowing us to maintain our reserve life of over 14 years.\nIn addition to the Lucky Friday technical report, we filed reports for Greens Creek and Casa Berardi to support our reserve estimates.\nThese reports include economic analyses in Section 19, demonstrating the strong economics of the reserves.\nThe analyses assume that the inferred resources we typically mine (5% to 15% of our total production at these two mines) are treated as waste.\nWe've also included summarized information in Section 21, providing our long-term plans that incorporate inferred materials at their expected grade.\nGiven our extensive history with these two mines, we have a good understanding of how they will perform when including inferred material.\nI recommend reviewing both Section 21 and Section 19 for a comprehensive picture.\nI'll now pass the call over to Russell.\nMoving to Slide 7, as Phil mentioned earlier, we generated record revenue exceeding $800 million, with silver contributing 34% and gold accounting for 42%.\nOur revenue was primarily generated by three operations: Greens Creek contributed about 50%, Casa Berardi 30%, and Lucky Friday 16%.\nWe expect Lucky Friday's contribution to increase due to projected production growth.\nOur record revenues and high margins resulted in record adjusted EBITDA of $279 million for the year, leading to a leverage ratio of 1.1 times, well below our target of two times.\nWe achieved the second-highest cash flow from operations at $221 million and free cash flow of $111 million.\nOur consistent strong operational performance has strengthened our balance sheet, starting the year with $210 million in cash and over $440 million in liquidity.\nThe industry has been discussing inflationary pressures on both operating and capital costs.\nHecla is also experiencing inflationary pressures.\nHowever, we expect these factors to have less impact on us compared to the rest of the industry for several reasons.\nPrimarily, we operate high-grade, high-value, low-tonnage underground mines.\nSince we process less rock than others in the industry, our production is less affected by certain cost pressures.\nWe have reduced exposure to rising energy costs as most of our sites' power comes from local utilities using renewable energy sources.\nAdditionally, we don't have any major capital expenditures planned.\nAs shown on Slide 8, our capital expenditures range from $91 million in 2020 to an anticipated $135 million in 2022.\nIn 2021, our total capital and production costs were about $480 million, with $370 million for production and $109 million for capital.\nWe expect our 2022 production costs to be roughly 6% higher than in 2021.\nWhile our 2022 capital spending guidance is slightly higher than 2021, this is mainly due to investment in Lucky Friday.\nA 5% inflation rate would add less than $7 million to the total capital spend.\nOur record revenue generation, strong margins, and consistent capital spending result in strong free cash flow from all our operating mines.\nAll our mines generate positive free cash flow, and company-wide, we produced over $110 million in free cash flow during 2021, the second-highest in company history.\nThis strong and consistent free cash flow generation has increased our cash balance by 60% compared to 2020 and more than tripled it since 2019.\nI'll now hand over to Lauren to discuss operations.\nI'll begin with Slide 11.\nGreens Creek had another successful year, producing 9.2 million ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $3.19 per ounce, below our lower guidance of $3.25 per silver ounce.\nThe cost reduction was due to higher byproduct credits and more favorable treatment charges than initially estimated.\nThe mine's 2021 realized silver margin was about $22 per ounce, a 75% increase from 2020.\nThese high silver margins drive the mine's strong free cash flow generation.\nIn 2021, Greens Creek generated $185 million in free cash flow and over $445 million in the past three years.\nBesides strong operational and financial performance, we increased reserves by 12%, reaching 125 million ounces, the second-highest since 2002.\nThis high-grade, high-margin mine is among the world's best.\nSilver production guidance for 2022 is 8.6 million to 8.9 million ounces due to mining lower grades in the production sequence.\nSilver cash costs are expected to range from $0.75 to $2.50 per ounce, with silver all-in sustaining cost guidance of $6.50 to $8.50 per ounce.\nMoving to Slide 12.\nThe introduction of the UCB mining method and anticipated higher grades at depth have set up Lucky Friday for a strong decade ahead.\nWe're very enthusiastic about the UCB mining method, which is showing significant improvements in managing seismicity and boosting productivity.\nLucky Friday has 75 million ounces in silver reserves, equating to a 17-year reserve mine life plan.\nThe Lucky Friday mine produced 3.6 million ounces of silver in 2021, with nearly one million ounces in the fourth quarter.\n2021 production increased by 75% compared to 2020.\nAll-in sustaining costs for the year were $14.34 per ounce, in line with our guidance.\nThe mine generated $32.7 million in free cash flow for the year, with 86% of tons mined using the UCB method.\nThe mine is expected to produce 4.3 million to 4.6 million ounces of silver in 2022, with cash costs of $0.75 to $2 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs of $7.25 to $9.25 per ounce.\n2022 production is planned to be almost 20% higher than 2021, while the all-in sustaining cost per ounce is expected to decrease by over 30% due to higher production and byproduct credits.\nTurning to Slides 13 and 14, the UCB mining method is a novel, productive technique developed by Hecla to proactively control fault slip seismicity in deep, high-stress narrow-vein mining.\nThe method uses bench drilling and blasting to fragment significant vertical and lateral extensive vein beneath a top cut, along the vein's strike and under engineered backfill.\nThis method doesn't use drop raises or lower mucking drives, which can cause local stress concentrations and increased exposure to seismic events.\nLarge blasts using up to 3,500 pounds of pumped emulsion and programmable electronic detonators fragment up to 350 feet of strike length to a depth of about 30 feet.\nThese large blasts proactively induce fault slip seismicity at the mine during and shortly after the blast.\nThis blasted corridor is then mined underhand for two cuts.\nAs these cuts are mined, little to no blasting is needed to advance them.\nControlling dilution involves supporting the hanging and foot walls as mining progresses through the blasted ore\nThe entire process repeats as stoping moves downward, beneath the fill, within the de-stress zone\nThis method provides better control over fault slip seismic events, greatly enhancing safety\nAdditionally, a significant productivity boost has been achieved by minimizing seismic delays and employing bulk mining techniques\nThe Casa Berardi mine reached a record throughput with the mill processing 4,187 tons daily in 2021\nOur investments in mill optimization continued to yield results in 2021, with mill recoveries improving by four percentage points alongside the increased throughput\nThe mine produced 134,500 ounces of gold for the year at cash costs of $1,125 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs of $1,399 per ounce, generating $13.7 million in free cash flow\nBetween 2019 and 2021, the mine has generated over $100 million in free cash flow\nAlthough our investments in production optimization have been successful, we are experiencing higher costs due to increased mining and processing volumes, contractor expenses, and higher underground maintenance costs\nOur production guidance for the mine in 2022 is 125,000 to 132,000 ounces at cash costs of $1,175 to $1,325 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs of $1,450 to $1,600 per ounce\nIt's worth noting that the mine's reserves increased by 16% to 1.8 million ounces, primarily due to additions at the 160 pit\nWith these reserves, Casa Berardi has a 14-year reserve mine plan\nSlide 17 presents our consolidated production guidance, combining all the individual mine production forecasts Lauren provided and aggregating them\nWe also provide guidance for 2023 and 2024\nLooking ahead, we expect growth in silver production due to high-grade material at Lucky Friday and productivity gains from the UCB method\nThese improvements should lead to expanded margins and increased free cash flow generation at Lucky Friday, potentially placing it among the top third of primary silver mines in terms of cost efficiency\nCasa Berardi will maintain its status as a premier silver asset, continuing to deliver substantial margins and free cash flow\nRegarding the guidance compared to last year, higher zinc prices allow us to mine lower-grade silver while generating similar or better cash flow, as Hecla is the third-largest zinc producer in the United States\nThis explains the slight reduction in production from last year to this year\nWe anticipate a slight increase in gold production over the next few years, with our gold output coming from Casa and Greens Creek\nWe aim to remain a very low-cost silver producer, with our all-in sustaining cost guidance set at $9.75 to $11.75\nFor gold, we're guiding to all-in sustaining costs of $1,450 to $1,600 per ounce, and we'll continue working to improve operations at Casa while addressing inflationary pressures in the Abitibi region\nWe plan to spend approximately $135 million in capital expenditures, slightly higher than previous years, mainly due to new equipment increasing the number of stopes at Lucky Friday\nCost and capital assumptions include COVID management expenses and assume 5% inflation\nWe plan to spend $45 million on exploration and pre-development, with a quarter allocated to Greens Creek and Casa\nBoth properties have programs to identify and test new targets in addition to extending reserves and resources\nThe Nevada program, accounting for about a third of the total, will focus on the two miles of the East Graben Corridor at Midas, where we've had high-grade intersections\nWe'll also complete the pre-development drift and exploration drilling at Hollister's Hatter Graben\nAt San Sebastian, we're exploring deeper mineralization near the mine infrastructure to expand the huge zone type mineralization and mining more for silver and gold in an area called La Roca\nWe're also resuming drilling programs in the Republic and [Inaudible] districts that have been on hold for several years\nWe're taking a new approach with our Montana assets by withdrawing the previous owner's plan of operations for both properties\nWe're submitting a new plan limited to geological and environmental activities for the Montanore site to develop our own modern, innovative mine plan\nRock Creek will only have care and maintenance activities while maintaining our mineral and property rights\nThese properties contain over 300 million ounces of silver and 3 billion pounds of copper\nGiven the growing importance of these metals, we believe this approach will allow production to begin early in the next decade\nOur view on starting production there early in the next decade remains unchanged\nI'd like to take a moment to remember my friend and predecessor, CEO R. Brown, who recently passed away\nArt worked for Hecla for almost 40 years, serving as CEO for nearly half that time\nThe UCB method is just the latest example of Hecla's culture of innovation\nArt kept Hecla at the forefront of new technologies, many of which are now standard in operations worldwide, such as paste backfill and the circular shaft at Lucky Friday\nHis legacy of continuous innovation extends to the automation advances at Greens Creek and Casa Berardi\nHecla wouldn't be the company it is today without him\nPlease keep his family in your thoughts\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Kessel Stelling, the Chairman and CEO, will initiate the conference call.\nJamie Gregory, CFO, and Kevin Blair, President and COO, will provide more comprehensive information afterwards.\nWe request that you restrict yourself to asking only two questions.\nWe'll be referencing non-GAAP financial metrics related to the company's performance during the call.\nKessel Stelling will now take over.\nWe have two primary narratives to discuss today, possibly more.\nThe first concerns our robust core operational performance in the first quarter, both before and after the coronavirus emerged.\nThe second, equally significant story is about our company's strength and adaptability, once again demonstrating our capacity to innovate, execute swiftly, and efficiently manage daily operations while also adjusting priorities and resources to address emerging needs.\nFrom the onset of the COVID-19 health crisis, our team's decisions and actions have been guided by two principles: prioritizing the physical and financial wellbeing of our employees, and doing what's best for our customers.\nWith these principles in mind, we converted our branches to drive-through and appointment-only service in March, and implemented rigorous cleaning, sanitizing, and hygiene protocols at all our company facilities.\nOver 80% of our 5,400 employees are now working remotely, thanks to our IT team's excellent work in quickly repositioning our workforce.\nWe've provided additional paid time off for employees who are ill, quarantining, or dealing with childcare or other related family challenges, and we're offering bonus payments to our hourly staff required to work on-site to serve customers.\nTo assist our customers during this period of financial strain, we're waiving NSF and monthly service fees and offering payment deferrals and other loan relief as appropriate.\nAlthough social distancing has largely eliminated our usual hands-on approach to community service, we're doing our utmost to support needs across our service area, including matching contributions to the American Red Cross, providing financial support for Feeding America, and funding meals for first responders and frontline healthcare workers.\nI'm particularly proud of our team's efforts to deliver Paycheck Protection Program loans to our customers.\nSince the P3 launch on April 3, our team has processed, approved, and funded over $2 billion in loans for 8,300 customers.\nWe continue to process submissions in our pipeline, preparing to fund as many as possible with the additional appropriations made available this week.\nKevin Blair will elaborate on key aspects of our COVID-19 response later in his remarks.\nBefore I discuss first quarter highlights, I want to express our confidence in our ability to navigate through this current crisis and emerge from it in an even stronger position.\nSince the last crisis, our company has consistently taken steps to prepare for an adverse economic environment, including efforts to strengthen management in the key risk areas of capital, credit, and liquidity.\nWe regularly employ stress testing and sensitivity analyses to inform business decisions, and we believe we're well-positioned to withstand an economic downturn such as the one we're facing today.\nRegarding capital, our internal stress testing process gives us confidence in our ability to maintain strong capital ratios in stressed economic environments, and our liquidity position remains robust.\nWe're also evaluating and reprioritizing strategic initiatives under our Synovus Forward program. Kevin Blair will provide more details later in the call on steps we're taking to ensure we're addressing short-term imperatives while also focusing on the right initiatives for strengthening our company long-term.\nI'll briefly review the quarter's highlights on slide four.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.21, compared to $0.98 a year ago.\nThis year-over-year decline was driven by a 225 basis point reduction in the Fed funds rate, the scheduled loss of loan accretion from acquired loans, and a significant increase to the allowance that accounts for the anticipated impact of COVID-19 under the CECL framework.\nWe were very pleased with our core performance fundamentals, including period-end loan growth of $1.1 billion, deposit growth of $1.4 billion, and core transaction deposit growth exceeding $600 million.\nCore net interest income, excluding purchase accounting adjustments, remained flat for the quarter.\nHowever, the core net interest margin declined 5 basis points from the previous quarter, slightly more than our initial expectations due to the more significant reduction in interest rates.\nAdjusted non-interest revenue of $99 million grew $7 million from the fourth quarter, benefiting from significant activity in mortgage, capital markets, and fiduciary businesses.\nThis was despite lower seasonal core banking fees and increased fee waivers as part of our effort to support clients during the COVID-19 disruption.\nAdjusted non-interest expense totaled $271 million for the quarter, up $6 million from the previous quarter, largely due to the $5 million increase in seasonal payroll taxes mentioned during our fourth quarter earnings call.\nWe also incurred an additional $1 million in expenses related to COVID-19 bonus payments for certain frontline team members.\nProvision for credit losses was $159 million, resulting in an allowance for credit losses ratio of 1.39%.\nThese metrics incorporate the impact of COVID-19 and the first quarter of CECL implementation.\nBefore I begin discussing the quarterly performance, I'd like to note that we have withdrawn our 2020 guidance.\nWe will provide some near-term indications of financial performance on key metrics throughout my commentary, and we are committed to re-establishing longer-term targets when the economy stabilizes.\nWe discussed our increased productivity during the fourth quarter call, and it continued into the first quarter with $3.1 billion in total loan production.\nOur Wholesale Banking team onboarded 155 new customers during the quarter, representing $1 billion in new loans.\nIn March, we saw a $300 million increase in line utilization.\nC&I line utilization plateaued at 50% in March as some customers increased drawdowns out of caution related to the economic situation.\nWe are confident in the credit quality of our growth this quarter as we maintained disciplined underwriting.\nIn the second quarter, we expect loans from the Paycheck Protection Program to be the primary driver of loan growth as additional pipelines have declined.\nMarch rate cuts led to loan yields of 4.6%, excluding purchase accounting, a decline of 15 basis points from the prior quarter.\nThe full quarter impact of these March cuts will have a greater effect on average loan yields in the second quarter.\nUnadjusted for hedges, approximately 50% of our loans have floating rates.\nAs previously discussed, we have a hedging program in place to help mitigate the impact of changes in short-term rates on our floating rate loan portfolio.\nAt quarter-end, we had $2.8 billion in receive-fixed swaps associated with these hedges, with an average rate of 1.4% versus one-month LIBOR.\nSlide six shows deposit growth of $1.4 billion, which included continued increases in core transaction deposits of $623 million.\nIn the first quarter, we took advantage of reduced pricing on wholesale broker deposits to increase balances and replace higher-cost single-service deposits.\nWe will continue to monitor these markets for opportunities, and while it remains a dynamic deposit environment, we remain focused on growing our core deposit base and maintaining a prudent liquidity profile.\nRegarding overall deposit pricing, we've certainly seen a response to recent FOMC actions.\nAs you can see, our total interest-bearing costs in March were approximately 30 basis points lower than the average from the prior quarter.\nIn this easing cycle, the FOMC cut their target rate by 225 basis points, and our general expectation is for cycle betas to end in the low to mid-30s as deposits reprice throughout the year.\nAs shown on slide seven, net interest income of $373 million declined $26 million from the prior quarter.\nThe majority of that decline, or $25 million, was attributable to the expected decrease in purchase accounting adjustments.\nThe core net interest margin, which excludes PAA, decreased 5 basis points from the prior quarter to 3.35%.\nLooking into the second quarter, we expect net interest income to remain relatively flat due to significant loan growth associated with P3.\nHowever, this growth, along with the depressed rate environment and an elevated cash position, is expected to weigh on our net interest margin.\nExcluding those impacts, we reiterate that we expect the margin to decline 4 to 5 basis points per 25 basis point decrease.\nWe expect the majority of the impact from March rate cuts to be realized in the second quarter.\nSlide eight shows our continued success in fee revenue generation, which increased to $99 million adjusted.\nThis represents an increase of $7 million from the prior quarter and up $21 million or 27% compared to the previous year.\nWe continue to see diverse strength in our fee revenue business during the first quarter.\nOur mortgage revenue increased by $3 million due to high production and elevated secondary gain on sale margins.\nCapital markets volumes rose $2 million as commercial clients secured lower interest rates on borrowings, while brokerage income grew $1 million from new hires and increased market volatility transactions.\nThese gains more than made up for decreases in areas like service charges on deposit accounts, mainly from lower retail NSF fees.\nHowever, COVID-19 is already affecting customer behavior, including major declines in capital markets activity, reduced debit and credit card transaction volumes, and overall business disruption for commercial clients.\nThis disruption will likely cause fee revenue to drop 15% to 25% in Q2 from our recent $90 million run rate.\nWe anticipate non-interest revenues will increase as the economy stabilizes.\nTurning to slide nine.\nFirst quarter non-interest expense was $276 million, or $271 million adjusted.\nAdjusted expenses rose $6 million from last quarter, aligning with our previous guidance.\nWith COVID-related expenses estimated at $5-6 million in Q2, we expect adjusted expenses to remain stable quarter-over-quarter before declining in the second half of the year.\nAs Kevin will explain shortly, we remain confident our recent efforts to improve operating efficiency will result in long-term positive operating leverage.\nWe are adjusting the timing of our Synovus Forward initiatives to maintain focus on team members, customers and communities.\nThis doesn't change our commitment to the strategy, just the timing.\nSlide 10 shows our credit quality metrics and a summary of our provision for credit losses and allowance.\nNet charge-offs at 21 basis points remain within previous guidance.\nThe NPL ratio increased to 41 basis points, up 1 basis point from last year.\nPast-dues returned to the low end of the recent range at 22 basis points.\nWhile we expect portfolio stress as the current economic environment progresses, we are entering this downturn well-positioned in terms of credit quality, with NPAs, NPLs, past dues and charge-offs at or near cycle lows.\nThe quarter's provision for credit losses and allowance were impacted by CECL adoption on January 1, generally resulting in higher provision for credit losses compared to the incurred loss method.\nAs shown on slide 11, the day one reserve increase was $110 million or 39%.\nWe opted for the five-year transition period for regulatory capital treatment.\nOur 10-K mentioned a two-year reasonable and supportable period for CECL estimates, but we reduced this to one year due to heightened economic uncertainty, followed by a one-year reversion to the mean.\nThe economic deterioration since January 1 due to the health crisis resulted in a higher allowance for credit losses ratio as of March 31st than modeled in the day one CECL implementation, currently at 1.39%.\nOur modeling process incorporates quantitative and qualitative considerations for CECL estimates.\nThe internal economic forecast used for the March 31 allowance was approved on March 20.\nAt that time, the forecast aligned with rating agency and Wall Street predictions.\nBetween approval and quarter-end, further economic deterioration necessitated a qualitative overlay to our allowance.\nThis $37 million overlay added 10 basis points to the allowance, better aligning it with end-of-quarter economic indicators and forecasts.\nSignificant economic uncertainty remains due to the ongoing health crisis and government stimulus efforts.\nIf our June 30 economic outlook resembles recent forecasts, we would expect a further increase in the allowance for credit losses.\nSlide 12 shows capital ratios including CECL impact and applicable regulatory transition periods.\nOur target ratios were determined through internal capital adequacy assessment and include 2019 capital optimization efforts.\nThese ratios give us confidence that we can withstand losses in a severely adverse scenario and remain well-capitalized.\nIn Q1, our CET1 ratio declined to 8.72%, largely due to increased risk-weighted assets, accounting for a 25 basis point reduction.\nStrong PPNR generated 39 basis points of capital, more than offsetting the 21 basis point CECL-related allowance build impact.\nCECL is expected to cause earlier capital ratio degradation in a recession than previous accounting guidance.\nHowever, this allowance provides a significant buffer for future realized losses and allows us to return to capital targets over time.\nThe allowance build is reflected in the total risk-based capital ratio, which increased 6 basis points to 12.31%.\nWe continue to use internal capital management processes based on Dodd-Frank Act stress testing.\nThese processes and our risk appetite framework provide capital preservation strategies for prolonged economic weakness.\nWe will be diligent in balance sheet deployment, prioritizing core customer relationships during this recession.\nThese processes also guide our approach to share repurchases and common equity dividends.\nWe've suspended our previously approved share repurchase program.\nWe continually evaluate our common equity dividend approach through our capital planning process, guided by capital adequacy assessment and long-term earnings projections.\nWe believe a change in the common dividend is not currently warranted.\nWe remain confident in our capital adequacy and continuously assess our long-term earnings outlook.\nLiquidity management remains a priority at Synovus.\nIn Q1, we issued $400 million of bank debt at attractive levels and increased Federal Home Loan Bank collateral by about $2 billion.\nSlide 13 shows we have approximately $14 billion in readily available balance sheet liquidity.\nWe expect loan balances excluding P3 loans to remain fairly flat near-term, but anticipate considerable Q2 growth from P3 lending.\nTo manage risk and maintain existing funding sources for other customer needs, we plan to use the Federal Reserve's P3 lending facility to support funding for at least some of these loans.\nWe believe this is the most effective way to manage our overall liquidity position and mitigate associated capital ratio impacts.\nKevin will now provide more detail on credit portfolios most impacted by COVID, our crisis response, and a Synovus Forward update.\nBefore detailing industries more impacted by COVID-19, let's examine our loan portfolio composition and quality by category, as well as the diversification and derisking benefits realized since the last financial crisis.\nThe chart shows key components of our three portfolio categories, with the bottom right table showing composition shifts since 2009.\nOur $17.7 billion C&I book primarily comprises diverse middle market and commercial banking clients.\nSpecialty divisions like senior housing and premium finance make up about 14% of total loans, contributing significantly to growth with some of the best credit metrics in recent years.\nThe portfolio is well-diversified by industry and geography, with almost 35,000 loans averaging approximately $770,000 in original balance.\nThe $10.7 billion CRE portfolio is 86% income-producing properties, with multifamily, office, shopping center, and hotel being the largest property types.\nWe maintain disciplined concentration management, with our largest CRE loan under $50 million and an average loan size of about $13 million.\nThis diverse portfolio has strong loan-to-value and debt service coverage levels, performing well with net recoveries over the last five quarters.\nThe $10 billion consumer book is nearly 75% mortgage and HELOC, with the remainder in lending partnerships, credit cards, and other consumer loans.\nThe credit score and loan to value statistics indicate this portfolio is prime quality and remains in good health.\nGiven current economic conditions, we anticipate our consumer portfolio will shrink in the short term as we reduce our willingness to provide unsecured loans and purchases from third party partners.\nThe final item I want to highlight on this slide is the considerable progress we've made in diversifying and reducing risk across the entire loan portfolio.\nBetween 2009 and Q1 2020, we have greatly reduced our involvement in one-to-four family residential land and investment properties, as well as commercial real estate overall.\nUsing historical loss rates alone, the restructuring of our portfolio would lead to a 50% decrease in losses.\nWhen considering the impact of a severely adverse scenario, we would expect losses to decrease even more due to improvements in underwriting and portfolio management.\nLet's move on to slide 15.\nWhile we continually assess our entire loan portfolio, we have implemented additional monitoring for the segments shown on slide 15.\nThese segments, totaling $4.6 billion, have been identified as being more directly and immediately affected by the COVID-19 crisis.\nWe are constantly working with our clients to assess how the current economic situation is impacting their business operations and ultimately their cash burn rate.\nWe are using payment deferrals and CARES Act stimulus programs to help alleviate short-term financial pressures.\nStrong underwriting, good credit performance, and improved balance sheets built during the extended growth period give us confidence that these portfolios are in the best possible position entering this downturn.\nYou can find more information about each of these portfolios in the appendix on slides 27 through 29, but I'll discuss a few of them now.\nOver 85% of our hotel portfolio is franchised and primarily consists of non-resort properties, with more than 90% rated upper mid-scale or above.\nThis portfolio has strong credit metrics with an average loan to value of 54% and debt service coverage ratios of 1.9 times.\nWe have approximately $1 billion exposure to shopping centers that are not anchored by grocery stores, pharmacies, or discount retailers.\nDue to our southeastern location, these centers are in markets that have experienced good population and household income growth, providing stability and growth for these businesses.\nAs a result, these portfolios continue to perform well in terms of credit quality.\nThe restaurant portfolio is $800 million, with 56% in limited service restaurants and 40% in full service.\nMore than 60% of our restaurants are franchises with an average loan size at origination of about $1.5 million.\nThe next two industries are non-essential retail trade and arts, entertainment, and recreation, totaling $1.2 billion in outstanding loans.\nBoth portfolios performed well before the crisis and are highly diversified with average loan sizes at origination of $1.8 million and $1.2 million respectively.\nLastly, I'll mention our relatively small exposure to oil-related industries at less than 1% of total loans.\nGiven our five-state footprint, oil is not a major industry, particularly in terms of exploration and production.\nMost of our exposure is in transportation operations and support related to the industry.\nThis portfolio has shown strong credit performance, but given the current state of the oil industry, we are monitoring our exposure more closely.\nOur bankers and credit team continue to work with and advise our customers, ensuring we provide necessary support to mitigate short-term cash flow disruptions.\nLike our entire credit portfolio, each of these portfolios has demonstrated strong performance in recent quarters and years and was as well-positioned as possible entering the current environment.\nThe length of the downturn will ultimately determine the impact on these businesses and how quickly these industries will return to more normal cash flow levels.\nAlthough we introduced our Synovus forward plan in March, we quickly shifted our focus to our COVID response, starting with the safety and well-being of our team members who are crucial in supporting our customers and the communities we serve.\nWe effectively implemented our business continuity plan, allowing our employees to work remotely while maintaining customer-facing roles in our branches and call centers to meet our customers' needs.\nFrankly, our other main concern was the safety and continued service of our customers.\nWhile we continue to practice social distancing, we are here to serve our customers and provide advice and new solutions to help them navigate the changing business climate and support their operations.\nIn fact, during the first quarter, we implemented over 6,000 new services in our Treasury & Payment Solutions area, a 320% increase compared to the first quarter of 2019.\nThis demonstrates our ongoing commitment to serve our customers and our ability to do so in a challenging environment.\nDespite the crisis, our bankers continue to reach out to and onboard new prospects, as our relationship-based approach is proving to be a key differentiator in these difficult times.\nWe will allocate our capital to areas that provide optimal returns, and while this approach may result in lower overall loan growth, we will continue to focus on acquiring new full-service relationships and expanding our current relationships with new opportunities.\nAs mentioned, we've taken a proactive approach to supporting our customers when needed, from waiving fees to increasing ATM and mobile deposit limits to granting loan payment deferrals.\nOur loan deferment program allows smaller loans to receive a short-term 90-day deferral of interest and principal to the loan's maturity date upon request.\nFor larger loans, we have implemented a credit-driven approach to review each request's specific circumstances, analyze cash burn, and obtain updated financial information while determining the need for deferment.\nTo date, our total deferrals represent about 13% of the overall portfolio, with industries more directly impacted by COVID-19 having higher percentages.\nWe have also closely monitored all stimulus actions and programs made available by the CARES Act.\nThe Paycheck Protection Program has had the most significant impact on our customers so far.\nWe began the PPP process on March 28 with an online expression of interest portal.\nWe started accepting applications on April 3rd, the day the program launched.\nAs Kessel mentioned earlier, as of today, we have secured funding for over 8,000 customers for approximately $2 billion.\nTo conclude, let me discuss the future of Synovus Forward.\nAs we shared during an investor conference in March, Synovus Forward is our new program designed to generate an additional $100 million in pre-tax income in the coming years and achieve top-quartile performance among mid-cap banks in terms of profitability and efficiency.\nWhile developing this program, we evaluated over 20 unique initiatives that included both expense and revenue opportunities.\nWe confirm today that the additional opportunity is still achievable.\nHowever, many of the benefits have been delayed due to the focus on the current crisis.\nMany expense and revenue initiatives planned for the first half of 2020 will be rescheduled for the second half of the year or early 2021.\nWhile we've had to delay some initiatives, we're also accelerating others.\nThis includes improving efficiencies from third-party spend initiatives, speeding up the development of digital and analytical capabilities to drive growth and manage risk, and using our remote environment to aggressively reconsider our physical distribution and locations.\nWe've also continued to invest in technology, particularly My Synovus, our consumer digital portal.\nIn March, we deployed major updates to enhance our customers' bill-pay and transfer experiences.\nAs we've made improvements, we've seen higher enrollment and utilization rates while seeing our overall operating increase, and it's important to note that the current crisis is creating opportunities to add new initiatives to the portfolio and resize current planned initiatives.\nThe Synovus Forward portfolio is flexible and will continue to evolve as we commit to delivering and growing value while addressing new economic and customer behavior realities.\nWe have much work ahead and understand the need to balance both short-term and long-term priorities.\nThe end-state benefits, their timing, and size may continue to change in this fluid environment.\nFor a brief update on this week's activities, I wanted to share that on Wednesday, we hosted our first online-only virtual shareholder meeting.\nAmong other actions, our shareholders overwhelmingly approved the elimination of our 10-1 voting structure and supermajority voting requirements.\nThese changes reflect our Board's ongoing commitment to best-in-class corporate governance.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Cullen/Frost reported earnings of $113.9 million or $1.77 per share in Q1, up from $47.2 million or $0.75 per share in the same period last year, and $88.3 million or $1.38 per share in Q4 2020.\nDespite a difficult economic climate, our team successfully executed strategies and achieved remarkable results, which will be elaborated on during this call.\nThe pandemic's economic effects continue to impact loan demand.\nQ1 average loans were $17.7 billion, an 18% increase from $15 billion in Q1 last year.\nExcluding PPP loans, Q1 average loans of $14.9 billion showed a slight decrease of just over 1% compared to Q1 2020.\nQ1 average deposits reached $35.4 billion, a 30% increase from $27.4 billion in Q1 last year.\nWhile macroeconomic factors have influenced our deposit growth, our company has historically been viewed as a safe haven for customers during uncertain times.\nOur Q1 return on average assets and average common equity were 1.09% and 11.13%, respectively.\nWe did not record a credit loss expense for loans in Q1, following a $13.3 million credit loss expense in Q4.\nOur asset quality outlook remains stable and showed significant improvement in Q1.\nGenerally, problem assets are decreasing, and new issues have dropped considerably, returning to pre-pandemic levels.\nQ1 net charge-offs decreased dramatically to $1.9 million from $13.6 million in Q4.\nAnnualized net charge-offs for Q1 were only 4 basis points of average loans.\nNonperforming assets at Q1-end were $51.7 million, down 17% from $62.3 million at Q4-end.\nA year ago, nonperformers were at $67.5 million.\nOverall, Q1-end delinquencies for accruing loans were $106 million or 59 basis points of period-end loans, remaining stable compared to 2020-end and consistent with recent years.\nOf the $2.2 billion in 90-day deferrals previously granted to borrowers, only about $11 million remained in deferment at Q1-end.\nTotal problem loans, defined as risk grade 10 and higher, were $774 million at Q1-end, down from $812 million at Q4-end.\nEnergy-related problem loans continued to decrease, reaching $108.6 million at Q1-end compared to $133.5 million in the previous quarter.\nFor context, total problem energy loans peaked at nearly $600 million in early 2016.\nEnergy loans continued to decline as a percentage of our portfolio, falling to 7.5% of our non-PPP portfolio at Q1-end.\nThis figure was 8.2% at Q4-end, with a peak of 16% in 2015.\nWe are actively working to reduce our company's energy sector exposure to appropriate levels.\nOverall, credit quality is improving.\nWhen the pandemic began last year, we formed teams to analyze non-energy portfolio segments considered most at risk, including restaurants, hotels, entertainment, sports, and retail.\nThese portfolio segments, excluding PPP loans, totaled just $1.6 billion at Q1-end.\nOur loan loss reserve for these segments was 4.9%.\nCredit quality of individual credits in these segments is mostly stable or improving compared to Q4-end, with an improving outlook, although some macroeconomic trends will take time to fully resolve.\nThe Hotel segment, with $286 million outstanding, remains our highest risk category.\nHowever, we believe our exposure to significant losses is minimal.\nI'm proud of our team's ability to establish relationships with new customers during challenging times, especially while focusing on helping existing small business customers obtain PPP loans.\nIn Q1, we added 55% more new commercial relationships than in Q1 last year.\nMany cited PPP as their reason for choosing Frost, but even more were attracted by our bankers' continued hard work and level of service.\nNew loan commitments booked in Q1, excluding PPP loans, decreased by 16% compared to Q1 2020, before the pandemic's economic impact was felt, clearly showing its effect on loan demand.\nThe balance between larger and core relationships for new loan commitments booked was nearly even, with 49% larger and 51% core at Q1-end.\nWe will continue to monitor this balance.\nOverall, 70% of deals were lost due to structure, consistent with 73% this time last year.\nHowever, we consider this a high number, illustrating strong competition in underwriting.\nOur weighted current active loan pipeline in the first quarter increased approximately 1% compared to the end of the fourth quarter\nAlthough slight, it was encouraging to observe some improvement\nConsumer banking continues to experience remarkable expansion\nOur net new consumer customer growth rate for the first quarter increased by 255% compared to the same period in 2020\nAccount openings at existing locations rose by 18% compared to the first quarter of 2020, and increased by 11% (non-annualized) from the previous quarter\nIn the first quarter, 36% of our new accounts were opened through online channels, including our Frost mobile app\nWe believe our performance is highly competitive within the industry\nOnline account openings increased by 35% compared to the first quarter of 2020\nThe consumer loan portfolio reached $1.8 billion at the end of the first quarter, growing by 1.4% compared to the same period last year\nWe are close to completing our previously announced expansion in Houston\nWe inaugurated the 23rd of the planned 25 new financial centers in April, with the remaining two set to open in the coming weeks\nOverall, the new financial centers are surpassing our expectations\nThis is one of the remarkable achievements I mentioned earlier\nOur team's ability to maintain momentum in Houston despite the pandemic and our efforts with PPP is a testament to our exceptional staff\nLet me provide an update on our expansion as of March for the 22 locations we had opened at that time, excluding PPP loans\nThe number of new households reached 144% of our target, representing over 8,700 new individuals and businesses\nOur loan volumes achieved 212% of the target, amounting to $263 million in outstanding loans\nExamining the composition of this portfolio, approximately 85% consists of commercial credits, with about 15% being consumer loans\nThe portfolio is comprised of just under half C&I loans, about 25% investor real estate, 15% consumer, and around 10% nonprofit and public finance\nNotably, with only three loans exceeding $10 million, over 80% are core loans\nRegarding deposits, at $343 million, they have reached 114% of our target\nThe deposits are split between approximately two-thirds commercial and one-third consumer\nWe've observed increasing momentum over the past year, when we were at about 68% of our target\nI hope this demonstrates that the nature of the business we're generating through the expansion aligns closely with the overall company\nIt's simply what we do, and you can see that its profitability will be driven by small and midsized businesses\nI'm incredibly proud of our organization's achievements in Houston, and I believe you should be too\nWe've established a platform that will enhance shareholder value for years to come\nThat's why I'm pleased to announce that we'll be applying the lessons and skills we've learned in the Houston market to a similar opportunity in Dallas early next year, with 25 new locations planned over a 30-month period\nThis expansion will put us on track to triple our presence in that dynamic market during that time\nRegarding PPP, our team was prepared to respond when the SBA reopened the application process in January\nTo date, we've received about 12,400 new loan applications in the second round of PPP, with over $1.3 billion funded\nCombined with our total from the first round last year, we've funded more than 31,000 loans totaling $4.6 billion, which is remarkable\nWe've also been working diligently to assist borrowers in obtaining loan forgiveness\nWe've invited all first-round borrowers to apply for forgiveness, and we've submitted 70% of those loan balances to the SBA, with about 50% already forgiven\nSince this process is crucial for our borrowers, we're handling all the work in-house with Frost bankers, without outsourcing any of these efforts\nWe're thrilled to introduce a new $100 overdraft grace feature for our consumer customers, launched on April 15.\nThis initiative is part of our organic growth strategy investment.\nWe believe this will have a positive impact on our customers' daily lives.\nThis sets us apart from traditional banks and neo-banks alike.\nWe anticipate this will boost our new customer acquisition rate and further expand our already growing consumer banking sector.\nThis month, we received positive feedback from third-party organizations evaluating our customer service.\nFor four consecutive years, Frost has received top scores in the Greenwich Excellence awards for superior service, advice, and performance to small business and middle market banking clients.\nOur already high overall satisfaction and Net Promoter scores improved even further in 2020, while many competitors experienced declines.\nI'm delighted to share that J.D. Power and Associates recently announced Frost has once again achieved the highest customer satisfaction ranking in Texas for retail banking.\nThis marks the 12th consecutive year we've led in Texas scores.\nCollectively, our strong financial performance, healthy deposit and loan figures, new relationships, goodwill from PPP efforts, Houston expansion, and customer service recognition demonstrate that prioritizing customer care and striving to positively impact their lives yields rewards.\nThese rewards extend beyond financial gains.\nIt's about people acknowledging our significant contributions and our superior performance compared to others.\nDespite the challenges of 2020 and early 2021, the outlook is improving.\nThis is due to our employees' dedication to our company and customers during these challenging times, and I'm optimistic about our future.\nI'm grateful for their hard work.\nI'm proud of our team and honored to be part of Frost.\nOur first quarter net interest margin percentage was 2.72%, a 10 basis point decrease from last quarter's 2.82%.\nThis decline was due to a larger proportion of earning assets invested in lower-yielding Fed balances, partially offset by the PPP loan portfolio's positive impact.\nInterest-bearing deposits at the Fed, earning 10 basis points, averaged $9.9 billion or 25% of our earning assets in Q1, up from $7.7 billion or 20% in Q4.\nExcluding PPP loans, our Q1 net interest margin percentage would have been 2.59%, down from an adjusted 2.75% in Q4.\nThe Q1 taxable equivalent loan yield was 3.87%, a 13 basis point increase from the previous quarter.\nWithout PPP loans, the taxable equivalent loan yield would have been 3.77%, essentially unchanged from Q4.\nQ1 average loan volumes of $17.7 billion decreased by $260 million from Q4's $17.9 billion average.\nExcluding PPP loans, Q1 average loans dropped by about $184 million, or 1.2% from Q4, with energy loans accounting for roughly three-quarters of the decline.\nWe funded over $1.3 billion in round two PPP loans during Q1, offset by approximately $580 million in round one loan forgiveness payments, bringing total round one forgiveness to about $1.4 billion.\nAt Q1's end, we had roughly $73 million in remaining net deferred fees to recognize, with about one-third related to round one loans.\nWe expect round two loans to have a shorter average life than round one due to smaller loan sizes and forgiveness process changes.\nWe anticipate recognizing about 90% of the remaining net deferred fees this year.\nOur Q1 investment portfolio averaged $12.2 billion, down about $335 million from Q4's $12.6 billion average.\nThe Q1 taxable equivalent yield on investments remained flat at 3.41% compared to Q4.\nThe taxable portfolio yield, averaging $4 billion, was 2.06%, down 6 basis points from Q4 due to higher premium amortization on agency mortgage-backed securities and lower yields on recent purchases.\nOur municipal portfolio averaged about $8.2 billion in Q1, down $154 million from Q4, with a stable taxable equivalent yield of 4.09%.\nAt Q1's end, 78% of the municipal portfolio was pre-refunded or PSF insured.\nQ1 investment purchases totaled approximately $500 million, evenly split between treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, with the remainder in municipals.\nWe project about $1.4 billion in investment purchases for the year to offset some maturities and expected prepayments and calls.\nFor full-year 2021, we currently expect non-interest expense growth of around 3.5% to 4% compared to our 2020 reported non-interest expenses.\nGiven our Q1 results and assuming similar or improving credit metrics, we believe the current mean analyst estimate of $5.42 for full-year 2021 earnings is too conservative.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Various aspects and precautionary statements are mentioned in the company's publicly available documents and reports, which can be found on the SEC website or the company's official website.\nI will now hand over the conference to Karen Colonias, who serves as Simpson's President and Chief Executive Officer.\nI am delighted to share our results with you today.\nI'll start with a brief overview of our first quarter financial performance, followed by a more in-depth discussion about the coronavirus pandemic, its impact on our operations, and the steps we're taking to address this unprecedented situation.\nWe achieved strong operational and financial results in the first quarter.\nRevenue of $283.7 million grew by 9.4% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to increased sales volume in North America.\nThe rise in sales volumes was mainly attributed to more favorable weather conditions in our key markets compared to the unusually cold and wet winter of the previous year.\nSales were partially counteracted by weaker performance in Europe, which began feeling the effects of COVID-19 in mid-March.\nWe maintained a robust gross profit margin of 45.7%, representing a 320 basis point improvement year-over-year.\nThis was primarily due to changes in our sales mix and reduced material costs.\nOur strong gross margin, combined with relatively stable operating expenses, resulted in an operating income of $49.4 million, a 64.4% increase year-over-year, and impressive earnings of $0.83 per diluted share, up 66% from the previous year.\nBrian will soon provide more details about our Q1 performance, but first, let's discuss COVID-19.\nWe extend our deepest sympathies to all those affected by the coronavirus pandemic.\nOur top priority is ensuring the health, safety, and well-being of our employees, their families, our customers, and our communities, and this guides every decision we make.\nWe took swift action at the beginning of this crisis to implement stringent safety protocols across all our facilities, including enhanced sanitation measures, mandatory social distancing, reduced on-site staff through staggered shifts and remote work where possible, and restricted visitor access to our locations.\nAs of today, all our US manufacturing facilities remain operational in compliance with applicable shelter-in-place orders, as we supply businesses deemed essential, such as hardware stores and other building material companies.\nHowever, two of our larger European operations in the United Kingdom and France were ordered to cease nearly all operations in late March, forcing us to temporarily furlough many affected employees.\nWe fully intend to bring these employees back to work when the time is right.\nOver the years, we've established a strong brand reputation with a loyal customer base and talented workforce, and we are committed to preserving this to ensure we can continue serving our customers while adhering to local government regulations.\nImportantly, we have not experienced any supply chain disruptions related to COVID-19 and have been able to meet our customers' needs.\nIn April, sales declined compared to March levels due to lower demand resulting from the anticipated slowdown in housing starts and general construction activities.\nWhile this situation is unique and unlike any previous downturn we've faced, we believe we are well-positioned to emerge from this crisis in a strong position.\nLooking back at the 2008-2009 financial crisis, which was accompanied by a significant decline in US housing starts and a simultaneous 28% drop in sales, our strong balance sheet played a crucial role in supporting our business through the recovery period.\nToday, our balance sheet provides us with sufficient liquidity to support our daily operations.\nWe ended the quarter with $305.8 million in cash on hand, after drawing down $150 million from our revolving credit facility as a precautionary measure to maintain financial flexibility and ensure our working capital needs are met in light of the current uncertainty stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nImportantly, following the 2009 crisis, we made significant strategic changes to our business to ensure an even stronger foundation in the event of a future recession.\nThese actions included diversifying our business to be less dependent on US housing starts by making key investments in adjacent products and markets.\nMore recently, we've taken significant steps to streamline our cost structure over the past three years in line with our 2020 plan goals.\nWe've been able to operate more efficiently, as demonstrated by the 250 basis point improvement in our total operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding the long-term impact of COVID-19, including market conditions and demand trends, we have proactively implemented additional measures to maintain our strong financial position.\nStarting in the second quarter, we've implemented a hiring freeze and will focus on employee retention while adjusting employee hours based on lower production levels in the near term.\nMoreover, our non-essential expenses such as staff travel and certain consultant projects have been drastically cut back, as we comply with stay-at-home orders across our operations.\nNow, let's discuss capital allocation.\nOur approach has changed in recent times, with a greater emphasis on preserving cash until this crisis subsides.\nConsequently, we are limiting our planned capital expenditures to only essential projects for repair, maintenance, or addressing potential safety concerns in our facilities.\nFurthermore, we are being highly cautious with inventory purchases in the current climate, aligning with our aim to enhance our inventory balance through careful management and buying practices.\nHowever, you will observe that inventory values on our balance sheet as of March 31 have increased compared to December 31 levels.\nThis is mainly to support the launch of a major new customer in the second quarter of 2020.\nExcluding the impact of this new customer, our total inventory value and quantity on-hand, including finished products, would have decreased compared to December 31 levels.\nWe anticipate providing more information about this launch during our upcoming second quarter earnings call.\nRegarding shareholder returns, as of April 25, we have distributed over $20 million in dividends to our shareholders and bought back more than 900,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $69.46 per share, totaling $62.7 million.\nHowever, as cash conservation is our main priority in the current environment, we are halting our share repurchase program until further notice.\nLastly, before concluding, I'd like to mention that we finished the final stage of SAP implementation in our major US sales organization during the first quarter of 2020, successfully integrating our Stockton manufacturing facility.\nAll of our US-based sales organizations have now transitioned to SAP.\nAs of today, we still aim for companywide completion by the end of 2021, but we will continue to monitor and adjust our timeline if stay-at-home orders persist for an extended period.\nIn conclusion, we are satisfied with our strong first quarter performance.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which began near the end of the first quarter, has led us to operate in an extremely challenging and uncertain environment that has disrupted the global economy.\nRegarding our 2020 plan, while the current situation makes predictions difficult, and these financial targets may still be attainable by the end of fiscal 2020, we continue to execute based on the same fundamental principle of focusing on operational efficiencies and cost savings to guide us through this pandemic as we progress.\nIn a world filled with such uncertainty, we believe our business is well-positioned to withstand the current crisis due to our focus on factors within our control, including maintaining a top-tier customer experience and producing high-quality, trusted products, ensuring overall financial flexibility through ample liquidity, and adopting a conservative approach to capital allocation with a focus on short-term cash preservation.\nI'm glad to share our first quarter financial results with you today.\nNow, let's examine our results.\nAs Karen mentioned, our consolidated sales were robust, growing 9.4% to $283.7 million.\nIn the North American segment, sales rose 12.5% to $249.1 million due to higher sales volume supported by stronger housing starts compared to the wet winter conditions we experienced last year.\nUS housing starts grew 22% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, notably in the west and south where we provide significant content in home starts, which grew 27% and 19%, respectively, year-over-year.\nIn Europe, sales declined 8.5% to $32.7 million, primarily due to lower sales volume in our concrete business.\nAdditionally, first quarter sales were slightly impacted by our facilities in France and the United Kingdom, which experienced government-mandated operational restrictions in March as safety precautions in response to COVID-19.\nConsequently, these locations operated with minimal activity to comply with the orders.\nEuropean sales were further negatively affected by $1.0 million from foreign currency translations, resulting from European currencies weakening against the US dollar.\nIn local currency, European sales decreased by approximately 5.5% for the quarter.\nWood Construction products accounted for 86% of total sales compared to 84% previously, while Concrete Construction products represented 14% of total sales compared to 16% previously.\nGross profit increased by 18% to $129.7 million, resulting in a gross margin of 45.7%.\nGross margin improved by 320 basis points, mainly due to lower material and factory overhead costs as a percentage of sales on increased production, partially offset by higher labor, warehouse, and shipping costs.\nBy segment, our gross margin in North America improved to 47.7% compared to 44.4%, while in Europe, our gross margin slightly increased to 32.7% compared to 32.3%.\nIn the first quarter, our wood products' gross margin was 45.4%, up from 42.3% last year, while concrete products' margin rose to 42.5% from 39%.\nWe will now discuss our expenses and operating costs for the first quarter.\nR&D and engineering costs rose 9% to $13.4 million, mainly due to higher staff costs and profit-sharing payouts.\nSales expenses grew by almost 2% to $28.5 million, primarily because of increased personnel costs and profit-sharing commissions, partly counterbalanced by reduced stock-based compensation and promotional spending.\nIn North America, selling costs increased by 2%, while in Europe, they rose by nearly 2%.\nGeneral and administrative expenses fell 3% to $38.5 million, mainly due to lower professional and legal fees and stock-based compensation.\nThese decreases were partially offset by rises in personnel costs, profit sharing, bad debt provisions, and intangible asset amortization.\nIn North America, G&A expenses decreased by 5%.\nG&A costs in Europe increased by almost 6%.\nOverall operating expenses were $80.4 million, a minor increase of $0.5 million or about 1%.\nTotal operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 28.3%, an improvement of 250 basis points from 30.8%.\nOur first quarter operating expenses included $3.4 million for SAP implementation and support, compared to $2.4 million in the same period last year.\nAs of March 31, 2020, we have capitalized $19.7 million and expensed $29.3 million in total since the project began.\nOur robust gross margins contributed to a 64% increase in consolidated operating income, reaching $49.4 million compared to $30 million.\nNorth American operating income grew 63% to $53.6 million due to higher sales and reduced operating costs.\nEurope reported an operating loss of $1.7 million, up from $0.4 million, due to lower sales and increased severance and amortization expenses.\nOur consolidated operating income margin improved by approximately 580 basis points to 17.4%.\nThe effective tax rate decreased from 22.5% to 21.3%.\nNet income reached $36.8 million or $0.83 per fully diluted share, up from $22.7 million or $0.50 per share.\nLet's now examine our balance sheet and cash flow.\nCash and cash equivalents stood at $305.8 million on March 31, 2020, a $192.4 million increase from March 31, 2019, largely due to drawing $150 million from our revolving credit facility.\nThis precautionary measure was taken to boost our cash reserves and maintain financial flexibility amid the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.\nThe borrowed funds can be used for working capital, general corporate purposes, or other uses allowed by the Credit Facility.\nWe have about $150 million of remaining borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility.\nOur operating cash flow for the first quarter of 2020 was $16.8 million, a $7.1 million or 74% increase.\nWe invested approximately $6.8 million in capital expenditures, including a small amount for our ongoing SAP implementation.\nWe also paid $10.2 million in dividends to our shareholders.\nOn April 23, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share, payable on July 23 to stockholders of record as of July 2.\nDue to significant macroeconomic uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, including limited visibility into future market conditions such as US housing starts, we have decided to withdraw our previously provided full year 2020 outlook and financial targets associated with our 2020 plan.\nIn conclusion, we are very satisfied with our first quarter performance.\nWe believe our strong market position, geographic diversity, wide product range, ongoing cost-saving initiatives from our 2020 plan, robust balance sheet, and current focus on cash preservation will position Simpson favorably when shelter-in-place orders are lifted.\nWe are confident in our ability to maintain operations during this challenging period as long as we can continue serving essential businesses, and we believe we are well-positioned to meet future demand once the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Before the start of the earnings call this quarter, the Company has provided a slide presentation.\nThese forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from current expectations.\nI'll now hand it over to Tom to start.\nWe've had a rather exciting quarter at California Water Service Group.\nWe'll be discussing our California General Rate Case and other quarterly developments in detail.\nI'll start with Slide 6, which covers the recognition of the 2018 California General Rate Case.\nOn October 14, the California Public Utilities Commission issued a proposed decision for our delayed California GRC, originally set to take effect January 1, 2020, approving the settlement announced in October 2019 and adopting Cal Water's stance on disputed financial matters.\nEarlier this year, we were hesitant to record regulatory assets for certain balancing account mechanisms due to uncertainty about their recoverability.\nBased on the proposed decision and subsequent events, we now believe the GRC decision will likely continue these accounts.\nWe're now recognizing regulatory assets related to various balancing account mechanisms, significantly boosting our quarterly and year-to-date revenue.\nThe Commission will also grant interim rate recovery, allowing us to book a regulatory asset for the interim rate memorandum account.\nA recent event has further bolstered our confidence in the General Rate Case outcome.\nOn Tuesday, the Public Advocates Office provided comments on the proposed decision, notably not contesting the continuation of key balancing accounts.\nThis strengthens our belief that the final decision, expected no earlier than November 19, will maintain these balancing accounts.\nAs part of this rate case, we're refunding excess deferred tax from the Tax Cut Jobs Act to customers, reflected in our income statement as a reduced effective tax rate.\nWhile these probability assessments carry some risk, we're confident in our current position based on available evidence.\nMoving to Slide 7, our third quarter net income has significantly increased from $42.4 million to $96.4 million compared to 2019.\nEarnings per share for the third quarter rose to $1.94 from $0.88 in the same period last year.\nSlide 8 shows year-to-date net income up by about $30 million to $81.3 million from $51.8 million in 2019.\nYear-to-date earnings per share increased to $1.66 from $1.08 in 2019.\nSlides 9 and 10 outline standard changes in earnings, revenues, and expenses, including increased operating expenses and variations in unbilled revenue accruals and retirement plan asset adjustments.\nSlide 11's earnings bridge emphasizes the impact of delayed regulatory asset recording from Q1 and Q2 on third quarter earnings.\nThis $0.80 increase represents earnings that would have occurred in the first two quarters had the rate case been adopted on time.\nSlide 13 provides insight into the Company's earnings power as a predominantly regulated utility.\nThe proposed California Rate Case decision allows for about $76 million in net income for test year 2020, reflecting the authorized equity return on $1.5 billion in rate base.\nWe have approximately $110 million of rate base in other states expected to earn similar equity returns.\nOur regulated business equity returns depend on costs aligning with adopted costs and, outside California, are affected by water sales.\nFrom 2023, we expect California earnings to also be influenced by water sales.\nIt's important to note that we don't anticipate annual net income effects from unbilled revenue accrual changes or unrealized retirement asset value changes.\nThose elements are contributing approximately $9.6 million to our net income for the year so far through the third quarter.\nBe mindful that as we approach year-end, we anticipate the unbilled amount will decrease back to its level at the end of 2019.\nSeveral other factors cause our earnings to exceed core regulated earnings, including unregulated activities, operation and maintenance contracts, cellular antenna leases on our facilities, the regulatory asset we record for the equity portion of construction funding (AFUDC), and state tax timing differences.\nI wanted to ensure everyone was aware of this and am happy to address any questions.\nI'd like to provide a brief operational update in light of COVID-19.\nDespite the pandemic, California experienced its worst fire season on record.\nIn addition to COVID, we had to contend with numerous fires, implement public safety power shutoffs across the state at various times, and deal with a couple of earthquakes - it's been an extremely busy year operationally.\nWe've activated our emergency operations center 18 times so far this year.\nI believe that's a new record for us.\nOur emergency operation centers follow FEMA-type protocols for handling emergency situations.\nI'm pleased to report that despite facing numerous potential emergencies throughout the year, the company's operations have run very smoothly and we avoided any major water service disruptions or outages, especially during fire season.\nWe continue to operate with enhanced safety measures to protect customers and employees from infection.\nSafeguarding employees, customers and public health remains our top priority.\nI'm delighted to share that we received the Silver Stevie Award for Most Valuable Employer for COVID Response, out of over 700 companies in contention.\nWe're very proud to receive this award recognizing our COVID response efforts and employee safety measures.\nWhile managing the pandemic, we've observed an increase in overdue customer accounts due to suspending collection activities.\nAs you may recall, Cal Water halted collections and shut-offs early on, before any government mandates, recognizing customers' need for water to combat the virus.\nOur balances over 90 days past due have risen to about $5.4 million.\nTypically only a portion of such amounts prove uncollectible.\nWe're monitoring this closely.\nWe believe it reflects the financial hardships people are facing as the pandemic has forced shelter-in-place orders and left many relying on assistance programs and unable to pay bills.\nWe've increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by around $1.6 million to $2.7 million, which covers roughly half of the overdue balance, and we'll continue to monitor this in the fourth quarter.\nOur additional expenses related to COVID were under $100,000 in Q3, which we consider positive.\nWe have memo accounts in California and Hawaii to track these costs.\nAs most of you know, with a memo account you expense costs when incurred but track them separately.\nWhen the amount becomes significant, you can potentially request cost recovery from the commission for those incremental expenses not factored into the business model.\nSo we continue tracking COVID-related costs in our memo accounts.\nOverall water sales have been close to adopted levels, at about 95% of adopted sales in California, with increased residential usage from people being home offset by lower commercial and industrial use during the quarter.\nRegarding liquidity, our position remains strong.\nAs of September 30, we had $113 million in cash and $170 million available through a credit line.\nOur liquidity has stayed robust throughout the pandemic and we're well-positioned heading into Q4.\nTurning to the California regulatory update on Slide 15, it's been a very active year for Cal Water on the regulatory front.\nAs Tom mentioned, in October the company received a proposed decision establishing a new revenue requirement of $698.7 million for test year 2020.\nThe proposed decision also authorized $828 million in new capital investments over the three-year rate case cycle.\nWe had filed a settlement agreement resolving most issues in the General Rate Case.\nHowever, 11 financial items remained contested and were not part of the settlement.\nIn the proposed decision, the judge ruled in Cal Water's favor on all 11 disputed financial items.\nThese included continuing the water revenue adjustment mechanism (WRAM/MCBA), sales reconciliation mechanism (SRM), and pension/healthcare balancing accounts; including an equity component in AFUDC calculations; and approving capital projects for advanced metering infrastructure and water treatment in the Los Angeles area.\nThe Commission is set to rule on the proposed decision as early as its November 19 meeting.\nI'll also note that Cal Water and other parties have requested a rehearing of the August 27 decision barring us from using the WRAM/MCBA starting with our 2021 Rate Case filing (effective 2023).\n2021 will be another busy year as we file our 2021 Rate Case and cost of capital case next spring.\nOur regulatory team will have their hands full preparing those filings.\nRegarding our 2020 capital investment program, Q3 capital investments were $84.7 million, up 16% year-over-year.\nYear-to-date capital investments are $221.3 million, $13.5 million higher than 2019.\nWe previously estimated spending $260-290 million this year.\nWe believe we're on track to meet our capital investment goals for 2020 despite the challenging environment.\nAdditionally, on October 13 we announced completing our Palos Verdes Water Reliability Project, the largest in company history at nearly $100 million, bringing redundancy to the PV Peninsula in Southern California.\nOnce again, the crew excelled, completing the project this year despite challenging operational conditions.\nFresh news arrived just yesterday.\nThe California Public Utilities Commission approved Cal Water's request for an additional $700 million in financing authority, which is expected to fund the company's capital program through 2025 or beyond.\nThis approval enables us to raise an extra $700 million in debt or equity to fund our capital expansion program over the next five years.\nThis development was also positive.\nWe've been exceptionally active in business development, possibly the busiest we've been in two decades, and Paul will provide an update on our progress in this area.\nSlide 17 presents an overview of our business development initiatives.\nCal Water continues to pursue a robust new business development strategy and has achieved significant success this year.\nOur new development efforts have secured contracts for over 25,000 new customer connections so far this year.\nThis represents more than a 5% increase in new customer connections across all of the company's subsidiaries.\nIn 2020, the company has completed two acquisitions: the Rainier View Water system in Washington and the Kalaeloa Water and Sewer system in Hawaii.\nWe have also entered into agreements to acquire the Animas Valley Water Company in New Mexico and the Gunner Ranch Sewer system in California, both pending regulatory approval.\nRegarding regulatory approval, we are still awaiting review for two other acquisitions: the Kapalua Water and Sewer Company in Hawaii and The Preserve at Millerton Water and Sewer in California.\nIn conclusion, our business development efforts are robust, as evidenced by this matrix, and we have a strong pipeline of potential deals.\nI'll now hand it back to Tom.\nI'll briefly discuss our next two slides, which show our traditional bar charts for capex and rate base.\nThese charts now offer more certainty than in previous presentations.\nClearly, as Marty and Paul mentioned, the capex authorized by the Commission is approaching realization.\nWe have a midpoint target of $275 million for capex, which is very achievable in 2020 given our progress so far.\nMoving to the estimated regulated rate base slide, we've updated this chart to reflect the proposed decision rate base in California.\nWe've also added the rate base I mentioned earlier from other states.\nWe estimate that our rate base in 2020, assuming the CPUC adopts the proposed decision and settlement, will be about $1.6 billion for California and other state-regulated operations.\nThis figure doesn't include the Palos Verdes pipeline project.\nAs Marty noted, that project is close to $100 million.\nIt's one of these advice letter projects.\nWe anticipate it will be incorporated into rates near the start of 2021 or possibly earlier, depending on how it progresses through the California rate case process.\nThis project will account for almost two-thirds of the advice letter rate base shown on this chart.\nI want to emphasize that our 2021 and 2022 rate bases in California are subject to an earnings test.\nWe haven't discussed this recently because we didn't have an earnings test this year due to the rate case test year.\nHowever, in two out of every three years, we undergo an earnings test that evaluates our progress on capital investments and the effective rate of return before granting additional rates in California districts.\nWe expect to provide an update on this and its impact on 2021 by the time of our year-end call.\nThe 2021 figure shown here represents the authorized rate base if we pass all those earnings tests.\nIt's been a hectic couple of weeks since receiving the Proposed Decision, working to process everything and collaborate with our independent registered Certified Public Accountants, Deloitte & Touche.\nI know you've put in many hours to get this information recorded.\nIt's great to be nearing the completion of the 2018 General Rate Case and wrapping it up.\nWhile the delay was disappointing, it's good to have it finished and move forward.\nWe've already begun work on our 2021 General Rate Case, as Paul mentioned.\nAs we enter the final six weeks of what has truly been a disruptive year, perhaps the most disruptive in our generation's experience, Cal Water remains well-positioned to execute our business plan, including our business development growth plans, dividend growth plans, and capital investment programs.\nMost crucially, our safety program has allowed us to maintain operations.\n91% of our employees have been at work every day.\nThe majority of our employees and assets are in the field, and they've been on the job daily throughout the COVID pandemic, which required us to implement strict COVID protocols for their protection.\nWe believe we're executing well and are in a strong position.\nIn a year that hasn't brought much good news, I'd like to conclude with something I consider quite significant.\nIn late September, the California legislature passed a bill we've been working on to address some of our concerns regarding wildfire liability.\nSenate Bill 1386, now signed into law by Governor Newsom, specifies that fire hydrants connected to public water systems are generally not designed or installed to provide water service for extinguishing fires that threaten property not served by a water service provider or wildfires.\nOur government affairs team worked diligently with California lawmakers to enact this legislation.\nWe believe this represents another significant milestone in differentiating our risk profile from those of electric and gas utilities in California.\nIt's a major step in the right direction, and the team deserves credit for achieving this.\nBrigette, we're now ready to open the floor for Q&A.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We released our Q2 2021 results earlier today.\nOur financial report can be found on our company website at oshkoshcorp.com.\nToday's speakers include our CEO John Pfeifer and CFO Mike Pat.\nWe're pleased to report exceptional Q2 results, with sales reaching $1.9 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.48, surpassing both last year's figures and our projections.\nThe demand across our company, especially in Access Equipment, has rebounded more quickly and strongly than anticipated, thanks to positive vaccine progress and the resulting market confidence.\nOur production rates have returned to pre-pandemic levels company-wide, and our 14,000 dedicated employees continue to adapt admirably to changing circumstances as we recover from the pandemic.\nGlobal businesses are facing significant supply chain issues as the economy recovers, including a worldwide semiconductor shortage, record-high steel prices, and resin shortages due to the February freeze in Texas.\nOur supply chain team and external suppliers have worked diligently to maintain production, but supply chain disruptions will likely remain a concern we'll need to manage throughout 2021.\nIn addition to our strong Q2 performance, we received excellent news on February 23 when we were awarded the Next Generation Delivery Vehicle contract with the U.S. Postal Service.\nI'm very proud of our team's efforts over the past few years that led to this historic win, which aligns with President Biden's goal to electrify the federal fleet with zero-emission vehicles and create new sustainable manufacturing jobs in America.\nOur Defense segment will provide the Postal Service with as many zero-emission battery electric vehicles (BEV) as they require while upgrading their fleet to be increasingly sustainable.\nThis contract is the latest achievement in our 25-year history of continuous innovation in electric drive and BEV engineering.\nI'll provide more details about this exciting contract win later.\nWe're also proud to be included in the S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook again in 2021.\nOur inclusion in the yearbook highlights our top 15% performance in our industry category and underscores our commitment to creating a more sustainable future and a culture centered on a safe and inclusive workplace.\nWe've also committed to further reducing greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption as we continue investing in technology, including developing battery electric products across all our businesses.\nI'm pleased to announce our expectations for 2021 adjusted earnings per share to be between $6.35 and $6.85 as we resume providing quantitative guidance.\nMike will provide more details in his section.\nThe improvements we began to see in our markets in December and January following positive vaccine news rapidly accelerated over the past few months, contributing to the strong performance we're reporting today.\nRevenue increased by 6.5% compared to last year, resulting in a solid adjusted operating margin of over 11%.\nWe had previously expected growth to return in the second half of the year, so we're pleased to be ahead of schedule.\nThese strong results would not be possible without the access team's disciplined execution throughout the pandemic, enabling the business to quickly respond to changing customer demand, particularly in North America.\nOrders were also strong, resulting in a solid backlog of $1.5 billion for this segment, an 80% increase from last year.\nGiven that most forecasts project nonresidential construction to decline in 2021, we believe replacement demand is driving access equipment sales growth.\nAs we've discussed in recent quarters, fleet ages are elevated throughout the North American market, and we believe the need to replace these aged fleets will significantly drive new equipment sales in the coming quarters.\nWe're further encouraged that demand has returned across a broad range of customers, not just the largest and most visible rental companies.\nWe believe this signals a healthy and robust market.\nAs mentioned in our last earnings call, JLG's U.S. production facilities returned to full production levels in March.\nWhile the threat of absenteeism in our operations has significantly decreased due to lower COVID infection rates and robust contact tracing, we are closely managing supply chain challenges that could impact production in the second half of the year.\nAs part of the coalition of American Manufacturers of Mobile Access Equipment, we also took action during the quarter against some unfair competition practices by foreign companies in the United States.\nWe believe this is beneficial for the long-term health of the industry.\nSteel prices remain at record highs, and we took further actions during the quarter to mitigate the risk, including additional cost locks on portions of our planned steel purchases and price increases for new units ordered beginning in early March.\nSimilar to our experience in 2018 when steel costs increased significantly, there will be a delay in the benefit until we work through orders that were in our backlog prior to the price increase.\nI'd like to share some positive news about our Tianjin, China facility.\nConstruction is largely complete for our expanded operations, and we expect to begin shipping products from the new capacity later this year.\nThis is an important step in our long-term strategy to drive profitable growth in China and other Asian markets.\nWe're honored to be the supplier of the next-generation delivery vehicles for the United States Postal Service.\nThis competition has been a rigorous five-year process, and our world-class engineers have risen to the challenge to provide the postal service with a vehicle that meets or exceeds all of their current and future needs.\nThe program covers the purchase of 50,000 to 165,000 units over 10 years as part of the postal service's plan to significantly modernize their delivery fleet with improved safety, reliability, sustainability, cost efficiency, and a much better working experience for our nation's postal carriers.\nOur offering provides the postal service with both zero-emission BEV units and fuel-efficient, low-emission ICE units, with the option of delivering any combination up to 100% of either model.\nThe vehicle design also allows the postal service to convert ICE units to BEV units in the future.\nWe expect to begin delivering production vehicles in the second half of 2023.\nWe're also pleased with the progress of integrating Pratt Miller into the company following the completion of the acquisition in January.\nWe look forward to leveraging their speed, agility, and expertise as we intensify our innovation focus across the company.\nThe Defense team continues its diligent efforts to supply JLTVs, FMTVs, and FHTVs for U.S. military use.\nWe established an additional production line for a portion of our output during the quarter.\nThe newly implemented production line incorporates cutting-edge technology to enhance manufacturing efficiency.\nWe encountered increased one-time expenses and temporary inefficiencies during the quarter due to the transition, which supports the segment's long-term success.\nOshkosh Defense and our partner, ST Engineering, have been chosen by the National Advanced Mobility Consortium to participate in the prototype stage for the U.S. Army's cold weather all-terrain vehicle (CATV) program.\nThe CATV program aims to develop new tracked vehicles for arctic operations, replacing small unit support vehicles that have been in use since the early 1980s.\nWe view this program as a promising opportunity in a related product area for our defense operations.\nThe Fire & Emergency division achieved exceptional results with strong sales growth and an operating income margin exceeding 15%.\nDespite facing supplier challenges and customer inspection limitations due to the pandemic last year, the team quickly recovered and continues to deliver industry-leading results.\nWe have overcome previous concerns about absenteeism, and our operations have returned to pre-COVID levels.\nWe frequently highlight the strength and capabilities of our robust Pierce dealer network.\nOur dealers have continued to increase investments in their sales and service networks despite the pandemic, demonstrating their dedication to customers.\nWe believe this level of commitment ensures long-term success.\nThe division ended the quarter with a solid backlog of $1.3 billion, approximately equal to last year's record-breaking level.\nAs anticipated, orders in the quarter were lower year-over-year, primarily due to pandemic-related impacts.\nWe will continue to monitor municipal budgets and expect a modest decline in the North American fire truck market over the next few quarters due to the pandemic.\nHowever, we don't believe this will significantly impact the long-term success of our Fire & Emergency business.\nMike will discuss our positive outlook for this business in 2021.\nOur Commercial division delivered solid results with increased operating income despite lower sales.\nThe simplification and innovation strategy in this division is proving effective, giving us confidence in continued long-term margin improvement.\nWe made excellent progress on our focused factory approach, transitioning mixer production to London, Ontario, during the quarter.\nThe team deserves commendation for their efforts, which have been challenging due to COVID-related cross-border travel restrictions with Canada.\nWe are also making significant advancements in establishing a high-flow refuse collection vehicle line in Dodge Center, Minnesota, utilizing the space freed up by relocating mixer production.\nThis modernization and automation investment adds capacity and efficiency as part of our strategy.\nRegarding our markets, we are observing a strong recovery in order activity for mixers and refuse collection vehicles as business improves post-pandemic.\nWe believe the reopening of the U.S. is driving increased refuse collection, and construction is rebounding, as evidenced by our higher year-over-year backlog.\nWe expect these trends to continue throughout 2021.\nSupply chain issues also pose risks in the Commercial segment.\nFor example, the availability of third-party chassis from truck manufacturers due to semiconductor and other component shortages is a concern we are closely monitoring, which could impact our deliveries in the latter half of 2021.\nOur supply chain teams are effectively addressing these challenges and maintaining our production lines, and we remain vigilant.\nWe are on schedule to deliver the electric refuse collection vehicles discussed last quarter to our customer in Boise.\nThese units will provide valuable insights into the opportunities and challenges of using battery electric vehicles for daily refuse collection.\nThe development of these products is part of our long-term electrification strategy across the company, which we believe will generate significant benefits for our customers and the environment.\nThis concludes our business segment overview.\nWe delivered strong quarterly results that surpassed our expectations.\nAs the quarter progressed, demand in the Access Equipment segment increased sharply, resulting in consolidated sales of $1.9 billion, $92 million higher than the previous year and approximately $140 million above our projections.\nThe growth compared to the previous year was driven by a 29% increase in Fire & Emergency sales and a 6.5% increase in Access Equipment sales, partially offset by a slight sales decrease in the Defense segment.\nAccess Equipment sales increased due to improved market demand in Asia and North America.\nLast year, demand was negatively impacted late in the second quarter as the COVID-19 pandemic led to shelter-in-place restrictions around much of the world.\nDefense sales decreased in the quarter due to lower FMTV sales and reduced cumulative catch-up adjustments following FHTV and JLTV contract awards in the second quarter last year, partially offset by higher FHTV sales and Pratt Miller sales for a portion of the quarter following its acquisition in January.\nFire & Emergency sales increased as a result of higher fire truck and ARFF vehicle sales.\nIn the prior year, fire truck sales were negatively impacted by COVID-19-related customer travel restrictions and a supplier quality issue that affected our truck delivery schedules.\nOur sales benefited from the delivery of vehicles under two multi-unit contracts in the current year quarter.\nCommercial segment sales declined primarily due to lower refuse collection vehicle demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the divestment of our concrete batch plant business in the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by an increase in concrete mixer volume.\nSales of front discharge concrete mixers were subdued in the previous year as the new S-Series 2.0 was still in its early stages of production.\nThe adjusted operating income for the entire company in Q2 was $143.3 million, representing 7.6% of sales, an improvement from $133.6 million or 7.4% of sales in the same quarter last year.\nThe Access Equipment division saw an increase in adjusted operating income due to higher sales volumes, reduced expenses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and an improved product mix, partially offset by increased incentive compensation costs.\nThe Defense division experienced a decrease in adjusted operating income due to unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments and inefficiencies associated with the launch of a new manufacturing line during the quarter.\nThe Fire & Emergency division's operating income grew in the current quarter, mainly due to increased sales volume, favorable price-cost dynamics, improved product mix, and enhanced manufacturing efficiency.\nThe Commercial segment's operating income improved due to reduced product liability costs, lower expenses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and decreased warranty costs.\nThe quarter's adjusted earnings per share reached $1.48, up from $1.25 in the same period last year.\nWe are satisfied with our strong performance in the first half of 2021 and the improved outlook for the second half, enabling us to provide specific financial projections once again.\nAll four segments have robust order backlogs, and we've observed a significant reduction in COVID-19-related employee absences.\nAs John mentioned, we face supply chain risks for the remainder of the year, similar to most global companies.\nOur supply chain teams have excellently managed to keep our production lines operational.\nNevertheless, there's a possibility that supplier shortages could disrupt production in the latter half of the year.\nOur projections assume no major production interruptions due to supply chain shortages.\nWe project consolidated sales of $7.75 billion to $7.95 billion, compared to $6.9 billion in 2020.\nWe anticipate adjusted operating income of $610 million to $655 million, up from $496 million last year, and adjusted earnings per share of $6.35 to $6.85, compared to $4.94 in 2020.\nFor the Access Equipment segment, we forecast sales of $3.15 billion to $3.35 billion, representing a 25% to 33% increase from 2020.\nWe anticipate growth to be led by North America, with sales growth expected in most regions as the world recovers from the pandemic.\nWe project the Access Equipment segment's adjusted operating margin to be 10.5% to 11.25%, which includes an expected $30 million net headwind from high steel prices, primarily affecting the fourth quarter.\nWe expect this headwind to diminish in 2022 as we begin to fully realize the benefits of pricing actions implemented in the second quarter.\nThe full-year impact of last year's temporary cost reductions returning to our expected run rate this year has decreased compared to previous expectations due to lower spending in the first half as travel, trade shows, and other discretionary expenses have resumed more slowly than anticipated.\nFor the Defense segment, we project 2021 sales of approximately $2.5 billion, an 8% increase compared to 2020.\nThis estimate includes increased JLTV production and the addition of Pratt Miller sales.\nThe segment's backlog remains strong at $3.5 billion, providing good visibility into 2022.\nWe expect Defense operating margins to be approximately 8%, aligning with our previous guidance of high single-digit operating margin percentages.\nThis estimate accounts for higher new product development spending, manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the new production line's start, and lower cumulative catch-up adjustments compared to 2020.\nWe anticipate Fire & Emergency segment sales to reach approximately $1.2 billion, about $90 million higher than 2020.\nThe revenue increase is primarily due to a return to more normal production and customer deliveries as COVID-19-related disruptions decrease.\nWe expect the Fire & Emergency segment's operating margin to increase to approximately 14% due to increased sales volume.\nWe project sales of approximately $925 million in the Commercial segment, slightly down from 2020 due to the previous year's sale of the concrete batch plant business.\nWe anticipate operating margins for this segment to be approximately 7%.\nMargins in this segment will be impacted in the second half of the year due to rapidly increasing steel costs and disruptions in the supply of third-party chassis.\nSimilar to the Access Equipment segment, we expect this unfavorable impact to decrease as we begin to realize the benefits of price increases implemented in early 2021.\nWe estimate corporate expenses will be $150 million to $155 million, an increase of $25 million to $30 million due to the return of higher incentive compensation levels.\nWe project the tax rate for 2021 to be approximately 22% and estimate an average share count of 69.3 million shares.\nFor the full year, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $650 million, reflecting an expected strong year of cash generation.\nWe also estimate capital expenditures will be approximately $120 million.\nFor the third quarter, we expect consolidated sales to increase by approximately 40% compared to the prior year, with Access Equipment and Defense showing the most significant growth.\nWe anticipate Commercial sales to increase by high single digits as our markets rebound, while Fire & Emergency sales are expected to remain essentially flat.\nLast year, we benefited from approximately $60 million in temporary cost savings in the third quarter.\nThis will create a headwind for incremental margins during the quarter as our spending begins to return to more typical levels in this year's third quarter with increased business activity.\nWe've just announced an excellent quarter and have a strong outlook for the remainder of the year, with expected growth in revenue, adjusted operating income, and adjusted earnings per share compared to 2020.\nWe anticipate ending the year in a strong position as we look ahead to the next several years.\nSupply challenges persist, but we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on the many opportunities presented by the recovery as we continue to innovate, serve our customers, and advance our company in the future.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Bob Jornayvaz, who serves as Intrepid's co-founder, executive chairman, president and CEO, is joining me on the call today.\nWe have no obligation to revise these statements, which are based on current information available to us.\nOur periodic reports submitted to the SEC, which are incorporated here by reference, outline these risks and uncertainties.\nWe will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial and operational measures during this call.\nOur fourth quarter was marked by robust cash flow and EBITDA, providing a positive conclusion to an unusual year.\nThe positive trends observed in the fourth quarter are persisting into spring, with commodity markets showing strength across both our fertilizer and oilfield divisions.\nWe've seen gradual but consistent progress in our ability to manage the COVID-19 pandemic over the past few months, and we're hopeful that this positive trend will continue as cities begin to ease restrictions now that a significant portion of our most vulnerable populations have been protected.\nWe hope for the best for everyone around the world.\nOur nutrient business finished the year with considerable momentum, which has continued into the first quarter.\nWe predicted the potash market had hit its lowest point during our November earnings call, and recent pricing and demand have surpassed our expectations.\nIn February, we announced an additional potash price increase of $50 per ton, bringing our posted potash prices to $140 per ton above summer fill levels.\nTrio has also experienced strong demand and is currently priced $60 per ton higher than summer fill values.\nCustomers have been keen to secure product as prices continue to rise, locking in some volumes through the second quarter with additional spot purchases occurring throughout spring, and farmers are eager to replenish nutrients at current crop prices.\nRobust commodity pricing across soybeans, corn, wheat, palm oil, sugar, cotton, and improvements in the cocoa and coffee markets all contribute to ongoing global demand.\nIn the fourth quarter, we continued to position ourselves to benefit from the revival of oilfield demand in the Delaware Basin, leading ESG initiatives with a clear focus on full cycle water management.\nFull cycle water management involves minimizing traditional source water use and produced water disposal through environmentally friendly treated produced water recycling.\nWith environmental and sustainability objectives at the forefront for many oil and gas management teams, regulatory bodies, and governments, responsible and innovative water use and reuse is crucial to unlocking the full potential of the Delaware Basin.\nIntrepid is uniquely positioned with its diverse assets and water rights in Southeast New Mexico to become a leader in this field, involved in every aspect of the market from fresh and brine water delivery to recycled and produced water handling and disposal.\nWe are in the initial stages of constructing a produced water disposal system adjacent to our South Ranch and expect to have our first produced water well drilled in the first half of this year.\nAs we wrap up our investment strategies, we are negotiating minimum volume agreements with operators to establish a solid foundation of demand for our investments.\nWe anticipate that producing a water well will cost about $2 million, and we will add extra capital for the surface facility when appropriate.\nThe total investment for our initial well and surface facilities is projected to be $7 million.\nWe believe additional wells can be added as needed based on demand and volume commitments, costing roughly $2 million each.\nBesides produced water, we're developing recycling infrastructure and enhancing our ability to provide services and products necessary for operating in an environment increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance factors.\nWe're currently discussing potential partnerships with several companies in new and exciting areas of oilfield and comprehensive water management, leveraging our unique position and the versatility of our Intrepid freshwater and brine water assets across the Northern Delaware Basin.\nThe Northern Delaware region is home to many well-funded operators with long-term perspectives, and we're noticing many of these operators reassessing their plans for 2021 due to the recent significant improvement in oil prices.\nThe demand for fracking is growing, and the need for source water per completion is at an all-time high.\nIn the first quarter, we sourced water from third parties with positive profit margins to complement our own water rights and existing infrastructure, meeting the increasing volume requirements of operators.\nOur strong connections with these operators and our capacity to meet substantial fresh water needs distinguish us from many other source water providers in the Delaware Basin.\nThe upcoming quarters are crucial for Intrepid as we implement our strategy to grow our oil and gas midstream operations in the Delaware Basin and capitalize on the significant opportunities in comprehensive water management.\nEffective water management and the ability to offer operators a single source capable of meeting both their operational and ESG objectives will be crucial in unlocking this business's potential value in the coming months.\nOur fourth quarter was marked by significant improvements in earnings and EBITDA compared to the third quarter, with favorable fertilizer market conditions and an improving oilfield outlook driving increased gross margin across all our business segments.\nWe reported fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $9.7 million, an increase of over $8 million compared to the third quarter of 2020.\nAs Bob mentioned, the potash market experienced a significant upturn in the fourth quarter with three announced price increases, favorable weather conditions nationwide, and rising commodity prices.\nCustomers sought to replenish potash inventories following a strong fall application season, as evidenced by the 78,000 tons of potash sold in the quarter, a significant increase from the previous year.\nLooking ahead to 2021, we still anticipate first half potash volumes to surpass the prior year by approximately 5% to 10%, despite the large volumes in the fourth quarter.\nThe average net realized sales price will continue to rise into the second quarter as we've incorporated agricultural sales at various price levels throughout the spring.\nWe have fully incorporated the fourth quarter price increases into our second quarter volumes and expect some additional spot sales at our current pricing.\nOverall, we anticipate our net realized pricing to rise from $248 per ton in Q4 2020 to between $300 and $310 per ton in Q2 2021, with Q1's net realized sales price roughly midway between these figures.\nMoving ahead, we maintain our strong emphasis on growing our specialty potash sales, particularly in the premium armory and feed sectors, where we experienced substantial growth in 2020.\nIn our trio segment, domestic demand was strong early in Q4 as we continued to expand sales in key U.S. markets, though total Q4 sales volumes slightly decreased compared to the previous year.\nThis was due to substantial international sales in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nOur listed price has now increased by $60 per ton compared to summer fill rates, and we're observing good acceptance at current prices for the spring season.\nWe anticipate our net realized sales price will climb to about 220 to $230 per ton in Q1 and 230 to $240 per ton in Q2 2021.\nThe oilfield segment showed significant improvement over Q3 as water sales increased from our higher-margin sources and contracts, positively impacting the bottom line.\nTotal water sales, including byproducts, reached $5.8 million in Q4, a $2.2 million increase compared to Q3 2020.\nOperators are deploying more crews than they anticipated just a few months ago, and commodity prices are clearly favorable for the world-class reserves in the Northern Delaware Basin.\nOur debt situation remains unchanged since Q3, with $55 million outstanding, of which $10 million is related to the PPP loan.\nThe SBA is currently reviewing our forgiveness application, with our 90-day review period concluding in April.\nAt year-end, we had $20 million available under our credit facility.\nOperating cash flow was $12.7 million in Q4 and $31 million for the entire year.\nCapital investment for 2020 totaled $16.4 million.\nWe project 2021 capital investment to be between 25 and 35 million, with 12 to 15 million allocated for sustaining capital and the remainder for potential opportunity capital projects.\nWe have considerable flexibility regarding our opportunity capital investments in 2021 and may adjust our investment plans as our expectations for the year evolve.\nWith a robust early start to the spring season, our current cash position is $28 million, with no change in our outstanding debt since year-end.\nWe are now prepared to take questions from the audience.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Accompanying me on the call are Arsen Kitch, our CEO and President, and Mike Murphy, our CFO.\nThe company released its Q3 2020 financial results shortly after the market closed today.\nThe company reported consolidated Q3 net sales of $457 million and adjusted EBITDA of $77 million, representing year-over-year growth of about 3% and 145% respectively.\nHere are some key business highlights to note.\nOur tissue segment drove performance with increased sales and production volumes to meet heightened demand.\nReduced input costs, especially for pulp, were also beneficial compared to last year.\nWe began to restore our tissue service levels to pre-pandemic standards as we continued collaborating with customers to fulfill orders and restock inventories.\nOur paperboard division maintained steady performance, navigating through varied end-market segments with effective execution.\nOur current order backlogs are comparable to previous years, and we successfully introduced the ReMagine folding carton brand, offering recycled content in SBS Board.\nIn Q3, we used generated free cash flow to further reduce our net debt by $40 million and refinanced our 2023 notes with new 2028 notes.\nAs I mentioned in the last two quarters, we continue to prioritize employee health and safety and maintaining operations to serve our customers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe maintain appropriate COVID-19 safeguards including temperature checks, quarantine protocols, sanitization practices, social distancing measures, face covering requirements, remote work options, travel restrictions, and enhanced benefits.\nOur HR and manufacturing leadership teams are doing an outstanding job of proactively monitoring our workforce's health and ensuring adequate staffing levels.\nOur risk mitigation efforts and strategies are effectively reducing the risk of COVID-19 at our facilities.\nI want to express my sincere appreciation to all our employees for their exceptional efforts and resilience during these challenging times.\nI'll now discuss our observations from both the tissue and paperboard segments in the third quarter.\nLet's begin with our Consumer Products division.\nAs previously mentioned, at-home tissue demand remained high during the quarter.\nWe continue to believe this is due to the shift from away-from-home to at-home consumption, as many people continue to work and study from home.\nWe noted in our previous earnings call that these consumption changes were leading to retail sales stabilizing above pre-COVID levels, according to IRI panel data.\nThis resulted in low double-digit retail sales growth in Q3 compared to the same quarter in 2019.\nWe anticipate that this year-over-year increase has continued to moderate as retailers replenished their inventories, consumers reduced their stockpiles, and people adapted to living with the pandemic.\nOur industry perspective remains largely unchanged, so I'll summarize a few key points for context.\nFirst, remember that the US tissue market is traditionally two-thirds at-home and one-third away-from-home.\nAs many states' economies began reopening, we believe this drove some normalization in demand during Q3.\nWe expect ongoing uncertainty related to these reopenings and travel patterns, making it difficult to predict demand drivers for these end markets in the coming quarters.\nIt's also challenging to predict what a new normal might look like once the pandemic eventually subsides.\nSecond, while it's too early to identify trends in branded versus private label market share, we're observing that paper towel demand is outpacing the overall tissue category, while facial tissue demand is lagging.\nWe'll continue to monitor these trends in the coming months and quarters due to the ongoing uncertainty in consumer demand related to COVID-19.\nThird, as we mentioned last quarter, SKU rationalization has occurred, creating additional production capacity.\nWe believe that fewer SKUs benefit both retailers and manufacturers like us.\nWhile some customers are seeking to restore SKUs, we don't expect SKU counts to return to pre-COVID levels in the near to medium term.\nOur tissue segment performed strongly in Q3.\nWe shipped 14.5 million cases, up about 10% compared to Q3 2019, but down 9% from Q2 2020, as anticipated.\nWe continue to perform well for our customers and are pleased with our production efficiency and fixed cost leverage.\nWe've largely replenished inventories throughout the supply chain and are seeing in-stock conditions improve.\nTo meet peak demand during the pandemic, we believe some of our customers made short-term commitments to alternative suppliers and tertiary brands, including imported products.\nAs a result, we believe these customers now have higher than normal inventory levels in several product categories that they're working to reduce.\nWe've also adjusted our sales and customer mix over the past six months to better position our business for long-term growth.\nThis has led us to discontinue service to several customers to reduce complexity and improve our network efficiency.\nWhile we have a strong pipeline of new business for next year, these strategic decisions are expected to negatively impact volume in the next couple of quarters.\nMike will further discuss the impact of these trends on our businesses in the financial outlook section of our discussion.\nAs you may recall, we estimate that about two-thirds of paperboard demand comes from products that are more recession-resistant, while one-third is driven by more economically sensitive or discretionary products.\nOur business, including customer demand, has remained stable despite economic uncertainties.\nClients in our folding carton business, particularly those involved in food and healthcare packaging, are experiencing robust demand, while our foodservice customers, especially those connected to fast food and out-of-home dining, as well as commercial printing firms, are facing weaker market conditions.\nOur presence in various market sectors provided stability to our order book during the quarter.\nUnlike in 2019, we didn't have a scheduled major maintenance shutdown in the third quarter of 2020, which led to improved operational performance.\nOur current sales backlog is in line with previous years, suggesting steady demand.\nDespite our strong quarterly performance, we're dealing with some uncertain market conditions.\nIn our previous earnings call, we unveiled the ReMagine line of SBS folding carton paperboard, which contains up to 30% post-consumer recycled fiber and is FDA-approved for food contact.\nOur NuVo SBS cup stock brand, containing up to 35% post-consumer recycled fiber, along with ReMagine, meets customer and consumer preferences for increased recycled content in sustainable paper-based packaging without compromising safety or quality.\nThe company's consolidated income statement summary is shown for the third quarter and the first nine months of both 2020 and 2019.\nFor the third quarter, earnings per diluted share were $1.28 and adjusted EBITDA reached $77 million.\nThe related segment results can be found on slide eight.\nOur Paperboard division maintained its strong adjusted EBITDA performance, while the consumer products segment benefited from substantial sales growth, fixed cost leverage tied to increased production, and favorable input costs.\nWe initiated our Shelby, North Carolina paper machine in Q2 2019, facing expected start-up costs due to reduced production efficiency, increased waste, and other expenses that continued throughout 2019.\nWe reached our targeted production rate for the new paper machine in Q2 2020 and are now reaping the benefits of the project, including ramping up converting lines, realizing supply chain advantages, and achieving sales gains and mix improvements.\nWhile we're not specifying exact figures for these costs and benefits, the ongoing realization of the Shelby investment significantly contributes to our performance improvement.\nOur product mix continues to improve as Shelby becomes operational, offsetting some year-over-year price impacts.\nWe're benefiting from volume increases related to the production ramp-up, which helped meet heightened demand.\nIn Q3 2020, our tissue business saw positive impacts from overall fixed cost leverage due to increased production, lower input costs, and improved mix, compared to Q3 2019.\nA comparison of our Q3 2020 performance to Q2 2020 can be found on slide 16 in the appendix.\nSlide 10 provides additional context for the exceptional performance of our tissue business, building on the data shared last quarter.\nThe slide presents IRI panel data, offering a snapshot of retail tissue sales in dollars.\nThe line chart shows monthly year-over-year changes, while the box data presents a quarterly comparison to the previous year.\nRetail sales are estimated to have grown by 34% in Q1, 23% in Q2, and 12% in Q3.\nThe data reveals the pantry-loading phenomenon at the end of Q1 and beginning of Q2, which has since given way to more stable demand for our retail customers.\nDuring our last quarterly call, we anticipated IRI panel data to show growth in the 10-15% range for Q3, and it came in close to 12%.\nWe expect year-over-year sales growth to continue moderating in Q4.\nThis projection is uncertain and depends on consumer behavior, retail buying patterns, and COVID-related restrictions.\nOur Q3 sales were 14.5 million cases, representing a 9% unit decline from Q2 but a 10% unit growth compared to the previous year, as anticipated.\nOur Q3 production was 15.3 million cases, down 4% from Q2 but up 19% year-over-year.\nProduction levels benefited from the Shelby ramp-up and SKU rationalization.\nThe cost leverage from significantly increased production, along with improved freight and logistics costs, led to continued strong results.\nSlide 11 shows a year-over-year adjusted EBITDA comparison for our paperboard business.\nLower pricing, reflected in Macy's reported price decrease in February, was partially offset by a favorable product mix.\nThe absence of a planned major maintenance outage at our Idaho mill was also a significant factor in year-over-year improvement.\nOverall, our team managed operations well in the quarter and continued to deliver stable results.\nA comparison of our Q3 2020 performance to Q2 2020 can be found on slide 17 in the appendix.\nOur Q3 performance exceeded expectations with stronger sales and production volumes in tissue and continued stability in paperboard, despite weak economic conditions.\nThese factors, combined with outstanding operational execution, delivered robust results.\nSlide 12 provides an outlook for Q4.\nAs discussed earlier, the tissue outlook largely depends on sales demand.\nWe recently ended relationships with some customers and specific products to better position ourselves for the future.\nAdditionally, several large customers placed substantial orders with us and other suppliers in Q3, leaving them with high inventories in several product categories.\nAs a result, we're seeing order pace slow in October as customers adjust their supply chains.\nOur October shipments were around 4 million cases, down from an average of 4.8 million cases per month in Q3 2020 and 4.4 million cases per month in Q4 2019.\nWe anticipate our tissue sales to be at or below Q4 2019 levels.\nOur production will also decrease to meet this level of demand, ensuring our inventories don't exceed targeted levels, which will impact the fixed cost absorption that had benefited Clearwater throughout much of 2020.\nExpenses for inputs are predicted to remain largely favorable, with the exception of some rising shipping costs.\nAs previously noted, our paperboard division has remained consistent overall, and while we continue to prepare for potential economic downturn related to COVID-19, our diverse customer base and market exposure continue to position us favorably through the end of October.\nAssuming demand remains steady and prices and raw material costs stay relatively stable, we anticipate fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA to range between $52 million and $62 million.\nThis estimate also assumes we can continue operating our facilities without major COVID-related interruptions.\nFor the entirety of 2020, we expect the following outcomes.\nWe project interest expenses to be between $46 million and $48 million, which is slightly lower than previous estimates due to debt repayments.\nWe anticipate depreciation to fall between $109 million and $112 million.\nCapital expenditures are likely to approach $45 million, and we don't expect to be a net cash taxpayer in 2020.\nWhile we're not ready to provide specific guidance for 2021, there are several factors to consider.\nScheduled major maintenance expenses are expected to decrease our earnings in 2021 compared to 2020 by $25 million to $30 million.\nWe've revised this guidance on slide 22, which represents a slight increase from the previous estimate of $23 million to $27 million.\nThis increase is partly due to a new project to replace the head box on one of our Lewiston paper machines, requiring additional downtime.\nBased on third-party forecasts, we anticipate a rise in pulp prices of around $50 per ton.\nAs a reminder, we purchase approximately 300,000 tons of pulp annually.\nCapital expenditures are expected to return to our historical average of about $50 million.\nSlide 13 presents an overview of our capital structure.\nWe used approximately $40 million of free cash flow to reduce our net debt, which included a $40 million voluntary prepayment of our term loans, and our liquidity stood at $277 million.\nDuring the quarter, we refinanced our 2023 notes with new 2028 notes, extending the maturity by approximately 5.5 years at an attractive rate of 4.75%.\nWe also secured an amendment to our ABL facility, providing additional reporting and operational flexibility.\nS&P recognized our improving credit status and removed us from negative outlook.\nWe continue to make progress in reducing our net debt and enhancing our financial flexibility.\nI'd like to reiterate our value proposition, which we discussed in our previous earnings call and shared with investors throughout the quarter.\nWe believe Clearwater Paper is well-positioned across two attractive and complementary business segments.\nOur Consumer Products division is a leader in the growing private-label tissue market.\nFrom our perspective, we believe the key strengths of this business are as follows.\nFirstly, we have a nationwide presence with the ability to supply a wide range of product categories and quality levels, which is appealing to our customers.\nOur expertise in manufacturing, supply chain, and transportation is a key differentiator, especially during challenging times like today.\nSecondly, there are long-term trends favoring private label products over branded ones.\nThese trends have typically been amplified during economic downturns.\nPrivate label tissue market share in the US increased to over 30% in 2019, up from 18% in 2011.\nWhile these trends are impressive, we're still far from the levels seen in many European countries, where private labels account for over half of the total tissue market share.\nLastly, tissue is an economically resilient and essential product.\nHistorically, demand has not been negatively impacted by economic uncertainty.\nRegarding our Paperboard division, we believe its key strengths are as follows.\nFirstly, we operate well-maintained assets with a geographic footprint that allows us to efficiently serve customers on both coasts.\nWe have a diverse customer base serving end markets with largely stable demand.\nSecondly, not being vertically integrated allows us to focus on independent customers with unparalleled service and quality commitment.\nThirdly, we believe the business is well-positioned to capitalize on trends towards more sustainable packaging and food service products.\nLastly, our paperboard business has demonstrated the ability to generate strong margins and consistent cash flows.\nOverall, our major capital investments are behind us, and we're prioritizing cash flows to reduce debt, as demonstrated in the third quarter with a net debt reduction of approximately $40 million, bringing our total reduction in 2020 to over $140 million.\nWe plan to continue deleveraging by realizing benefits from our Shelby investment, pursuing operational improvements, actively managing working capital, and prudently allocating capital.\nWhile we expect lower tissue shipments in the coming quarters, we're making strategic decisions to support our customers' success and position our business for long-term growth.\nWe believe this strategy is the best approach to create value for both equity and debt holders.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Brian Chambers, the CEO and Chairman, and Ken Parks, the CFO, are joining us for today's meeting.\nYou can find information on our Investors page in the Corporate section of our website.\nBefore we start, please take a look at slide 2 for some important notes.\nWe are not obligated to provide updates to these statements beyond what is legally required by securities regulations.\nI sincerely hope everyone participating in this call is in good health and staying safe.\nI'm glad to report that our team has consistently overcome the challenges that have significantly impacted our businesses, markets, and ways of working and living over the past year.\nAlthough many of these challenges continue to affect our daily lives, we have now become accustomed to them.\nWe've become more flexible in adapting to changing market conditions, showing that strong performance and an unwavering dedication to our employees and customers can lead to exceptional results even in difficult circumstances.\nWe clearly demonstrated this in Q1, achieving excellent operational and financial results by utilizing our leading market positions, unique technologies, and enterprise model to capitalize on strong or improving market conditions.\nKen will provide more details on our financial performance after my initial remarks.\nI will then return to discuss our business outlook for Q2 and share our views on key markets.\nAs always, I'll start with safety, where we remain focused on working together to protect each other, our customers, and our suppliers.\nWe maintained a very safe environment in Q1, with an RIR of 0.64, consistent with our full-year 2020 performance.\nMore than 50% of our global facilities have been injury-free for over a year.\nWe achieved record Q1 revenue of $1.9 billion, a 20% increase compared to Q1 2020, or 18% on a constant currency basis, and adjusted EBIT of $282 million, which is more than double last year's Q1 and a record for any first quarter.\nOur global teams performed excellently, delivering outstanding financial results in a dynamic market environment, showcasing our company's earnings potential.\nOur Q1 performance was driven by strong volumes, broad price realization, and efficient manufacturing across all businesses, resulting in a 15% adjusted EBIT margin for the company, with all three businesses posting double-digit EBIT margins for the third consecutive quarter.\nWe observed widespread strength across many of our end markets during the quarter.\nThe US residential housing market remains robust, with both repair and remodeling activity and new construction growth driving strong demand for our products.\nWe also saw improvement in many of our global markets and commercial and industrial end markets throughout the quarter.\nWhile market conditions have improved, our operating priorities, investments, and execution have positioned us to deliver these strong financial results.\nWe continue to invest in growth and productivity initiatives across the enterprise to serve our customers and enhance our operating performance.\nIn Insulation, we're investing in automation and process technologies to create a more cost-effective, flexible manufacturing network in our residential insulation business to capitalize on the strong housing market.\nWe're also investing in new Insulation materials and systems for nonresidential applications to expand our global product range.\nIn Composites, we're investing to grow in higher-value downstream applications like building and construction, wind energy, and infrastructure.\nWe're also focusing on optimizing our low-cost manufacturing network to serve key markets such as North America, Europe, and India.\nIn roofing, we're leveraging our vertical integration model to develop innovative products and systems, expanding our roofing components offering, and strengthening partnerships with contractors and distributors to help grow their businesses with our products and brands.\nOur enterprise operating model enables all of this work by leveraging our commercial strength, material science capabilities, and global operating scale to expand growth opportunities, improve operating efficiencies, and generate strong free cash flow.\nWe recently announced the appointment of two excellent executives.\nI'd like to congratulate Dr. Jose Mendez Andino on his promotion to Chief Research and Development Officer.\nMaterial science research and product and process innovation are fundamental to our value delivery as a company.\nJose will play a crucial role in leading our efforts to increase our innovation pipeline and ensure we're helping our customers succeed and grow in the market.\nGina Beredo has joined us as Executive Vice President and General Counsel.\nShe comes from Nordson Corporation, where she served for 8 years, most recently as their General Counsel.\nGina brings over 20 years of experience across multiple industries and will be a valuable partner to me and our entire executive team.\nWe recently published our 15th annual sustainability report titled \"Beyond Today Shaping Tomorrow.\"\nOur sustainability journey began nearly two decades ago, and our goals have evolved beyond environmental sustainability.\nThey now focus on three key pillars: expanding our products' positive impact, reducing our environmental footprint, and increasing our social impact.\nWe're proud of our progress over the past decade across all our 2020 sustainability goals, particularly in climate action, where we've reduced absolute greenhouse gas emissions from our operations by 60% since our peak year, despite several significant acquisitions.\nOur 2030 goals commit to further reducing these emissions by 50%, resulting in 2030 absolute greenhouse gas emissions being 75% below our peak.\nWe're also committed to a 30% reduction in our scope 3 emissions, focusing on making a positive impact throughout our supply chain.\nSustainability is central to our purpose and will continue to be an important driver and differentiator for our company.\nAs Brian mentioned, Owens Corning delivered outstanding Q1 financial results.\nStrong top-line growth, 400 basis points of gross margin expansion, and continued operating expense discipline led to record Q1 adjusted EBIT and a 15% adjusted EBIT margin.\nStronger earnings, combined with continued focus on working capital management and capital investments, resulted in healthy Q1 free cash flow generation.\nWhile benefiting from generally stronger market conditions than a year ago, solid execution across the business was fundamental to this performance.\nAs expected, we're managing a more inflationary environment, primarily related to materials and transportation.\nPositive price realization and manufacturing productivity more than offset the inflation headwind in the quarter.\nKeeping a positive balance remains a priority as we navigate through this period of inflation.\nLet's move on to the next slide.\nWe can examine our results more closely.\nIn Q1, we saw consolidated net sales of $1.9 billion, a 20% increase from 2020, with all three segments showing double-digit revenue growth, reflecting the strong US residential housing market and improving commercial and industrial sectors.\nQ1 2021 adjusted EBIT reached $282 million, an increase of $166 million year-over-year, with all three segments maintaining double-digit EBIT margins.\nFirst quarter adjusted earnings were $183 million or $1.73 per diluted share, compared to $67 million or $0.62 per diluted share in Q1 2020.\nQ1 depreciation and amortization expense was $119 million, slightly higher than the previous year.\nOur Q1 capital additions were $60 million, up $6 million from Q1 2020.\nWe will maintain disciplined capital spending, focusing on generating strong free cash flow and prioritizing growth and productivity investments.\nThe next slide reconciles our Q1 adjusted EBIT of $282 million to our reported EBIT of $301 million.\nWe recognized $20 million in gains from selling certain precious metals this quarter.\nOur ongoing productivity improvements and manufacturing technology advancements have allowed us to redesign our production tooling and reduce some precious metal holdings.\nWe also recorded $1 million in restructuring costs related to the Insulation network optimization actions initiated in Q4 2020.\nThese items are not included in our adjusted Q1 EBIT.\nThe following slide provides a high-level comparison of our Q1 adjusted EBIT for 2021 and 2020.\nOur adjusted EBIT of $282 million set a new Q1 record for the company, increasing by $166 million year-over-year.\nRoofing and Insulation more than doubled their EBIT, while Composites grew by 80%.\nBefore reviewing each business, I want to address the one-time financial impacts from February's winter storms.\nAll our businesses faced operational disruptions due to the storms.\nHowever, these were offset by gains on renewable energy settlements in each business.\nAs mentioned in our year-end call, these impacts were factored into our Q1 guidance.\nLet's move to the next slide.\nI'll provide more detailed information on each business's performance.\nThe Insulation business performed well, achieving strong growth in both revenue and profit.\nQ1 sales were $700 million, a 16% increase from Q1 2020.\nWe saw strong volumes across the business as US new construction remained robust, and many global commercial end markets continued to improve.\nIn North American residential Fiberglas Insulation, we're operating at full capacity as the US new residential market remains very strong.\nVolumes increased in line with our previous expectations, and we continue to see positive pricing from actions taken over the past three quarters.\nI'm pleased to report that we started our batts and rolls lines in Kansas City in February and ramped up production throughout the quarter.\nIn technical and other insulation, we saw volume growth across the business, with our highly specialized products continuing to see increased demand in North America and Europe.\nPricing remains stable, and we benefited from currency translation this quarter.\nOverall, the Insulation business's good manufacturing execution partially offset ongoing transportation challenges and accelerating material inflation.\nWe achieved 12% margins and $82 million in EBIT, more than doubling the $39 million EBIT from Q1 last year.\nThe Composites business had a strong start to the year.\nQ1 sales were $559 million, up 13% year-over-year.\nBetter-than-expected volume growth resulted from demand for downstream applications in building, construction, and wind markets, as well as demand in key regions where our local supply for local demand model is valued by customers, driving higher volumes compared to last year.\nWe also saw positive price realization in Composites, resulting from our most recent contract negotiations and market strength.\nOperationally, solid manufacturing performance offset headwinds from material and transportation inflation.\nComposites delivered $79 million in EBIT and a 14% EBIT margin for the quarter.\nThe next slide provides an overview of our Roofing business.\nRoofing produced its strongest first quarter top and bottom line performance as we continue to operate in a sold-out environment.\nQ1 sales were $711 million, up 28% year-over-year.\nThe US asphalt shingle market grew 26% for the quarter compared to last year, with our US shingle volumes slightly outperforming the market.\nWe're seeing strong realization on our announced price increases, and price-cost remained positive as asphalt deflation continued to narrow through the quarter, and we began facing transportation inflation.\nLike the other two businesses, strong manufacturing performance was crucial to the Roofing business results.\nFor the quarter, EBIT was $156 million, up $92 million from last year, achieving 22% EBIT margins.\nLet's move to the next slide.\nI'll discuss key financial highlights for Q1 and full-year 2021.\nContinued discipline in managing working capital, operating expenses, and capital investments resulted in strong cash flow.\nAdditionally, we didn't experience the typical seasonal working capital build in Q1 due to robust demand across our businesses.\nThe company's free cash flow for Q1 2021 was $120 million, showing a $264 million increase compared to Q1 2020\nThis was an unprecedented achievement for a first quarter\nIn Q1 2021, the company bought back 1.6 million shares of its common stock and distributed $197 million to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends\nThe company maintains a robust investment-grade balance sheet and operates within its target debt to adjusted EBITDA range with sufficient liquidity, thanks to strong cash performance and previous year's debt reduction efforts\nAt the end of the quarter, the company had about $1.7 billion in liquidity, comprising $605 million in cash and nearly $1.1 billion in combined availability on its bank debt facilities\nThe company remains committed to consistently generating strong free cash flow, returning at least 50% to investors over time, and maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet\nNow, let's look at the 2021 outlook for key financial items\nThere are no changes from the initial outlook provided in February\nGeneral corporate expenses are expected to be between $135 million and $145 million\nCapital additions are anticipated to be around $460 million, which is less than the expected depreciation and amortization of about $480 million\nThe company continues to seek opportunities to support its businesses at a sustained lower level of capital intensity over time\nInterest expense is estimated to be between $120 million and $130 million\nThe company expects its 2021 effective tax rate to be 26% to 28% of adjusted pre-tax earnings and its cash tax rate to be 18% to 20% of adjusted pre-tax earnings\nThe company is closely monitoring potential changes to the US tax landscape and will be proactive in mitigating the long-term effect on its cash tax rate\nThe first quarter performance provided a strong start to the year\nLooking ahead, the company anticipates robust US residential repair, remodeling, and new construction end markets, with commercial and industrial markets continuing to strengthen\nDespite ongoing market uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company's teams are performing exceptionally well, producing results that demonstrate the company's earnings potential and positioning it well for continued outstanding performance\nGiven the strength of key markets and continued operational performance, the company expects to generate another quarter of significant revenue and earnings growth in the second quarter compared to the previous year\nConsistent with prior practice, the business outlook comments will focus on expectations for Q2\nIn each business, prior year comparisons are expected to be influenced by pandemic-related market responses that affected production and volume shipments last year\nIn the Insulation segment, the company continues to see strength in new U.S. residential construction\nGiven the decline in North American residential Fiberglas Insulation shipments last year during Q2, the company expects those shipments to grow about 25%, with pricing continuing to improve from the realization of the April increase\nDue to the inflation outlook, the company has recently announced an 8% price increase effective June 28\nIn the technical and other building insulation businesses, volumes are recovering to pre-COVID levels\nIn Q2, the company expects volumes to be up mid-teens as demand increases for its products in global building and construction applications\nPricing in these businesses is expected to remain relatively stable to slightly up\nThe company expects material and transportation cost increases faced in Q1 to continue more significantly in the current quarter, partially offset by ongoing strong manufacturing productivity\nThe company anticipates benefits of approximately $30 million from better fixed cost absorption on higher production volumes\nGiven these factors, EBIT margins are expected to improve sequentially, approaching mid-teens for the quarter\nIn the Composites segment, volume growth is expected to continue at a strong pace, up approximately 30% versus the prior year\nPricing is also expected to improve low to mid-single digits year-over-year\nMargins should benefit from the reversal of roughly $30 million of curtailment cost seen in Q2 2020\nConsistent with the broader industry trend, inflation will represent a more meaningful headwind for the business, which the company expects to partially offset through productivity gains\nOn a sequential basis, EBIT margins in Q2 are expected to be similar to the first quarter\nIn the Roofing segment, the market is expected to be up between 15% and 20%, with the company's volumes up mid to high single digits\nThe company anticipates its volume growth will trail the market growth due to the strength of its shipments in Q2 of last year\nRoofing pricing is expected to improve with the announced increase of 5% to 7% that was effective at the beginning of this month\nThe company expects to face more significant headwinds in asphalt cost and other material inputs, particularly resin used in its components business\nIn response, the company has recently announced an additional price increase of 4% to 6% effective in mid-June\nOverall, EBIT margins are expected to increase sequentially from Q1, approaching mid-20%\nThe company remains committed to generating strong operating and free cash flow\nCapital allocation priorities remain focused on reinvesting in the business, especially productivity and organic growth initiatives, returning at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases, and maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet\nThe company is also evaluating investments in bolt-on acquisitions that leverage its commercial, operational, and geographic strengths and expand its building and construction product offering\nThe company is well-positioned to capitalize on near-term market opportunities as well as several longer-term secular trends that provide multi-year growth opportunities\nThese trends include demand for new housing in the US, continued remodeling investments, growing opportunities from the drive for increased energy efficiency in homes and buildings, greater importance placed on sustainability and material durability, and additional investments in renewable energy and infrastructure\nEach of these trends creates opportunities for the company to leverage its material science, building science, and unique product and process technologies to partner with customers and help them grow with additional products, systems, and services\nThe company is proud of its outstanding operational and financial performance in the first quarter and is excited by the opportunities to grow, help customers win in the market, and deliver value to shareholders.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:For phone listeners, there may be a delay in slide transitions.\nOperating margins refer to operating income and sales, not including surcharge.\nLet's review our safety performance on Slide four.\nOur year-to-date total case incident rate (TCIR) is 0.6.\nWe've achieved three straight quarters with a TCIR below 1.0, which is outstanding safety performance.\nWe continue to improve our safety program in areas like hand safety, human performance, leadership training, ergonomics, employee engagement, and home safety initiatives.\nWe aim to reach our next safety milestone as we strive for zero incidents.\nOur Q3 results met expectations, with COVID-19 still affecting our financial performance.\nBoth SAO and PEP segments performed as predicted in our Q2 earnings call.\nWe've maintained focus on key strategic goals during this difficult time.\nPrioritize employee safety.\nGenerate cash flow and improve liquidity.\nWe've produced $189 million in free cash flow over the last four quarters, ending Q3 with $539 million in total liquidity, including $244 million cash and no immediate financial obligations.\nNurture long-term customer relationships.\nWe expanded customer connections and found new ways to create value this quarter.\nWe extended several contracts, mainly in medical, transportation, and aerospace and defense sectors.\nAerospace customers recognize that supply will be limited when production returns to normal levels, as capacity was already constrained before the pandemic.\nCarpenter Technology is unique in investing in capacity, specifically the Athens facility.\nQualification processes continued despite the pandemic, with a significant provisional approval received this quarter.\nThe new hot strip mill at our Reading campus is in final testing stages.\nThis advanced mill enhances our soft magnetics capabilities, positioning us to benefit from the electrification trend.\nLet's discuss end-use market updates on Slide six.\nCOVID-19 has significantly impacted our customers and markets, especially aerospace and defense, our largest sector.\nWe've offset some of the aerospace downturn by capitalizing on increased demand in transportation, industrial, and consumer markets, particularly our semiconductor business.\nRecently, all our end-use markets have shown positive trends, moving beyond their pandemic-related declines.\nAll sectors are recovering, though at different rates.\nWe believe the worst is over and expect improving conditions in coming quarters.\nAerospace and defense sales decreased both annually and sequentially.\nCustomer inventories continued to decline in Q3, with some initial restocking activity.\nRemoving the impact of one-time customer contract items from Q2, aerospace results would be relatively stable sequentially.\nWhile visibility remains limited, overall outlook suggests gradual improvement through 2021, with accelerated activity in 2022 and beyond.\nFuture industry capacity and lead times remain key topics in customer discussions, as most recall the extended lead times before COVID-19.\nDefense submarket activity remains strong, with increased demand for certain programs.\nMedical sales increased 7% sequentially.\nElective procedure volumes grew compared to Q2 as patient confidence and hospital capacity improved.\nElective surgery recovery is expected to continue into late 2021 as vaccination rates increase.\nWe anticipate further improvement in medical market activity in Q4 as customers prepare for increased elective surgeries.\nMedical was one of our fastest-growing markets pre-pandemic.\nWe remain well-positioned to support this market with our expanded OEM relationships, advanced materials portfolio, and ability to develop new solutions for complex market needs.\nTransportation sales increased both sequentially and year-over-year.\nSales grew across all submarkets sequentially.\nLight vehicle demand remains strong, driven by North America and China.\nThe heavy-duty truck market has largely recovered and is expected to grow through 2022.\nWe're gaining market share in both light vehicle and heavy-duty truck segments due to our high-temperature, high-resistance turbocharger and valve exhaust solutions.\nEnergy market conditions remain challenging, with low activity levels in the U.S. oil and gas submarket, while international markets show some improvement.\nNote that last year's Q3 results included our Amega West business, which we divested in Q1 this fiscal year.\nIn power generation, we continue working with customers during the current maintenance upgrade cycle.\nIndustrial and consumer sales decreased year-over-year and sequentially.\nThe slight sequential decline was due to order flow between the last two quarters, as we continue to see demand increase in line with the general manufacturing recovery.\nTurning to Slide 8, the income statement summary.\nQ3 net sales were $351.9 million, with sales excluding surcharge at $298.1 million.\nSales excluding surcharge were essentially flat sequentially on 5% lower volume.\nCompared to Q3 last year, sales fell 40% on 39% lower volume.\nAs Tony explained in the end-use market review, the year-over-year decline is due to ongoing demand challenges in our key aerospace and defense and medical markets resulting from the global pandemic.\nDemand was similar to recent Q2 levels, as expected.\nGiven the current demand environment, we continue to actively manage production schedules and focus on our targeted inventory reduction program.\nWhile reducing inventory improves near-term cash flow, as seen in our liquidity position, it negatively impacts our operating income performance.\nQ3 SG&A expenses were $47.8 million, down $3 million from the same period last year, reflecting our cost reduction actions, including eliminating about 20% of global salaried positions late last fiscal year, closely managing discretionary spending, and reduced administrative costs due to remote working conditions, such as lower travel and entertainment expenses.\nIn sequential order, SG&A expenses increased by $5.6 million due to additional costs related to the new ERP system implementation and its associated depreciation expenses.\nThe quarter's operating results include $7.6 million in restructuring and asset impairment charges, including inventory write-downs, linked to ongoing cost reduction and focus narrowing efforts in the additive business unit within the PEP segment.\nThis quarter's results also include $2.7 million in COVID-19-related expenses, slightly lower than the $3.9 million incurred in the previous quarter.\nThese COVID-19 costs encompass direct incremental operating expenses such as enhanced cleaning services, isolation pay for potentially exposed employees, and additional protective equipment and supplies necessary to maintain operations while ensuring employee safety.\nExcluding special items like restructuring, asset impairment charges, and COVID-19 costs, the operating loss for the current quarter was $40 million.\nThe adjusted operating loss was $29.7 million, compared to an operating income of $58.7 million in the same period last year and an adjusted operating loss of $32.3 million in the previous quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nThe current quarter's results largely met expectations set at the quarter's start, reflecting the impact of significantly lower volume compared to last year, combined with a targeted inventory reduction, partially offset by cost-cutting measures.\nThis quarter's other expense category includes an $8.9 million non-cash pension settlement charge related to the company's largest qualified pension plan.\nThe pension plan's net liabilities were remeasured due to the charge, resulting in an expected $3 million reduction in pension expenses for the full fiscal year compared to previous estimates.\nFor clarity, this decrease in net pension expense does not affect operating income.\nThe effective tax rate for the third quarter was 29.2%.\nFor the remainder of the year, the expected tax rate is between 28% and 30%.\nThe quarter's earnings per share showed a loss of $0.84.\nExcluding special items, the adjusted earnings per share loss was $0.54.\nShifting focus to Slide nine and the SAO segment results, net sales for the quarter were $299.6 million, or $246.5 million excluding surcharge.\nCompared to the same quarter last year, sales excluding surcharge decreased by 38% on 37% lower volume.\nSequentially, sales excluding surcharge remained relatively stable with a 3% lower volume.\nThese sequential results reflect similar weakened demand in the primary aerospace and defense market as the supply chain manages near-term reductions in OEM production rates.\nThis was partially offset by increased shipments in transportation due to strong demand for materials driven by North American light vehicle production.\nSAO reported a $9.9 million operating loss for the current quarter.\nIn the same quarter last year, SAO's operating income was $76.4 million.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, SAO reported an operating loss of $11.6 million.\nThe year-over-year decrease in operating income mainly reflects lower volume impacts and negative effects of inventory reduction, partially offset by cost-cutting measures.\nDuring the current quarter, SAO reduced inventory by about $15 million, bringing the year-to-date inventory reduction to $146 million.\nThe sequential improvement in operating loss is primarily due to lower volume, offset by a favorable product mix and a less significant impact from inventory reduction compared to the second quarter, partly due to rising raw material prices.\nThe current quarter's results include approximately $2.1 million in direct incremental costs related to COVID-19 protection efforts, compared to $3.2 million in the previous quarter.\nLooking ahead, demand conditions across most end-use markets are expected to stabilize and gradually recover starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nBased on current projections, SAO is anticipated to generate an operating loss of about $5 million to $7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nThis guidance includes similar sequential COVID-19-related costs in the upcoming quarter.\nAdditionally, as inventory reduction continues, a non-cash LIFO decrement charge is expected in the fourth quarter.\nDue to significant inventory reductions expected for the full fiscal year, LIFO layers with higher inventory costs than fiscal year 2021 are being liquidated, resulting in a non-cash charge to the income statement.\nThe provided guidance excludes the impact of any non-cash LIFO decrement charges.\nTurning to Slide 10 and the PEP segment results, net sales excluding surcharge were $64.9 million, down 39% from the same quarter last year but up 20% sequentially.\nThe year-over-year sales decline was driven by market challenges largely due to the global pandemic.\nAdditionally, sales in the energy end-use market declined following the exit from the Amega West oil and gas business in the first quarter of this fiscal year.\nThe sequential increase in sales reflects growing demand for titanium materials in aerospace, defense, and medical end-use markets.\nThe distribution business also saw higher sales due to increased demand related to strong activity in the automotive supply chain.\nThe additive business experienced a modest sales increase as demand improved.\nPEP reported a $3.3 million operating loss in the current quarter.\nThis compares to a $7.2 million operating loss in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 and a $0.3 million operating loss in the same quarter last year.\nThe sequential operating results reflect the positive impacts of higher volumes across all PEP business units.\nLooking ahead, demand conditions are expected to gradually improve in the coming quarters, with PEP anticipated to generate an operating loss of $0 million to $1 million in the upcoming fourth quarter.\nSimilar to SAO, the PEP guidance includes COVID-19 costs in line with the recent quarter but excludes any non-cash LIFO decrement charges.\nReviewing free cash flow on Slide 11, the current quarter generated $4 million in cash from operating activities.\nInventory reduction continued, although less pronounced than in previous quarters.\nOver the last four quarters, starting with the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, inventory has been reduced by nearly $300 million, including $182 million in reductions so far in fiscal year 2021.\nRegarding other working capital, the new ERP system implementation caused some challenges with customer collections, reducing cash from accounts receivable.\nThese issues are largely resolved, and the benefits of catching up are expected in the upcoming fourth quarter.\nCapital expenditures for the third quarter totaled $19 million.\nFor fiscal year 2021, capital expenditures are expected to be between $110 million and $120 million, depending on the timing of certain projects scheduled for completion in the remainder of the fiscal year.\nThe cash-generating actions taken in the current environment have been crucial.\nIt's important to note that the company values returning capital to shareholders and has continued to pay quarterly dividends despite challenging economic conditions.\nThe quarterly dividend demonstrates confidence in the ability to manage near-term market impacts and long-term business prospects.\nIn the quarter, we reported a negative free cash flow of $25 million, taking into account the aforementioned details\nWe encountered some difficulties in collecting accounts receivable during the quarter, as I previously mentioned\nWe believe we've resolved these issues and will continue to pursue opportunities to further reduce inventory as we look towards the fourth quarter\nWe are aiming for at least $50 million in positive free cash flow in our upcoming fourth quarter, given this information\nAt the end of the current quarter, our total liquidity stood at $539 million, comprising $244 million in cash and $295 million in available credit facility borrowings\nIt's worth noting that we modified and extended our credit facility this quarter, reducing it from $400 million to $300 million, which is reflected in the sequential change in liquidity\nI'll now move to Slide 12 to discuss our capital structure\nWe've maintained a balanced approach to capital allocation over the years\nWhen the global pandemic emerged just over a year ago, we quickly shifted our focus to building liquidity, which was made possible by our strong capital allocation philosophy\nIn addition to the cost-cutting measures and cash generation focus we implemented earlier this year, we took action to extend our maturity profile and increase our cash reserves with our July 2020 notes offering\nThis extended our notes due in July 2021 to July 2028\nWe completed another crucial step in our strategy last month, in March 2021, by executing an amended and extended credit facility\nThe previous credit facility was due to expire in March 2022\nThe new facility will mature in March 2024\nWith these actions behind us, we have no imminent maturities and possess significant liquidity with potential for further growth\nWe recognize that varying demand recovery timelines and customer ordering patterns will continue to influence our short-term quarter-to-quarter mix\nI'd like to share our optimism regarding mid-term and long-term prospects in the end-use markets we serve\nLet's begin with the aerospace sector\nWe've continued to strengthen our already robust position during the downturn\nMost industry experts anticipate demand will recover to and surpass pre-COVID-19 levels, which were already showing signs of constraint\nIn the long run, the industry will require improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions, driving demand for better engine materials where we are well-positioned\nThe defense sector is expected to maintain market resilience for key platforms requiring increased strength, customer satisfaction, and fatigue performance\nWe are monitoring long-term funding patterns as governments reassess their budgets following significant COVID-19-related expenditures\nIn the medical field, as orthopedics and dental procedures follow the cardiology recovery, we continue to gain market share and identify additional opportunities, largely due to our wide range of high-value material solutions supporting industry innovation\nWe anticipate this trend to continue long-term, as quicker patient recoveries and improved outcomes will be key drivers\nIn transportation, with recovery well underway in North America and China, regulations are driving the near-term shift towards higher efficiency powertrains, which benefits our portfolio of high-temperature materials\nAs electric vehicle adoption grows in the long term, they will naturally claim an increasing share from the large internal combustion engine base\nWe have a clear understanding of the life cycle decline of these products and are balancing our focus accordingly\nAs mentioned earlier, our new hot strip mill provides capability and capacity to support significant future electric vehicle volume growth\nThe energy sector experienced a significant demand decline this past year\nOil prices have increased by 50% in calendar year 2021, and we've seen limited capital expenditures released for some major projects that present specific opportunities\nHowever, a supply and demand imbalance is likely to persist over the next couple of years\nLong-term, we expect continued emphasis on transitioning from oil to natural gas and alternative fuel sources\nIn industrial submarkets, particularly semiconductor and fluid control products, the relatively steady demand we experienced through the pandemic is expected to increase, driven by manufacturing for 5G, Internet of Things connectivity, and more efficient power plants requiring better-performing materials\nThe consumer submarket is expected to maintain its seasonal cyclicality\nHowever, we're observing an increasing number of applications with tighter design constraints that require wave interference removal and utilize our materials for automated sensory feedback responses\nLong-term, with the proliferation of digital and data management, we anticipate more devices with more sensors requiring exponentially more connectivity\nI've discussed our soft magnetics products and their relevance to increasing electrification trends in previous quarters\nWe believe this capability will position us well to capitalize on long-term growth in these areas\nIn the electrification space, we're participating in an increasing number of prototype and initial low-rate production initiatives that use our products to provide power-dense propulsion in ways that rely on reduced mass or where motor space is limited\nWe see current drone, air taxi, and related applications becoming increasingly relevant, especially where options to extend range or boost performance are being exhausted\nLastly, in additive manufacturing, despite some project cancellations or delays and industry consolidation, we believe the competitive landscape has narrowed, focusing attention on the value of our quality and life cycle management platform where data and knowledge management will be crucial to the success of any additive program\nDespite the challenges posed by the pandemic, we have continued to strengthen our foundation for long-term profitable growth\nI'm proud that we continue to strive for a zero-injury workplace and that all our facilities have remained operational during the pandemic\nThese efforts have demonstrated resilience and commitment to our employees, customers, and communities\nWe have adapted to new working conditions, aligned our cost structure and manufacturing footprint with rapidly changing market conditions\nWe have taken several steps to enhance our capital structure, maintain strong liquidity, and extend our debt maturities\nWe concluded the third quarter with $244 million in cash and over $539 million in total liquidity\nOur capital structure activities, combined with targeted cost reduction initiatives, have positioned us on solid ground to not only manage through the downturn but emerge as a leaner, more flexible, and more productive company\nWe have also strengthened our relationships with our customers\nRecovery across our end-use markets remains in various stages, but we expect overall market conditions to continue improving as we progress through the rest of calendar year 2021 and into 2022\nSome markets will recover faster than others, and we are intensely focused on capitalizing on the recovery as opportunities arise\nThis includes our largest end-use market, aerospace and defense, where signs of recovery are beginning to emerge\nWe are working closely with our customers daily to align our production schedules with their material needs as overall sentiment begins to trend upwards\nOur core business is built on 130 years of metallurgical expertise, manufacturing and processing experience, and a commitment to delivering mission-critical solutions to customers in some of the world's largest industries\nThis strong core business will be supported long-term by targeted investments in critical, emerging technologies, including electrification and additive manufacturing\nCollectively, we believe our core business and next-generation capabilities position us to deliver sustainable, long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders in the years to come\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The safe harbor statement is presented on Slide 2.\nThese assertions are derived from our convictions, current expectations, projections, and forecasts.\nNumerous factors beyond the company's control influence its future outcomes.\nDuring the presentation, executives will refer to non-GAAP financial indicators, such as organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, and adjusted diluted EPS.\nBefore delving into our third quarter results and revised 2020 forecast, I'd like to emphasize the significance of West's mission and the core values that guide our operations.\nIn the current uncertain climate with seemingly new challenges arising daily, we maintain our focus on two key priorities: ensuring our team members' safety and maintaining uninterrupted supply of high-quality containment and delivery devices for our customers and the patients we serve.\nWest is uniquely positioned to meet growing market demand by utilizing our global operations and resources, as shown on Slide 5.\nOur team recognized early in the pandemic the necessity to expand production capacity.\nWe were already supporting our base business growth, and the anticipated demand for our products needed for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments meant we had to act swiftly and decisively.\nTo meet the increased demand, we accelerated planned investments in production capacity.\nEarlier this month, we installed new manufacturing equipment at one of our HVP facilities to prepare for future FluroTec and NovaPure demand.\nAs of this week, that capacity is operational, and we're installing additional equipment at a second HVP site, with more installations planned at other global locations in the coming months.\nThe robustness of our performance this past quarter demonstrates the momentum we've built over time with our market-led strategy and One West team approach to meeting market demand.\nMoving to Slide 6, the pandemic-induced disruption has affected how we all conduct business and live our daily lives.\nWest is not exempt from these changes.\nCustomers turn to West for scientific and technical expertise, which sets us apart in the market.\nWe've been investing in digital technology and automation with two goals: introducing new connected products and enhancing operational productivity at all organizational levels.\nWhile we're in the early stages of our digital journey, I'd like to share some recent successes, starting with our manufacturing automation strategy.\nWe've made significant progress over the past year in achieving continuous improvements in quality, safety, service, and cost.\nOur St. Petersburg, Florida site has developed an automated process for robotically loading and unloading molding presses.\nThis has significantly reduced idle production time associated with product changeovers and improved operating efficiency.\nOur Kinston site has automated molding, trimming, and rinsing processes, which will lead to higher quality final products and greater efficiency gains.\nI'm particularly pleased with our team's agility in accelerating the production capacity expansion mentioned earlier.\nExtensive planning and engineering went into this initiative to help us meet our customers' requirements.\nOn the digital front, we've just introduced West Virtual, the future of customer interactions with a truly immersive, fully interactive online experience.\nWe expect this tool to be a primary customer interface, even beyond the current pandemic.\nTurning to Slide 7 and our third quarter performance, our financial results remain strong.\nI'm pleased to report that the growth trends we've experienced over recent quarters continued in the third quarter, and the outlook for the fourth quarter remains positive.\nWe achieved over 18% organic sales growth in the third quarter, driven by robust high-value product sales and contract manufacturing sales.\nWe also experienced solid growth in operating profit margin expansion.\nThis resulted in strong adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for the third quarter.\nSimilar to the second quarter, our base business had solid organic sales growth in the third quarter.\nWe also had incremental sales associated with numerous COVID-19 development projects we're supporting for both therapeutics and vaccines.\nSpecifically for vaccines, towards the end of the quarter, our customers requested accelerated initial deliveries of components, which more than offset continued sales decline of products associated with injectable drugs and treatments such as dental and elective surgeries that have been negatively impacted by the pandemic.\nRegarding our outlook for the rest of the year, we are optimistic about our strong core business and new opportunities to assist customers with pandemic-related solutions.\nAs a result, we are increasing our projected sales and earnings per share for the remainder of this year.\nLet's examine the figures more closely.\nWe'll start by analyzing Q3 2020 revenue and profits, which showed robust growth in sales and earnings per share, primarily due to strong performance in our biologics and generics divisions as well as Contract Manufacturing.\nI'll discuss the margin growth we experienced this quarter and highlight some key points from the balance sheet.\nTo conclude, we'll go over our revised 2020 forecast.\nOur financial performance is outlined on Slide 8, with non-U.S. GAAP measure reconciliations detailed in Slides 16 to 20.\nWe achieved net sales of $548 million, representing an organic sales increase of 18.2%.\nCOVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been roughly $32 million for the quarter.\nThis figure includes our assessment of components related to COVID-19 patient treatment and diagnosis, minus reduced sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic.\nExcluding the net COVID impact, organic sales grew by about 11%.\nTurning to Slide 9.\nProprietary product sales experienced organic growth of 20.3% in the quarter.\nHigh-Value Products, which accounted for over 65% of proprietary product sales in the quarter, saw double-digit growth and maintained strong momentum across all market units throughout Q3.\nExamining the performance of market units, Biologics units delivered robust double-digit growth.\nWe maintain collaborations with numerous biotech and biopharma clients utilizing West and Daikyo high-value product offerings.\nThe generics market unit saw high single-digit growth, driven by sales of Teflon stoppers and FluroTec components.\nOur Pharma market unit experienced mid single-digit growth, with sales led by high-value products and services, including Westar and FluroTec components.\nContract Manufacturing achieved double-digit organic sales growth for the third quarter, once again propelled by sales of diagnostic and healthcare-related injection devices.\nWe continue to see improvements in gross profit.\nWe recorded a gross profit of $194.6 million, which is $46.8 million or 31.7% higher than Q3 of last year.\nOur gross profit margin of 35.5% represented a 310 basis point increase from the same period last year.\nWe observed an improvement in adjusted operating profit, recording $103.9 million this quarter compared to $70.1 million in the same period last year, a 48.2% increase.\nOur adjusted operating profit margin of 19% marked a 360 basis point rise from the same period last year.\nLastly, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew by 46% for Q3.\nExcluding the stock tax benefit of $0.02 in Q3, earnings per share increased by approximately 53%.\nLet's examine the main drivers of both revenue and profits.\nSlide 10 illustrates the contributions to sales growth in the quarter.\nVolume and mix added $77.1 million or 16.9 percentage points of growth, including about $32 million of volume driven by COVID-19-related net demand.\nSales price increases contributed $6.1 million or 1.3 percentage points of growth, while changes in foreign currency exchange rates boosted sales by $8.7 million or 1.9 percentage points.\nRegarding margin performance, Slide 11 displays our consolidated gross profit margin of 35.5% for Q3 2020, up from 32.4% in Q3 2019.\nProprietary products' third-quarter gross profit margin of 40.8% was 260 basis points above the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2019.\nThe key factors behind the continued improvement in proprietary products gross profit margin were: a favorable mix of products sold, driven by high-value products; production efficiencies; and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs.\nContract Manufacturing's gross profit margin in the third quarter reached 17.9%, surpassing the margin from the same period in 2019 by 350 basis points\nThis achievement can be attributed to enhanced efficiency and optimal plan usage\nNow we will examine our financial position and evaluate our progress in cash generation\nKey cash flow metrics are presented on Slide 12\nFor the year-to-date 2020, operating cash flow increased by $63 million to $323.8 million, a 24.2% rise compared to the same period last year\nOur capital expenditure for the year-to-date was $116.7 million, which is $27.9 million more than the same period last year and aligns with our projections\nAs of September 30, 2020, working capital stood at $790.6 million, an increase of $73.5 million from December 31, 2019, mainly due to higher Accounts Receivable from increased sales and inventory growth for safety stock\nOur cash reserves as of September 30 were $519.4 million, $80.3 million higher than December 2019, primarily due to positive operational results\nWe maintain robust capital and financial resources, including strong overall liquidity\nSlide 13 presents a concise overview of our guidance\nWe anticipate full year 2020 net sales to range between $2.1 billion and $2.11 billion\nThis forecast includes approximately $85 million in estimated net COVID-related incremental revenues\nCurrent foreign exchange rates suggest a potential $4 million headwind\nWe project organic sales growth to be around 14% to 15%\nThis is an improvement from our previous guidance of $2.035 billion to $2.055 billion and approximately 12% growth\nOur revised full year 2020 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance is expected to be between $4.50 and $4.55, up from the previous range of $4.15 to $4.25\nAs Eric mentioned, we are increasing our HVP manufacturing capacity at existing locations to meet the anticipated COVID-19 vaccine demand for 2021\nOur capital expenditure guidance remains unchanged at $170 million to $180 million\nI'd like to highlight some crucial aspects of this updated guidance\nBased on current foreign currency exchange rates, estimated FX headwinds are expected to impact earnings per share by approximately $0.02\nThe revised guidance includes a $0.18 earnings per share impact from tax benefits related to stock-based compensation\nTo recap the third quarter's key points: strong revenue growth in both Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing segments, improved gross profit margin, increased operating profit margin, higher adjusted diluted earnings per share, and growth in operating and free cash flow\nOur sales and earnings per share forecasts for 2020 and performance align with our long-term goal of approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and earnings per share expansion\nI'm pleased to announce that we received FDA clearance last night to market our 20 millimeter Vial2Bag advanced product\nOur team is eager to introduce this innovative product to healthcare professionals\nIn conclusion, while we face numerous challenges, we remain committed to our mission, systems, and most importantly, our team to address these issues\nWe see strengths in our core business and are confident in our long-term growth strategy\nOur market-led approach delivers unique value propositions to our customers\nOur global operations network can adapt and respond to demand while maintaining our market-leading service and quality\nOur investments in digital technology and automation will keep us at the forefront of the industry\nWe remain dedicated to delivering value to all our stakeholders on a sustainable basis and contributing to the healthcare industry's efforts to resolve this global pandemic\nOn behalf of West's team members, we continue to wish you well in the coming days\nGila, we are now ready to take questions\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi, and Vice Chairman, Chris O'Herlihy, are accompanying me today.\nMichael Larsen, our Senior Vice President and CFO, is unable to join today's call due to a sports-related injury.\nWe will be discussing ITW's second quarter financial performance and updating our full year 2021 forecast during this call.\nThe second quarter saw ongoing recovery momentum across our portfolio, resulting in strong operational execution and financial performance.\nWe experienced a 43% increase in revenue with 37% organic growth, and every segment and geography showed double-digit growth.\nOur earnings per share rose by 143% to $2.45, or 108% if we exclude the one-time tax benefit of $0.35 recorded this quarter.\nIn this robust demand environment and despite challenging supply conditions, our global teams utilized our long-standing customer-centric manufacturing and supply chain approach, along with the benefits of maintaining full staffing and investment through our winter recovery positioning, to continue providing exceptional service to our customers while also advancing our long-term strategy to achieve and maintain ITW's maximum potential performance.\nWe're optimistic about our organic growth momentum, as order intake rates remained consistently strong across all areas.\nDuring the second quarter, we observed numerous instances where our ability to maintain our distinctive delivery capabilities by staying fully invested throughout the pandemic resulted in additional market share opportunities for our businesses.\nWhile the raw material supply situation is undoubtedly the most challenging we've faced in a long time, possibly ever in my 38-year tenure at ITW, we are in the best possible position to continue distinguishing ourselves through our customer responsiveness.\nWe've spent the last nine years positioning ITW to deliver superior performance in any environment, and I'm confident that the ITW team will continue to execute at a high level throughout the remainder of the year and beyond.\nLet me provide more details about our second quarter performance.\nAs mentioned earlier, organic growth was 37% with strong performance across all seven segments.\nThe two segments most severely impacted by the pandemic last year led this quarter's growth, with Automotive OEM up 84% and Food Equipment up 46%.\nGeographically, North America saw a 36% increase, while international markets grew by 38%, with Europe up 50% and Asia Pacific up 20%.\nGAAP earnings per share reached $2.45, a 143% increase, which included a one-time tax benefit of $0.35 related to the reassessment of net deferred tax assets in the U.K. due to a change in the statutory corporate tax rate.\nExcluding this item, earnings per share grew by 108% to $2.10, setting a Q2 record and surpassing Q2 2019 by 10%.\nOperating income rose by 99% with a 40% incremental margin at the enterprise level.\nOperating margin improved by 680 basis points to 24.3%, driven by strong volume leverage and 150 basis points of benefits from our enterprise initiatives.\nYear-to-date, our teams have delivered substantial margin expansion, with incremental margins for our seven segments ranging from 37% to 48%, including price/cost impact.\nRegarding price/cost, the headwind to margin percentage in the quarter was 120 basis points.\nAlthough raw material cost increases accelerated in the second quarter, our businesses have been proactively implementing pricing actions since early in the year to address rising raw material costs, in line with our strategy to offset these increases on a dollar-for-dollar basis.\nIn Q2, we fell slightly short of this goal due to some timing lags, resulting in a $0.01 reduction in earnings per share from the net price/cost impact.\nWe still anticipate price/cost impact to be EPS-neutral or better for the year, and I'll provide more insight on the price/cost environment later in my remarks.\nThe quarter saw a record after-tax return on invested capital of 30.8%.\nFree cash flow amounted to $477 million, with a conversion rate of 72% of net income when adjusted for the one-time tax benefit mentioned earlier.\nThis was due to additional working capital investments required to support our strong organic growth.\nWe continue to expect approximately 100% conversion for the full year.\nWe repurchased $250 million of our shares this quarter as planned.\nLastly, our tax rate for the quarter was 10.1% due to the one-time tax benefit.\nExcluding this item, our Q2 tax rate was 23%.\nMoving to Slide four for a price/cost update.\nWe continue to face raw material cost increases, particularly in categories such as steel, resins, and chemicals, and now project raw material cost inflation at around 7% for the full year, which is almost five percentage points higher than our initial forecast at the beginning of the year.\nTo put this in perspective, it's roughly twice what we experienced during the 2018 inflation tariff cycle.\nThat experience taught us a great deal.\nOur pricing recovery actions are now much quicker and more timely compared to 2018.\nWe anticipate that the impact of price versus cost will be neutral or positive for earnings per share over the entire year, with price increases more than compensating for cost rises in absolute terms.\nIn the short term, however, price versus cost will continue to negatively affect our operating margin percentage, as seen in Q2, and this impact may be slightly more pronounced in Q3 before reversing.\nFor the entire year, we expect the price versus cost impact to reduce margin by approximately 100 basis points, which is 50 basis points more than our projection at the end of Q1.\nNevertheless, margin improvements from company-wide initiatives and volume increases will sufficiently counteract the negative effect of price versus cost on margin percentage, allowing us to achieve strong overall margin performance for the year.\nLooking beyond the short-term impact of price versus cost, we remain optimistic about significant additional structural margin improvement potential through the continued implementation of our enterprise-wide initiatives.\nThe table on the left of Slide five illustrates the growth momentum in our businesses by comparing sequential revenue from Q1 to Q2.\nAs anticipated, the recovery pace in our Auto OEM segment has been slowed by the widely reported shortage of semiconductor chips, despite very strong underlying demand.\nFor this reason, we included an additional row in the table to show portfolio demand trends excluding Auto.\nOur Q2 revenue, excluding Auto, grew by 8% compared to Q1.\nThis year, Q2 had one more shipping day than Q1, so adjusting for equal days, our Q2 versus Q1 revenue growth excluding Auto is 6%, which is twice our normal Q2 versus Q1 seasonal increase of 3%.\nFurthermore, we added over $200 million to our backlog in Q2.\nBoth of these factors indicate that demand increased significantly across our portfolio in Q2.\nLet's examine each segment in more detail, beginning with Automotive OEM.\nThis segment showed the most evident demand recovery compared to the previous year, with 84% organic growth.\nThis growth was, of course, compared to easy baselines from a year ago when most of our customers in North America and Western Europe were shut down from mid-March to mid-May.\nNorth America saw a 102% increase, Europe grew by 106%, and China rose by 20%.\nWe estimate that the semiconductor chip shortage negatively impacted our sales by approximately $60 million in the quarter.\nThe operating margin of 18.8% increased by 26.6 percentage points due to volume leverage and enterprise initiatives.\nPrice versus cost was a significant headwind of more than 200 basis points due to the longer time required to implement price recovery actions in this segment.\nGiven the ongoing uncertainty in semiconductor chip supply, we now project full-year organic growth in Automotive to be around 10%, compared to our original range of 14% to 18% at the year's start.\nIt's important to note that this is not lost revenue, but rather delayed until next year.\nMoreover, the slower-than-expected growth in Auto is counterbalanced by strength in other parts of the enterprise.\nIn Food Equipment, organic revenue rebounded by 46%, with recovery evident across the board and a backlog significantly higher than the previous year.\nNorth America grew by 39%, with equipment up 42% and service up 33%.\nInstitutional revenue increased by more than 30%, with healthcare and education growth in the low to mid-30s and lodging up in the mid-20s.\nRestaurants saw a rise of about 60%, with the largest year-over-year increases in full service and quick-service restaurants.\nRetail grew in the mid-teens due to continued solid demand and new product launches.\nInternational recovery was also strong at 58%, with Europe up 66% and Asia Pacific up 29%.\nEquipment sales were robust, increasing by 66%, while service growth was 39%, which continued to be affected by extended lockdowns in Europe.\nThe operating margin was 22% with an incremental of 46%.\nTest & Measurement and Electronics revenue of $606 million set a Q2 record with organic growth of 29%.\nTest & Measurement grew by 20%, driven by solid recovery in customer capital expenditure spending and continued strength in semiconductors.\nElectronics grew by 38%, reflecting continued strength in consumer electronics and automotive applications, as well as the added benefit of timing for some large equipment orders in electronic assembly.\nThe operating margin of 28.1% increased by 240 basis points, setting a record for Q2.\nLet's proceed to the seventh slide.\nQ2 saw robust growth in welding at 33%.\nEquipment sales increased by 38% while consumables growth reached 25%, marking its first positive performance since 2019.\nOur industrial sector experienced 52% growth due to increased capital expenditure by customers, and the commercial sector remained strong with 26% growth, following 17% growth in Q1.\nNorth America saw a 38% increase, while international growth was 13%, primarily due to recovery in the oil and gas sector.\nPolymers & Fluids organic growth reached 28%, with the automotive aftermarket business leading at 33% due to strong retail sales.\nPolymers grew by 34%, maintaining momentum in MRO applications and heavy industries.\nFluids increased by 8%, with North American growth in the mid-teens and European sales showing low single-digit growth.\nThe operating margin reached an unprecedented 27.3%, driven by strong volume leverage and enterprise initiatives, partially offset by price/cost factors.\nLet's move to the eighth slide.\nConstruction organic growth of 28% showed double-digit increases and recovery across all three regions.\nNorth America increased by 20%, with 16% growth in residential renovation and 26% in commercial construction.\nEurope experienced 61% growth, showing strong recovery compared to easier comparisons in the UK and Continental Europe.\nAustralia and New Zealand saw 13% organic growth, with continued strength in residential and commercial sectors.\nThe segment's operating margin of 27.6% increased by 390 basis points, setting a Q2 record.\nSpecialty organic revenue grew by 17%, with North America up 15%, Europe up 24%, and Asia Pacific up 14%.\nOur flexible packaging business increased by mid-single digits against a more challenging comparison than the rest of this segment.\nMost of our businesses saw double-digit growth, led by appliances with over 50% increase.\nConsumable sales rose by 19% and equipment sales by 12%.\nLet's proceed to Slide nine for an update on our full-year 2021 guidance.\nWe now anticipate full-year revenue between $14.3 billion and $14.6 billion, representing a 15% increase at the midpoint compared to last year, with organic growth ranging from 11% to 13% and a positive 3% impact from foreign currency translation.\nThis represents a one percentage point increase in organic growth at the midpoint compared to our Q1 guidance update, largely due to the additional revenue impact of pricing actions implemented in Q2 in response to rising raw material costs.\nWe are increasing our GAAP earnings per share guidance by $0.35 to a range of $8.55 to $8.95 to account for the one-time tax benefit realized in the second quarter.\nThe midpoint of $8.75 represents 32% earnings growth compared to last year and 13% over 2019.\nExcluding the one-time Q2 tax item, the midpoint of our 2021 guidance is 10% higher than 2019.\nRegarding margin percentage, the additional cost increases observed in Q2 will result in a full-year margin dilution of 100 basis points, compared to the 50 basis points projected at the end of Q1.\nWe are adjusting our margin percentage guidance accordingly to a range of 24.5% to 25.5%, which would still represent an improvement of over 200 basis points year-over-year and set an all-time record for the company.\nWe continue to expect no earnings per share impact from price/cost for the full year.\nWe anticipate free cash flow conversion to be approximately 100% of net income, excluding the impact of the one-time non-cash tax benefit recorded in Q2.\nIn the first half, we have repurchased $500 million of our shares and plan to repurchase an additional $500 million in the second half.\nWe expect our tax rate in the second half to be in our usual range of 23% to 24%, resulting in a full-year tax rate of around 20%.\nToday's guidance does not include any impact from the previously announced acquisition of the MTS Test & Simulation business, which we expect to finalize later this year.\nWe will provide an update once the acquisition is completed.\nSummary: ",
