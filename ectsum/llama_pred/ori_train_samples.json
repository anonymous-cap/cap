Treasurer and CFO, Mark Thies; Senior Vice President, External Affairs and Chief Customer Officer, Kevin Christie; and Vice President, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer, Ryan Krasselt.\nOur consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020 were $0.85 per diluted share, compared to $0.76 for the fourth quarter of 2019.\nFor the full year, consolidated earnings were $1.90 per diluted share for 2020 compared to $2.97 last year.\nNow, I'll turn the discussion over to Dennis.\nAs we begin 2021 continuing to work through the COVID pandemic, we hope you're staying safe and healthy.\nLooking back on the last year, I'm just so proud of our employees for navigating the challenges presented by the pandemic, continuing to provide energy like they always do to our customers and progressing our business plans forward.\nWe continue to help those who are struggling and most in need in our communities.\nIn 2020, Avista and the Avista Foundation provided more than $4 million in charitable giving to support the increased need for services that community agencies are still experiencing throughout the areas we serve.\nFinancially, our earnings for 2020 were better than expectations, and Mark will provide further details here in just a few minutes.\nOperationally, we finished installing nearly all of our smart meters, electric smart meters and natural gas modules across Washington in one of the largest projects in our history.\nThe deployment of this infrastructure will provide customers with more real-time data, so they can better manage their energy use.\nThe technology enables us to proactively push high energy alerts to notify customers, if they could exceed their preset energy budgets, which of course, helps eliminate surprises when their bill arrives at the end of the month.\nBeyond generating bills, we're using the data from smart meters to run a more reliable and efficient power grid and to deliver a higher level of service for our customers.\nFor example, we now have more visibility into our system, which allows us to detect and restore power outages more quickly.\nWe also made strides to meeting our clean energy goals, as the Rattlesnake Flat Wind Farm went online last December.\nDuring its construction the project created clean energy jobs for our local communities and now that it's completed the project's 20 -- project's 57 wind turbines excuse me will provide 50 average megawatts of clean renewable energy for our customers at an affordable price.\nThat's enough energy to power 38,000 homes for years to come.\nAs wildfires continue to have an impact on our region we implemented a new comprehensive 10-year wildfire resiliency plan that aims to improve defense strategies and operating practices for a more resilient system.\nWe expect to invest about $330 million implementing the components of this plan over the life of the plan, which as I said was 10 years.\nWe were proud to announce yesterday that Avista has been recognized again as one of the 2021 World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices.\nThis marks the second year in a row that Avista has achieved this distinction.\nWe are only one of nine honorees recognized in the energy and utilities industry based on their assessment.\nIn 2021, 135 honorees in total were recognized spanning 22 countries and 47 industries.\nIn January, we published Avista's 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report on our avistacorp.com website and I urge you to check it out when you have some time.\nThis content provides a broad look at our operations and how we're fulfilling our commitments to our people, our customers, our communities and our shareholders.\nThe website also provides links to Avista's reporting on a series of industry and financial ESG disclosures.\nThe updated content supports Avista's long-standing commitment to corporate responsibility and sharing this information with our stakeholders.\nSwitching gears with respect to regulatory filings, in January we filed two-year general rate cases in Idaho.\nAnd as you know in 2020 we filed general rate cases in Washington.\nAnd we continue to work through the regulatory processes in both of these jurisdictions.\nWe take our responsibility to provide safe, reliable energy at an affordable price very seriously.\nAnd we work hard to make prudent financial investments in our infrastructure, manage our costs and identify ways to best serve our customers that contribute to keeping energy prices low.\nFor example, our proposed tax customer credit would completely offset an immediate increase in electric and natural gas bills for our Washington customers.\nIn Oregon new rates went into effect on January 16 of this year and we expect to file another rate case in the second half of 2021 in Oregon.\nLooking ahead, we remain focused on running a great utility and continue to invest prudent capital to maintain and update our infrastructure and provide reliable energy service to our customers.\nWe are initiating our 2021, 2022 and 2023 earnings guidance with consolidated ranges of a $1.96 to $2.16 per diluted share for 2021, $2.18 to $2.38 in 2022 and $2.42 to $2.62 per diluted share for 2023.\nThis puts us on track to earning our allowed return by 2023.\nLastly, earlier this month the board increased our dividend by 4.3% to an annual dividend of $1.69 per share and a dividend increase approved by the board marks the 19 consecutive year the board has raised the dividend for our shareholders, and I believe it demonstrates the board's commitment to maximizing shareholder value.\nWe had low expectations coming into this year.\nNo, not the company, the Blackhawks and the Blackhawks have really started off pretty good after a slow first four games.\nWe've had five rookies score their first goals ever in the NHL, so pretty exciting times for all you hockey fans out there.\nFor the company in the fourth quarter, Avista Utilities contributed $0.81 per diluted share compared to $0.67 last year.\nOur earnings increased primarily due to higher utility margin and customer growth.\nAlso in the fourth quarter, the Oregon and Washington Commissions joined the Idaho Commission to allow for the deferral of certain COVID-19 related expenses for future -- possible future recovery.\nAdditionally, Avista Utilities earnings were better than expectations due to higher utility margin and lower income taxes, which were partially offset by higher operating expenses.\nWith respect to COVID-19, as I mentioned earlier, we have now received accounting orders in each of our jurisdictions to defer the costs and benefits associated with COVID-19.\nAnd those will be addressed in future proceedings with each of those commissions.\nWe expect a gradual economic recovery that will still have some depressed load and customer growth in '21.\nWe expect that to start improving in the second half of '21, our economy.\nWe do have decoupling and other regulatory mechanisms, which mitigate the impacts of changes in load for our residential and certain commercial customers.\nOver 90% of our revenue, as you recall, is covered by regulatory mechanisms.\nAs Dennis mentioned, we continue to be committed to investing the necessary capital in our utility infrastructure.\nWe expect our capital expenditures in 2021 to be about $415 million and at AEL&P we expect about $7 million and about $15 million in our other businesses.\nWith respect to our liquidity, as of December 31, we have $270 million of available liquidity under our committed credit line at Avista Utilities and in 2020 we issued about $72 million in stock in 2020.\nIn '21 we expect to issue about $75 million of equity or stock and up to $120 million of long-term debt.\nAs Dennis mentioned, we are initiating guidance not only for 2021 but also for 2022 and 2023.\nAnd as we mentioned those ranges, this is to get us back to earning our allowed return by 2023 and our guidance does assume timely and appropriate rate relief in each of our jurisdictions relative to the capital expenses that we have going forward.\nWe experienced regulatory lag during '20 and expect this to continue through the end of '22 due to our continued investment in infrastructure and our delayed filings.\nWe again delayed last year as we talked about with the pandemic in Washington and Idaho.\nDennis mentioned those earlier.\nWe expect our cases in Washington and Idaho along with new rates to provide some relief in 2021 and begin reducing that regulatory lag.\nGoing forward we'll strive to continue to reduce debt and closely align our returns to those authorized by '23.\nAfter '23 we expect to grow at 4% to 6% our earnings.\nOur '21 guidance reflects unrecovered structural cost estimated to reduce the return on equity by approximately 70 basis points and in addition our timing lag, which is what we're trying to reduce with rate cases has reduced it by about 100 basis points.\nThis results in expected return on equity for Avista Utilities of approximately 7.7% in 2021.\nWe are forecasting operating cost growth of about 3% and customer growth of about 1% annually, which has slightly improved from prior numbers on the customer growth side.\nFor 2021 we expect Avista Utilities to contribute in the range of a $1.93 to $2.07 per diluted share and the midpoint of our guidance does not include any expense or benefit under the ERM.\nOur current expectation for the ERM is in the benefit position within the 75% customer, 25% company sharing band which is expected to add $0.05 per diluted share.\nFor 2021 we expect AEL&P to contribute in the range of $0.08 to $0.11 per diluted share and our outlook for both Avista Utilities and AEL&P assumes among other variables, normal precipitation and hydroelectric generation for the year.\nWe expect a loss between $0.05 and $0.02 per diluted share for our other businesses as we continue to develop opportunities for the future.\nWe'll spend a little bit of money in the next couple of years to continue to get those earnings up over the course of the next five years and we look forward to those opportunities.\nThey're both in our service territory and in funds.\nOur guidance generally includes only normal operating conditions and does not include any unusual or non-recurring items until the effects are known and certain.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Our chief financial officer, Ray Young, will review the drivers of our performance as well as corporate results and financial highlights.\nThen Juan will discuss our outlook.\nOur team delivered a super fourth quarter.\nAdjusted segment operating profit was $1.4 billion, 23% higher than the fourth quarter of 2020.\nOur trailing four-quarter adjusted EBITDA was $4.9 billion, $1.25 billion more than a year ago.\nAnd our trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 10%, meeting our objectives.\nThat performance represented a strong finish to an outstanding 2021.\nFor the full year, our adjusted earnings per share was $5.19, also a record.\nAnd full year adjusted segment operating profit was $4.8 billion.\nThis excellent performance was reflected across the company.\nThe Ag Services and Oilseeds team's actions to improve their business portfolio and strengthen their operating model continued to enable superior performance in a strong market environment.\nAS&O delivered full year 2021 OP of $2.8 billion, with each subsegment performing at or near historic highs.\nCarbohydrate solutions executed phenomenally well to deliver full year operating profits of $1.3 billion.\nAnd the team is continuing the evolution of carbohydrate solutions from the sale of our Peoria dry mill and the announcement of the sustainable aviation fuel MOU; to our agreement with LG Chem and the continued growth of our exciting biosolutions platform, which delivered new revenue wins with an annualized run rate of almost $100 million; to the project we announced earlier this month to further decarbonize our operations by connecting two other major processing facilities; to our vacate of carbon capture and storage capabilities.\nThe nutrition team once again delivered industry-leading revenue and OP growth, with full year revenues up 16% and full year OP of $691 million, representing a 20% year-over-year increase.\nWe also continued to enhance our nutrition business with strategic investments targeted at growing areas of demand, including soya protein, which will expand our participation in alternative proteins; PetDine, which substantially enhance our presence in pet food and treats; Deerland, which continued the expansion of our functional probiotics and enzymes portfolio within our global health & wellness business; and FISA, which enhance our flavor footprint by opening up new growth opportunities in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nLast month, at our Global Investor Day, we unveiled our strategic plan and reiterated our balanced financial framework for value creation, including using our strong cash flows to deliver both growth investments and distributions to shareholders.\nWe are confident in our plan [Audio gap] which is why we are pleased to announce an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share.\nWe are proud of our record of 90 uninterrupted years of dividends and more than 40 years of consecutive annual dividend increases, and we are pleased to continue to follow through on our commitment to shareholder value creation.\nIt's been a great year, and we're excited about what's to come.\nOur continued actions to build a better ADM and dynamically align it with the global trends of food security, health and well-being, and sustainability, and the steadfast advancement of our productivity and innovation initiatives will help propel our 2022 results.\nI will talk in more detail about the upcoming calendar year shortly.\nThe Ag Services and Oilseeds team capped off really a truly impressive year, successfully navigating through supply chain challenges to deliver results largely in line with the extremely strong prior-year quarter.\nThe Ag Services team performed well in an environment of continued strong global demand, including significantly increased export volumes for customers outside of China.\nGlobal trade was substantially higher year over year, driven by solid risk management and improved results in global ocean freight.\nOverall, Ag Services delivered strong results, just slightly off the outstanding fourth quarter of 2020 when we benefit from exceptionally high export margins.\nCrushing executed well on the continued solid demand environment for both soybean meal and vegetable oil.\nLower results in EMEA versus a very strong fourth quarter of 2020 and approximately $250 million in net negative timing impacts versus negative $125 million in the prior-year quarter drove overall results lower year over year.\nThe majority of those negative timing effects are expected to reverse in the first half of 2022.\nThe refined products and other teams delivered substantially higher results versus the prior-year period, driven by strong volumes and margins in North America for refined oils and improved biodiesel margins in North America and EMEA, which more than offset weaker South American results due to the reduced biodiesel mandate.\nEquity earnings from Wilmar were higher year over year.\nLooking ahead, we expect a strong first quarter from Ag Services and Oilseeds, higher than the first quarter of 2021 and in line with the just-ended fourth quarter.\nCarbohydrate solutions' fourth quarter results were more than double the prior-year quarter.\nIn Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, including ethanol production from our wet mills, results were lower versus the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by higher input costs, including energy costs in EMEA as well as lower wheat milling volumes, partially offset by continued strong ethanol margins.\nVolumes for North America sweeteners and starches were largely flat year over year.\nVantage corn processor results were again substantially higher year over year, driven by historically strong industry ethanol margins as a result of strong demand relative to supply as well as increased sales volumes due to production at the two dry mills that were idle in the previous year period.\nAs we look ahead, we believe the first quarter for carbohydrate solutions should be similar to or slightly above the strong first quarter of 2021.\nThe nutrition business closed out a year of consistent and strong growth, with fourth quarter revenues 19% higher year over year, 21% on a constant currency basis, with 26% higher profits year over year, and sustained strong EBITDA margins.\nHuman Nutrition had a great fourth quarter, with revenue growth of 21% on a constant currency basis and substantially higher profits.\nFlavors continued its growth trajectory, driven primarily by improved product mix in EMEAI and continued strong performance from North America, partially offset by weaker APAC results.\nIn specialty ingredients, overall profits for the fourth quarter were in line with the year-ago period as strong demand for plant-based proteins offset the impact of onetime insurance proceeds in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nHealth & wellness was higher versus the prior-year quarter as the business continued to deliver growing profits in bioactives and fermentation.\nAnimal nutrition revenue was up 21% on a constant currency basis, and operating profit was much higher year over year, driven primarily by continued strength in amino acids.\nNow looking ahead, we expect nutrition to continue to grow operating profits at a 15%-plus rate for calendar year 2022, with the first quarter similar to the first quarter of 2021 with continued revenue growth offset by some higher costs upfront in the year and the absence of the onetime benefits we saw in the first quarter of the prior year.\nNow let me finish up with a few observations from the Other segment as well as some of the corporate line items.\nOther business results were substantially higher, driven primarily by higher captive insurance underwriting results as the prior-year quarter included larger intracompany insurance settlements.\nFor calendar year 2022, we expect other business results to be similar to 2021.\nAlthough for the first quarter, we expect a loss of about $25 million due to insurance settlements currently planned.\nNet interest expense increased year over year on higher short-term borrowings.\nIn the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $276 million were lower year over year due primarily to increased variable performance-related compensation expense accruals in the prior year, partially offset by higher IT offering in project-related costs and transfers of costs from business segments into centralized centers of excellence in supply chain and operations.\nWe anticipate calendar year 2022 total corporate costs, including net interest, corporate unallocated, and other corporate, to be in line with the $1.2 billion area, consistent with what I discussed at Global Investor Day with net interest roughly similar, corporate unallocated a bit higher, and corporate other a bit lower.\nThe effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was approximately 21%, compared to 8% in the prior year.\nThe calendar year 2021 effective tax rate was approximately 17%, up from 5% in 2020.\nThe increase for the calendar year was due primarily to changes in geographic mix of earnings and current year discrete tax items, primarily valuation allowance and return to provision adjustments.\nLooking ahead, we're expecting full year 2022 effective tax rate to be in the range of 16 to 19%.\nOur balance sheet remains solid, with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 28% and available liquidity of about $9 billion.\nI hope most of you were able to join us on our Global Investor Day last month.\nThere, we showed that we have consistently advanced our strategy from our work to improve ROIC through capital cost and cash; to our strategic growth and margin enhancement accomplishments, including the creation of a global Nutrition business; to today's focus on productivity and innovation.\nLet me take a few moments to talk about how we see the 2022 environment.\nIn Ag Services and Oilseeds, we see a continued favorable global demand environment.\nDue to a short growth in South America, with the magnitude of the shortfall still to be determined, we expect global ag commodity buyers will rely relatively more on the U.S. market for their needs, assuming we have a normal U.S. crop later this year.\nOn the oilseeds side, we're starting 2022 with strong soy crush margins.\nAnd as we discussed at Global Investor Day, we believe that increasing demand for meal as well as vegetable oil as a feedstock for renewable green diesel should continue to support the positive environment this year, with our soy crush margins in the range of 45 to $55 per metric ton.\nAssuming these dynamics play out, we believe that Ag Services and Oilseeds in 2022 has the potential to deliver operating profit similar to or better than 2021.\nFor carbohydrate solutions, we are assuming the demand and margin environment for our starch and sweetener products will be steady versus 2021.\nWe expect the industry ethanol environment to continue to be constructive, supported by the recovery of domestic demand to pre-COVID levels, energy costs driving higher exports, and better clarity on the regulatory landscape.\nWith this in mind, we're assuming higher ADM ethanol volumes and EBITDA margins to average $0.15 to $0.25 for the calendar year.\nIn addition, we are expecting our biosolutions platform to deliver another year of solid growth as we continue to evolve the carbohydrate solutions business.\nPutting it all together, we expect carbohydrate solutions to deliver full year operating profit slightly lower than their outstanding 2021.\nIn nutrition, we're expecting continued growth in demand for our unparalleled portfolio of nutrition ingredients and systems, along with the benefits of accretion from our recent acquisitions.\nWith these dynamics, we expect 15-plus percent OP growth in 2022, revenue growth above 10%, and EBITDA margins above 20% in human nutrition and high single digits in animal nutrition, consistent with targets we set out at our Global Investor Day.\nSo as we look forward in 2022, we see a positive demand environment across our portfolio.\nAnd then we add to that thing we can do better.\nOur execution was great in 2021, but we're always identifying opportunities for improvement.\nAnd we intend to do even more to meet this growing demand in 2022.\nPut it all together, and we're optimistic for another very strong performance in 2022 as we progress toward our strategic plans next earnings milestones of six to $7 per share.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:During today's call, we will also reference non-GAAP metrics.\nI greatly appreciate the work they do every day to keep us moving forward.\nAs always, we remain focused on those things under our control.\nDespite a significant shift in the economic environment during fiscal '20, there were several things that went as planned including: sales of replacement parts performed better than new equipment and first-fit products, gross margin increased from the prior year, we reduced our discretionary expenses while investing in growth businesses, and we maintained a strong financial position while returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.\nWe are entering fiscal '21 with clear priorities and engaged employees.\nWe do not anticipate strong market conditions overall this year but our diverse business model and robust operational capabilities give me confidence that we can make progress on our strategic initiatives in any economic environment.\nWe will talk more about our longer term opportunities later in the call.\nSo I'll now turn to a brief overview of fourth quarter sales.\nTotal sales were $617 million in the quarter with sequential increases in June and July.\nCompared with the prior year, sales were down 15%, which is consistent with the forecast we provided in early August.\nBoth segments experienced a similar decline.\nHowever, there was quite a bit of variability within the results.\nIn the Engine segment our first-fit businesses remain under the most pressure.\nFourth quarter On-Road sales were down 44% from the prior year.\nThe U.S. is the largest portion of On-Road and it accounted for much of the decline as the cyclical slowdown in Class 8 truck production was magnified by the pandemic.\nAs a reminder, On-Road first-fit in the U.S. is only about 3% of total Donaldson sales so our aggregate exposure to that market is limited.\nSales in Off-Road were down 24% in the quarter.\nMore than half the decline was due to Exhaust and Emissions.\nThere were pre-buys in Europe last year related to an oncoming regulatory change and new programs for our Exhaust and Emissions products are not yet at meaningful volumes.\nIn the U.S. production on heavy duty Off-Road equipment remains depressed, particularly for the construction and mining industries.\nOn the other hand, Off-Road sales in China were up nearly 50% in the fourth quarter.\nThe Chinese government is investing to stimulate activity which is benefiting our Off-Road business.\nAdditionally, we continue to win new programs with local manufacturers and some of those programs were won with PowerCore.\nThese are new customer relationships in the country that produces more heavy duty equipment than anywhere in the world.\nWe are learning how to best support these local manufacturers and we know that will come with order volatility, but our team in China is motivated as we see the opportunity for significant long-term growth.\nSales trends for Engine aftermarket were predictably better than our first-fit businesses.\nFourth quarter aftermarket sales were down 11% reflecting a decline in the mid-teens for sales through our independent channel.\nThe headlines in our independent channel are fairly consistent with third quarter.\nSales in the U.S. fell with the collapse of the oil and gas market combined with slowing transportation activity.\nIn Latin America, utilization is slowing across the region as the spread of the virus is compounding the impact from geopolitical uncertainty.\nAnd fourth quarter sales in Eastern Europe remain strong as we continue gaining share.\nSales through the OEM channel of aftermarket experienced a more modest, low-single-digit decline.\nIn the U.S., large customers pulled down inventory to match demand, which was partially offset by strong growth in China as we continue gaining share with local customers.\nIn fact, aftermarket sales in China were at a record level last quarter and we see a long runway as we expect to continue winning new programs with innovative technology.\nOur portfolio of innovative products performed well in the fourth quarter.\nThis portfolio makes up nearly a quarter of the total aftermarket revenue and fourth quarter sales were up in the low-single digits.\nFor nearly two decades, we have been improving, expanding and reinventing our offering related to these razor-to-sell razor-blade products.\nAfter all that time we still have very strong retention rates.\nThese products create a significant opportunity for growth and relative stability in our Engine business.\nSo, we will continue to invest in new technologies for a long time to come.\nSales of Aerospace and Defense were down 3% in fourth quarter driven by soft sales of products for commercial helicopters.\nThe decline was partially offset by a strong increase in sales for ground defense vehicles but some of the growth is timing-related as key distributors build inventory in the quarter.\nI also want to update you on a change to our strategic portfolio classification.\nBeginning in fiscal '21, we are recategorizing the defense business to critical core from mature.\nOur mature businesses are committed to generating cash that allows for investment elsewhere while critical core businesses are geared toward driving share gains in existing markets with new technology, services and relationships.\nThe Defense business has won new programs with our robust engineering capabilities and we expect these wins will deliver solid returns over a long time horizon.\nTurning to our Industrial segment, fourth quarter sales were down 15% driven in large part by the Dust Collection business within Industrial Filtration Solutions or IFS.\nSales of new dust collectors and replacement parts were down as customers continue to defer investment and reduce output.\nThe quote-to-order cycle remains elongated with large projects being put on hold while smaller must-do projects tend to move forward.\nAt the same time, our value proposition still resonates.\nFourth quarter sales of our Downflo Evolution dust collection systems were up in the low teens and the sales of those replacement parts grew more than 30%.\nThe Downflo family of products is only about 15% of total dust collection sales today, but it has grown rapidly as customers appreciate the space and energy savings it offers and we value the ability to retain the aftermarket.\nWe are also building the dust collection business through our e-commerce platform shop.\nWe turned on the ability to take guest orders earlier this year and we are encouraged by the results.\nWhile incremental dollars are still small, we have seen a significant number of new dust collection customers.\nWith our robust sales and delivery model, we believe the simplicity of our e-commerce platform gives customers another reason to choose Donaldson.\nFourth quarter sales of Process Filtration were down in the low-single digits after an increase of more than 10% last year.\nThe decline was driven by new equipment while replacement parts were about flat with the prior year.\nWe continue to make progress penetrating the highly valuable food and beverage industry.\nWe position ourselves as an engaged partner and we market our ability to quickly fulfill orders with a product that can help improve efficiency in our customer's processes.\nThe pandemic gave us the opportunity to prove this value proposition to our customers in the food and beverage industry and our Process Filtration team delivered.\nWe remain very excited about this market, so we will continue to invest in growing the sales force and adding new tools to drive this profitable business.\nSales of Special Applications were down 10% in fourth quarter.\nDisk Drive was down from the prior year after having a significant increase in third quarter while the slowdown in the automotive market resulted in lower sales of Venting Solutions.\nFourth quarter sales in Gas Turbine Systems or GTS were up 6% due primarily to strength in small turbines.\nOnce again the GTS team delivered another profit increase in terms of both dollars and rates.\nAs you know, we shifted the GTS go-to-market strategy four years ago.\nWe determined that the best path forward was to focus on replacement parts and small turbines while being highly selective in deciding which large turbine projects we pursue.\nThe GTS team has done an incredible job executing their strategy and we see it in the results.\nIn the past quarter we also chose to consolidate our joint venture in Saudi Arabia into our company.\nOnce again, we are focused on rightsizing and streamlining GTS to enhance our profitability.\nBased on what the GTS team has delivered and the opportunities in front of us, we are reclassifying GTS as a mature business in our portfolio.\nThe GTS team has transitioned from fixing the business to driving profitability and we are on solid footing today.\nThe success in GTS is not an isolated incident.\nOur company is filled with great people working together to deliver results and create value for all our stakeholders.\nThat's why I'm comfortable and confident in our future.\nBefore turning the call to Scott, I want to briefly touch on fiscal 2021.\nWe're not sure how long the pandemic will last nor are we sure about its ultimate impact on our business.\nGiven those uncertainties, we will remain focused on what we control, prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, fulfilling our customer commitments, pursuing market share and growth opportunities around the world, executing margin enhancement initiatives and maintaining a balanced approach to expense management, which includes making targeted investments to advance our strategic priorities.\nScott will share some more fiscal '21 details.\nLike most companies, we had to quickly adjust to a new way of working over the past six months, and our employees did an excellent job at that period.\nWe increased our level of collaboration, we deepened our relationships with customers and suppliers, and we performed in critical businesses around the world with minimal disruption.\nOverall, I'm very impressed by what our team accomplished.\nAs we turn to fiscal '21, we have a solid foundation.\nBut the markets are not yet on firm footing.\nGiven the wide range of possible outcomes, including the timing and shape of the inevitable recovery, we are not issuing detailed guidance at this time.\nWe do however want to provide some of our 2021 planning assumptions.\nI'll cover those later in the call, but first I'll share some thoughts on fiscal '20 results.\nDecremental margin was a notable highlight for us.\nWe delivered 20% in the fourth quarter and 18% for the full year.\nThose results are stronger than our historic averages.\nSo let me walk through some of the details.\nI'll start with operating expenses, which declined 10% to $125 million in the fourth quarter, that's flat sequentially, and it's our lowest fourth quarter level in four years.\nDiscretionary expenses were down significantly, due in part to pandemic-related travel restrictions, and we maintained our investments in strategic growth businesses like Process Filtration, Dust Collection and Connected Solutions.\nWe will continue to focus on balancing expense [Indecipherable] investments, and we are pleased with the performance in the fourth quarter.\nWe are also pleased with our gross margin performance.\nFourth quarter gross margin was up 20 basis points in the prior year, and our full year rate was up 50 basis points despite headwinds in lower sales and higher depreciation related to our capacity expansion projects.\nAs a side note, many of these projects are now completed.\nThat's why our capital expenditures in fiscal '21 are planned well below the $122 million we invested last year.\nOur focus has now shifted to the optimization opportunities enabled by these investments.\nWe plan to lower our cost structure while maintaining or improving service levels.\nWhile benefits from these initiatives will ramp up over time our list of optimization projects give me confidence that we can deliver strong returns with these new assets.\nLower raw material costs are helping us offset the loss of leverage, impact on gross margin.\nWe have seen favorability in market prices for steel, media and petroleum-based products and our procurement team is driving incremental savings as they strengthen our supplier network while improving terms.\nI also want to touch on pricing, while it has been a major contributor to the year-over-year gross margin increase it hasn't been a headwind.\nWe have more latitude to drive pricing in many of our replacement parts businesses and teams like those in the independent channel of Engine Aftermarket have done an excellent job consistently executing our pricing strategy.\nIt makes a big difference especially in this economic environment.\nA favorable mix of sales is also making a difference to gross margin.\nIn the fourth quarter and for most of the year we have realized mixed benefits as replacement parts make up a greater share of total sales.\nTo a certain extent these mixed benefits are by design.\nWe invest in technology to win first-fit programs that drive aftermarket retention.\nAs we move through an economic cycle, our strong base of recurring revenue creates some relative stability and provide some gross margin inflation [Phonetic].\nReplacement parts now account for 64% of total sales giving us confidence in the durability of our business model.\nBefore moving further down the P&L, I want to quickly talk about segment profit margins.\nThe story is Engine is consistent with the consolidated results.\nMix benefits and lower raw material costs after the loss of leverage results in a year-over-year margin increase of 20 basis points in the fourth quarter.\nWithin the Industrial segment, the loss of leverage was magnified by continued investments in our strategic growth businesses.\nWe expect Industrial margins will bounce back helping us deliver our goal of mixing the company's margins up over time.\nMoving back to the P&L, Other income was $2.7 million in the fourth quarter compared with an expense of $0.5 million in the prior year, and improved performance in our joint ventures was a benefit in fiscal '20 and the fourth quarter expense in the prior year reflects a charge related to our global cash optimization initiatives.\nThese initiatives, which allowed us to streamline our legal and fee structure were enabled by tax reform.\nWe excluded the charge of last year's calculation of adjusted earnings per share and we also excluded a non-recurring charge related to tax reform legislation.\nWith that in mind, it's best to compare the reported fourth quarter tax rate of 21.1% with the prior year's adjusted tax rate of 21.4%.\nWhile the delta between rates is not significant, I'll point out that current and prior year rates were well below what we would typically expect.\nThe fourth quarter 2020 rate benefit from a favorable mix of earnings across jurisdictions while the 2019 adjusted rate included a non-recurring benefit related to the favorable settlement of an audit.\nAs we think about fiscal '21, we see our full year tax rate going up in 2020 to be more in line with our long-term estimate of 24% to 27%.\nIn terms of our financial position, we feel good about where we ended the year.\nOur leverage ratio was 0.9 times net-debt-to-EBITDA and in the fourth quarter we paid off a term loan for $50 million and we reduced borrowings in our revolver by $110 million.\nWe proactively reduce from our revolver in the early days of the pandemic as a way to bolster our liquidity out of an abundance of caution.\nWhile markets still are uncertain, we are confident in our strong position and no longer feel the need for that extra layer of security.\nReceivables were down meaningfully from the prior year, which is what we expect in this environment.\nInventory was also down.\nSo we plan further improvements this year as we focus on leveling with demand.\nOur fourth quarter and full year 2020 cash conversion rates increased meaningfully to 165% and 103% respectively and we plan to exceed 100% again this year.\nOur fiscal '21 assumptions for sales are directionally consistent with recent trends.\nSales are expected to vary widely by geography and market and sales of our replacement parts and products for new markets should continue to outperform the company average.\nAdditionally, we expect sales during the first half of '21 will be down versus the prior year due to the timing of when the pandemic began.\nWe are seeing these sales trends play out in August, which we expect will be down about 10% from the prior year.\nTotal sales for the month will also be down from July, but that's typical seasonality.\nRegional trends in August match what we saw in the fourth quarter.\nSales in the APAC region are performing the best versus the prior led by growth in China.\nEurope is faring better due in part to currency while the U.S. and Latin America remain under the most pressure.\nAnd as expected we have pockets of relative strength from some of our more stable businesses including Engine Aftermarket and Process Filtration, which are both up in Europe while new equipment remains under more pressure.\nIn terms of fiscal '21 gross margin, benefits from product mix and lower raw material costs would lessen as we compare against strong tailwinds in the prior year.\nAt the same time, we will execute our optimization projects to position ourselves for long-term increases in gross margin.\nOur fiscal '21 operating expenses will also have some puts and takes.\nResetting our annual incentive compensation plan generates a headwind of about $13 million and we are planning to make further investments in our strategic growth businesses and technology development.\nWe plan to substantially offset these increases by controlling expenses, which will likely see some benefits from pandemic-related restrictions and comparing against a higher level spend in the first half of the prior year.\nShould we see an opportunity that makes sense, we will also explore additional optimization initiatives.\nFinally, we plan to repurchase at least 1% of outstanding shares in fiscal '21, which would offset any dilution from stock-based compensation.\nAny repurchases beyond that level would be governed by macroeconomic conditions, our investment opportunities and our balance sheet metrics.\nShould conditions improve, it is not unreasonable to assume this goal above the 1% in fiscal '21.\nAt a high level, our objectives for the New Year are consistent with our long-term strategic agenda.\nWe will pursue growth and market share opportunities in our Advance & Accelerate portfolio of businesses, drive optimization initiatives that will strengthen gross margins, control discretionary expenses while making targeted investments and protect our strong financial position to discipline capital deployment and working capital management.\nThese are the actions we can control and I am confident in our ability to deliver in 2021.\nBefore turning the call back to Tod, I want to share some news.\nAfter five years as our Investor Relations Director, Brad is going to be moving to Belgium to take over as Finance Director of our Europe-Middle East region.\nCOVID makes the timing a little uncertain, but I know he's committed to facilitate a smooth transition when we find his replacement.\nYou have done an excellent job and congratulations on the exciting new adventure with Donaldson.\nYou'll clearly be missed in this role, but we all know it's a great opportunity, so we're very excited for you.\nI'm confident in our ability to navigate the complexities of the current environment and I'm equally confident in our ability to create long-term value by meeting the evolving needs of our customers.\nWe have strong relationships with our customers and they range from some of the world's biggest brands to small business owners.\nOur goal is to solve our customers' complicated filtration challenges in a way that allows them to deliver great products efficiently and I think we're doing well against that objective.\nLet me share some examples of what I mean.\nIn the Engine segment, our Filter Minder team released a wireless monitoring system that helps fleet managers optimize their maintenance schedules for On-Road and Off-Road equipment.\nOur system integrates into the existing telematics and fleet management infrastructure making it easy for our customers to adopt this valuable technology.\nWe're also expanding connecting solutions into the dust collection market with our IQ offering.\nThis service provides customers with real-time monitoring of their equipment performance helping them save energy costs and reduce unplanned downtime.\nOnce again, we made it easy to adopt, our IQ set up can be used on any brand of dust collector and the retrofit process is very simple.\nOur e-commerce platform is another tool for helping customers operate more efficiently.\ndonaldson.com has a global reach and offers features like real-time availability and personalization functionality making it easy for customers to find what they need and place new or repeat orders.\nAs always, new technology is a critical part of our success formula and we continue to expand our technologies and solutions to drive growth.\nMany of our Engine customers are looking to improve fuel economy and reduce emissions and our products can help them achieve their goals.\nWe have shown that consistent use of our PowerCore products can help end-users improve fuel economy and it provides value to our OEM customers as they can retain more of their parts business.\nWe still see many opportunities with diesel engines and we also see a growing opportunity with alternative powertrains like hybrid solutions and hydrogen fuel cells.\nHybrid platforms leverage the portfolio of air and liquid solutions we have today so we have good opportunity with that equipment.\nThe needs are different for fuel cells and we have a specialized air filtration system that is specifically designed to meet those needs.\nIn addition to our air systems, we also have venting products and specialized membranes for fuel cells.\nWith our technical capabilities, we are well-positioned to participate in this growing market.\nWe are also pursuing non-Engine markets like food and beverage.\nSales of process filtration were about $15 million in fiscal '20, that's an increase of more than 60% over the past three years.\nWe have continued investing in new technologies and we are building capabilities that will facilitate our future expansion into life sciences.\nOur long-term success is dependent on our team, so we're committed to making our company a great place to work.\nWe have a strong culture and we place a high value on integrity, commitment, respect and innovation.\nWe also have a continuous improvement mindset, so we've recently created a diversity, equity and inclusion council that will help identify and implement practices to make us a stronger company.\nWe are also on a journey with our sustainability practices.\nWe began developing our global sustainability strategy last year.\nWe have engaged our stakeholders and we have identified a long list of projects while reducing greenhouse gas emission, energy consumption and wastewater.\nImplementing and maintaining sustainable practices is one more way we drive toward our purpose of advancing filtration for a cleaner world.\nI'm proud of what we accomplished as One Donaldson and I look forward to another successful new year.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The pandemic has given us an opportunity to display our agility as a company.\nWe increased our communications with retailers.\nWe changed our marketing messages.\nWe shifted investments to categories that are most important to consumers.\nAnd we set new production records for VITAFUSION, ARM & HAMMER laundry and ARM & HAMMER baking soda.\nAnd we've moved people to focus on the online class of trade.\nSo we've been proactive in seizing the opportunities presented by the crisis and are increasing manufacturing capacity in our plants and externally with new co-packers.\nThe agility and resilience of the Church & Dwight team is showing up in our results.\nOur priorities continue to be employee safety, meeting the needs of consumers and retailers, helping the communities where we live and ensuring the strength of our brands.\nOur plant, warehouse and laboratory employees have done an exceptional job in keeping safe, which has contributed to our ability to operate our supply chain.\nOur office employees continue to work remotely and are doing a super job running the company.\nSo now let's talk about the results.\nQ3 was another exceptional quarter.\nReported sales growth was 13.9% and adjusted earnings per share was $0.70.\nRevenue, earnings and operating cash flow were all significantly higher in Q3 than last year, driven by the significant increase in demand for many of our products.\nOrganic sales grew 9.9%, driven by higher consumption.\nRegarding e-commerce, we were already strong pre-COVID and well positioned online.\nIn Q3, our online sales increased by 77% as all retailer.coms have grown.\nOne example would be gummy vitamins.\nIn 2019, 8% of our full year sales were online.\nThis year, we expect full year to be about 14% online.\nRecall, we began the year targeting 9% online sales as a percentage of global consumer sales.\nIn Q1, it was 10% online; Q2, 13%; and Q3, also 13%.\nSo we expect the full year to be actually close to 13% as well.\nWe continue to conduct research on the purchasing habits of U.S. consumers.\nThere's no surprises here, actually.\nThere is continued consumer concern that stores will run out of stock and websites will face delivery issues.\nConsumers report that they are consolidating shopping trips and continue to stockpile to ensure that they have enough product for a couple of weeks at a time.\nIf we look at year-to-date shipment and consumption patterns, our brands remain generally in balance in the 15 categories in which we compete.\nWith respect to our brands, we had broad-based consumption growth in Q3.\nWe saw a double-digit consumption growth in VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins, ARM & HAMMER baking soda, OXICLEAN, FLAWLESS, ORAJEL, NAIR, FIRST RESPONSE pregnancy kits and cleaners.\nIn Household, our laundry business consumption was up 4% and ARM & HAMMER cat litter was up 8%.\nWater flossers is another bright spot as consumption turned slightly positive in Q3.\nAlthough our Lunch & Learn activity continues to be significantly curtailed, we intend to continue to address this with incremental advertising.\nIn addition to VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS, water flossers is another brand we expect to benefit from the heightened consumer focus on health and wellness.\nBATISTE dry shampoo remains impacted by social distancing, with consumption down 10%, but improved sequentially compared to Q2 when consumption was down 22%.\nTROJAN consumption was down 6% in Q3, but also improved sequentially when we were down 15% in Q2.\nThere's no doubt that consumers have made health and wellness a priority.\nVITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins saw the greatest consumption growth of any of our categories in Q3, up 49%.\nThe category consumption was even higher.\nOur expectation is that consumer demand for gummy vitamins will remain high.\nAnd we have new third-party capacity coming online in late Q4 to take advantage of this trend.\nConsumers are focusing on health and wellness, but also, cleaning, home cooking and new grooming routines.\nAt a recent investor conference, you may have heard me cite consumer research that suggests it takes 66 days to form a new habit.\nAnd only time will tell if all of these new behaviors will translate into permanently higher levels of consumption.\nBut if they do endure over time, we believe we are well positioned.\nNow a few words about private label.\nAs you know, our exposure to private label is limited to five categories.\nPrivate label shares have remained generally unchanged for the first, second and third quarters of this year.\nOur international business came through with double-digit organic growth in the quarter, driven by strong growth in our GMG business, that's our Global Markets Group, and Canada.\nIn October, our GMG business is off to another strong start, and we continue to see strong POS recovery in Canada and Europe.\nAfter three consecutive quarters of growth, our Specialty Products business contracted 3.4% in Q3, primarily due to the poultry segment.\nNow turning to new products.\nInnovative new products will continue to attract consumers even in this economy.\nVITAFUSION gummy vitamins launched a number of new products.\nAnd to capitalize on increased consumer interest in immunity, we launched POWER ZINC and Elderberry gummies.\nWe've launched ARM & HAMMER CLEAN & SIMPLE, which has only six ingredients plus water compared to 15 to 30 ingredients for typical liquid detergents.\nAnd in the second half, we launched ARM & HAMMER ABSORBx clumping cat litter, a new litter, which is 55% lighter than our regular litter.\nNow let's turn to the outlook.\nWe're having an exceptional year.\nWe now expect full year adjusted earnings per share growth of 13% to 14%, which is far above our evergreen target of 8% annual earnings per share growth.\nGiven our strong performance, we have raised our full year outlook for sales growth to be approximately 11% and organic sales growth to be approximately 9%.\nAs mentioned many times in the past, we take the long view in managing Church & Dwight in order to sustain our evergreen model.\nIn the second half, we took the opportunity to increase our marketing spend behind our new products and we made incremental investments in the company.\nAs we wind up the year, we are putting together our 2021 plan.\nIt's safe to say that we have a high degree of confidence that we will meet our evergreen model in '21.\nIn February, we'll provide our detailed outlook for next year.\nNow in conclusion, I would like to remind everyone of the many reasons to have confidence in Church & Dwight.\nThe great thing about our company is we are positioned to do well in both good and bad economic times.\nThe categories in which we play are largely essential to consumers.\nAnd we have a few categories that stand to benefit from the current environment.\nWe have a balance of value and premium products.\nOur power brands are number one or number two in their categories.\nAnd we have low exposure to private label.\nWe're coming off some of the best growth quarters we've ever had.\nAnd with a strong balance sheet, we continue to be open to acquiring TSR-accretive businesses.\nWe believe our company is stronger and more agile than ever.\nAnd finally, we have the resources, the common sense and the ambition to ensure that our brands perform well in the future.\nNext up is Rick to give you details on the third quarter.\nWe'll start with EPS.\nThird quarter adjusted EPS, which excludes an acquisition-related earnout adjustment, grew 6.1% to $0.70 compared to $0.66 in 2019.\nAs we discussed in previous calls, the quarterly earnout adjustment will continue until the conclusion of the earnout period.\nStronger-than-expected sales performance allowed the company to spend incrementally on marketing.\nReported revenue was up 13.9%, reflecting a continued increase in consumer demand for our products.\nOrganic sales was up 9.9%, driven by a volume increase of 10.2%, partially offset by 0.3% of unfavorable product mix and pricing, primarily driven by new product support.\nVolume growth was driven by higher consumption.\nNow let's review the segments.\nOrganic sales increased by 10.7%, largely due to higher volume.\nOverall, growth was led by VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins, WATERPIK oral care products, ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent and OXICLEAN stain fighters.\nWe commonly get asked to bridge the Nielsen reporting to our organic results.\nThis quarter, tracked consumption was 7.7% for our brands compared to an organic sales increase of 10.7%.\nIn this environment, one might assume that is restocking retailer inventory.\nThat is not the case.\nWe had 400 basis points of help from strong growth in untracked channels, primarily online, and 100 basis point drag from couponing to support new products.\nThe good news is, as you heard from Matt, consumption and shipments are in balance, both low double digits.\nConsumer International delivered 11.6% organic growth due to higher volume, offset by lower price and product mix.\nThis was a great recovery for our international business from a flat Q2.\nGrowth was primarily driven by the Global Markets Group and Canada.\nFor our SPD business, organic sales decreased 3.4% due to lower volume, offset by higher pricing.\nThe lower volume was primarily driven by the nondairy animal and food production in sodium bicarbonate business.\nTurning now to gross margin.\nOur third quarter gross margin was 45.5%, 110 basis point decrease from a year ago.\nGross margin was impacted by 110 basis point drag from tariffs and a 90 basis point impact from acquisition accounting.\nIn addition, to round out the Q3 gross margin bridge is a plus 100 basis points from price/volume mix; plus 160 basis points from productivity programs, offset by a drag of 80 basis points of higher manufacturing costs, inflation and higher distribution costs; as well as a drag of 90 basis points for COVID costs.\nMoving now to marketing.\nMarketing was up $45.7 million year-over-year as we invested behind our brands.\nMarketing expense as a percentage of net sales increased 230 basis points to 13.8%.\nFor SG&A, Q3 adjusted SG&A decreased 30 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to leverage from strong sales growth.\nOther expense all in was $12.3 million and $3.9 million decline due to lower interest expense from lower interest rates.\nAnd for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 17.3% compared to 21.6% in 2019, a decrease of 430 basis points, primarily driven by higher tax benefits related to stock option exercises.\nAnd now turning to cash.\nFor the first nine months of 2020, cash from operating activities increased 29% to $798 million due to significantly higher cash earnings and an improvement in working capital.\nAs of September 30, cash on hand was $549 million.\nOur full year capex plan continues to be approximately $100 million as we begin to expand manufacturing and distribution capacity, primarily focused on laundry, litter and vitamins.\nAs I mentioned back at the Barclays conference in September, we do expect a step-up in capex over the next couple of years to approximately 3.5% of sales for these capacity-related investments.\nIn addition, as you read in the release, due to the strong cash position, the company may resume stock repurchases in the future.\nFor Q4, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 9%, organic sales growth of approximately 8%.\nAnd as Matt mentioned, we have strong consumption across many of our categories.\nTurning to gross margin.\nWe previously called 150 basis point contraction in the second half.\nNow we're saying down 190 basis points.\nThe change is primarily due to nonrecurring supply chain costs.\nWe also expect significant expense, and we have called flat for the year in terms of a percent of sales, which implies a step-up in Q4.\nWe also anticipate a lower tax rate.\nAs a result, we expect Q4 adjusted earnings per share to be $0.50 to $0.52 per share, excluding the acquisition earnout adjustment as we exit 2020 with momentum.\nAnd now for the full year outlook, we now expect approximately 11% for the year 2020 sales growth, which is above our previously 9% to 10% range.\nWe're also raising our full year organic sales growth to approximately 9%, up from our previous 7% to 8% outlook.\nWe raised our cash from operations outlook to $975 million, which is up 13% versus year ago.\nTurning to gross margin.\nWe expect gross margin to be down 20 basis points for the year, primarily due to the impact of acquisition accounting, COVID costs, incremental manufacturing and distribution capacity investments and the higher tariffs on WATERPIK.\nAs to tariffs, remember back in 2018, we got caught up in Tier two tariffs for which we were granted an extension in 2019.\nThat exemption expired and was not extended as of Q3 2020.\nWe continue to work on mitigating that impact.\nAnother word or two on gross margin.\nPreviously, I have said the first half of the year was plus 150 basis points on gross margin and the second half was down 150 basis points on gross margin.\nAnd so our outlook as of last quarter was flat for the year.\nAnd then also last quarter, you heard me walk through investments we were making in the second half of 2020.\nExamples here included a new third-party logistics provider, outside storage to handle surge inventories, preliminary engineering on capacity, VMS outsourcing costs as well as other investments around automation, consumer research and analytics.\nNow we're calling down 190 basis points for the back half or down 20 basis points for the year, and that implies down 250 basis points for the quarter.\nWe have some supply chain nonrecurring costs.\nHere are a few examples.\nFirst, because of our outsized growth, I mentioned last quarter, we're adding a new 3PL distribution center.\nIn the quarter, we again had stronger sales.\nAnd as such, had duplicative outside storage locations and the new 3PL distribution center that wasn't operational.\nSo for a period of time, we had duplicative costs.\nWe're also in the process of going through make first buy decisions.\nAnd that will trigger a couple of asset write-offs likely in Q4.\nWe have lean training across the plants.\nAnd finally, due to the great results this year, higher incentive comp cost that flow through COGS.\nSo our full year tax rate expectations are 19%, and we also raised our adjusted earnings per share growth to 13% to 14%.\nNow that we're through the outlook, I also want to spend a minute on FLAWLESS.\nAs you saw in the release, we had an earnout benefit of approximately $50 million in the quarter in reported earnings.\nWe exclude any of the earnout movements in adjusted EPS.\nSome color on that swing.\nAs a backdrop, we bought that business for $475 million upfront and a $425 million earnout tied to year-end 2021 sales.\nThat sales target represented in excess of 15% CAGR for three years off of a baseline of $180 million of trailing sales.\nThe revised 3-year CAGR for this business is closer to 8%.\nAnd as such, the earnout liability comes down and earnings go up.\nWe're still positive on this business.\nAnd the strong consumption growth these past six months is a great indicator for the future.\nAs you heard from Matt, the company is well positioned as we enter 2021.\nAnd with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'll start today with a review of guest cruise operations, along with a summary of our first quarter cash flows.\nThen I'll provide an update on booking trends and finish up with adjusted EBITDA and net income expectations.\nTurning to guest cruise operations.\nDuring the first quarter 2022, we restarted 10 additional ships, resulting in 60% of our fleet capacity in guest cruise operations for the whole of the first quarter.\nThis was a substantial increase from 47% during the fourth quarter 2021.\nAs of today, 75% of our fleet capacity has resumed guest cruise operations.\nAgility to continuously adapt to the ever changing landscape has been one of our greatest strengths during the pandemic.\nIn the first quarter, we continued to demonstrate this scale as we adjusted restart dates to optimize our guest cruise operations.\nAnd we now expect each brand's full fleet to be back in guest cruise operations for its respective summer season where we historically generate the largest share of our operating income.\nI am happy to report that just last week, we announced plans for our Australia restart, commencing at the end of May after the government advised that cruising would be permitted beginning in April.\nFor the first quarter, occupancy was 54% across the ships in service.\nWe never expected to achieve our historical 100-plus percent occupancies for the first quarter since many of these sailings were confirmed just a number of months before departure, which resulted in less than the normal booking lead time.\nHowever, we had anticipated first quarter occupancy would exceed the 58% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nWe started the quarter with over 55% cabin occupancy booked for the first quarter and expected to improve upon that during the quarter.\nHowever, during the first quarter 2022, as a result of the omicron variant, we experienced an impact on bookings for near-term sailings, including higher cancellations resulting from an increase in pretravel positive test results, challenges in the availability of timely pretravel tests and disruption than omicron caused on society during this time.\nAll of this inhibited our ability to build on our cabin occupancy book position for the first quarter 2022 during the first quarter, resulting in occupancy for the first quarter 2022 at 54% being lower than the 58% occupancy we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nDespite all that, during the first quarter, we carried over one million guests, which was nearly a 20% increase from the fourth quarter 2021.\nOnce again, our brands executed extremely well with Net Promoter Scores continuing at elevated levels compared to pre-COVID scores.\nRevenue per passenger day for the first quarter 2022 increased approximately 7.5% compared to a strong 2019 despite our lucrative world cruises and exotic voyages being shelved this year.\nOur revenue management teams held on price when we experienced an impact on bookings for near-term sailings, optimizing our longer-term prospects for future revenue and pricing.\nOnce again, our onboard and other revenue per diems were up significantly in the first quarter 2022 versus the first quarter 2019, in part due to the bundled packages as well as onboard credits utilized by guests from cruises canceled during the pause.\nWe had great growth in onboard and other per diems on both sides of the Atlantic.\nIncreases in bar, casino, shops, spa and Internet led the way onboard.\nOver the past 2.5 years, we have offered and our guests have chosen more and more bundled package options.\nIn the end, we will see the benefit of these bundled packages in onboard and other revenue.\nAs a result of these bundled packages, the line between passenger ticket and onboard revenue is blurred.\nFor accounting purposes, we allocate the total price paid by the guests between the two categories.\nTherefore, the best way to judge our performance is by reference to our total cruise revenue metrics.\nOn the cost side, our adjusted cruise cost without fuel per available lower berth day, or ALBD as it is more commonly called, for the first quarter 2022 was up 25%.\nI did say adjusted cruise costs and not net cruise costs, a term we had previously used.\nThe calculation of adjusted cruise costs and net cruise costs are the same.\nThe increase in adjusted cruise costs without fuel per ALBD is driven essentially by five things: first, the cost of a portion of the fleet being in pause status; second, restart related expenses; third, 15 ships being in dry dock during the quarter, which resulted in nearly double the number of dry dock days during the first quarter versus the first quarter 2019; fourth, the cost of maintaining enhanced health and safety protocols; and finally, inflation.\nRemember, that because a portion of the fleet was in pause status during the first quarter and the higher number of dry dock days, we spread costs over less ALBDs.\nThis will again result in a doubling of the dry dock days during the quarter compared to 2019, which will impact adjusted cruise cost without fuel per ALBD during the second quarter.\nWe anticipate that many of these costs and expenses driving adjusted cruise costs without fuel per ALBD higher will end during 2022 and will not reoccur in 2023.\nAs a result of all of the above, we expect to see a significant improvement in adjusted cruise costs, excluding fuel per ALBD, from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 2022 with a low double-digit increase expected for the full year 2022 compared to 2019.\nNext, I'll provide a summary of our first quarter cash flows.\nWe ended the first quarter 2022 with $7.2 billion in liquidity versus $9.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter.\nLooking forward, we believe we remain well positioned given our liquidity.\nThe change in liquidity during the quarter was driven essentially by four things: first, an improved negative adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion due to our ongoing resumption of guest cruise operations despite the impact of the omicron variant.\nWe had thought adjusted EBITDA was going to improve more.\nBut as I said before, the omicron variant inhibited our ability to grow occupancy during the quarter, which limited the improvement in adjusted EBITDA.\nSecond, our investment of $400 million in capital expenditures net of export credits.\nThird, $500 million of debt principal payments.\nAnd fourth, $400 million of interest expense during the quarter.\nNow let's look at booking trends.\nSince the middle of January, we have seen an improving trend in booking volumes for future sailings.\nRecent weekly booking volumes have been higher than at any point since the restart of guest cruise operations.\nDuring the first quarter, we increased our booked occupancy position for the second half of 2022, albeit not at the same pace as a typical wave season due to the omicron variant.\nAs a result, the cumulative advanced book position for the second half of 2022 is at the lower end of the historical range.\nHowever, we believe we are well situated with our current second half 2022 book position given the recent improvement in booking volumes, coupled with closer in booking patterns and our expectation for an extended wave season.\nWe continue to expect that occupancy will build throughout 2022 and return to historical levels in 2023.\nAnd importantly, I am happy to report that prices on these bookings for the second half of 2022 continue to be higher with or without future cruise credits, or more commonly called FCCs, normalized for bundled packages as compared to 2019 sailings.\nOur cumulative advanced book position for the first half of 2023 continues to be at the higher end of the historical range, also at higher prices with or without FCCs normalized for bundled packages as compared to 2019 sailings.\nThis is a great achievement given pricing on bookings for 2019 sailings is a tough comparison as that was a high watermark for historical yields.\nI will finish up with our adjusted EBITDA and net income expectations.\nWe all know that booking trends are a leading indicator of the health of our business.\nWith improved recent booking trends leading the way, driving customer deposits higher, positive adjusted EBITDA is clearly within our sights.\nOver the next few months, we expect ship level cash contribution to grow as more ships return to service and as we build on our occupancy percentages.\nHowever, as I've already said, adjusted EBITDA over the first half of 2022 has been or will be impacted by the restart-related spending and dry dock expenses as 39 ships, over 40% of our fleet, will have been in dry dock during the first half of fiscal 2022.\nGiven all these factors combined, we expect monthly adjusted EBITDA to continue to improve and turn consistently positive at the beginning of our summer season.\nWe continue to expect a net loss for the second quarter of 2022 on both a U.S. GAAP and adjusted basis.\nHowever, we expect the profit for the third quarter of 2022.\nFor the full year, we do expect a net loss.\nLooking to brighter days ahead in 2023, with the full fleet back in service all year, 8% more capacity than 2019 and improved fleet profile with nearly a quarter of our capacity consisting of newly delivered ships, continuing momentum on our outstanding Net Promoter Scores and occupancy returning to historical levels, we are looking forward to providing memorable vacation experiences to nearly 14 million guests and generating potentially greater adjusted EBITDA than 2019.\nSummary: ",

Philip Schlom, chief financial officer; and David Nark, senior vice president, marketing, communications, and IR.\nThose risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited, to, changes in customer demand and response to products and services offered by the company, including demand by the power generation markets, electrical transmission and distribution markets, the industrial markets and the metal coatings markets; prices and raw material costs, including zinc and natural gas, which are used in the hot-dip galvanizing process; changes in the political stability and economic conditions of the various markets that AZZ serves, foreign and domestic; customer-requested delays of shipments; acquisition opportunities; currency exchange rates; adequate financing; and availability of experienced management and employees to implement the company's growth strategies.\nIn addition, AZZ customers and its operations could potentially be adversely impacted by the ongoing COVID pandemic.\nWe continue to gain momentum in the third quarter and completed our fifth consecutive quarter of solid performance after the disruption from COVID in the first half of last year.\nTheir perseverance continues to allow us to achieve these kinds of results.\nConsolidated sales of almost $232 million improved 2.3% versus the prior year or 4.1% when adjusted for the divestiture of SMS last year.\nmetal coatings generated another excellent quarter with sales up 15.4% to over $133 million and infrastructure solutions sales down 11% at about $99 million.\nWe are pleased to have completed another strong quarter of performance.\nWe continue to generate solid cash flow and returned capital to our shareholders during the third quarter.\nWe generated net income of over $21 million and earnings per share of $0.85 per diluted share, reflecting the resiliency of our businesses and the dedication of our people.\nOur businesses leverage the realignment actions taken last year to improve profitability while maintaining their focus on providing outstanding quality and service to our customers.\nWe also benefited from lower interest expense and a lower tax rate of 22% for the third quarter.\nIn line with our strategic commitment to value creation, we repurchased over 148,000 shares for $7.6 million and distributed $4.2 million in dividends.\nIn metal coatings we achieved 24.5% in operating margins on sales of $133 million.\nThis resulted in operating income being up over 14% from the previous year.\nThe margin improvement was primarily due to driving operating efficiencies and productivity, while realizing improved pricing in the face of rapidly rising zinc, labor and energy costs.\nIn spite of the ongoing challenges of COVID, our team succeeded in completing the acquisition of Steel Creek Galvanizing in South Carolina.\nThis site was completed in 2019 and includes a lot of automation, making it the newest and most modern in our fleet.\nOur team is excited about the growth opportunity it presents in a region we were not present in.\nOur metal coatings team continues to demonstrate their ability to perform and deliver great results while managing labor shortages and the increasing costs.\nOur infrastructure solutions segment demonstrated continued profitability improvement in the quarter, leveraging the cost reduction actions that they took last year.\nWe were down about 8% when considering the impact of the SMS divestiture.\nThe infrastructure solutions segment delivered operating income of over $9 million, with operating margins improved 140 basis points to 9.3% as compared to the prior year.\nThe segment did face growing labor constraints and delays in materials due to supply chain disruptions resulting from COVID, including components from customers.\nOne WSI international project was significantly impacted by COVID outbreak, which was managed well, that resulted in lower profitability.\nWe remain focused on strategic selling initiatives across both the electrical and industrial platforms and we believe we are well positioned to finish this fiscal year well.\nFor fiscal year 2022, while COVID continues to generate some uncertainty in many sectors given our strong performance in the first three quarters and due to seeing more opportunities than risks the balance of this year, we are tightening our earnings per share guidance.\nWe anticipate annual sales to be in the range of $865 million to $925 million and earnings per share at $3 to $3.20 per diluted share.\nWe do not anticipate any material impact in the fourth quarter from the recently announced acquisition as we're focused on integration these first couple of months.\nMetal coatings is continuing to focus on sales growth, including leveraging our spin galvanizing operations at several sites, operational execution and customer service as labor and operating expenses increase due to inflation.\nOur infrastructure solutions segment is cautiously optimistic as it enters the fourth quarter with some momentum in bookings activity, particularly in the electrical platform.\nOur WSI business is seeing good results from the expanded Poland facility, although internationally, the business continues to experience some intermittent project delays due to COVID outbreaks at some customer sites.\nAs we noted on the last call, some of the fall season projects will now be completed in the fourth quarter.\nWe also have some spring projects that look to kick off a little earlier than normal.\nThe electrical platform is focused on operational execution and growing its e-house and switchgear businesses.\nDue to the project extensions from the third quarter, we expect a better-than-normal performance in the fourth quarter.\nI will note that our outlook for the spring turnaround season is quite good based upon the level of quotations, but we remain cautious due to the ongoing battles with COVID outbreaks at customer sites.\nFor the balance of fiscal year 2022, AZZ will continue to execute on our strategic growth initiatives to drive shareholder value while positioning for a strong start to fiscal 2023.\nOur commitment to superior customer service is unwavering.\nOur ability to generate strong cash flow is based on initiatives that drive operational excellence, tightly manage costs, ensure pricing discipline and emphasis on receivables collection within our operating platforms.\nWe are confident that our businesses remain vital to improving and sustaining infrastructure, so we continue to drive profitable growth and enhance shareholder value.\nBookings or incoming orders in the third quarter were $248 million, a $53.6 million or 28% increase over the third quarter of the prior year.\nOur bookings-to-sale ratio remained consistent with last quarter, 107% and well above the book-to-sales ratio of 0.86 for the same quarter last year.\nAs Tom had alluded to, we have seen consistently strong markets for our metal coatings segment and continue to experience improving markets in our infrastructure solutions segment.\nThird quarter fiscal 2022 sales were $231.7 million, $5.1 million or 2.3% higher than the prior-year third quarter sales of $226.6 million.\nYear over year, for the third quarter, metal coatings segment sales were up $17.8 million and were partially offset by lower sales in the infrastructure solutions segment, mostly in the industrial segment where we took significant actions to restructure the business in the middle of last year.\nThe business generated gross profit of $57 million compared with gross profit of $54.7 million in the third quarter of the prior year.\nOur gross margin was 24.6% for the third quarter compared with gross margin of 24.1% in the third quarter of last year as business in both the segments continue to improve.\nOperating income for the quarter was $30.1 million compared with $27.9 million in the third quarter of the prior year, a $2.2 million or 8% improvement year over year.\nOur earnings per share was $0.85 or $0.09 higher than last year's third quarter reported earnings per share of $0.76 and adjusted earnings per share of $0.80 in the prior-year third quarter.\nThe prior year was impacted by our loss on the divestiture of southern mechanical services or SMS. Third quarter EBITDA of $39.8 million was flat compared with EBITDA in the third quarter of the prior year.\nYear-to-date sales through the third quarter of fiscal 2022 were $678 million, a 5.4% increase from last year's third quarter, year-to-date sales -- from last year's third quarter year-to-date sales of $643 million.\nExcluding the impact of SMS divestitures, sales would have increased 8.6% year over year on a pro forma basis.\nFiscal 2022 year-to-date net income of $62.4 million was $38.9 million or 166% above the prior year-to-date reported net income of $23.5 million and $23.1 million or 58.9% above the adjusted net income from the prior year-to-date period, wherein the company had recorded impairment and restructuring charges net of tax of $15.8 million.\nEPS on a year-to-date diluted share basis is $2.48 compared with $0.90 reported in the prior year and $1.50 on an adjusted basis.\nCurrent year-to-date earnings per share improved $0.98 or 65.3% over the year-to-date 2021 results.\nWhile we continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, our balance sheet remains strong.\nThe following are capital allocation highlights for the year.\nOn a gross basis, outstanding debt at the end of the quarter was $192 million, consisting of $150 million on our 7- and 12-year senior notes and $42 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility.\nThis reflects a $13 million increase in borrowings from the end of the last fiscal year.\nBorrowings have increased, primarily as a result of our continued share repurchase activity, higher receivables and higher inventories as the business volumes improve.\nYear to date, we have deployed $19.1 million in capital investments and anticipate capital investments of roughly $32 million this year, slightly below our previous estimate of $35 million.\nSupply chain constraints have continued to impact and delay the timing of spending on our planned capital expenditures.\nWe repurchased 7.6 million in outstanding stock during the quarter and year-to-date have repurchased 712,000 shares or $28.9 million.\nWe declared and continue to make quarterly dividend payments.\nThrough the nine months ended November 30, 2021, cash flows generated from operations was $49.7 million, down $9.7 million or 16.4% from the same period in the prior year.\nOperating cash flows were positively impacted by the higher earnings but were more than offset by higher receivables on increased sales and increased inventories, primarily as a result of higher zinc costs in our metal coatings.\nWe continue to remain active on the merger and acquisition front and completed the acquisition of the galvanizing operation in South Carolina that will expand our Southeast footprint and should be accretive during the first year of operation, as Tom had noted earlier.\nHere are some key indicators that we are paying particular attention to.\nFor the metal coating segment's Galvanizing business, we are carefully tracking fabrication and construction activity and material and labor cost inflation as well as OSHA's COVID vaccine mandate.\nFor the surface technologies platform, we are primarily focused on expanding our customer base and benefiting from improved operational performance.\nFor infrastructure solutions, domestic turnaround and outage activity has returned to a normal level.\nThe spring season is currently looking to be good, although we remain cautious due to COVID, particularly for international customers.\nThe electrical platform is benefiting from transmission distribution and utility spending and growing data center and battery energy storage activity.\nIn regards to the strategic review of infrastructure solutions and stated desire to become predominantly a metal coatings company, we have meaningfully advanced our work on a couple of strategic options that are designed to achieve this commitment.\nUnfortunately, due to related NDAs, we are not able to comment further at this time.\nWe remain committed to our growth strategy around metal coatings and achieving 21% to 23% operating margins with galvanizing performance being quite steady, while we continue to improve Surface Technologies.\nWe will remain acquisitive, particularly in metal coatings and hope to complete one more acquisition before the end of this fiscal year.\nFor infrastructure solutions, we are focused on profitability and cash flow.\nThis segment's business unit should benefit from more normalized turnaround outage seasons and a solid market for renewables, transmission and distribution, utility, battery energy storage, data center e-houses and switchgear.\nWe did issue our first ESG report this past quarter and we'll continue to pursue improvement in these areas.\nAnd finally, our normal cadence would be to issue guidance for fiscal year 2023 later this month, but we will not be doing so.\nWhile we are committed to providing sales and earnings per share guidance, we may not be in a position to do so until our work on the strategic options can be factored in.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:mdu.com, under the Investors tab.\nLeading our quarterly earnings discussion today are Dave Goodin, President and CEO of MDU Resources and myself.\nAlthough the company believes that its expectations and beliefs are based on reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ materially.\nFor second quarter of 2021, we delivered earnings of $100.2 million or $0.50 per share compared to second quarter 2020 earnings of $99.7 million or also $0.50 per share.\nDuring the quarter, our results were impacted by higher stock-based compensation and healthcare costs of approximately $4.2 million after tax.\nFurther impacting our second quarter consolidated results was a $5.4 million lower investment returns on certain benefit plans compared to the same quarter in 2020.\nWhile these items had an impact on the quarter's results, all of our operations performed very well throughout the first six months of the year, growing consolidated revenues by 3.5% and increasing earnings $27.5 million year-to-date.\nOur utility business are $9.6 million for the second quarter compared to earnings of $11.2 million in the second quarter of 2020.\nFor the Electric Utilities segment, reported earnings of $10.3 million for the quarter compared to $12.2 million for the same period in 2020.\nHigher operation and maintenance expense, largely the result of higher labor-related costs, including the increased stock-based compensation expense and healthcare costs, as we previously discussed, as well as increased generating station expenses drove the decrease in earnings.\nLower benefit plan investment returns also negatively impacted the results.\nPartially offsetting the decrease was higher adjusted gross margin driven by a 6.9% increase in retail sales volumes.\nSales volumes increased for industrial and commercial customers during the quarter and were offset in part by lower residential volumes as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic start to reverse and individuals are returning to work as businesses reopen.\nHigher demand revenues and higher revenues associated with transmission interconnect projects also had a positive impact on the adjusted gross margin.\nOur natural gas utility segment reported a seasonal loss of $700,000, improved from a seasonal loss of $1 million for the same period in 2020.\nAdjusted gross margin increased during the quarter from approved rate recovery and 2% customer growth.\nTransportation revenues also increased from higher volumes transported to the company's electric generation customers.\nPartially offsetting the decreased loss was higher operation and maintenance expense, primarily labor-related costs, as previously discussed, as well as lower returns on certain benefit plan investments.\nThe pipeline business had earnings of $9.2 million in the second quarter compared to $9 million in the second quarter of 2020.\nHigher nonregulated project revenues and increased allowance for funds used during construction were the primary drivers of the increase in earnings.\nPartially offsetting this was higher operation and maintenance expense relating to the previously measured increase in nonregulated projects as well as higher payroll.\nNow turning to the construction businesses.\nConstruction services reported record second quarter earnings of $28.9 million compared to the prior year's record of $27.9 million.\nRevenues increased 6% on a year-over-year basis to second quarter -- to a second quarter record of $525.6 million.\nDemand for construction services remains high for both the inside and outside specialty contracting.\nInside specialty contracting saw strong demand for commercial and industrial work, specifically in the manufacturing industry and outside contracting workloads increased with high demand from the utility industry.\nLower depreciation, depletion and amortization expense resulting from decreased intangible amortization related to prior acquisitions also contributed to the increase in earnings.\nOur construction materials business reported second quarter earnings of $51.4 million compared to the prior year's $53 million in the second quarter.\nRevenues increased 2% to $633.8 million.\nThe decrease in earnings was primarily the result of higher selling, general and administrative expenses from increased labor-related costs as we had previously discussed.\nLower returns on certain benefit plans also impacted the quarter.\nPartially offsetting these items was lower interest expense due to lower average interest rates.\nThat summarizes the financial highlights for the quarter.\nToday, I'll walk through each of our business lines to highlight some notable drivers in the quarter and go into greater detail about some of the organic growth items covered in yesterday's news release.\nStarting with our regulated energy delivery platform.\nWe now have approximately 1.15 million customers across our electric and natural gas utility businesses.\nAnd our utility employees remain focused on organic growth and infrastructure improvements that help to safely and efficiently serve our customers.\nWe continue to expect strong customer growth across our service territory, outpacing the national average and in the range between 1% and 2% compounded annually.\nThe electric utility finished the precommissioning -- decommissioning activities on the coal-fired Unit I at the Lewis & Clark generating station here in the second quarter and commenced decommissioning here in July.\nWe expect to retire Units I and II at Heskett Station near Mandan, North Dakota early next year, which are the last of the company's wholly owned coal-fired facilities.\nOur generation portfolio in regards to nameplate capacity prior to the commencement of the retirements -- these retirements was 48% coal and will decrease to 31% in 2023 upon completion of the proposed Heskett IV natural gas-fired peaking unit.\nOur natural gas utility, along with our pipeline business, WBI Energy, recently announced a project that will increase natural gas service to Wahpeton, North Dakota, while also being able to offer natural gas service for the first time to Kindred, North Dakota.\nThis project is driven by customer contracts requiring more firm natural gas supply that our current infrastructure can provide to Eastern North Dakota.\nThe project involves constructing approximately 60 miles of 12-inch pipeline from our existing facilities at Mapleton, North Dakota to Wahpeton.\nIt will add 20 million cubic feet per day of natural gas capacity and is expected to cost approximately $75 million.\nDepending on regulatory approvals, construction is expected to begin in early 2024 with the completion date later that year.\nSpeaking of our pipeline business, we're excited that in early July, WBI Energy received final FERC approval, allowing construction to begin on the North Bakken expansion project in Western North Dakota.\nThis $260 million project will add 250 million cubic feet of daily natural gas transportation capacity to our system, bringing WBI's total pipeline capacity to more than 2.4 Bcf per day, while helping to reduce natural gas flaring in the region and allowing Bakken producers to move natural gas to market.\nConstruction began here in mid-July.\nAnd with favorable weather during the construction season, we expect the project to be in service by end of this year.\nNow moving on to Construction.\nOur Construction Services Group had an outstanding second quarter as demand for both inside and outside specialty contracting remains very strong.\nCSG reported record second quarter revenues and earnings and an all-time record backlog now standing at $1.32 billion as of the end of June.\nBidding remains highly competitive in all areas, but we are confident that our relationships with existing customers, our skilled workforce and our high quality of service will aid in securing and executing on profitable projects.\nAs a reminder, revenue guidance at this business for 2021 continues to be in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion, with margins comparable to or slightly higher than 2020 levels.\nAnd finally, at our construction materials business, while earnings were down slightly year-over-year, Knife River is operating at near-record levels, falling just short of the prior year's record second quarter earnings while continuing to produce record revenues.\nDemand and pricing for aggregates and ready-mix concrete is strong across a number of markets.\nConstruction materials reported backlog at the end of the quarter at $912 million, an increase of over 4% from the prior year.\nRevenue guidance for this business is also in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion, with margins comparable to our 2020 levels.\nWe remain optimistic about our construction businesses and continue to evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities that will enhance our existing footprint and appropriately expand our business, all while earning attractive returns on invested capital.\nAs mentioned in our news release yesterday, we feel very positive about the conversation surrounding infrastructure funding packages at the federal level as well as at various state levels across our footprint.\nWith combined construction backlog at an all-time record at $2.23 billion as of June 30, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of these multiyear growth opportunities.\nWhile we believe these infrastructure proposals will provide additional opportunities to some of our core areas of business, such as surface transportation improvements, renewable energy, power grid modernization, broadband and much more, these infrastructure proposals are not included in our earnings per share guidance of $2 to $2.15 for this year of 2021 or in our 5-year capital investment plan for that matter as well.\nOverall, we are very pleased with our performance throughout the first half of the year.\nOur focus at MDU Resources has been and continues to be to produce significant long-term value as we execute on our business plans, our organic growth projects and our targeted acquisitions.\nWe continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, solid credit ratings and a good liquidity position.\nFor the last 83 consecutive years, we provided a competitive dividend for our shareholders and have been increasing it for the last 30 years.\nAs always, MDU Resources is committed to operating with integrity and a focus on safety while creating superior shareholder value, and we continue to act along our tag line of Building a Strong America.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Let me provide highlights on our 2020 performance, share my expectations for 2021 and comment on our strategy going forward.\nAnd then Stephen will cover our fourth quarter results and guidance for 2021 in more depth.\nWe finished the year strong with fourth quarter results much better than expected.\nWe delivered another solid quarter in a pandemic year that was challenging and unpredictable.\nOur operations demonstrated agility and a relentless focus to deliver great bottom line results, despite pressure on the top line and downturns in some of the end markets that we serve.\nAnd this was our story throughout the year.\nBeginning in early 2020, we took swift action to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees.\nOur teams worked tirelessly to reset our manufacturing and supply chains at many times during the year to meet our customers' needs as they changes.\nWe did a great job for customers and continue to drive efficiency and productivity improvements.\nWe took early action to manage our costs well.\nAnd consequently, we were able to deliver outstanding margins for our shareholders and generate solid free cash flow and add to our strong balance sheet.\nAlso notable, our customer performance metrics are at record levels for service, on-time delivery and quality.\nOur safety performance ended the year as the best in the history of the company.\nOur factory productivity and supply chain initiatives contributed to our bottom line success.\nAnd we managed to launch a number of employee training and development initiatives.\nI'm most proud of how our employees found ways to work safely and how they've innovated to not only do our work, but to improve how we do it.\nIt's not an accident that we completed well over 100 Lean Kaizen improvement projects in 2020 despite the restraints of social distancing, working remote and following precautions for COVID-19.\nIn December, we recognized these accomplishments by our employees, and we're pleased to award all of our employees around the world, excluding the executive team, with a $1,000 bonus of gratitude.\nAs I've said, I'm proud of how our employees pulled together to support one another and work safely during this pandemic and continue to do a great job for customers.\nNow let me make a few comments about the outlook for this year and beyond.\nOur Machine Clothing segment's end markets appear to be gaining strength.\nWe exited last year with a solid order book, which bodes well for this year and beyond as the global economy improves.\nAs a leader in machine clothing, we're well positioned to grow with our customers, especially in the higher growth areas of tissue and packaging.\nOur long-standing strategy of continuous investment in technology and product development, along with our operating discipline, has served us well during the worst market downturn in more than a decade.\nConsider this: in the middle of a global pandemic recession, our MC segment expanded its adjusted EBITDA margin by 170 basis points in 2020.\nAnd more impressive, since 2015, our MC segment has expanded its adjusted EBITDA margin by more than 500 basis points.\nWe're also optimistic about our Engineered Composites segment's future, although it's longer term since 2021 still portends to face headwinds from the pandemic and the downturn in commercial aerospace and airline travel.\nThrough 2021, we're planning for slower production on some lines in AEC because of excess inventory in our facilities and inventory and the supply chain of our customers, particularly for components for the Boeing 737 MAX, the 787, and to a lesser degree the F-35.\nTo continue managing our costs, and because of the recent downward revision by Boeing for 787 demand, we just yesterday implemented a reduction in our Salt Lake City workforce where we produce 787 frames.\nWhile 2021 is expected to be slower because of inventory destocking, we expect growth in Engineered Composites to resume longer term.\nWe're well positioned in both military and commercial markets with solid programs such as the CH-53K, the JASSM missile, the F-35 and LEAP.\nAnd our position on LEAP engines with Safran should see early growth in the recovery since narrow body aircraft, which the LEAP engine powers, are expected to lead commercial aerospace out of the recession as domestic air travel is expected to recover first.\nNext, let me say a few words about our strategy.\nAlbany International has a 125-year history of innovation and developing new materials that add value for our customers.\nWe're committed to continuing this legacy with a focus on developing the next generation of engineered materials and advanced composites to help our customers improve their products and production processes.\nOur Machine Clothing segment is the leader in PMC because it offers a full range of the most advanced material belts used on paper machines, which operate at high speeds in a severe environment.\nWe've earned a reputation for constantly improving our belt's technology, durability and performance.\nAnd because of our advancements, our customers are able to produce higher quality paper products reliably at lower overall cost of production under demanding conditions.\nThis is a technology-intensive collaborative partnership that our customers value.\nIn our Engineered Composites segment, we continue to advance the state of the art in advanced composites, including our proprietary 3D woven composite material used in the LEAP engine, fan blades and fan cases.\nIn 2020, despite the pandemic, we worked closely with Safran to continue improving our 3D woven composite materials and to reduce our cost of manufacturing them so as commercial aerospace rebounds, we'll be even more competitive.\nWe also expanded our collaboration with new customers and for new applications to diversify our customer base and develop future growth areas.\nOur technology development on the Wing of Tomorrow program with Airbus has continued through the pandemic.\nWhile this program is longer term, it's imperative that we get an early seat at the table and bring our technology to design the next generation of aircraft.\nIn the medium and near term, we have other ongoing R&D development efforts, what I call incubator projects, in both military and commercial areas.\nFor example, our R&D team is supporting a major prime OEM in the development of next-generation hypersonic materials and structures using our proprietary 3D woven composite materials.\nWe also have projects in unmanned vehicles, higher temperature materials and thermal plastics.\nWe believe the current downturn in commercial aerospace is transitory and that market forces in the long term will drive energy efficiency and ongoing replacement of metallic components with lighter composites.\nThis trend will gain in importance as the industry seeks to reduce its environmental impact with the next generation of more efficient aircraft.\nOur 3D woven composite technology is commercially proven can meet the need for lighter weight and high strength, and we intend to grow our participation in the most demanding structural applications in aerospace.\nAs a company, we remain committed to investing in technology and product development of advanced materials for organic growth.\nIn fact, we're increasing our R&T budgets in both segments in 2021.\nAnd this is a critical part of our capital allocation strategy.\nOrganic growth has been driven by not only our investment in hard capital such as new products, tooling and production equipment, but also by our investment in intellectual capital, the expertise, the time and effort that are necessary for successfully developing new products and process know-how over time.\nWe're disciplined in how we invest in the criteria we use to measure success.\nWe guide our capital investment decisions based on expected returns to shareholders, and we direct capital to those programs with the best risk-adjusted returns.\nIn summary, we're optimistic about the future.\nWe have a solid balance sheet and strong free cash flow generation, which enables continued investment to grow.\nSo with that, I'll hand it over to Stephen.\nI will talk first about the results for the quarter and then about our initial outlook for our business in the coming year.\nFor the fourth quarter, total company net sales were $226.9 million, a decrease of 12% compared to the $257.7 million delivered in the same quarter last year.\nAdjusting for currency translation effects, net sales declined by 13.6% year-over-year in the quarter.\nIn Machine Clothing, also adjusting for currency translation effects, net sales were down 6.6% year-over-year, driven by declines across most major grades of product, partially offset by growth in engineered fabrics.\nOnce again, the most significant decline of over 21% on a constant currency basis was in publication grades, which represented about 17% of our MC sales in the quarter.\nHowever, we do see signs of a generally improving machine clothing market.\nFirst, while we did see year-over-year declines in packaging and tissue grades in the quarter, driven by the same factors that we discussed on our third quarter call, the year-over-year declines we saw on those grades in the fourth quarter were considerably smaller than we had seen in the third quarter.\nSecond, segment net sales in the fourth quarter were sequentially higher than the third quarter and modestly exceeded our expectations.\nEngineered Composites net sales, again, after adjusting for currency translation effects, declined by 23.5% compared to last year, primarily caused by significant reductions in LEAP and Boeing 787 program revenue, partially offset by growth on the F-35 and CH-53K platforms.\nDuring the quarter, the ASC LEAP program generated revenue of a little under $25 million compared to $48 million in the same quarter last year.\nHowever, this quarter's ASC LEAP revenue was up significantly on a sequential basis, 48% higher than the third quarter, driven by the fact that all three of our ASC LEAP facilities were operational for the full fourth quarter.\nFourth quarter gross profit for the company was $91.3 million, a reduction of 5.5% from the comparable period last year.\nThe overall gross margin increased by 280 basis points from 37.5% to 40.3% of net sales.\nWithin the MC segment, gross margin improved from 50.2% to 50.9% of net sales, driven by favorable foreign currency exchange rates, increased efficiencies and product mix.\nAEC gross margin improved from 19.6% to 21.7% of net sales, driven primarily by a favorable mix in program revenues, partially offset by a lower net favorable change in the profitability of long-term contracts.\nWhile we did recognize a net favorable change in the estimated profitability of long-term contracts this quarter of about $500,000, this compares to a $3.3 million improvement recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nFourth quarter selling, technical, general and research expenses increased from $51.3 million in the prior year quarter to $54.8 million in the current quarter and increased as a percentage of net sales from 19.9% to 24.1%.\nThe increase in the amount of the expense was driven primarily by higher incentive compensation expense and an increase in foreign currency revaluation losses from $1.4 million in Q4 of 2019 to $3.0 million this quarter.\nThese items were partially offset by lower travel expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.\nI would like to note that the higher incentive compensation expense that we recorded in both the third and fourth quarters of 2020 included accruals at corporate totaling $3.9 million across both quarters combined for the special $1,000 employee bonus that Bill referenced.\nTotal operating income for the company was $35.0 million, down from $43.6 million in the prior year quarter.\nMachine Clothing operating income decreased by $4.9 million, caused by lower gross profit, higher STG&R expense and higher restructuring expense, while AEC operating income fell by $2.1 million, caused by lower gross profit and higher STG&R expense, partially offset by lower restructuring expense.\nOther income and expense in the quarter netted to about income of $490,000 compared to an expense of about $350,000 in the same period last year.\nThe improvement was driven primarily by a more beneficial foreign currency revaluation effect in the quarter.\nThe income tax rate for this quarter was 13.5% compared to 24.8% in the prior year quarter.\nAs a result of a foreign currency revaluation gain at an entity where no tax provision is required, the tax rate associated with our adjusted earnings per share is somewhat higher at 17.8%.\nThat 17.8% tax rate is significantly lower than the tax rate for the full year.\nIn 2020 as a whole, our tax rate, excluding discrete items, was 28.4%, which compares to 28%, excluding discrete items, for 2019 as a whole.\nThe lower rate this quarter, due mainly to a true-up of earlier quarters' provisions, increased adjusted earnings per share by $0.12 this quarter.\nHad we known the final full year rate earlier in the year, that $0.12 would have been recognized as additional adjusted earnings per share in those earlier quarters.\nNet income attributable to the company for the quarter was 27.5% (sic) $27.5 million, a reduction of 5.5% from $29.1 million last year.\nThe reduction was primarily driven by the lower operating income, partially offset by the lower tax rate and improved other income and expense.\nEarnings per share was $0.85 in this quarter compared to $0.90 last year.\nAfter adjusting for the impact of foreign currency revaluation gains and losses, restructuring expenses, pension curtailment charges and expenses associated with the CirComp acquisition and integration, adjusted earnings per share was $0.89 this quarter compared to $0.97 last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA fell 10.4% to $57.3 million for the most recent quarter compared to the same period last year.\nMachine Clothing adjusted EBITDA was $50.9 million, or 35.3% of net sales this year, down from $52.8 million, or 35.1% of net sales, in the prior year quarter.\nAEC adjusted EBITDA was $21.3 million, or 25.7% of net sales, down from last year's $24.2 million, or 22.6% of net sales.\nTurning to our balance sheet.\nNet debt declined by about $46 million during the fourth quarter.\nAs a result, our absolute leverage ratio declined from 0.89 at the end of Q3 to 0.74 at the end of Q4.\nThe reduction in net debt was principally caused by strong operating cash flow generation in the Machine Clothing segment and lower capital expenditures during the quarter, due principally to a reduction of capital expenditures on the LEAP program.\nI would now like to turn toward the coming year by comparing it to 2020 and by providing our resulting initial financial guidance for 2021.\nWe expect to deliver another strong year -- another year of strong performance in the Machine Clothing segment.\nFor the full year 2020, we delivered net sales of about $573 million, down 5% from about $601 million in 2019.\nOrders in the fourth quarter of 2020 were up about 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.\nThis was a marked change from the first three quarters of the year when cumulative orders in the segment had been down compared to the same period in 2019.\nThis gives us some comfort as we head into 2021.\nIn particular, we do expect that sales in Q1 of 2021 will be up compared to the relatively low level of sales delivered in Q1 of 2020.\nWe are providing initial net sales guidance for the segment of $570 million to $590 million.\nFrom a profitability perspective, Machine Clothing had a very strong year in 2020, delivering $216 million of adjusted EBITDA.\nHowever, there are three effects that will make it hard to replicate those results in 2021.\nFirst, as we have previously disclosed, we benefited from very favorable foreign exchange rates in 2020, particularly with respect to the weakness of the Brazilian real and Mexican peso, both of which are currencies in which we are short in that we have more expenses than revenues in both.\nOverall, net favorable foreign exchange rates contributed over $6 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2020 compared to the prevailing foreign exchange rates in 2019.\nHowever, some of those favorable effects had dissipated by the end of the year.\nFor example, the Mexican peso had weakened from under 20 pesos per U.S. dollar in Q1 of 2020 to almost 25 pesos per dollar in Q2, but by the end of the year, the rate was back under 20 pesos.\nSecond, in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we incurred a significantly lower level of travel expense in the segment than in prior years.\nWhile this helped the bottom line to the tune of about $6 million, this was not ideal from a business perspective, as we depend on strong customer relationships to develop insight into customer needs and to drive product development and support.\nWe are expecting to resume our prior level of travel during 2021, although in Q1, travel will likely continue to suffer from some COVID effects.\nThird, we continue to see pressure on input costs, particularly right now with respect to logistics where sea, rail and air freight costs are all considerably higher than they were 12 months ago.\nIn the typical year, we see over $4 million of input cost pressure, and there is reason to believe that in 2021, this could be higher.\nWhile as is typical, we believe that we will be unlikely to be able to recover all of that increased cost through pricing increases.\nWe will, of course, work to implement cost improvement initiatives to offset as much of the remainder as possible.\nNotwithstanding these three pressures on profitability, we expect the Machine Clothing segment to deliver another strong year of profit performance and are providing initial adjusted EBITDA guidance for the segment of $195 million to $205 million.\nTurning to Engineered Composites, 2020 was a challenging year for the segment from a revenue perspective.\nOverall, revenue in the segment declined by about $125 million in 2020 compared to 2019, driven principally by lower sales on LEAP, 787 and other commercial programs, offset by growth in military programs.\nUnfortunately, in 2021, we are going to see a continuation of some of the same trends with 2021 shaping up to be a year of finished goods inventory destocking across our customers' supply chains.\nOn the ASC LEAP program, we expect to continue to produce components for the LEAP-1B variant, which powers the 737 MAX, at very low levels.\nWhile the 737 MAX is now reentering service, there is considerable finished goods inventory in the channel at Boeing, at Safran and in our own facilities on which we have already recognized revenue as we recognize revenue at the time of production, not delivery.\nIn 2021, we currently expect to make components for fewer than 150 LEAP-1B engines, far below the 1,000-plus engine shipsets we would expect to deliver annually in the long term.\nOn LEAP-1A, there is a much lower level of finished goods inventory in the channel, and we expect to produce components for well over 500 engine shipsets in 2021.\nOverall, while the total number of ASC LEAP engine shipsets produced in 2021 is expected to be somewhat higher than that produced in 2020, this is offset by the absence of certain recoverable nonrecurring expenses that were recognized as revenue in 2020, resulting in roughly flat revenues for ASC from 2020 to 2021.\nOur next largest commercial program to produce frames for the Boeing 787 also has finished goods inventory destocking challenges.\nIn 2020, we had already seen some effect from Boeing's decision to reduce the 787 build rate, and our revenues from the program in 2020 were down over 20% from 2019.\nHowever, as Boeing reduced the 787 build rate further, there has been an increased buildup of our finished goods in Boeing supply chain, resulting in drastic reductions in order quantities for delivery in 2021.\nIn addition, we expect our start-up of production of the 787 aft fuselage frames will now shift from late 2021 into mid- 2022 as it will take longer to consume the parts already in the supply chain that were produced by the previous supplier.\nOverall, in 2021, we expect our revenues on the 787 frames program to be $30 million to $35 million lower than we recognized in 2020.\nOn the military side, we support the Lockheed Martin F-35 through several contracts for different parts, including wing skins, edge seals and engine components at both our Salt Lake City and Boerne locations.\nF-35 has been and remains a very important platform for us.\nIn 2020, we recognized over $85 million of revenue on the platform overall, up more than 25% from what was recognized in 2019.\nHowever, during 2020, Lockheed Martin produced finished F-35s at a rate lower than they had originally predicted due to supply chain issues caused by the pandemic and consumed fewer sustainment parts.\nAs a result, during 2020, there was a buildup of our finished goods in the F-35 supply chain; a situation that we expect will reverse itself in 2021.\nThis year, to rebalance the supply chain, we expect that our build rate will be lower than the rate at which Lockheed Martin is completing aircraft.\nWe now expect our F-35 revenues in 2021 to be more than $15 million lower than we recognized in 2020.\nWe see similar patterns in several smaller commercial programs across the segment where the revenue on those programs in 2021 will be close to $15 million lower than recognized in 2020.\nAll of these reductions will be offset by growth on other programs, most notably on the CH-53K.\nOverall for the Engineered Composites segment, we are providing initial guidance for net sales of $275 million to $295 million.\nTurning to the Engineered Composites segment profitability, 2020 was a strong year with adjusted EBITDA margins of over 26%, largely enabled by three factors: one, strong operating performance in the period as evidenced by about $10 million in net favorable adjustment to long-term contract profitability; two, a sales mix benefit as the majority of the revenue declined from 2019 to 2020 was on the ASC LEAP program, which is a lower than average profit margin; and 3, despite the decline in revenue, there was limited loss of fixed cost absorption as the cost-plus nature of the ASC LEAP program allowed us to still recover all of the fixed costs of operating our three ASC facilities.\nUnfortunately, those factors will not help us again in 2021.\nFirst, the lower revenue in 2021 at our non-ASC facilities, most notably our Salt Lake City operation where all of our 787 work and the bulk of our F-35 work is performed, will create upward pressure on plant overhead rates.\nWhile, as Bill mentioned, we have announced a workforce reduction of our Salt Lake City facility, that alone will not offset these rate pressures.\nIn such an environment, it will be difficult for us to achieve the lower unit production costs required to deliver significant improvements to long-term contract profitability.\nThis is a change from the past few years when a growing revenue base at our non-ASC facilities created a tailwind to long-term contract profitability.\nSecond, in 2021, we will see a product mix hit as a roughly $40 million to $50 million revenue decline we expect this year is on fixed price programs, which have a higher than average profit margin.\nAnd third, unlike 2020, we will suffer from a loss of fixed cost absorption due to the fixed price nature of the programs with declining revenues.\nAs a result, the decremental margins will be much larger than the average margins on those programs.\nIn fact, it is not atypical for our fixed price programs to have EBITDA contribution margins in the 30% to 40% range.\nAs a result of the impact of those three factors in 2021, not only do we expect the top line reduction I discussed earlier, but we also expect the EBITDA margins for the segment to fall from the 26.1% level delivered in 2020 into the low 20s.\nTherefore, we are providing initial 2021 guidance for Engineered Composites adjusted EBITDA of $55 million to $65 million.\nAt the total company level, we are providing initial 2021 guidance as follows: revenue of between $850 million and $890 million; effective income tax rate of 28% to 30%; depreciation and amortization of between $70 million and $75 million; capital expenditures in the range of $50 million to $60 million; GAAP and adjusted earnings per share of between $2.40 and $2.80; and adjusted EBITDA of between $195 million and $220 million.\nWhile we are not providing explicit cash flow guidance for 2021, we do expect that the free cash flow we generate in 2021 will be well above the roughly $100 million generated in 2020.\nI would also like to note that in 2021, we expect R&D expenses to be more than 25% higher than they were in 2020, reflecting the ongoing investments in both segments that Bill referenced earlier.\nReturning to the present, we are very pleased with how the company performed in 2020 overall.\nDespite the challenging operating environments, both segments met our customers' needs and delivered outstanding performance, all while maintaining a safe working environment.\nWhile it does appear that we have one more year of channel destocking ahead of us before we return to growth in the Engineered Composites segment, we remain very excited about the future prospects for both segments.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:See Slide 2 for more information on the calculation of these pro forma metrics.\nFor pro forma comparisons, current and prior periods include the results of recent acquisitions and the PA Consulting investment.\nWe are also providing pro forma net revenue comparisons adjusted to exclude the impact of the extra week in Q4 fiscal 2020.\nTurning to the agenda on Slide 3.\nSteve will begin by updating the progress we are making against our strategy and the future ESG at Jacobs.\nBob will then review our performance by line of business.\nAnd Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial results, followed by an update on our Focus 2023 and M&A initiatives as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow.\nWith that, I'll now pass it over to Steve Demetriou, Chair and CEO.\nTurning to Slide 4.\nBefore I review our results, I'd like to share that we're in the final stages of completing our new strategy.\nWe will be hosting an investor event, the week of March 7 for a deep dive of the next phase of our Jacobs transformation.\nThree key initiatives have emerged.\nFirst, we're putting in place a purpose-driven roadmap, rooted in our values and strong culture to maximize our next stage of growth.\nSecondly, we identified and have aligned investment resources to capture three multi-decade growth opportunities; global infrastructure modernization, climate response and the digitization of industry.\nAnd third, we're taking a transformational approach to executing against these opportunities as we are unlocking the innovation engine at Jacobs, expanding our technology ecosystem, while accelerating our trajectory of profitable growth and durable cash flow generation.\nWe look forward to eliminating this strategy at our upcoming investor event.\nNow turning to our financial results.\nI'm pleased with our strong fourth quarter and fiscal year performance with net revenue increasing 7% year-over-year.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 12% during the quarter and 18% for the full year.\nBacklog ended the fourth quarter up 12% year-over-year and up 7% on a pro forma basis.\nPA Consulting continued to post exceptional performance with 41% revenue growth.\nMore importantly, PA delivered this growth while maintaining adjusted operating profit margins of 24%.\nFor the full year, PA revenues surpassed $1 billion, far exceeding our deal investment model.\nAs we look at overall Jacobs growth going forward, we now have certainty surrounding the unprecedented U.S. Infrastructure funding with the passage of the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure and Jobs Act last week.\nAnd more broadly, global infrastructure modernization and national security needs are accelerating as our government and commercial clients address the challenges of climate change, advancement of the digitization strategies and increasing cyber threats.\nOn top of that, our advanced facilities business is expected to show significant growth, driven by the need for additional semiconductor manufacturing capacity and post-pandemic life Sciences priorities.\nGiven these strong growth dynamics, we're introducing fiscal 2022 guidance for double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth.\nLooking beyond 2022, we expect our strong organic growth to result in approximately $10 per share of adjusted earnings per share in fiscal year 2025.\nTurning to Slide 5.\nAs we reflect on climate change, it is globally accepted that humanity is at a critical juncture in our efforts to limit global warming.\nJacobs and PA participated at the recent UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties COP26 in Glasgow to demonstrate our commitment to reinvent tomorrow with immediate and sustained action in the transition to a net zero economy.\nWe stood alongside other business financial and government leaders as well as activists and students to make sure our voice was heard.\nWe engaged in activities to accelerate solutions to ensure the world stays on track to meet the critical 1.5 degree celsius trajectory, while preparing to adapt to the changes already locked in from climate change.\nAs we move to Slide 6, given the nature of our business, it's clear that Jacobs' greatest opportunity to positively address climate change comes from a sustainable and resilient solutions that we co-create and deliver in partnership with our clients.\nTo spearhead this effort, we have established a new office of global climate response in ESG to ensure that sustainability is woven into all of our solutions across markets and geographies.\nWe are accelerating our established partnerships with the public and private sector to advance net zero carbon outcomes, climate resilience, natural and social capital as well as ESG business transformation in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\nAnnually, we generate approximately $5 billion of ESG-related revenue and expect to grow significantly over the next several years driven by strong capability and energy transition, decarbonization, climate adaptation and natural resource stewardship.\nOur culture is a competitive differentiator.\nOur people have the knowledge, curiosity and the trust of our clients to achieve our purpose to create a more connected sustainable world.\nMoving on to Slide 7 to review Critical Mission Solutions.\nDuring the fourth quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance.\nTotal CMS backlog increased 16% year-over-year, 7% on a pro forma basis to $10.6 billion driven by a strategic new wins in cyber and intel and nuclear and remediation.\nOur CMS strategy is focused on creating recurring revenue growth and margin expansion by offering technology-enabled solutions aligned to critical national priorities.\nThree market trends that we see offering continued strong growth include, cyber, commercial space and 5G technology for national security.\nBeginning with cyber and intelligence, we are seeing several major emerging threats to national security.\nFirst, cyber attacks on mission critical infrastructure, which are even more stealth and as disruptive as a traditional attack.\nSecond, the speed and complexity of near-peer threats, which requires real-time coordination between space and other domains as a severity of nation state sponsored attacks continues to increase.\nAnd third, the adoption of a data-intensive AI-based applications are dramatically increasing the need for real-time data security and integrity.\nThe funding for addressing these threats are partially reflected in the unclassified federal government spending on cyber in FY '22, which is expected to be over $20 billion, up 10% from prior year.\nAdditionally, we expect to spending within classified budgets to be up higher.\nDuring the quarter, we are awarded a $300 million, seven year contract with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency to modernize the NGA's ability to rapidly gain and share insights from cross domain inventory, including top secret data classification.\nAnd within the classified budget, we were awarded $170 million five year new contract to develop highly secure and hardened software application that are leveraging the latest advances in AI and machine learning.\nWe recently closed the BlackLynx acquisition, which provides software-enabled solutions for automating the collection of data at the edge and quickly gaining insights into extremely large volumes of structured and unstructured data.\nOur strong presence across the DoD and intelligence community as well as our digital enablement center will provide the escape velocity for BlackLynx to commercialize and scale their solutions resulting in highly profitable recurring revenue.\nWe also recently announced a strategic investment and distribution agreement with HawkEye 360, which will enhance our digital intelligence suite of technologies with their RF, spectrum analytics and collection automation offering.\nMoving on to space.\nWith a significant amount of capital being infused into the commercial space companies, the affordability of space tourism is becoming a reality as well as other emerging opportunities such as acceleration of satellite-based technologies and the need to understand the impact of space debris.\nToday we support commercial space companies with manufacturing process optimization, system and subsystem prototype work and test facility studies and projects.\nAs commercial space matures, we are positioning our solutions for these emerging opportunities.\nDuring the quarter, we were notified of a significant increase to the ceiling of our contract in Marshall Space Flight Center that also supports Artemis and SLS.\nThe U.S. Space Force selected Jacobs for a five year contract to provide software and system support for its Patriot Excalibur system, which coordinates to scheduling, training and status of U.S. Space Force aircraft.\nFinally, our telecom business had a strong quarter.\nAnd we see the rollout of 5G investment from clients like AT&T, Verizon, DIRECTV, T-Mobile and Dish Network accelerating in 2022 and beyond.\nIn addition, the new Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill includes $2.5 billion for 5G rollout at U.S. military bases, and the DoD is investing heavily in 5G technology in support of national priorities.\nIn summary, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions in 2022.\nThe CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18 month qualified new business opportunities remaining above $30 billion, which includes $10 billion in source selection with an increasing margin profile.\nNow on to Slide 8, I'll discuss our People & Places Solutions business.\nWe finished the year with strong financial performance with the year-over-year backlog growth of 7% and annual net revenue growth.\nI'll discuss our results across the major themes of climate response, pandemic solutions, infrastructure modernization and digitization.\nStarting with climate response.\nAs the top-ranked global environmental consulting firm, Jacobs is leading the efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate emergency, advanced transition to a clean energy net zero economy and rapidly respond to natural disasters.\nThis quarter, Jacobs is awarded a multi-year contract by the U.S. Army's Engineer Research and Development Center to integrate nature-based solutions that grow climate resilience across defense department facilities.\nJacobs has recently been selected to reimagine New York's Rikers Island, taking the site through a full community revitalization with an equitable resilient multi-use approach incorporating our innovative social value analysis.\nAs the first phase in a 20-year program across the entire city, Jacobs' plan will consolidate four aging wastewater facilities into a state of the art 1 billion gallon per day water resource recovery facility that includes the renewable energy hub.\nIn the transportation market, our specialists have pioneered advanced charging technology that enables clients to transition to decarbonized operation, a key focus of economic stimulus packages.\nOur transit team continues to win contracts that support clients with assets, operational and technology shifts toward green fleets.\nFor example, we recently won and commenced a hydrogen rail facility study with Caltrans.\nAnd our long-term work with Brisbane Metro continues to showcase cutting-edge green transit solution.\nWith exponential growth forecasted in the electric vehicle market, Jacobs has become the go-to-firm to support leading EV battery and vehicle manufacturing companies globally.\nWe've doubled our EV book of business in the past year and are forecasting continued growth.\nWe also announced a strategic partnership and investment in Microgrid Labs, a provider of commercial fleet electrification and infrastructure solutions, including their proprietary SaaS platform.\nThe green economy transition is driving increased investments in hydrogen and renewables.\nAnd our team is delivering diverse solutions for a range of clients from our participation in the Bacton Energy Hub Consortium in the U.K. to energy transmission plans for a potential offshore wind development in the U.S. and additional contracts with Iberdrola's Renewables Avonlie Solar Farm and the Swanbank waste to energy facility in Australia.\nMoving on to the theme of pandemic response.\nWith ongoing impact to the supply chain, health systems and semiconductor chip shortage, Jacobs is gaining momentum with multi-year backlog across sectors with new wins in biopharma such as the next phase of a new $2 billion biotechnology facility.\nJacobs has successfully won several health opportunities in the U.S., Europe and Australia as they rethink pandemic response operations.\nThe most significant aspect of the global supply chain disruption involves semiconductor shortages.\nAs the world's leading technical services provider to the semiconductor industry, we are poised for significant growth in the electronic sector this year and expect our electronics business to further accelerate over the next several years.\nIn fact, Jacobs is engineering several major investments for large chip manufacturers.\nProjects like Intel's New Arizona Fab, which Jacobs is designing, are scheduled to be fully operational in 2024.\nThe new fab will manufacture Intel's most advanced process technology and represents the largest private investment in Arizona's history.\nInterconnected with climate response, pandemic solutions, infrastructure modernization and digital transformation are leading to long-term transformative growth with significant wins across all markets.\nGlobally, we are continuing to win pioneering transportation projects across all sectors and modes.\nIn highways, we were recently selected for transport for New South Wales along with consortium partners to undertake the $1.2 billion Warringah Freeway upgrade project to accommodate a third road crossing Sydney Harbour.\nIn Ports and Maritime, we won the sustainable ports design and program management for King Abdul Aziz Port in Dammam, Saudi Arabia.\nAnd in air transportation, we were selected as the integrated program manager for the Solidarity Transport Hub in Poland, a greenfield airport in multimodal, including a high-speed rail network with an initial planned capacity of 45 million passengers.\nThe program is of national significance.\nIt will become the benchmark for zero carbon delivery and be a sustainable transportation platform for Eastern Europe's future travel demand.\nOur long-standing relationships and existing framework agreements supported major wins with U.S. State Department of Transportation and Transport for London, emphasizing our market leading position for solving our clients' most complex transportation challenges.\nIn summary, we see continued investment across the P&PS client sectors.\nWe are already experiencing exciting global wins in the first quarter of our new fiscal year, indicating that we are well positioned to develop and deliver unmatched value and capability to our clients as investment momentum builds from the U.S. Infrastructure Act and other economic stimulus.\nTurning to PA Consulting on Slide 9.\nAs Steve mentioned, PA continues to exceed expectations, supported by an extension of consultative service to U.K.'s National Health Service, PA's efforts have extended into longer term vaccine deployment, testing trace and future pandemic preparedness planning.\nAdditionally, PA growth is being accentuated by recent digital solution wins for confidential U.S. biopharmaceutical clients in the areas of cell and gene therapy and next generation patient care model.\nWe continue to progress our synergy growth and long-term collaboration.\nThe Jacobs' PA team were recently awarded a biotechnology manufacturing plant expansion to provide an end-to-end lifecycle solution incorporating critical digitize clinical trial information into the process design and facility layout.\nAdditionally, we continue to receive Joint Strategic Consultancy award in the transportation sector globally.\nI look forward to our continued success with collaborative and integrated offerings to our customers.\nAt COP26, PA displayed its deep ESG expertise and successfully unveiled its innovative EV battery charging technology, ChargePoint.\nFurther, PA gained -- PA received industry recognition for their jointly developed COVID-19 awareness and situational intelligence tool with Unilever.\nThe business exceeded current expectation -- current expansion targets for the year and is well positioned for continued out-year growth.\nTurning to Slide 10 for a financial overview of fourth quarter results followed by our fiscal year review.\nAs we have previously communicated, our fiscal fourth quarter 2020 had 14 weeks compared to our normal 13-week quarters, which impacted our quarter year-over-year growth rate by 7% and our full year growth rate by 2%.\nFourth quarter gross revenue increased 2% year-over-year and net revenue was up 7%.\nIncluding the pro forma impact from all acquisitions and adjusting for the year ago extra week, net revenue was up 6% for the quarter.\nAdjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 27.2%, up 370 basis points year-over-year.\nConsistent with last year, the year-over-year increase in gross margin was driven by a favorable revenue mix in both People & Places, CMS as well as the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin profile of nearly 50%.\nWe will continue to focus on increasing gross margins as we bring to market higher value solutions for our clients.\nAdjusted G&A as a percentage of net revenue was up year-over-year to 17%.\nWithin G&A, during the quarter, we incurred an approximate $20 million or $0.12 per share charge to a legal settlement cost, which burdened both GAAP and our adjusted results.\nThis charge was related to a CH2M legacy matter, surrounding a previously completed product advisory arrangement.\nGAAP operating profit was $252 million and was mainly impacted by $46 million of amortization from acquired intangibles.\nAdjusted operating profit was $303 million, up 17%.\nOur adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10%, up 85 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis.\nGAAP earnings per share from continuing operations rounded to $0.34 per share and included $0.45 primarily related to the U.K. statutory tax rate changes and other tax-related items, $0.40 related to the final mark-to-market of the Worley stock and related FX impact, $0.23 of net impact related to amortization of acquired intangibles, $0.10 of transaction and other related costs and $0.06 from Focus 2023 and other restructuring costs.\nExcluding these items, fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.58, including the $0.12 burden from the previously discussed legal matter.\nDuring the quarter, PA's continued strong performance contributed $0.23 of accretion net of incremental interest.\nQ4 adjusted EBITDA was $310 million and was up 12% year-over-year, representing 10% of net revenue.\nFinally, turning to our bookings.\nDuring the quarter, our revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.3 times for Q4, positioning us well for the developing growth momentum we expect over the course of fiscal year '22.\nNow turning to a recap of our full year fiscal year 2021 on Slide 11.\nGross revenue increased 4% and net revenue was up 7%.\nIncluding the pro forma impact of all acquisitions and adjusting for the extra week in the year ago period, net revenue was up 3% for the full year.\nWe continue to enhance our portfolio to higher value solutions, which is evident as gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 26% for the year, up 235 basis points year-over-year.\nWe expect mid-single-digit reported revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 with an acceleration in the second half of our fiscal year driven by U.S. infrastructure spending and the ramp up of new awards in our CMS business.\nGAAP operating profit was $688 million and was mainly impacted by the $261 million of purchase price consideration for the PA Consulting investment and a $150 million of amortization of acquired intangibles.\nAdjusted operating profit was $1.188 billion, up 23% and represented 10% of net revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $1.244 billion was up 18% year-over-year to 10.6% of net revenue and just above the midpoint of our increased fiscal 2021 outlook.\nGAAP earnings per share was $3.12 and was impacted by $1.96 from the PA Consulting purchase price consideration and valuation allocation, $0.77 of amortization of acquired intangibles, $0.57 related to the U.K. statutory rate change and other U.K. related tax items, $0.35 of net charges related to Focus 2023, deal costs and restructuring and all of this being partially offset by a net positive $0.48 from the final sale of Worley and C3.\nExcluding all of these items, adjusted earnings per share was $6.29, also above the midpoint of our previously increased outlook.\nOf the $6.29, PA Consulting contributed $0.48 to that figure.\nBefore turning to LOB performance, I would like to highlight that we are currently working on a further optimization of our real estate footprint.\nAs a result, while we are still reviewing key components of the plan, we expect the potential non-cash impairment charge ranging from $60 million to $70 million in the first half of fiscal '22.\nOur new footprint will facilitate virtual work options that leverage new technology and more collaborative workspaces in our offices.\nStarting with CMS, Q4 2021 revenue was down 5% year-over-year, but when adjusting for the extra week in Q4 2020 was relatively flat on a pro forma basis.\nLet me remind you of the transitional dynamic impacting CMS revenue growth related to the transitioning off of two lower margin contracts.\nThis represented $175 million year-over-year revenue impact during the quarter.\nWhen excluding the contract roll-off and adjusting for the extra week a year ago, pro forma CMS revenue was up double-digits year-over-year.\nIn 2022 Q1, we expect to -- we continue to expect an approximate $210 million year-over-year impact from these two contract roll-offs, and this will phase out in Q2.\nAs a result, we expected report -- we expect reported revenue in the first quarter 2022 to be down slightly on a year-over-year basis with underlying growth being much stronger.\nWe expect the CMS growth trajectory to improve over the year, resulting in a reported mid-to-high single-digit full year 2022 growth rate.\nQ4 CMS operating profit was $115 million, up 7%.\nOperating profit margin was strong, up 100 basis points year-over-year to 9.1%.\nFor the full year, CMS operating profit was $447 million, up 20% with 8.8% operating profit margin.\nThe improvement for the quarter and the year in operating margin was driven by our strategy to focus on higher margin opportunities across the business.\nWe expect operating profit margin to remain in the mid-8% range through fiscal 2022.\nMoving to People & Places.\nQ4 net revenue was flat year-over-year.\nWhen factoring in the impact from the extra week, P&PS grew net revenue approximately 8% year-over-year for Q4 and was up 2% for the fiscal year 2021.\nIn Q4, total P&PS operating profit was down year-over-year driven by the $20 million legal settlement cost I described earlier.\nAdding back down legal settlement costs, operating profit growth would have been up 8% in Q4.\nFor the fiscal year, operating profit was up 5% or 8% excluding the legal settlement.\nIn terms of PA's performance, PA contributed $273 million in revenue and $66 million in operating profit for the quarter.\nQ4 revenue grew 41% and 32% year-over-year in sterling.\nQ4 adjusted operating profit margin was 24% in line with our expectations.\nOn a full year basis, PA Consulting grew revenue 33%, 24% in sterling with adjusted operating profit margin up 23%.\nOur non-allocated corporate costs were $55 million for the quarter and $190 million for the full year.\nThese costs were up year-over-year and in line with our expectation.\nThis -- the increase, excuse me, was driven primarily by the expected increases in medical costs and IT investments related to our new ways of working.\nIn fiscal 2022, we expect non-allocated corporate costs to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million given continued increases in medical costs and other investments.\nThese corporate costs as well as Focus 2023, CMS, P&PS investments will precede our expected acceleration in revenue growth and profit later in 2022.\nIn summary, these increased investments ahead of our growth will likely result in our Q1 profitability and earnings per share being relatively flat versus our Q4 results with Q2 then showing improvement and further acceleration occurring in the second half of the year.\nTurning to Slide 13 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we generated $176 million in reported free cash flow as DSO again showed strong improvement.\nThe quarter's cash flow included $22 million of cash related to restructuring, and other items was $16 million related to a real estate lease termination as we take advantage of virtual working.\nFor the year, free cash flow was $633 million, which was mainly impacted by the $261 million of PA purchase price consideration treated as post-closing compensation that we discussed last quarter.\nRegardless, our reported free cash flow represented 133% conversion against our reported net income.\nFor the full year 2022, we will again target an adjusted free cash flow conversion of at or above one-times.\nAs a result of our strong cash flow, we ended the quarter with cash of $1 billion and a gross debt of $2.9 billion, resulting in $1.9 billion of net debt.\nOur pro forma net debt to adjusted expected 2022 EBITDA is approximately 1.3 times, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet.\nDuring the quarter, we monetized our Worley stock for $370 million and executed a $250 million accelerated share repurchase program.\nWe will continue to monitor for any material dislocation in our share price given the strong long-term secular growth opportunities for our company.\nAnd finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased 11% earlier this year to $0.21 per share.\nWe are introducing our fiscal 2022 outlook for adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion, which at the midpoint represents double-digit growth.\nOur adjusted earnings per share outlook for fiscal 2022 is in the range of $6.85 to $7.45.\nWe expect a multi-year benefit from the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to support our growth in the second half of fiscal 2022.\nAs we look beyond this year, we see substantial opportunities for sustained organic growth driven by infrastructure monetization, climate response and digital transformation.\nWe anticipate approximately $10 of adjusted earnings per share through fiscal 2025.\nAt our in-person investor event in March, we'll further expand on our long-term strategy and financial model.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm joined today by Ron Tsoumas, our Chief Financial Officer.\nLet's begin with the business highlights on Slide 4.\nOur sales for the quarter were $288 million.\nExcluding favorable currency translation, our organic growth was up 45% from the prior year.\nHowever, it should be noted that our prior year first quarter was significantly impacted by the pandemic.\nIn this year's first quarter, our team faced customer demand fluctuations and supply chain challenges.\nThese included the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage, pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and port congestion, all of which created both sales and margin pressure.\nOnce again, our team worked diligently to mitigate many of these challenges and we were able to deliver results within our guidance ranges for the quarter.\nHowever, these demand fluctuations and supply chain disruptions continued to require remedial actions, such as expedited shipping and premium component pricing.\nAs of today, our expectation is that these conditions will last at least until the end of the calendar year.\nWhile we have reaffirmed our guidance for the full year, persistent headwinds could cause our performance to be below the midpoint of the ranges as the situation is very fluid and will remain very challenging.\nThe sales growth that we realized in the first quarter was due to increased demand across most of our businesses, but was especially focused on the auto and commercial vehicle markets.\nWe also realized growth in our Dabir business.\nHowever, that business is still being hampered by the pandemic, thus limiting our production or product evaluation opportunities in hospital operating rooms and ICUs.\nOn an order basis, we had solid awards for EV, cloud computing and e-bike applications.\nFocusing on EV, last quarter, we reported that sales into EV applications were 13% of consolidated sales.\nThis quarter, EV sales were 16% of consolidated sales and we continue to expect that number to be in the mid-teens for fiscal 2022.\nMethode's combination of user interface, LED lighting and power distribution solutions is a winning formula in EV.\nIn the quarter, we further reduced debt, generated positive operating cash flow and continued to return capital to our shareholders.\nWe have ample liquidity, which also allows us to execute our stock buyback program, under which we purchased $7.6 million of shares in the quarter, and to pay our dividend, which rose from $0.11 to $0.14 per share in the quarter.\nWe continued to allocate capital per our balanced approach.\nMoving to Slide 5.\nMethode had another solid quarter of business awards.\nThese awards continue to capitalize in key market trends like vehicle electrification and cloud computing.\nThe awards identified here represent some of the key businesses -- business wins in the quarter and represent over $30 million in annual business at full production.\nIn vehicle electrification, we won awards for power distribution and LED lighting programs.\nWe continue to win programs with OEMs globally in both auto and commercial vehicle applications.\nIn non-EV automotive, we were awarded programs for power, lighting and traditional switch applications.\nIn cloud computing, we saw demand for our power distribution and transceiver products and data center applications.\nLastly, we continue to participate in the growth of e-bikes, which utilizes our proprietary magneto elastic sensor technology.\nBuilding on the prior year, our business awards are delivering on our strategic priority to drive both customer and geographic diversity.\nTurning to Slide 6.\nAs I've mentioned in recent quarters, our business awards over the last couple of years have put us on track in aggregate to replace the sales from the roll off of our largest auto program.\nAs such our customer and program diversity continues to improve.\nOur EV, as well as our commercial vehicle and cloud computing businesses have helped drive our customer diversification.\nWhile GM and Ford have been and are expected to continue to be good customers that have fueled Methode's historical growth, in recent years, we have strategically and systematically broaden our customer base.\nOur business outside of GM and Ford grew to two-thirds of our fiscal 2021 total sales.\nTo conclude, despite the ongoing demand fluctuations and supply chain challenges, we are still in a position to deliver strong organic growth for fiscal 2022.\nFirst quarter sales were $287.8 million in fiscal year '22 compared to $190.9 million in fiscal year '21, an increase of $96.9 million or 50.8%.\nThe year-over-year quarterly comparisons include a favorable foreign currency impact on sales of $10.3 million in the current quarter.\nThe increase was mainly due to lower sales in the prior year quarter from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to higher sales of electric and hybrid electric vehicles, which amounted to 16% of sales in the first quarter of fiscal year '22, which was in line with our previous communication that electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicle sales would comprise mid teens of our fiscal year '22 consolidated sales.\nIn addition, stronger commercial vehicle sales contributed to the robust sales growth.\nFirst quarter net income increased $8.4 million to $29.1 million or $0.76 per share diluted from $20.7 million or $0.54 per diluted share in the same period last year.\nNet income benefited from increased sales and favorable currency translation, partially offset by higher income tax expense, higher costs from supply chain disruption, higher selling and administrative expenses and lower other income.\nFirst quarter gross margins were higher in fiscal year '22 as compared to fiscal year '21, mainly due to increased sales, partially offset by higher material costs, higher logistic costs, including freight and supply chain shortages.\nFiscal year '22 first quarter margins were 24.9% as compared to 23.6% in the first quarter of fiscal year '21.\nThe negative impact of the supply disruption and higher logistics costs, including freight, on the first quarter of fiscal year '22 gross margin was nearly 300 basis points.\nThese higher costs that were experienced in the first quarter are expected to continue further in fiscal year '22.\nIn addition, we anticipate a degree of cost inflation in the remainder of the current fiscal year.\nFirst quarter selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 11.4% compared to 13.9% in the fiscal '21 first quarter.\nThe fiscal year '22 first quarter percentage decrease was attributable to increased sales related to the negative impact of COVID-19 pandemic on fiscal '21 sales, partially offset by higher stock-based and performance-based compensation expenses.\nThe first quarter of fiscal year '22 selling and administrative expenses percentage was in line with our historical norm, which should yield an efficient flow-through from gross margin to operating income.\nIn addition to the gross margin and selling and administrative items mentioned above, two other non-operational items significantly impacted net income in the first quarter of fiscal year '22 as compared to the comparable quarter last fiscal year.\nFirst, income tax expense in the first quarter of fiscal year '22 was $5.7 million or 16.4% as compared to a net tax benefit of $5.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal year '21.\nThe effective tax rate was lower in the first quarter of fiscal year '21 due to discrete tax benefits of $7.8 million in the quarter or $0.20 per diluted share.\nWithout the discrete tax benefits, the effective rate would have been 17.2%.\nThe year-over-year tax expense increase was $10.8 million.\nSecond, other income net was lower by $1.6 million, mainly due to lower international government assistance between the comparable quarters.\nShifting to EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure.\nFiscal year '22 first quarter EBITDA was $48.5 million versus $29.3 million in the same period last fiscal year.\nEBITDA was positively impacted by higher operating income, partially offset by lower other income.\nFree cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net cash provided from operating activities minus capex.\nFor fiscal year '22 first quarter free cash flow was a negative $6.2 million as compared to a positive $4.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal year '21.\nThe decrease was mainly due to negative working capital changes, especially inventory, resulting from difficult logistics and higher capital expenditures.\nWhile we experienced negative free cash flow in the first quarter of fiscal year '22, we expect improvement the remainder of the fiscal year.\nWe anticipate continuing our proven history of consistently generating reliable cash flows, which allow for ample funding of future organic growth, inorganic growth and return of capital to shareholders.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year '22, we invested approximately $15.9 million in capex as compared to $11.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal year '21.\nThe higher first quarter capex is in line with our expectation that capex in fiscal year '22 would be higher than the investment in the prior year estimated to be in the range of $53 million to $57 million.\nWe have a strong balance sheet and we'll continue utilizing it by continuing investment in our businesses to grow them organically in the future.\nIn addition, we continue to actively pursue opportunities for inorganic growth and have a measured return of capital to the shareholders.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year '22, we reduced gross debt by $4.7 million.\nSince our acquisition of Grakon in September 2018, we reduced gross debt by nearly $123 million.\nRegarding capital allocation, we recently announced two initiatives.\nFirst, on March 31st, we announced the $100 million share repurchase program, which we executed $7.6 million of repurchases during the first quarter of fiscal year '22.\nSince the authorization's approval, we have purchased $15.1 million worth of shares at an average price of $46.45.\nIn addition, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.11 to $0.14 per quarterly share, an increase of 27%.\nWe ended the first quarter with $207.9 million in cash.\nAs Don mentioned in his remarks, we reaffirmed our previously issued guidance and earnings per share annual guidance.\nExternal events and their related potential impact on our financial results remain an ongoing challenge.\nWhile we have reaffirmed our guidance for the full year, persistent headwinds could cause our performance to be below the midpoint of the ranges as the situation is fluid and will likely remain very challenging.\nThe revenue range for the full fiscal year '22 is between $1.175 billion to $1.235 billion.\nDiluted earnings per share range is between $3.35 to $3.75 per share.\nThe range is due to the uncertainty from the supply chain disruption for semiconductors and other materials on both Methode and its customers.\nFrom a sales perspective, lower sales could result from the supply disruption to us and/or our customers, which could result in lesser demand for our products or our ability to meet customer demand.\nContinued supply chain disruption would also negatively impact gross margins due to additional costs incurred from premium freight, factory inefficiencies and, to a lesser extent, tariffs and other logistic factors, including port congestion.\nHigher costs for materials, freight and labor are a constant and dynamic battle, and we are uncertain as to when things will stabilize.\nDon, that concludes my comments.\nKen, I believe we're ready to take questions.\nSummary: ",

call.\nWe ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.\nDuring the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures related to the company's performance.\nAnd now Kevin Blair will provide an overview of the quarter.\nOur team delivered another solid quarter with growth in revenue and earning assets while maintaining an expense discipline that resulted in year over year quarterly expenses declining 5%.\nAdditionally, we continue to see an improving credit outlook that produced a release in allowance.\nFinally, we continue to successfully deliver on our Synovus Forward initiatives and investments with the $75 million in pre-tax run rate benefit achieved through the second quarter and an additional $100 million in pre-tax run rate benefits to come by year-end 2022.\nBefore I proceed, let me take a second to remind you of our performance to date as it compared to our expectations at the beginning of the year.\nWe shared with you that we would deliver loan growth, excluding PPP and ramp it up in the second half of the year.\nWe also said we would improve the deposit mix and lower our cost of funds to stabilize the margin.\nAlso, we would drive efficiency initiatives that will assist in returning to positive operating leverage while continuing to manage effectively through the uncertain credit environment and produce the planned benefits from Synovus Forward.\nI'm pleased to share with you today that we are delivering on those objectives, and we concluded the first half of 2021 with considerable momentum and are optimistic about the prospects for growth and expansion moving forward.\nOur commercial loan pipelines are back to pre-pandemic levels with continued growth in C&I outstandings and commitments and line utilization actually increased slightly during the quarter.\nClient liquidity remains strong, which has allowed us to further optimize our deposit mix and reduce our cost of funds again this quarter.\nWe expect this trend to continue in this low rate environment.\nOur Wealth and Treasury and Payment Solutions businesses are performing at a high level.\nContinued growth and operating margin expansion in these fee income-generating business units will help to offset the industrywide reduction in mortgage activity.\nCriticized and classified loans declined for the quarter, another proof point that the elevated credit concerns raised by the pandemic continue to abate and signal the opportunity to continue to move the allowance over time back down toward day one CECL levels.\nAnd during the first half of the year, we continued to invest in the future of Synovus.\nKey priorities to enhance the customer experience and deliver new sources of growth.\nA couple of examples of this include: our Treasury and Payment Solutions business launched a new suite of integrated receivable solutions called Synovus Accelerate AR.\nThis solution has been well received, and the sales pipeline has already begun to fill which will create a new source of revenue while significantly benefiting our customers by saving them time and money.\nWe also have migrated approximately 25,000 business clients to Synovus Gateway, our new digital platform for business and commercial banking.\nWith expanded functionality and capabilities, we are making it easier for our customers to do business and promoting higher levels of business retention.\nLastly, our smart analytics tool, which we've shared previously, has been further rolled out across our bankers and our markets, and is beginning to have an impact on increasing pipelines and opportunities to expand the share of wallet from our customers.\nWe are also reminded during the second quarter that our focus on delivering a personalized and value-added customer experience matters and will continue to provide a foundation for future growth.\nIndustrywide consumer satisfaction surveys, again show that our clients are more satisfied and loyal than those of our competitors.\nAnd we also received two awards of excellence for our family office during the quarter.\nThese scores and accolades are not success in and of themselves, but rather affirmation that our efforts and our approaches are having meaningful impacts for our customers.\nFor all of these reasons, as well as the vibrant economic expansion that we expect to continue in the Southeast, we remain confident in our path forward.\nMoving to Slide 3, which includes our financial highlights for the quarter.\nTotal adjusted revenue of $489 million, adjusted expenses of $268 million and a $25 million reversal of provision for credit losses resulted in adjusted net income of $179 million or $1.20 diluted earnings per share.\nWithout adjustments, net income was $178 million or $1.19 diluted earnings per share.\nPretax run rate benefits from Synovus Forward of $75 million have increased by $25 million from the first-quarter results.\nOur work on completed and future initiatives continues to give us confidence in our ability to achieve an aggregate pre-tax run rate benefit of $100 million by year-end 2021 and $175 million by the end of '22.\nTotal loans, excluding P3 loans, were up $194 million in the second quarter.\nGrowth in the quarter was delivered in our core C&I portfolio, as well as third-party consumer lending, given the continued high liquidity environment.\nDespite solid production levels, elevated prepayment activity remains a headwind in our commercial and consumer real estate portfolios.\nCore transaction deposits increased $702 million or 2%, led by core noninterest-bearing deposits growth of $601 million or 4%.\nWith the current loan-to-deposit ratio, we continue to remix the deposit base strategically reducing higher cost categories, including CDs and broker deposits.\nKey credit metrics were stable with the NPA ratio declining by 4 basis points to 46 basis points, and the ACL coverage remains strong.\nA more favorable economic outlook and a 14% reduction in criticized and classified loans supported further allowance releases.\nThe ACL ratio, excluding P3 loans, declined 15 basis points to 1.54%.\nWe remain well capitalized with the CET1 ratio increasing to 9.8%, while completing nearly half of our $200 million share authorization in the quarter.\nWe also executed on additional earning asset growth activities to monetize excess liquidity while keeping capital above our operating target.\nAs shown on Slide 4, we ended the quarter with earning assets of $51 billion.\nTotal loans declined $569 million, led by P3 balance declines of $763 million.\nWhile gross production levels continue to improve, the liquidity environment continues to result in downward pressure on loan demand.\nWhile our customers are utilizing less of their line commitments, we are continuing to grow overall commitments to new client relationships and deeper existing relationships.\nThe annualized growth rate and total commitments over the past two years is more than 3% compared to an annualized increase in funded loan balances of approximately 1%.\nA material portion of that growth will translate into funded balances once C&I line utilization begins to normalize closer to the long-term average of 46 to 47%.\nBased on market intelligence and conversations with our clients, we believe increases in line utilization will occur later in the cycle as client liquidity subsides.\nOur base assumption included in our loan growth guidance is that line utilization will remain near current levels through year-end.\nWhile commitment growth will support longer-term loan growth, our confidence in the forecast for the near term is based on continued strong production, growth in the commercial loan pipeline and our expectation that the elevated level of payoffs and paydowns will abate.\nAnother factor that gives us confidence in loan growth is more recent monthly data.\nIn June, total loans, excluding changes in P3 balances grew by approximately $200 million.\nIn the second quarter, further declines in consumer mortgage and HELOC portfolios of $98 million and $74 million, respectively, continued to be impacted by accelerated prepayment activity and excess liquidity.\nCRE loan declines of $173 million this quarter largely resulted from accelerated payoffs as many owners are selling with the expectation that capital gains taxes will increase in 2022.\nC&I balances, excluding changes in P3, increased $220 million with $469 million in commitment growth while C&I line utilization remained near historic lows.\nAs a reminder, a normalization in C&I line utilization would result in more than $700 million in funded balances.\nWe had approximately $150 million in fundings of round two P3 loans, net of unearned fees, which partially offset forgiveness of $927 million.\nTotal P3 balances ended the quarter at $1.6 billion.\nThere's more detail related to P3 loan activity in the appendix.\nLastly, as a function of this liquidity environment, we increased the securities portfolio about $616 million and third-party consumer portfolio about $273 million.\nThe risk profile of asset acquisitions was largely consistent with those completed in the first quarter with emphasis in mortgage-backed securities and secured third-party consumer loans.\nInvestment securities accounted for 17% of total assets at the end of the quarter and could increase further as we look for opportunistic deployments of liquidity in the second half of 2021.\nAs shown on Slide 5, we continue to grow core transaction deposits, which increased $702 million, or 2% from the prior quarter.\nThis was led by core noninterest-bearing deposit growth of $601 million or 4%, which offset strategic declines in higher cost deposits.\nWe continue to have success reducing our total deposit costs in the second quarter with a reduction of 6 basis points from 22 basis points to 16 basis points.\nThis was driven by a combination of deposit mix optimization with a continued focus on strategic reductions in high-cost time deposits, as well as a reduction in the expense associated with interest-bearing deposits.\nWhile the pace of CD maturities will slow significantly, there are opportunities to further improve the deposit mix and reduce rates paid on other interest-bearing deposits as we progress through the second half of 2021.\nFor the month of June, total deposit costs were 15 basis points, and we expect further reductions in total deposit costs this year.\nSlide 6 shows net interest income of $382 million, an increase of $8 million from the prior quarter.\nNII increased as benefits from asset growth, reduced deposit costs and day count more than offset the reduction in P3 fee income.\nThe net interest margin of 3.02%, a decline of 2 basis points was primarily impacted by P3 forgiveness as P3 fee accretion decreased $5 million from the prior quarter.\nOther dynamics are similar to recent quarters as the headwind from asset repricing is being offset by further reductions in liability costs.\nAs expected, slower prepayment activity in the latter part of the quarter helped to improve the yield on the securities portfolio, supporting both margin and NII.\nBased on current mortgage trends, we'd expect modest further improvement in that yield in the third quarter as the impact of a full quarter of more normalized prepay activity is realized.\nDeceleration of prepayment activity resulted in a $3 million reduction of premium amortization in the second quarter, down from $20 million in the first quarter.\nIn terms of asset sensitivity, we remain positively exposed to potential increases in interest rates.\nThat dynamic continues to be supported by the aforementioned shifts in our balance sheet, including funding mix, with the estimated exposure being split between both short-term and long-term rates.\nAs of June 30th, our loan portfolio is 54% variable and approximately 30% of those variable rate loans have floors at or above short-term index rates of 25 basis points.\nBased on current market conditions and our expectations for loan growth, we reiterate our expectation that quarterly net interest income, excluding P3 fee accretion, should increase in the second half of the year driven by loan growth, deployment of liquidity, a deceleration of prepayments and further deposit cost reductions.\nUsing the quarter-end forward curve and absent rate hikes, we expect a NIM of approximately 3%, excluding the impact of P3, with headwinds from the lapse of P3 fee accretion being offset by the continued deployment of excess liquidity and with notable upside coming from increases in either short-term or long-term interest rates.\nAs we've shared previously, we estimate NIM dilution of approximately 6 basis points per $1 billion of excess cash on deposit at the Federal Reserve.\nSlide 7 shows a total adjusted noninterest revenue of $106 million, down $6 million from the previous quarter.\nEmbedded in the continued strength in fee revenue is diversified growth across our fee revenue sources, partially offsetting the continued normalization of the mortgage business from all-time high levels of production.\nCore banking fees were $41 million, up $3 million.\nIncreases were broad-based, led by $1 million increases in account analysis fees that benefit from our treasury and payment solutions team and our recently in-sourced merchant business.\nNSF, or overdraft fees, which have received a lot of attention throughout the industry, were flat at $6 million, accounting for less than 6% of noninterest revenue and 1.3% of total revenues.\nNet mortgage revenue declined $8 million in the second quarter to $14 million due to reductions in secondary production and gain on sale.\nThis remains above pre-pandemic levels, and we expect continued normalization in the second half of 2021.\nIncreases in fiduciary revenues of $3 million helped offset decreases in other areas, including capital markets income.\nAssets under management grew 3% in the quarter and 28% from the previous year.\nThe build-out of wealth management and other fiduciary services, particularly in South Florida, will continue to provide meaningful growth opportunities.\nTotal noninterest expense of $271 million is highlighted on Slide 8.\nAdjusted noninterest expense was $268 million up $2 million from the prior quarter and down $6 million from the prior year.\nAdjusted items include the impact of an earn-out liability, nonqualified deferred compensation and restructuring fees primarily related to branch closures.\nEmployment expense of $159 million was down $1 million from the prior quarter as seasonal decreases in payroll taxes was partially offset by an increase in pay days, as well as commissions and other variable compensation.\nExpenses of $42 million associated with occupancy, equipment and software increased $1 million from the previous quarter, largely due to an increase in the repairs and maintenance.\nAs Kevin will touch on later, we continue to evaluate and optimize our branch and non-branch real estate for additional efficiency opportunities.\nOther expenses of $67 million were up $3 million primarily due to the $4 million increase in third-party processing fees associated with the expenses from additional P3 forgiveness and third-party consumer loans.\nOur commitment to prudent expense management and profitable growth allows us to continue to invest in strategically compelling high-return growth vectors.\nWe have reduced our head count 6% year over year, approximately 85% of which was on the support side.\nThis reduction in headcount is a key priority in our expense management efforts, However, there are some offsetting costs as we promote team members who are taking on more responsibility and continue to hire customer-facing team members.\nOur expectations for expenses and benefits from Synovus Forward remain unchanged.\nSlide 9 highlights stable credit metrics, which remain near historical lows.\nWe continue to see improvement in the overall economic outlook, which is reflected in the reversal of provision for credit losses of $25 million and a 14% reduction in criticized and classified loans.\nSupport for the ratings improvements comes from client conversations and cash inflows.\nAs shown in the appendix, cash inflows from March to May are each up more than 10% compared to the same period from 2019, which we use as a pre-pandemic baseline.\nThe annualized net charge-off ratio for the quarter was 0.28%.\nWe expect net charge-offs to remain relatively stable in the second half of the 2021, assuming no material change in the economic outlook.\nDuring the second quarter, the NPA ratio declined 4 basis points to 46 basis points.\nCriticized and classified loans fell 14%, and we expect further reductions as we progress through the rest of the year.\nThe ACL ratio of 1.54%, excluding P3 loans, was down 15 basis points from the prior quarter and 27 basis points from the end of the year.\nWe continue to use a multi-scenario framework in our CECL modeling and a sign of 40% weighting to adverse scenarios, 55% weighting to the base scenario and 5% weighting to an upside scenario.\nAs noted on Slide 10, the CET1 ratio increased 1 basis point to 9.75% as a result of strong performance.\nThe building capital was deployed via risk-weighted asset growth, share repurchases and our common equity dividend.\nIn the second quarter, we repurchased $92 million of the $200 million share repurchase authorization in place for 2021, which resulted in a 1.3% reduction of average diluted outstanding shares.\nWe have completed approximately $15 million of additional repurchase activity in July.\nBased on current conditions and economic outlook, we expect to complete the full authorization in the second half of the year.\nWe will continue to opportunistically deploy capital on our balance sheet and to our shareholders as we remain above our 9.5% operating target for CET1.\nWe remain well positioned to complete our key strategic objectives including profitable growth with the highest priority being multi-solution relationships.\nAt the beginning of 2020, we laid out our Synovus Forward plan to deliver significant upside in earnings power through a set of strategic actions to enhance our efficiency and accelerate top line growth.\nThe Synovus Forward initiatives are aligned with our strategy of building a high-growth, low-risk, nimble bank that can continue to take market share in our attractive southeastern markets.\nAs I highlighted earlier, throughout the second quarter, we have continued to add to our Synovus Forward pre-tax run rate benefits, now totaling approximately $75 million.\nAs you can see on Slide 11, we have delivered these results through a combination of expense and revenue initiatives.\nBased upon our progress to date, as well as the ongoing plan and execution, we remain confident in achieving the 2021 and 2022 milestones of $100 million and $175 million, respectively.\nSuccess to date on the expense front has largely come from three primary areas: a reduction in third-party spend, a decrease in head count, as well as branch and corporate real estate consolidation.\nApproximately $50 million of the $75 million pre-tax run rate benefit we have achieved by the end of the quarter relates to these specific efficiency initiatives.\nWe have plans to increase the savings in each of these categories, but also are adding new initiatives and areas of focus to achieve an incremental 30 to $40 million in pre-tax benefits by the end of 2022.\nAdditional third-party savings, workforce optimization, a reduction in branch and non-branch square footage, process automation and additional tax strategies will all contribute to drive future efficiencies.\nWe have also had success to date on the revenue side of Synovus Forward with $25 million in pre-tax run rate benefits.\nThe Treasury and Payment Solutions pricing-for-value initiative has resulted in annualized pre-tax run rate benefits of approximately $12 million in the second quarter.\nThe realization of a broad-based increase in pricing has been supported by the competitive landscape, enhancements to our products and services and a commitment to providing proactive needs-based advice.\nIn addition, with the deployment of a new pricing tool and the continued low rate environment, we have also been able to reduce our cost of funds to levels lower than was originally expected, and we now have a more robust capability and tool to better manage customer rate elasticity as we move into a higher rate environment in the future.\nAdditional areas where we have seen incremental revenue include the in-sourcing of our merchant business, and expansion of our merchant sponsorship business and expanded solutions such as trade finance and international payment and currency capabilities.\nAs we turn to future plans and initiatives, the 60 to $70 million in expected pre-tax revenue benefits will largely be accomplished through analytics, new products and solutions, balance sheet management strategies, as well as ongoing talent and specialty team expansion.\nAs it relates to analytics, we continue to make progress on our aforementioned commercial analytics pilot, which we refer to as the SMART tool.\nThe feedback and utilization thus far are encouraging as our bankers are working to actionable leads and insights that are now translating into new sales and overall expansion of the share of wallet of our existing clients.\nWe will continue to pilot in the third quarter with a companywide rollout in the fourth.\nIn addition, we have begun to develop our retail analytics program, which will also have a meaningful impact in our ability to deepen the share of wallet of our consumer and wealth customers while reducing the overall levels of attrition.\nWe are expanding our premium finance and specialty lending businesses, adding strong new teams and highly attractive specialized verticals, as well as launching targeted, innovative products and capabilities to serve as new sources of revenue growth.\nAs I have noted in the past, Synovus Forward is a constant improvement mindset, not just a collection of initiatives.\nI am pleased with our team members focused on the art of possible as we continue to innovate and find new ways to become more efficient and drive new sources of revenue.\nAnd I would be remiss if I didn't end this slide with an update on technology in general.\nWe clearly feel that our competitive advantage will come from our high-touch approach, complementing our high-tech investments and partnerships.\nWe continue to make progress in enhancing both the consumer and the commercial client digital experience.\nWe are partnering with the right fintechs to build and deliver new products and solutions, and we have a road map to move to a modern core over time in a segmented and controlled fashion.\nWe will continue to focus on ways to increase online origination capabilities and evaluate new technological opportunities, especially in the payment and banking as a service areas.\nMoving to Slide 12.\nThis includes our 2021 outlook, which have a few key changes.\nWith the first half of the year behind us and greater certainty in the economic outlook, we'd like to provide some updates and additional clarity.\nI'll begin with loan growth.\nWe still expect to be within our 2 to 4% loan growth guidance excluding P3 loans, and third-party consumer loans.\nHowever, we think it's likely that we're at the low end of this range due primarily to the elevated prepayment activity that we have seen to date that was not anticipated at the beginning of the year.\nThis assumes line utilization remains at current low levels and prepayment activity returns to a more normalized level.\nAs a reminder, we do not include third-party consumer loans in this guidance.\nThis asset class represents $1.5 billion in period-end balances, up $776 million in 2021.\nPre-pandemic, this portfolio was approximately $2 billion in held for investment outstandings.\nOver the past five-plus years, we have had a successful track record with originating and managing these credits providing incremental revenue and solid returns.\nWe will continue to employ this strategy as long as the excess liquidity environment persists, as well as the relative returns of future purchases are constructive.\nWe're raising our expectation for total adjusted revenue and total adjusted expense.\nAs a reminder, it's appropriate to consider these together because areas that are providing additional revenue, including mortgage production and higher third-party consumer balances have associated expenses related to them, and these examples commission and servicing expense.\nAnd while we remain committed to taking advantage of growth opportunities in the Southeast.\nWe also remain committed to achieving positive operating leverage, and that is one of our top priorities for 2021.\nWe are not incorporating any significant change in interest rates as part of the updated guidance.\nAlthough it's important to note the increased asset sensitivity Jamie referenced earlier, as any increase in rate will provide a meaningful tailwind to NII.\nOur capital management target now includes a CET1 ratio greater or equal to 9.5% target.\nA continuation of strong operating performance and a stable economic outlook is likely to result in a CET1 ratio above 9.5%, even after completing the entire $200 million share repurchase authorization for the current year.\nAdditional focus and execution related to various tax strategies are expected to result in an effective tax rate of 22 to 24%.\nYear-to-date, the ETR is 22% or 23% before discrete items.\nThe actions we've mentioned throughout today's call further position us for success in the second half of the year but also long-term success.\nIt's important to note that the efforts and continued investment in Synovus strengthens our currency and provides opportunities for strategic growth, both organic and inorganic.\nWe're looking forward to the second half of 2021, and I feel an increased level of excitement from our entire team as we roll out our future of work operating environment this quarter.\nOur balance sheet is well positioned for growth with strong capital and liquidity.\nOur team members are delivering, and they're very passionate about winning.\nAnd our pipeline show that clients are poised to grow their business with Synovus as their partner.\nSummary: ",

Diebold Nixdorf.\nI would encourage investors to review the shareholder letter as it contains additional information regarding the progress of the company.\nWe also made an announcement today regarding our upcoming CEO transition.\nIn a moment, we will share remarks from Gerrard Schmid, president and chief executive officer, as well as Octavio Marquez, who will be succeeding Gerard as Diebold Nixdorf next CEO.\nIn this message, Gerard will provide commentary on the business environment, our accomplishments in 2021 and then introduce Octavio.\nFinally, Jeff Rutherford, chief financial officer, will discuss the company's financial performance, including highlights from the quarter and year, along with our guidance for 2022.\nThen take your question.\nAdditional information on these factors can be found in the company's periodic and annual filings with the SEC.\nParticipants should be mindful that subsequent events may render this information to be out of date.\nAnd now, I'll hand the call over to Gerrard.\nIt's a pleasure to speak with you today.\nIn 2021, we faced unprecedented challenges brought on by the second year of the pandemic.\nI'm pleased to report that in the fourth quarter, we delivered on our objectives.\nI work over the last few months of 2021.\nWas painstaking and meticulous, requiring us to look at every area of opportunity.\nfrom logistics and supply chain, to prepayments, and payables.\nWhat seemed impossible to those outside our company was in fact possible.\nAnd we've once again shown that we're resilient and strong.\nWhile supply chain and logistics challenges were two of the bigger themes in 2021, it is still noteworthy to share that in 2021, we shipped more ATMs, more self-checkout devices, and more point-of-sale devices than we did in 2020.\nA testament to the resilience of our model.\nWhile the pandemic has disrupted our world, and caused us to rethink what the future might look like, we have time and again in our ability to build an agile company that challenges the status quo, and goes the extra mile to execute well.\nThe environment we've been in for nearly two years has brought to the forefront the rapidly changing demands of consumers, and the need for self-service solutions wherever possible.\nWe are well-positioned to offer these solutions plus growth opportunities for our customers whether at a bank, the grocery store, or retailer.\nTo help them deliver more digital, flexible, and effective consumer journeys.\nIn retail, the evolution of consumer behavior, along with the rapidly changing labor dynamics, have led to increased demand for self-service and automation, and growth has been driven by customer momentum for a self-service solutions.\nIn 2021, we saw growth above market rates in Europe for a self-service hardware, services, and software.\nWe also continue to make inroads into other markets, such as the United States, and Australia.\nIn banking, we continue to see strength in demand for cash recyclers as banks rethink their branch footprint, and move more toward automation, and efficiency around their real estate.\nAs I share with large U.S. customers has increased.\nIn 2021, our America's order levels were 16% higher than 2020, and 17% higher than pre-pandemic levels in 2019.\nfinancial institution to deploy DN series cash recyclers.\nLet me now turn to highlights our world class services organization.\nWe, as well as our customers, consider this to be one of our best assets, and in many cases, it is a major contributor to DN winning new business, and expanding our current relationships.\nIt also provides opportunities for new horizontals like electric vehicle, or EV charging stations, which I will comment on later.\nIn 2021, we continue our journey of delivering superior service by reaching a milestone with connected devices for our all connected data engine.\nWith approximately 150,000 banking self-service devices connected to the solution, which represents approximately 122% year-on-year growth in connected devices.\nOur ancient languages, real time internet-of-things capability to support our predictive maintenance offering, which has been reducing customer downtime significantly.\nEqually, in retail, we continue to deliver value and services to our customers.\nI would be remiss to not mention an ongoing success story.\nWe achieved with one of our key customers, a major UK based retailer.\nThis customer relies on us for flawless execution and service excellence, and has over 25,000 checkout lanes.\nI'm pleased to report that this past year we delivered a 100% availability of point-of-sale, and self-checkouts states on a two most demanding shopping days of the year.\nWe help this retailer improve their end-customer satisfaction with a shorter queues, shorter wait times by increasing their sales for this period, year-over-year.\nThis is now the 10th consecutive year that we have achieved this performance goal.\nAnd a testament to our services capability.\nWe also implemented this program with another large European retailer with the same success proving this is a repeatable model for retailers.\nWe believe delivering or exceeding the service expectations of our customers is one of the best foundations for putting additional technology into the field.\nAnd both of these retailers placed additional self-checkout orders with us in December.\nWe were glad to see the trust that retailers have in us to continue to deliver quality services to them and their customers.\nFurther, augmenting our strength in services, I'd like to comment briefly now about the strides he made in the fourth quarter into EV charging stations, especially in Europe.\nToday EV charging value chain is fragmented, multiple players, including start-ups, mid-sized companies, and large electronics conglomerates are competing in the space.\nAdditionally, there are multiple roles along the value chain that are inconsistent.\nThis is a large and growing market with significant demand.\nBy 2026, the number of public EV charging stations in Europe, and the United States will be greater than the number of ATM devices.\nBut more EV drivers, especially in Europe, where there are less likely to have home charging opportunities, and rental and fleet cars, and public transportation, moving to more electric vehicles, there will be a need for more public charging stations.\nCurrently, there are over 40 relevant [Inaudible] or chargepoint operators globally, and we are working on in talks with many of them.\nOur global service capability, including our technicians, and our skills in global spare parts, logistics management and multilingual help desks have resonated with several market participants that lack access to these skills as they look to scale their own businesses As of Q4 2021, we are contracted for several thousand charging stations in Europe and the US with a short term pipeline of three times the size of our current base.\nThe team has set a target to service over 30,000 charging stations by the end of 2022.\nOne notable recent win that I would like to pull out is with Compleo, one of the leading full service providers with charging technology in Europe.\nWho is this partnership deal will provide a full range of managed services for initially over 1,000 of Compleos DC fast charging stations in public locations across Germany with the potential for expansion.\nLastly, as you know, diversity and sustainability have been an important focus for us as a company.\nI'm proud to note that in 2021, females accounted for over 60% of our senior hires, at the vice president and above level.\nAnd we made important strides environmentally, reducing our scope one and two carbon emissions by $0.06.\nOur shareholder letter detailed further accomplishments on this front.\nAnd I want to emphasize how grateful I am to our teams for their work and dedication in this important area.\nOver the past four years, we have undertaken a comprehensive restructuring and transformation effort.\nThe company has made significant strategic and operational progress.\nWe have growing profitability, gain market share through our DN series and self-checkout solutions, and entered new growth markets.\nAnd I'm proud that we've achieved these goals while also delivering four years of consecutive improvements in customer satisfaction.\nWe entered 2022 with a strong backlog, a seasoned executive team, and operations that have proven to be resilient despite the pandemic, and a challenging macroeconomic backdrop.\nAs we look ahead to move past the pandemic and build further momentum in growth areas like EV charging services and payments.\nWhile continuing to optimize our core businesses in retail and banking, it is the right time for Octavio to assume the CEO role.\nOctavia needs no introduction to many of our customers and to our employees.\nHe has been leading a global banking segment with responsibility for approximately 70% of the company's revenues, and he's deeply passionate about our customers and our business.\nHe has a deep understanding of our business, and is the right person to lead people mixed off into the future.\nI will remain a member of Diebold Nixdorf, board of directors, until my term expires at the 2022 shareholder meeting.\nI'll also be working closely with Octavio, and the rest of the leadership team as an advisor for a few months to ensure a smooth transition.\nIt has been a tremendous privilege serving as CEO of Diebold Nixdorf.\nAnd, I believe that we have materially advanced the operational, and strategic direction of the organization.\nI'd like to now hand the call over to Octavio for a brief introduction.\nIt has been a pleasure being part of our journey under your leadership.\nI am truly excited to lead Diebold Nixdorf going forward.\nI have been with Diebold Nixdorf since 2014, and have thoroughly enjoyed contributing to our evolution to a leader of self-service banking and retail technology.\nI have had the pleasure of working closely with our customers across the globe.\nWhen I initially joined the [Inaudible] I worked closely with our Latin American customers, and then managed or American banking customer segment, and for the past 18 months have been working closely with our global banking customers.\nI have seen first hand how particular role we play for our customers, and how we can continue to innovate to serve them with a broader range of solutions.\nWe have a passionate and talented employee base that have been instrumental to the progress of the company.\nI am also energized by our growth opportunities, like our strong felt check out growth in retail, our managed services, efforts in banking and retail, along with our newer but equally interesting opportunities in payments, and EV charging services.\nWe have been vigorous in execution on improving our efficiency as a company, and I look forward to further enhancing our execution.\nThe team and I appreciate your contributions, and wish you well on your future endeavors.\nIn the year ahead, we look forward to moving past the global macro challenges we've experienced by leveraging our mitigation strategies, and delivering for our customers and shareholders.\nDiebold Nixdorf is well-positioned to capitalize on the strong demand for our products and solutions as customers continue to desire our market leading devices, services, and software.\nAnd as the market moves toward a self-service automation focus driven by consumers.\nAs a reminder, please see our shareholder letter for the full financial details from the quarter and full year.\nHere I will highlight a few of our key performance metrics.\nIn the fourth quarter, total revenue was $1.6 billion, a decrease over fourth quarter 2020 of approximately 4% as reported, and a decrease of approximately 1%, excluding the foreign currency impact of $22 million and $13 million impact from divested businesses.\nAdjusted for foreign currency and divestitures, product revenue increased approximately 4%, services revenue decreased the approximately 6%, and software revenue increased approximately 3% over fourth quarter 2020.\nDuring the quarter, we experienced delayed revenue due to extended outbound transport times and inbound component delays.\nThis primarily impacted the US, Latin America, and certain iAPAC countries, and increased our revenue deferral to 2022 by $30 million to a total of $150 million.\nOn a sequential basis, total revenue increased the approximately 11%.\nFull year 2020 revenue was $3.905 billion that was driven by demand for our DN series ATMs, especially our cash recyclers, our self-checkout devices, and the tax services offset by approximately $150 million of deferred revenue due to supply chain and logistics challenges.\nOn a year-over-year basis, 2021 revenue was approximately flat as compared to 2020 as reported, and also flat excluding a foreign currency benefit of $74 million, and the $60 million impact from divested businesses.\nAdjusted for foreign currency and divestitures, product revenue increased approximately 4%, services revenue decreased approximately 4%, and software revenue increased approximately 2% for the full year 2020.\nFor the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted of $126 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.9%.\nFourth quarter adjusted EBITDA results reflect a reduction in operating expenses fully offset by the decline in gross profit due to the revenue deferral and non-billable inflation of approximately $30 million.\nFull year 2021 adjusted EBITDA was $450 million, the lower-end of our guidance range primarily due to supply chain challenges, which increases deferral of revenue, as I mentioned earlier to approximately $150 million, non-billable for the year was approximately $15 million.\nLast week we delivered free cash flow of $407 million for the fourth quarter, resulting in $101 million for the fiscal year 2021.\nThis record fourth quarter free cash flow was achieved through tremendous efforts of our sales, operation, and finance organizations.\nThe fourth quarter marks the conclusion of the DN Now transformation and restructuring program.\nAs a reminder, going forward, we will not present non-GAAP adjustments to earnings except for the analyzation of intangible purchase accounting assets and when appropriate, non-recurring items such as M&A activities.\nOur revenue guidance for the full year 2022 is $4 billion to $4.2 billion, which reflects approximately $150 million in revenue deferral from 2021 to 2022, and organic growth and pricing growth, partially offset by model divestitures and terminated low-profit service contracts, and the potential ongoing logistics and supply chain disruptions.\nWhile we are very encouraged by the demand environment for our solutions, our guidance range also reflects caution regarding the timing of global logistics and supply chain environments.\nOur adjusted EBITDA outlook is $440 to $460 million, taking into account gross profit growth due to increased revenue and a model gross margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA will likely be weighted toward the second half of 2022 as our pricing and incremental cost management actions begin to take hold, and volume builds throughout the year.\nOur free cash flow outlook is $130 to $150 million, reflecting our EBITDA outlook, normalization of working capital, and combination of the DN Now transformation and restructuring program and related payments.\nIt should be noted that our free cash flow guidance does not reflect any benefit from a potential debt refinancing.\nIn terms of the first quarter, we are modeling gross margin to be comparable to the fourth quarter 2021 due to the continuation of non-billable inflation.\nAdditionally, we will experience an increase in first quarter operating expenses due to wage inflation, and growth in infrastructure investments.\nAnd as such, we expect the first quarter to be the low point for 2022 operating profit and margin.\nThat concludes my review of the results.\nWith our transition to a new CEO just been announced.\nOperator over to you.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These statements are subject to change due to new information or future events.\nAssured Guaranty's insurance production loss mitigation and capital management strategies combined to deliver outstanding results in 2021.\nWe had many notable accomplishments during the year, we earned $470 million of adjusted operating income, 84% more than in 2020.\nWe more than doubled adjusted operating income per share to $6.32 per share.\nWe brought all three of our measures of shareholder value to new highs.\nOver the year, shareholder's equity per share grew 9% to $93.19.\nAdjusted operating shareholder's equity per share increased 13% to $88.73, and adjusted book value per share rose 14% to $130.67.\nWe repurchased $10.5 million common shares, or approximately 14% of our shares outstanding at December 31, 2020, at an average price of $47.19.\nThose repurchases totaled $496 million, with the addition of $66 million of dividends, we returned a total of $562 million to shareholders.\nThrough strong new business production in each of our financial guarantee markets, U.S. public finance, international infrastructure finance and global structure finance, we generated a total of $361 million of PVP in 2021.\nDirect PVP exceeded $350 million for the third consecutive year, compared with an average annual direct PVP of $210 million from 2012 to 2018, making the last three years our best in more than a decade for direct new business production.\nWith a more than 60% share of new issue insured par sold, we led the U.S. public finance bond insurance industry to its highest penetration, market penetration in a dozen years.\nAnd taking advantage of exceptionally low interest rates are U.S. holding company issued a total of $900 million, a 3.15% 10-year and 3.60% 30-year senior debt to refinance $600 million of debt with higher coupons ranging from 5% to almost 7%.\nAs a result, annual debt service savings will be $5.2 million through the next maturity date.\nOur financial guarantee production was well-diversified across all of our markets.\nU.S public finance PVP of $235 million included in its second best direct production in at least a decade, surpassed only by the previous year's result, or $79 million of international infrastructure PVP marks the fourth year out of the last five that we have exceeded 75 million of direct PVP in that sector.\nGlobal structure finance PVP at $47 million was the second best and direct production since 2012.\nOur markets and economic environment offered both opportunities and challenges during 2021, issuance of U.S. municipal bonds reached a record par amount of $457 billion in 2021.\nThis partly reflected investors increased demand for taxes on paper in expectation of higher tax rates and continued limitations on state and local tax deductions at the federal level.\nAdditionally, -- issuers were eager to take advantage of extremely low municipal interest rates to refinance bonds issued in the path of higher rates, with the option to execute tax exempt advance refunding still off the table.\nMany issuers also turned to the taxable market to replace higher coupon tax exempt debt.\nTotal insured market volume increased to 8.2% of par issued, the highest annual rate over the past 12 years, and up from 7.6% during 2020 and 5.9% during 2019.\nWe believe this increased penetration in 2021 indicates that the risk of unpredictable developments, which is brought home by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, has made a lasting impression on investors.\nWe have also seen that Assured Guaranty has the underwriting and risk management skills to construct an insured portfolio that experienced minimal claims from the economic disruption caused by the pandemic, most of which have already been reimbursed.\nThe $37.5 billion of insured par in 2021 represented a 10% annual increase, on the heels of a 43% increase the prior year, resulting in a 57% growth of the insured market in just two years since 2019.\nAssured Guaranty's production was a leading force behind this growth, as we enjoyed over 58% of new issue insured par sold in 2020, and more than 60% in 2021.\nOur highest annual market share since 2013, Our $23 billion of insured new issue volume in 2021 was almost $3 billion more par than we insured in 2020, and was generated by more than 8,000 individual transaction.\nAn important trend in recent years has been the use of our guarantee to help launch some of the municipal bond markets largest transaction, which indicates growing institutional demand for the security, relative price stability and significant market liquidity our guarantee can provide.\nWe guaranteed $100 million or more on each of 48 large issues launched in 2021, up from 39 transactions in 2020 and 22 in 2019.\nSignificantly, we continue to add value on credits with underlying ratings in the double aid category from one or both of S&P and Moody's, ensuring a 109 such AA transactions totaling more than $3.5 billion of insured par.\nU.S. public finance, forms the largest part of our uniquely diversified financial guarantee strategy.\nOur three pronged strategy also targets insurable transactions in both infrastructure finance outside the United States and structured finance throughout the world.\nThis helps us in times when one market or another shows temporary weaknesses, and it drives great results in years like 2021, when we are thriving in all three of our markets.\nFurther demonstrating the diversity of our business, in 2021, we guaranteed financing of a Spanish solar power facilities and UK higher education and healthcare projects.\nAdditionally, we work with the UK water company to extend a debt service reserve guarantee, which is a unique product we developed as an alternative to bank liquidity facilities.\nWe also provided a number of secondary market guarantees.\nOur European business was historically based in the UK, which previously allowed us to do business throughout the European Union.\nWe have long been active and where we continue to believe that plentiful and diverse opportunities.\nOur Paris subsidiary, which we opened in 2020 to serve continental Europe more effectively, especially now that the UK has left the European Union, further grew its business around originations in 2021.\nA global structured finance and important part of our business is to provide institutions like banks and insurance companies with tools to optimize the capital utilization of their asset portfolios.\nDuring the year, we guarantee large insurance securitizations and significantly increase our CLO activity.\nOur guarantees of CLOs attract new investors who might otherwise be discouraged by the higher capital requirements on uninsured Clos.\nWe are seeing more opportunities to help investors reduce the capital consume of both existing structured finance exposures and new investment.\nThe new business we rode across all of our markets in 2021, enabled us to increase the year-end net par amount of our insured portfolio for the first time in many years.\nWe believe the trend going forward will be to continue increasing the par amount of our insured portfolio, and increase our deferred premium revenue, which will further stabilize and grow our future earnings.\nWe have continued to reduce the risk in our insured portfolio, and believe we can continue to do so as we continue to write new investment grade business.\nThe below investment grade portion of our insured portfolio declined to barely more than 3% as of December 31, 2021.\nAlmost half of our below investment grade net par exposure is to Puerto Rico, and we expect that with the court approved settlements pertaining to the GO and certain other credit scheduled to occur on March 15th of this year, that figure should drop below 2.5%, and continue to fall as more of our Puerto Rico settlements are executed.\nAfter years of twists and turns related to the restructuring of Puerto Rico debt, decisive progress occurred in 2021, we and the other creditors, along with the Commonwealth, agreed to support the final revision of the Oversight Boards restructuring plan for the central government, which the Title III court approved in January of this year.\nAs a result, the Commonwealth government's exit from bankruptcy is expected to begin in mid-March.\nThe Title III court also laid the groundwork for favorable consideration of additional agreements that support certain other Puerto Rico restructurings, such as for highways and transportation authority.\nAll this means that Puerto Rico's long awaited resolution of its unpaid debt is proceeding well, and the island is positioned for years of fiscal stability, according to the Oversight Board's latest fiscal plan.\nIn addition to our success in the financial guarantee business in 2021, we also made significant progress toward our goals for the asset manager business.\nOur overall investment performance was strong as one of the top 25 collateralized loan obligation managers by assets under management.\nWe were well-positioned to participate in this CLO market that reached a record level of interest issuance.\nDuring 2021, we launched six new CLOs representing $2.5 billion of assets under management, more than double what we issued in 2020, and we converted non-fee earning AUM to fee earning at AUM by selling substantially all this CLO equity still held by a Assured IM legacy funds, where we had been rebating management fees.\nThrough these efforts, we increased CLO management fees in 2021 to $48 million from $23 million in 2020.\nAdditionally, we reset a refinance 10 CLOs in the United States and Europe.\nIn the asset backed sector, we closed a continuation fund holding an auto finance investment.\nAdditionally, the healthcare portfolio managed by Assured healthcare partners continue to grow as capital was deployed.\nLooking back on the year, we believe much of Assured Guaranty success reflected the market's growing appreciation of the reliability of our financial strength and the security we provide investors, while also delivering financial benefits and first class service to bond insurers and other clients, the responsibility embodied in our careful underwriting, discipline risk management, and tireless loss mitigation.\nThe proven resilience or financial guarantee business model and our strategic approach to capital management to protect policyholders and create value for shareholders.\nIn our view, this heightened recognition of our guarantees value could help to drive demand higher as interest rates rise.\nWe expect market conditions in 2022 and beyond to be very different from those of 2021, as the Fed strives to contain inflation, the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 recedes, developing geopolitical events continue to disrupt markets, and municipal governments prepare for the end of extraordinary federal support.\nRising interest rates, widening credit spreads, and the accompanying volatility tend to increase financial guarantee demand.\nWe believe Assured Guaranty is better positioned for the long-term success than in any time in our history.\nOur financial strength has never been stronger.\nThe credit challenges in our legacy insured portfolio are largely behind us.\nOur markets are large.\nOur opportunities are diverse.\nOur human capital exceptional.\nAnd our business model proven through decades of economic cycles.\nWe look forward to fulfilling the high expectations of our policyholders, clients and shareholders.\nI am very pleased to report that our fourth quarter 2021 adjusted operating income was $273 million, or $3.88 per share, a significant increase over the adjusted operating income of the fourth quarter of 2020, which was $56 million, or $0.69 per share.\nThe primary driver of the increase in fourth quarter 2021 total adjusted operating income was the insurance segment where adjusted operating income increased 134% over fourth quarter 2020 from $109 million to $277 million.\nMuch of this benefit came from our loss mitigation strategies, particular for our Puerto Rico exposure.\nAfter many years of negotiation and other loss mitigation efforts, we are close to resolving $1.4 billion in gross par associated with our Puerto Rico GO, PBA, CCDA and PREPA exposures.\nThe increased certainty of the settlement and Puerto Rico's improved economic outlook, combined with the increased value of our actual and expected recoveries under the settlement agreements, were the primary drivers of the $186 million economic benefit in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we sold a portion of our salvage and subrogation recovered bulls associated with certain matured Puerto Rico GO and PREPA exposures, resulting in proceeds of $383 million, thereby realigning some of our expected recoveries early.\nIn 2022, we continued to sell portions of our GO, PBA and PREPA salvage and subrogation recoverable, resulting in an additional proceeds of $133 million.\nThe prices at which we crystallized these recoveries, as well as observed market pricing for other similar instruments and the forward interest rate environment, are reflected in the updated assumptions of the value of the remaining recovery bonds and contingent value instrument that we project receiving in the various Puerto Rico settlements.\nOther components of the insurance segment also performed well in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nTotal income from investments, which consists of net investment income on the fixed maturity portfolio and equity in earnings on short Im funds and other alternative investments, was $111 million, an increase from $94 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nCollectively, the investments in Assured IM funds and alternative investments generated $44 million in equity in earnings of investees in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with $24 million in the fourth quarter 2020.\nWith the increase mainly attributable to a large fair value gain on a specific investment in a private equity fund.\nAs a reminder, equity in earnings and investees is a function of mark-to-market movements attributable to the Assured IM funds and other alternative investments.\nIt is more volatile than the net investment income on the fixed maturity portfolio and will fluctuate from period-to-period.\nOur fixed maturity and short-term investments account for the largest portion of the portfolio, generating net investment income of $67 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with $70 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nAs we shift fixed maturity assets into alternative investments, net investment income from fixed maturities may decline, however, over the long-term, we are targeting enhanced returns on the alternative investment portfolio of over 10%, which exceeds our projected returns on a fixed maturity portfolio.\nIn terms of premiums, scheduled net earned premiums decreased slightly in the fourth quarter of 2021 to $91 million, compared with fourth quarter 2020 of $94 million.\nPremium earnings due to refundings and terminations were $20 million in fourth quarter 2021, compared with $65 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, when two large transactions refunded.\nThe asset management segment adjusted operating loss was $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nThe improvement in asset management segment results is primarily attributable to increased management fees in the strategies we launched since the 2019 Blue Mountain acquisition, and a non-recurring impairment of a lease right of use asset of $13 million in 2020.\nAsset management fees on a segment basis were $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nHigher fees from healthcare opportunity funds and CLOs more than offset the decrease in fees from wind down funds as distributions to investors continue.\nAs of December 31, 2021, AUM of the wind down funds was $582 million, compared with $1.6 million as of December 31, 2020.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the effective tax rate was 15.1%, compared with 12.7% in fourth quarter 2020, which included the release of a reserve for uncertain tax positions.\nThe overall effective tax rate on adjusted operating income fluctuate period-to-period based on the proportion of income in different texture jurisdictions.\nOverall, the fourth quarter capped off a year of successful execution of our strategic initiatives.\nThese achievements are reflected in our 2021 full year adjusted operating income of $470 million, which includes a loss on extinguishment of debt of $175 million pre-tax, or $138 million after tax.\nDespite the debt extinguishment charge, full year 2021 adjusted operating income represents an 84% increase compared with 2020 adjusted operating income of $256 million.\nThe primary driver of this increase was the insurance segment, with 722 adjusted operating income in 2021, compared with $421 million in 2020.\nU.S public finance benefited from the increased recovery assumptions, the Puerto Rico exposures that I mentioned earlier and the U.S. RMBS benefit this primarily a function of home price appreciation.\nEconomic loss development, which excludes the effects of deferred premium revenue, was a benefit of $287 million in 2021.\nAcross the whole portfolio, loss expense in 2020 was $204 million, and was primarily attributable to Puerto Rico.\nOn a full year basis, total income from the investment portfolio was $424 million in 2021, compared with $371 million in 2020.\nThe investment returns on the portion of the portfolio invested in Assured IM funds demonstrates an important component of the benefits of the asset management segment, not only as a fee earning business but as an investment advisor for our insurance segments.\nAssured IM funds in which the insurance subsidiaries invest generated gains of $80 million in 2021, compared with gains of $42 million in 2020.\nThe gains were across all strategies, particularly healthcare, CLOs, and asset based, and generated a year-to-date return of 20.8%.\nThe third party alternative investments also generated gains of $64 million in 2021, compared with $19 million in 2020.\nThese gains more than offset reduced net investment income on the available -- sale fixed maturity portfolio, which was $280 million in 2021, down from $310 million in 2020.\nLower average balances, the fixed maturity portfolio reinvestment yields an income -- loss mitigation securities were the primary drivers of the year-over-year variance.\nTotal net earned premiums in credit driven revenues were $438 million in 2021, compared with $540 million in 2020, including premium accelerations of $66 million and $130 million, respectively.\nIn the asset management segment, we have continued to make great progress in 2021.\nWe raised new third party capital in our CLO, healthcare and asset base strategies.\nWe increased for earning for CLO AUM to the issuance of $2.8 billion in CLOs and the sale of CLO equity out of the legacy funds, and we continue to liquidate assets in the wind down funds.\nThe improvement in the asset management segment operating loss from $50 million in 2020 to $90 million in 2021, was primarily attributable to an increase in management fees from $59 million in 2020 to $76 million in 2021.\nHigher free -- fees from CLOs and -- turning funds more than offset the decline in fees from wind down funds.\nThe increase in -- opportunity fund fees was primarily attributable to the new healthcare funds launched in late 2020, which raise additional third party capital in late 2021.\nThe corporate division had adjusted operating loss of $253 million in 2021, including a loss on debt extinguishment of $175 million, or $138 million on an after tax basis.\nWhich resulted from a $600 million in debt redemptions that Dominic mentioned earlier, this charge is simply an acceleration of expenses that would have occurred over time.\nIn the prior year, corporate division adjusted operating loss was $111 million.\nThe debt redemptions were financed with the proceeds from the issuance of $900 million in new 10-year and 30-year debt, which resulted in a reduced average coupon and redeemed debt from 5.89% to 3.35%, and $170 million -- reduction in our 2024 debt refinancing needs.\nIn addition to debt refinancing has generated annual debt service savings of $5.2 million until the next maturity date and provided flexibility to continue share repurchases.\nWe were able to accomplish all of this without significantly affecting our debt leverage or interest coverage ratios, the additional $300 million of proceeds from the debt issuances were used primarily for share repurchases.\nIn the fourth quarter 2021, where we purchased $3.7 million shares for $192 million at an average price of $51.47 per share.\nThis brings full year 2021 purchases to $10.5 million shares, or $496 million, which represents 14% of the total shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.\nThe continued success of this program helped to drive by our per share book value metrics to record highs as of December 31, 2021.\nSubsequent to the quarter close, we repurchased an additional $1.7 million shares for $91 million.\nSince the beginning of our repurchase program in January 2013, we have returned $4.2 billion to shareholders under this program, resulting in a 69% reduction in total shares outstanding.\nThe cumulative effect of these purchases was a benefit of over $37 an adjusted operating shareholder's equity per share and $65 in adjusted book value per share, which helped drive these metrics to new record highs.\nFrom a liquidity standpoint, the holding companies currently have cash and investments of approximately $274 million dollars, of which $124 million resides in AGL.\nThese funds are available for liquidity needs or for use in the pursuit of our strategic initiatives to [Inaudible] our business or repurchase shares to manage our capital.\nThis week, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $350 million of common shares.\nUnder this and previous authorizations, the company is now authorized to purchase $364 million of its common shares.\nIn addition, we declared a dividend of $0.27 per share, which represents an increase of 13.6% over the previous dividend of $0.22 per share.\nAs we look to 2022 and beyond, we are optimistic that our largest single BIG exposure, Puerto Rico, will be substantially resolved by the end of this year.\nThe interest rate environment will be more conducive to new insurance business production and that the asset management segment and alternative asset strategies will continue to contribute to the company's progress toward its long-term strategic goals.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm Jeff Kotkin, Eversource Energy's Vice President, Investor Relations.\nSpeaking today will be Joe Nolan, our new President and Chief Executive Officer; and Phil Lembo, our Executive Vice President and CFO.\nAlso joining us today are John Moreira, our Treasurer and Senior VP for Finance and Regulatory; and Jay Buth, our VP and Controller.\nWe hope that all on the phone remain healthy and that your families are safe and well.\nI'm looking forward to meeting many more of you over the coming years and sharing my optimism and enthusiasm for Eversource's future and excellent investment thesis.\nI'm grateful to the Eversource Board of Trustees and to Jim for allowing me to lead an incredibly dedicated and high-performing organization.\nIn approving these Executive level changes, the Eversource Board is signaling its confidence in our long-term strategy that focuses on our core regulated business with an exciting investment in offshore wind.\nWe are in a world where customer service, safety, and reliability have never been more important.\nWe will never forget that we would not be in the business without our 4.3 million customers; they are our top priority.\nCustomers pay the bills and they deserve the reliable and safe utility service that we must provide.\nOver the coming decades the tens of billions of dollars we will invest in our energy and water delivery systems will be critical in helping New England prepare for a clean energy future, and we expect to be a central catalyst to that clean energy transition.\nBut first, I need to address our Company's relationship with Connecticut.\nWe have thousands of employees in Connecticut, who work hard each day to provide our 1.7 million natural gas, water, and electric customers with the most reliable and responsive service possible.\nDuring emergency situations, which we have had far too often over the past year, due to the historic storm levels, they are working up to 16 hours a day for as many days as it takes to ensure that our customers have their service restored promptly and safely, even in a pandemic.\nSo I cannot tell you how painful it was for me to read certain elements of the Tropical Storm Isaias decision that was released on April 28th.\nIt did not reflect the hard work of our dedicated employees in a company I've been chosen to lead.\nOur customers, PURA, and our company all want the same thing, great service each and every day of the year.\nAnd, when there is a strong event power restoration as safely and quickly as possible.\nThe women and men of Eversource work hard each and every day to meet these expectations.\nThe PURA auto [Phonetic] on storm response clearly identify the areas for improvement.\nWe know we have to work to not only our response plan but also on our relationship with PURA.\nThis was apparent from the April 28 decision in a subsequent notice of violation.\nI can assure you that we hear this loud and clear and already doing all we can to improve on both accounts.\nTurning to our clean energy initiatives.\nYou are probably aware of the climate legislation that Massachusetts Governor Baker signed into law earlier this spring.\nAmong many elements, the law will allow each of the state's utilities to build up to 200 -- 280 megawatts of solar generation, NSTAR Electric will be able to increase its level of solar generation in rate base from 70 megawatts to 350 megawatts.\nAs Phil mentioned during our year-end earnings call, we have budgeted approximately $500 million for this initiative from 2022 to 2025.\nThe other item with a direct impact on us is a 2,400 megawatts expansion of Massachusetts offshore wind authorization from 3,200 megawatts to 5,600 megawatts.\nThis expansion will help me [Phonetic] to stay at the forefront of offshore wind development in the United States.\nAs you can see on Slide 2, there are now more than 10,000 megawatts of unawarded offshore wind authorizations in Southern New England and New York, with Massachusetts set to award up to 1,600 megawatts later this year.\nIn fact, Massachusetts RFP was just issued on Friday of last week.\nOur offshore wind partnership with Orsted is very near and dear to my heart.\nSince I'm always seeing that relationship and worked closely with our partner in recent years, it is an important element of our clean energy growth strategy.\nAnd we have had a number of positive offshore wind developments already this year.\nStarting with Slide 3 in early January, the Bureau of Ocean Management or BOEM released its draft environmental impact statement on South Fork project.\nComments received by late February, and we expect to see a final EIS way this summer.\nBOEM is scheduled to rule on our final federal permits for that project in January of 2022.\nAssuming that the January data is met, we expect to begin construction early next year and complete the project in late 2023.\nAdditionally, in late March, The New York Public Service Commission approved the necessary New York state sighting permit for the project, while the local town and trustees of East Hampton approved the local real estate rights required for the project.\nTurning to Revolution Wind.\nLate last month BOEM released a schedule for reviewing the 704 megawatt project.\nThe schedule calls for a final environmental impact statement to be issued in March of 2023 and for a final decision on construction and operating plan by the end of July 2023.\nThe release of that schedule represents a significant step forward with this project.\nRevolution Wind and South Fork are two of only three projects in the Northeast, that have achieved that milestone.\nOver the coming months, we and Orsted will be reviewing the BOEM and the state of Rhode Island permitting process to develop a projection for the Revolution Wind construction schedule.\nFinally, we expect to receive BOEM review schedule for our 924 megawatt Sunrise Wind project later this year.\nWe continue to make significant progress in preparing for the commencement of construction.\nOver the past couple of months, we have announced agreements with two critical ports that will serve as staging grounds for construction.\nNew London, Connecticut will serve as a hub for turbine construction and Providence, Rhode Island will be the center for foundation construction.\nEnormous economic benefits will accrue to these communities, as a result of their role in our construction activities, including hundreds of direct jobs.\nWe are also very encouraged by the extremely positive signs we see from Washington.\nPresident Biden has underscored his support for offshore wind construction along the Atlantic seaboard and has marshaled multiple members of his cabinet to support it.\nThe goal was to have about 30,000 megawatts of offshore wind turbines operating in the U.S. by 2030.\nWe expect to be a significant contributor to that output through our partnership with Orsted.\nAlready more than 1,750 megawatts are under contract to serve load in Connecticut, New York, and Rhode Islands.\nAgain, I look forward to speaking with many of you at the AGA Virtual Conference later this month.\nNow, I will turn over the call to Phil.\nSo I'll start with Slide number 4 and noting that earnings were $1.06 per share in the first quarter, compared with earnings of $1.01 per share in the first quarter of 2020.\nResults for both years included after-tax costs associated with our recent acquisition of the assets of Columbia Gas, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts and that's $0.02 per share this year and $0.01 per share in 2020.\nResults for our Electric Distribution and Natural Gas Distribution segment showed the most significant changes year-to-year.\nElectric Distribution earned $0.27 per share in the first quarter of this year, compared with earnings of $0.39 per share in the first quarter of 2020.\nLower results were driven by a couple of principal factors.\nThe first is that we recorded a charge of $30 million or $0.07 per share, primarily to reflect customer credits of $28.4 million and an additional penalty of $1.6 million to be paid to the state of Connecticut.\nThese credits relate to a Notice of Violation that Connecticut regulators announced last week, as a result of our performance in restoring power following the catastrophic impact of Tropical Storm Isaias last August.\nThe docket established by PURA to review the penalty is scheduled to run through mid-July of this year.\nAdditionally, Electric Distribution results were negatively affected by approximately $20 million of higher storm-related expenses in the first quarter of 2021 and that's compared to a pretty quiet and warm first quarter in 2020.\nAnd in fact, in this quarter, we experienced 31 separate storm events across our three states versus fairly limited activity in Q1 of 2020.\nSo, by contrast, our Natural Gas Distribution segment showed a sharp increase in earnings because it's now about 50% larger than it was a year ago.\nIt earned $0.43 per share in the first quarter of 2021 compared with earnings of $0.26 per share in the first quarter of 2020.\nImproved results were due primarily to the addition of Eversource Gas of Massachusetts, which earned $0.14 per share in the quarter.\nIn addition, we had higher revenues at NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas and these were partially offset by higher O&M and depreciation expense.\nI should note that the transition process for Eversource Gas of Massachusetts continues to progress extremely well.\nAs we continue to migrate off of NiSource business systems and onto Eversource platforms, reducing costs and improving service.\nTo date, more than 80% of the business processes have been transferred to Eversource from NiSource's, great progress has been made.\nEversource ownership of the distribution system is being well received by customers, communities, and employees, and we continue to meet or exceed the financial and operational targets we'd set for ourselves.\nOn the Electric Transmission segment, we earned $0.39 per share in the first quarter of 2021, compared with $0.38 per share in the first quarter of 2020.\nImproved results were driven by a higher level of investment in transmission facilities and this was partially offset by dilution of additional shares issued.\nOur Water Distribution segment earned $3.6 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared with earnings of $2.1 million in the first quarter of last year.\nImproved results were due largely to lower interest expense and lower effective tax rate.\nAs you may have noticed, last month Aquarion announced an agreement to purchase a small investor-owned water system that is based in Connecticut, but also serves portions of Massachusetts and New Hampshire.\nNew England service company, as it's called, serves about 10,000 customers in the three states and has rate base of about $25 million.\nThis acquisition is consistent with the growth strategy we've discussed for our water delivery business.\nAnd assuming timely regulatory approvals, we expect to close the transaction by the end of this year and for it to be accretive right away in 2022.\nAs you probably noted in our news release and you can see on Slide 5, we are reaffirming our long-term earnings-per-share growth rate in the upper half of the 5% to 7% range.\nHowever, we modified our current year 2021 earnings guidance to reflect the customer credits I mentioned earlier.\nWe now project earnings per share toward the lower end of the $3.81 to $3.93 range and this includes the $0.07 per share impact of the credits.\nOn the regulatory side.\nWhile our primary operating companies don't have any base rate reviews pending, we have several regulatory dockets open in Connecticut and I'll summarize the status of a few of them.\nIn addition to the penalty I described previously, PURA also identified a 90 basis point reduction in our authorized distribution ROE.\nThis is likely to be addressed in the current CL&P interim rate decreased proceeding.\nGiven the revised schedule the PURA released last week, we believe any ROE reduction would take -- would not take place or take effect until October 1st of this year.\nTo help you size that impact currently, CL&P's authorized ROE is 9.25% and we have approximately $5 billion of rate base at CL&P.\nAlso, on April 28th, PURA finalized an interim decision on the recovery of certain tracked cost by CL&P.\nThis decision would result in a number of changes to those track cost that would be implemented on June 1st, with other modifications deferred until October 1st.\nThe interim decision implemented a number of positive modifications to an early draft and we appreciate PURA making those decisions -- making those changes in its decision.\nPURA also continues to review several other dockets, including potential for grid modernization initiatives, including AMI electric vehicle programs and storage.\nAnd the status of the major open PURA docket is listed in an appendix to our slides.\nTurning from Connecticut to Washington.\nWe were disappointed last month in the developments around the ongoing notice of proposed rate making concerning incentives that FERC is granted for many years to utilities that participate in regional transmission organizations or RTOs.\nFERC will be taking comments and replies on the proposed changes over the next several weeks before deciding on a final order.\nI would expect that the New England transmission owners and others will file comments opposing the change, which some see as being inconsistent with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and with President Biden's focus on building out the nation's electrical infrastructure to bring more clean-energy resources to market.\nAs a helpful rule from a 10 basis point reduction in our transmission ROE effects consolidated earnings by about $0.01 per share.\nIn terms of financings, we completed $450 million of debt issuances so far this year, primarily to pay off maturities at Eversource parent and at the Aquarion in Connecticut -- Aquarion company in Connecticut.\nWe've not issued any additional equity this year other than through our ongoing dividend reinvestment and employee incentive programs.\nHowever, as you know and we've stated in the past, we continue to expect to issue approximately $700 million of new equity through some sort of after market program and that would occur at various points in time over our forecast period.\nIn terms of our operations, we've gotten off to a very strong start this year.\nElectric reliability continues to be in the top quartile of the industry versus our peers.\nThrough March, our above-average safety record improved even further with fewer employee injuries than we experienced in the first quarter of 2020.\nAll three of our natural gas utilities are outperforming on their emergency response requirements and Aquarion's water quality is solidly exceeding its target.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Last night,we released results for our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, copies of which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nIn order to provide greater transparency regarding our operating performance, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that involve adjustments to GAAP results.\nAny non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered to be an alternative to financial measures required by GAAP.\nErica will review the business segment and corporate financial details.\nAt this time last year.\nI talked about being prepared to win as the recovery takes hold and I think 2021 is evidence that we were prepared.\nFiscal 2021 was a remarkable year for Cabot as the business recovered from the 2020 COVID lows to deliver record results.\nWe accomplished this through a combination of extraordinary execution and our commitment to driving growth through differentiated investments.\nI would like to spend a little time now recapping the accomplishments of the year.\nThe Cabot operating model is built on the foundations of commercial and operational excellence and our strength in these disciplines drove our outstanding results in fiscal year 2021.\nWe delivered record adjusted earnings per share of $5.02 and total segment EBIT of $550 million.\nAnd our focus on cash, resulted in a record discretionary free cash flow of $353 million.\nThe macro environment in 2021 required resilience and agility and I'm very proud of the Cabot team in how they work tirelessly to support our customers' evolving needs.\nServing our customers and innovating to grow with them is what motivates our team.\nThis was made more challenging in 2021 given the myriad global supply chain disruptions that companies face and the fact that necessary COVID safety protocols continue to evolve and adjust our normal ways of working.\nAdditionally, companies experienced sharply rising input costs, which required dynamic commercial management.\nOur teams worked closely with our customers to manage through this environment and we were successful in our pricing efforts to ensure our margins remained robust and we could invest to support our customers long-term supply needs.\nFiscal year 2021 mark the sixth year of our advancing the core strategy and I'm very pleased with our record of execution and the growth prospects for our company.\nAdjusted earnings per share has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 11% since the inception of our strategy, ahead of our 7% to 10% target.\nA growth focus built around our core segments and disciplined execution have been the hallmarks of our approach.\nAs pleased as we are with the results since 2015, I'm even more excited about the growth opportunities that lie in front of us and the progress we made in 2021.\nOur growth strategy is built on a philosophy of investing from positions of strength and where we have what we call a right to win.\nA few highlights from 2021 are particularly noteworthy.\nOur unmatched portfolio of conductive carbon additives in our strong customer focus model resulted in a doubling of revenue in our battery materials business year-over-year.\nWe are progressing with the specialty carbons conversion of our plants in Xuzhou, China and this investment will provide growth across our broad range of specialty carbon applications and will free up additional capacity to support battery materials.\nOur inkjet business is well positioned to capitalize on the shift in the commercial and packaging segments from analog to digital printing and we achieved multiple OEM qualifications in 2021 that set us up well for growth as inkjet presses penetrate these markets.\nAnd finally, we continue to the execution of a project to build a specialty compounds production line in Cilegon, Indonesia, which will allow us to meet customer demand for black masterbatch in this high growth region.\nWhile growth and execution are highlights from 2021, these accomplishments have been achieved with sustainability at the core.\nWe continued our sustainability journey in 2021 with several noteworthy accomplishments.\nFirst and foremost, we committed to align our disclosures with the recommendations of the Task Force for Climate Related Financial Disclosure or TCFD and we engaged a third party to help us evaluate climate risks and opportunities following the TCFD guidelines.\nWe intend to share the results of this work in the coming months.\nWhile the operating rhythm of 2021 was challenging, I'm very proud of our performance in employee safety.\nOur total recordable incident rates of 0.34 keeps us firmly in the upper echelon of chemical and industrial companies.\nWe also completed a major air emissions control project at our carbon black manufacturing facility located in Louisiana.\nThis investment in control technology will result in improved air quality through the substantial elimination of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions and will ensure that we can support our customer supply needs in a sustainable fashion over the long term.\nIn addition, waste heat from the plant is being recovered and used to generate up to 50MW of cogen power without creating any additional emissions.\nIn August, we announced a new $1 billion revolving credit facility that has pricing that is based on the company's credit ratings, as well as our performance against annual intensity reduction targets for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions.\nThe transaction reinforces our commitment to sustainability and was one of the first sustainability-linked revolving credit agreements in the U.S. chemical industry.\nLastly, as a chemical industry, we need to attract the next generation of talented and diverse candidates into our field of chemistry.\nIn support of this aim, Cabot is taking part in an industry effort to support the Future of STEM Scholars Initiative or FOSSI, which focuses on creating pathways for students at historically black colleges and universities to enter and succeed in STEM careers within the chemical industry.\nThis initiative will have a lasting and transformational impact on the students and our industry and we are proud to be an inaugural sponsor.\nOverall, we had a very successful 2021 in terms of financial performance and progress against our strategic objectives.\nThis well-rounded performance is a testament to the positioning of our portfolio and our exceptional team.\nNow a few comments on the fourth quarter.\nI am pleased to report solid fourth quarter results with adjusted earnings per share of $1.11.\nThis performance was 63% above the same quarter last year despite the effects of the semiconductor chip shortage and ongoing global supply chain disruptions, as well as a higher level of maintenance spending due to the timing of turnarounds.\nWe also continue the momentum of battery materials and ended the year with EBITDA in our previously communicated range of $15 million to $20 million.\nCash flow from operations was strong at $100 million in the quarter despite the impact of higher raw material prices.\nI will start with discussing results in the Reinforcement Materials segment.\nDuring the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2021, EBIT for Reinforcement Materials increased by $8 million and $167 million respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year.\nThe increases were principally due to higher unit margins and higher volumes.\nHigher margins were driven by higher spot pricing, particularly in Asia.\nThe higher volumes in the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2021 were due to a strong recovery in all regions from the COVID related impacts in fiscal 2020.\nThe fourth quarter results were also impacted by higher costs associated with the plant maintenance.\nGlobally, volumes were up 6% in the fourth quarter as compared to the same period of the prior year due to 6% growth in the Americas, 5% increase in Europe and up 7% in Asia.\nHigher volumes were driven by strong demand in all regions as the replacement tire market remain robust.\nLooking at the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect a sequential increase in EBIT from a decrease in fixed costs with lower plant maintenance spend and as volumes are expected to increase modestly sequentially as demand for replacement tire remains solid.\nNow turning to Performance Chemicals.\nEBIT increased by $20 million in the fourth quarter and $93 million for the full year as compared to the same periods in fiscal 2020, primarily due to improved product mix, stronger volumes and higher customer pricing.\nThe stronger product mix was driven by an increase in sales into automotive and conductive carbon applications in our specialty carbons and compounds product line.\nPricing improved year-over-year in our fumed silica product lines, particularly in China.\nYear-over-year volumes in the fourth fiscal quarter increased by 2% in performance additives and decreased by 8% in formulated solutions.\nVolumes were impacted during the quarter, largely due to two plant outages as we discussed on last quarter's call.\nThis segment experienced increased maintenance costs in the fourth fiscal quarter as expected, but these higher costs were offset by $7 million of insurance proceeds related to a claim from earlier in fiscal 2021.\nLooking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect sequential volume growth as one of the impacted plants came back online and a positive benefit from growth in our battery materials product line.\nWe anticipate higher input costs in the first quarter that will temporarily impact results until our latest round of announced price increases and surcharges can be fully implemented to recoup the rising costs.\nMoving to Purification Solutions.\nEBIT in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased by $4 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and full year EBIT increased $7 million.\nThe increases were driven by lower fixed costs from the sale of the mine in Texas and the related long-term activated carbon supply agreement and the favorable impact from improved pricing in our specialty applications.\nLooking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect EBIT to decline sequentially due to seasonally lower volumes and higher maintenance costs due to planned turnaround activities.\nI will now turn to corporate items.\nWe ended the quarter with a cash balance of $168 million and our liquidity position remains strong at approximately $1.3 billion.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, cash flows from operating activities were $100 million, which included a working capital decrease of $4 million.\nCapital expenditures for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 were $80 million and additional uses of cash during the fourth quarter were $20 million for dividends.\nDuring fiscal 2021, we generated $257 million of cash flow from operations, including an increase in net working capital of $222 million.\nThe working capital increase was largely driven by the impact of higher raw material costs on our inventory balances and accounts receivable balances as we passed higher costs onto our customers in our pricing.\nThe increase was also partially driven by the growth in our business year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures for fiscal year 2021 were $195 million dollars, which included both our targeted growth investments and the spend related to U.S. EPA compliance projects.\nWe expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 to be between $225 million and $250 million.\nThis estimate includes continued U.S. EPA related capital compliance spend and increased spending on growth projects related to high confidence, high return areas of the portfolio.\nThe growth related capital includes completing the conversion of upgrading our new China carbon black plant to produce specialty carbons, which is planned to come online in the second half of 2022.\nIn addition, we are executing on a new specialty compounds unit in Indonesia and have planned growth capital related to capacity expansions in battery materials and inkjet.\nAdditional uses of cash during the fiscal year included $80 million for dividends.\nThe operating tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was 27% and we anticipate our operating tax rate for fiscal 2022 to be in the range of 27% to 29%.\nAs we look ahead to 2022, I'm excited about the growth opportunities in front of us.\nLet me take a couple of minutes to share with you our priorities for the upcoming year.\nFirst, we will finalize our 2022 tire customer agreements and we remain positive about the outcome as security of supply remains the top priority for customers.\nDemand continues to be strong and is projected to be robust in all regions.\nInventories levels are low across the value chain and global transportation flows remain challenging, all of which are placing a greater premium on local supply.\nSecond, we'll continue to advance a broad portfolio of strategic growth investments across the company.\nIn battery materials, we plan to expand capacity at our carbon nanotube facility in Zhuhai, China.\nAdditionally, the aforementioned specialty carbons conversion of our Suzhou plant will provide 50,000 metric tons of growth capacity across specialty carbons and will free up our network to support growth of battery materials.\nWe also expect to complete our new specialty compounds production unit in Indonesia later in the calendar year 2022, which will enable us to build on our strong position in the high growth ASEAN region.\nAnd finally, we intend to build on our track record of execution by delivering earnings growth and strong cash flow, while maintaining our investment grade rating and industry-leading dividend.\nI hope this gives you some color on our priorities for 2022.\nI'll close out my prepared comments today by talking about our outlook for the year.\nClearly, we are pleased with the momentum coming out of fiscal 2021 and we feel very good about how the new year is shaping up.\nWe expect a step-up in Reinforcement Materials starting in the second quarter based on an expected positive outcome from our 2022 customer agreements.\nWe anticipate improved results across all product lines in the Performance Chemicals segment with above-market growth in our battery materials and inkjet product lines.\nBased on this, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal year 2020 to be in the range of $5.20 to $5.60.\nThe first quarter results are expected to be generally in line with the fourth quarter with results accelerating as we move through the year.\nOn the cash side, we anticipate strong free cash flow from year-over-year earnings growth, partially offset by an increase in working capital to support growth.\nCash flow will be used to fund advantage growth investments, dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.\nOverall, I'm very excited about where we are as a company and where we're going.\nThe growth opportunities we have in front of us are better than they have been at any point during my time as CEO.\nThe long-term fundamentals of our businesses are strong.\nOur end markets remain robust and we continue to execute at a high level.\nLooking ahead, we believe we have a winning formula, a talented team, an excellent portfolio of businesses that for growth and a strong balance sheet, all of which position us to deliver on our strategic objectives and continue to grow and lead in our industry.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Consistent with those objectives, our communities under the leadership of our field staffs have continued to operate and serve our residents while adhering to the CDC's guidelines and complying with local, municipal and state guidelines.\nOur corporate team members have also adapted well to the new work environment and have continued to support our field staffs and to advance all of our strategic business objectives.\nI truly believe that we have collectively done some of the best work in our Company's 27-year history during what has certainly been its most challenging period.\nThe next generation of ACC team members appear to be learning a lot about our business for mom and dad each day.\nAs you know, at the outset of this pandemic, consistent with our Company values and the previously mentioned eight guiding objectives, we made a pledge that no resident would go without a home because of an inability to pay rent on a timely basis.\nWe also committed to be compassionate to the financial hardships that our residents and their parents may be experiencing due to COVID and the corresponding government shutdowns.\nAnd we committed to be the best partner possible to our long-term ACE university partners.\nStaying true to our pledge and these commitments did indeed cause short-term financial impacts that are reflected in the quarter.\nAt our off-campus apartment communities and those on-campus apartment communities that American Campus leases in the open market, on a monthly average basis for April, May and June, 93.7% of our residents made their rent payments.\nFor those that were not able to meet their financial obligations due to hardship, through our resident hardship program we provided nearly $9 million of direct financial relief to more than 6,500 of our residents and their parents.\nWe also provided an additional $15 million of financial relief to students and parents at our ACE on-campus communities where leasing administration, rent collections and residence life are administered by our university partners.\nIn addition, our waiving of fees associated with the payment and collection of rent resulted in more than $2 million of budgeted revenues not being collected during the quarter.\nAs the team will discuss, this $24 million in financial relief and the waiver of fee income makes up the large majority of our diminished revenue for the quarter.\nWe were able to offset a portion of this through expense reductions that did not diminish our ability to deliver quality service to our residents.\nWith the majority of our current in-place leases ending in the weeks ahead and a new academic year about to begin at universities across the nation, unlike multifamily residents, the financial position and buying power of the student renter has the potential to improve somewhat.\nAs many of you will recall from your own college years or from being parents of college students, each year students are eligible to apply for needs-based financial aid in the form of grants, scholarships and student loans.\nIn the spring and summer of 2019, when those financial aid assessments were being completed for the current academic year, the US economy was at or near all time highs, with unemployment for nearly every demographic group being at all-time lows.\nIncomes from the favorable economic conditions were likely reflected in the students' applications for financial aid based on their and their parents' financial position at that time.\nAs such, when COVID hit in March of 2020, in the middle of this academic year, many of those students and parents saw their income significantly diminish without the benefit of financial aid support.\nBy contrast, as students have applied for financial aid in the spring and summer of 2020 for the upcoming academic year, those students and parents experiencing financial hardship due to the pandemic are now likely to qualify for more financial aid than they received in the prior year.\nWe believe this needs-based increase in financial aid likely occurs in every US recession and is perhaps one of the reasons the student housing industry has been so resilient over the years during times of macroeconomic stress.\nAs we look forward to the next academic year, while we do not believe there will be a full return to normalcy in the fall of 2020, we are cautiously optimistic at this time, given the following four variables.\nOne, universities' focus on policies and procedures to promote a safe environment in the delivery of their academic curriculum, facilitating a return to campus with some component of in-person instruction.\nAs reported in the College -- in the Chronicle -- excuse me, as it reported in the Chronicle of Higher Education, at this time, 63 of our 68 universities served are conducting some component of in-person classes.\nAnd it's worth noting, we also continue to have leasing activity of property serving the five universities that have announced predominantly online curriculum delivery, with our four same store properties at these schools being 90% leased and with potential no shows and request for reletting currently representing only 5% potential diminishment in occupancy.\nTwo, universities now having available data on how COVID impacts the 18 to 22-year-old student demographic and having an improved understanding of how modern apartment style student housing and in-suite bath residence halls facilitate a student's ability to sanitize their own living environment and to isolate in households of two to four residents in times of outbreak.\nThree, student sentiment with regard to a desire to be in the college environment with their peers versus at home with mom and dad even if instruction is being delivered predominantly online.\nAnd four, the continued incremental improvement we see in our overall leasing data, coupled with well above normal velocity compared to the same period prior year with regard to traffic, applications, leases and renewals for the last three, 10 and 20 days at our open market properties as of July 17.\nAs you saw in last night's release, with a range of five to 11 weeks left before the commencement of classes, we are now 90% pre-leased for the upcoming academic year, only 340 basis points behind the prior year.\nWhile the variance to prior year increased from the 230 basis points in our May 31 leasing update, it is worth noting that the variance to prior year at our open market leasing properties have decreased since that time.\nAnd when you review page S8 in our supplemental, the three, 10 and 20-day velocity trends in traffic, applications, leases and renewals would suggest that variance to the prior year should continue to decrease for that core category of properties.\nI'd now like to further break down our cautious optimism in terms of the ongoing risk and opportunities that may negatively or positively impact our final leasing numbers.\nFirst focusing on risk.\nThere are three normal and ordinary risk categories that we routinely manage in each and every annual lease-up.\nThose components are: one, renewal skips; two, students who have asked us to attempt to relet their accommodations so that they may be released from their financial responsibility; and three, no shows.\nIn all three of these risk categories, each year it is our goal to relet prior to the beginning of classes any accommodations that become available due to any of these three reasons.\nA renewal skip is a current period leaseholder that has also signed a renewal lease for the upcoming academic year, but has vacated their apartment and quit paying current rent, thus having skipped out on their current lease and the future lease.\nGiven the definitive actions that they have taken and the certainty that they are not returning for the next academic year, these students are actively removed from our pre-leasing statistics and are not counted as leases in our pre-leasing reports.\nThus far, throughout this lease-up, we have had 178 renewal skips, which is consistent with our historical levels.\nWith regard to potential no shows and relet request, we commenced our no show management and reletting process in late May, early June versus our normal timing in July in an attempt to ferret out, earlier than usual, the number of students who may not be planning to show up in the fall as well as to proactively identify students who wish to have us help them release their accommodations.\nThese potential no shows and relet leases are included in our pre-leasing numbers as they have always been at this time in the lease-up.\nOur normal and ordinary annual process is to diligently attempt to release accommodations subject to both no show and relet request until the very end of the lease-up process.\nAt the very end of the annual lease-up process, we then remove from our final leasing statistics any actual no shows and unsuccessful relets that also never took possession of their accommodations and essentially became a no show.\nAs we have commented to the market over the years, we typically only lose a total of 35 basis points to 60 basis points of final occupancy, with that net loss always having been reflected in the final leasing statistics we report each year.\nTo be clear, our final fall lease-up occupancy average of 97.5% over the years has always been net of the impacts of the process as we just discussed.\nWe've also often commented over the years that we believe one of the reasons our fall occupancies typically exceed the industry average by 200 basis points is our diligent administration of this process versus our peers.\nAs part of this year's efforts to expedite this process, we have undertaken an exhaustive communication process to facilitate engagement with our residents, giving them the opportunity to let us know if there is a possibility that they are not coming.\nWe do not proactively ask directly, are you going to take possession of the unit or are you planning to no show.\nBut rather, we undertake communication and discussions related to the steps and actions required with regard to roommate matching, move-in and other coordinating informational items.\nThis process includes a series of email communications to each resident and their guarantor as well as an attempt to call and actually speak to each resident guarantor.\nAt our properties leased in the open market, we currently have a total of 72,009 leases for fall, with 28,057 being returning renewal residents that have already taken -- already have possession of their units and 43,952 being new incoming leases, with this latter category representing a greater no show risk.\nIn addition to our standard email protocols, which again were implemented earlier than usual this year, we, as of this date, have made a total of 64,029 phone calls and successfully have had direct in-person dialog with 68% of our new incoming leases and 20% of our returning renewals.\nAt this time, our numbers do reflect an increase over the prior year's potential no show and requested relet activity.\nWhile we do know some portion of this increase is due to COVID, we do not yet know to what degree the increase over the same day prior year is directly due to our efforts to expedite the process.\nAs of yesterday, July 20, we have identified 689 potential no shows as compared to 135 in the prior year.\nWith regard to relet request, we currently have 1,563 for the current year as opposed to 956 in the prior year.\nThe combined current year total potential no show relet at this time represents approximately 230 basis points of potential lost occupancy versus 110 basis points in the prior year.\nIn addition, historically, the no show -- the number of no shows typically increase in the first week of August in concert with the first rent installment being due.\nAs an example, last year, the 135 potential no shows as of July 20 hit a high of 446 on August 5 of last year.\nThrough our normal processes, we successfully managed the final impact to only 38 basis points of diminishment due to actual no shows and successful reletting.\nWe will closely monitor rent payments and increases in potential no shows during the first week of August to determine if historical or above normal increases occur or if our efforts to expedite these processes did in fact accelerate identification of potential no shows and relets earlier than usual.\nWell, as of July 20, the combined no show and relet net variance to last year's is 1,161, representing 120 basis points of potential lost occupancy.\nThe ability to relet both no show and relet request in the COVID environment will likely be more challenging.\nThis year, with fewer properties being leased and in many cases -- I'm sorry, this year, with fewer properties being fully leased and in many cases not having a wait list to facilitate this process, we will have to rely mostly on increased traffic, applications and leasing velocity to the prior year that we previously discussed to backfill these potential no shows and relet requests.\nWith regard to opportunities that may further accelerate our leasing velocity beyond historical levels in the late stages of our lease-up, I'd like to discuss universities' fall housing de-densification activities due to COVID.\nAs we have discussed earlier in the summer, of the approximately 470,000 on-campus beds in the 68 owned markets we serve, over 180,000 of those beds are largely in older traditional residence halls with community bathrooms where as many as 20 to 40 students share common sinks, toilets and showers in small confined spaces, a less than ideal product with regard to consumer preference and the ability to control sanitization to minimize the spread of viruses.\nWith many universities looking to de-densify this product type by converting double bedrooms to singles, thus cutting in half the number of students sharing these common restroom and bathing facilities, the potential existed for on-campus capacity to be reduced by as much as 90,000 beds.\nBased upon our tracking of these de-densification activities by the universities we serve, at this time, 48 of the 68 universities served are de-densifying their on-campus housing, resulting in a reduction of 45,800 on-campus beds.\nIn addition, a total of 50 of the 68 universities are taking an additional 9,735 on-campus beds offline to use as quarantine housing should a second wave of coronavirus occur, resulting in an actual total reduction of more than 55,500 beds on campus this fall.\nAs universities are in the final stages of administering these plans and given the fact that to date we have not yet seen a positive variance in velocity in the 48 markets where de-densification is occurring as compared to the 20 where it is not, we are hopeful that we have yet to see the additional off-campus demand that yet may occur.\nWith regard to on-campus densification impacting our own portfolio via compliance with any mandates covering on-campus university housing, we're pleased to report that we have only 1,061 beds impacted at this time, representing only 110 basis points of capacity lost to our portfolio's designed beds.\nI'd also like to briefly touch on the average rental rate increase for the upcoming academic year.\nAt this time, the 90.1% of leases in place are at an average rent of $807 per bed for a 1.6% increase over the prior year in place average rent.\nWhether or not that rate growth increases, decreases or stays largely intact depends upon the rent levels associated with the mix of remaining vacant beds leased, the rent levels associated with leases ultimately not reflected on our final leasing statistics due to final no shows and relapse.\nAs expected, this quarter the operations team was focused on our response to and preparations for operating the portfolio under eight core objectives as outlined by Bill last quarter addressing COVID-19.\nPage S5 of the supplemental highlights our financial performance, which was impacted on the revenue side by rent relief to our residents made either directly or through our university partnerships, followed by wait fees, revenues foregone in our summer camp and conference business and increased reserves for bad debt for our residents.\nThis resulted in property same-store revenues decreasing by 14.2% which we were able to partially offset with savings and operating expenses of 5.7% for a combined NOI decrease of 20.9%.\nIn mid-March, since the virus was officially designated a pandemic, the American Campus team has been transitioning our operational systems to accommodate the new norms amid the coronavirus crisis.\nUnderstanding the different property types in our portfolio was essential to creating mitigation strategies for each properties based on how students circulate through the communities.\nOver 60% of our portfolio is garden style apartment or townhome units which typically feature exterior unit entries and by nature have less interior circulation and common area interaction.\nThe balance of our communities consist of 30% mid-rise products and 9% high-rise buildings that rely on the use of common elevator banks and single point entries which require additional mitigation.\nAs part of our COVID operational plan, we are collaborating with RB, the maker of Lysol, and implementing a comprehensive Be Safe, Be Smart, Do Your Part program.\nOur approach to operating in a pandemic environment can be broken down to four key components: material specifications, operational policies, staff and student education and the promotion of resident accountability and responsibility.\nIn addition to following CDC and EPA guidelines, ACC's collaboration with RB-Lysol will greatly enhance areas of the operational plan.\nThe Be Safe, Be Smart, Do Your Part program began with a touch point analysis of the public spaces in each of our communities.\nSimply put, our operations team evaluated every public area from the building entry throughout the community and identified the high-touch surface areas, in areas where close interaction would occur.\nThis essential analysis, which highlighted single-point entries, door handles, reception desks, elevators, public bathroom fixtures, among others, gave us the information needed to begin implementation of all aspects of the program.\nAntimicrobial surface overlays, which have a chemical response that continuously self-cleans contaminants off the surface were applied to door handles, touch-screens and elevator buttons.\nTo further minimize touch points, ACC has also incorporated door foot pools at some public restrooms, touch-less trash and recycling receptacles, touch-less paper towel dispensers and touch-less soap dispensers.\nHand sanitization stations were placed at entries, amenities and elevator lobbies while sanitization white stations were strategically placed promoting student involvement in the disinfecting of high-touch surface areas.\nThe annual operation expense on these items is approximately $2.5 million to $3 million.\nSignage has been installed to highlight policies that will promote physical distancing, maximum recommended occupancies and best practices.\nWe are also providing our residents at every community with updated rules and regulations addressing COVID-19 resident responsibilities, a student code of conduct that addresses the use of amenity spaces and education for residents to perform a daily wellness self-checklist to assess their health before leaving their student unit.\nACC has also comprehensively overhauled our cleaning policies and procedures.\nWe are proud to have co-written these cleaning policies and procedures with RB-Lysol as the US Environmental Protection Agency recently approved Lysol disinfectant spray as the first product to test effective against the virus that causes COVID-19 when used on hard nonporous surfaces.\nOur revised cleaning regimen, including the frequency of deep clean and high touch-point surface areas has customized products and procedures for each type of functional space in our student housing communities.\nAs we turn in make ready units, we will disinfect with Lysol products and prepare each student unit and bedroom according to the co-written Lysol protocols, and we will place a Lysol clean and confident room seal on the unit and bedroom doors, which will not be broken until the resident renters their unit and bedroom.\nOur operational staff have new policies for safe engagement with residents as well as each other, and have been issued masks, gloves and other equipment along with guidelines for their use.\nWe will also reach out and educate our residents through a healthy living email campaign, virtual brochures and virtual resident life programming.\nOur residence life programming initiatives will support the health and wellness and academic and personal success of our residents.\nWhile education is key to understanding the current environment, perhaps the most critical part of the Be Safe, Be Smart, Do Your Part program is promoting self-accountability and responsibility among our residents.\nAs such, the most important part of collectively mitigating the spread of the virus is the individual actions of our residents.\nFor this unprecedented fall semester, we have physical distancing, sanitization knowledge and personal responsibility practices will become the new behavioral norms for our student residents.\nAlready, we are delighted to see our residents embrace the new personal responsibility policies at our communities.\nBeginning with our 2020 owned development deliveries, I'm pleased to report that we have received all necessary permits for occupancy for all projects expected to be completed for this August, including the second phase of our Disney College Program housing and projects at San Francisco State and USC Health Sciences.\nWhile those developments are targeted to open on time and on budget despite the potential disruption from COVID-19, we are experiencing impacts to targeted occupancy for fall of 2020.\nWith regards to the Disney project, Flamingo Crossings, while Walt Disney World has reopened to limited capacity, based on discussions with Disney, we do not currently anticipate occupancy of the project in 2020 based on their current reopening schedule and labor onboarding.\nWhile the situation remains fluid, we will have 1,600 beds available in August, increasing to 2,600 beds in January 2021 ready to occupy DCP participants once the program recommences.\nThrough the terms of the ground lease, our project has a first fill provision for all DCP participants in the program.\nTo the extent the interim program continues to be suspended for a prolonged period of time, we have the right in the ground lease to open the project to all of Walt Disney World's Orlando based employees along with the additional backup provisions where we have the right to convert the project to a hotel and which Disney has the right to offer and manage as part of their hospitality portfolio.\nEach of these alternate uses has pro forma returns equal to or greater than the development's intended primary use.\nWith regards to San Francisco State University, the university officials have mandated to significantly reduce the amount of on-campus housing available for fall 2020 as part of de-densification efforts.\nOur project is operating under a marketing and license agreement, with San Francisco State performing the leasing administration duties for this academic year.\nAfter discussions with the University, we anticipate that the project will open at 60% capacity and a single occupancy configuration for this fall.\nThere remains the potential to return to fully designed bed capacity for spring and summer 2021, and we will continue to monitor the situation and work closely with the University.\nWith regards to USC Health Sciences phase two, we are currently 72% pre-leased and are working through continued leasing activity and the no show process for fall.\nWe will provide a comprehensive update on all fall deliveries on the Q3 call.\nMoving to our on-campus P3 business.\nWe have a strong pipeline of on-campus development of 10 projects in various levels of pre-development.\nFirst, we anticipate closing and commencement of construction on our third-party project at Georgetown University in Q3 of this year as originally planned.\nHowever, due to the disruptions caused by COVID-19, our third-party projects at Concordia, University of California, Berkeley, Upper Hearst and University of California, Irvine, are anticipated to be delayed until next year.\nWe currently expect to close and commence construction on all three projects in 2021, with Concordia delivering -- with Concordia targeting delivery in fall of 2022 and UC Berkeley and UC Irvine targeting delivery in fall of 2023.\nAnd we continue to make progress in the early stages of pre-development on our previously announced awards at MIT, Virginia Commonwealth University, Princeton, Northeastern, UC Berkeley and West Virginia University.\nThe final structure, scope, feasibility, fees and timing for all projects in pre-development have not yet been finalized.\nOverall, while we have seen some procurement and housing initiatives temporarily delayed and suspended through COVID-19, we continue to pursue numerous active procurements and see a vibrant future pipeline of on-campus development opportunities.\nAs Bill mentioned in his remarks, universities across the country have had to de-densify on-campus housing, with beds impacted consisting primarily of older traditional dorms with community baths.\nConsumer preferences also weighted heavily to more modern apartment and suite style accommodations that more easily allow sanitization and, if needed, isolation to occur within the unit.\nIn addition, due to de-densification, other reduced revenue streams and related financial impacts, universities will utilized off-balance sheet financing structures in order to update their housing stock, including both project based financing as well as equity based models like our ACE program.\nWe expect that the combination of these facts will further accelerate the need for the modernization of outdated on-campus housing, utilizing the P3 financing method, and believe ACC is well positioned as the established best-in-class partner to capitalize on this expanding opportunity.\nIn addition to what we believe will be an expanding opportunity on-campus, ACC is also positioning itself to execute on opportunistic investments that may arise from the COVID-19 crisis and corresponding economic environment.\nGiven that our recent cost of public equity continues to be at disconnect to private market valuations, it is prohibitive for us to execute on the many investments in the current environment.\nAs such, we are expanding our joint venture equity strategy in order to pursue external growth.\nWe have engaged [Indecipherable] financial advisor and are currently in the market to identify equity sources for joint venture or fund in which ACC would invest minimal equity or contribute existing assets as minority GP.\nIn addition to our existing partnership with Allianz, the identification of external equity partners will allow ACC to pursue external growth, off-balance sheet, while also offering further access to liquidity via dispositions if the current economic crisis continues.\nWe plan to utilize this off-balance-sheet structure to execute on our proven core competency of identifying and executing on investment opportunities that drive outsized returns for both ACC and our strategic capital partners.\nACC will benefit in the form of earnings per share and FFO growth to the generation of fees and potential promotes upon outperformance while requiring minimal equity investment to preserve our balance sheet for more accretive investments.\nWe will keep the market up to date as we make progress.\nFinally, looking forward to the fall 2021 academic year, we continue to see favorable reductions in new supply across our owned markets.\nWithin ACC's 68 markets, we are tracking 17,600 beds currently under construction for 2021, with a potential additional 1,200 beds planned, but not yet under construction, reflecting a decline of 14% to 20% in new supply off the current year's decline of 20%.\nEven if all planned beds were delivered for fall of 2021, this is the lowest number of beds delivered in our markets since 2011.\nWe will update the market with respect to these potential deliveries on our third quarter call.\nAs we reported last night, total FFOM for the second quarter of 2020 was $50.9 million or $0.37 per fully diluted share.\nAs has been discussed, Q2 was a quarter significantly impacted by the effects of COVID-19 and the associated governmental shelter in place orders put into effect across the country.\nWhile we cannot completely isolate every item related to the pandemic, we believe approximately $23 million to $24 million in FFOM was lost due to situations surrounding the pandemic this quarter.\nOverall, owned property revenue was $32.4 million negatively impacted by COVID related rent relief, lost summer camp revenue, increased bad debt and waived fees and other items.\nSomewhat offsetting the lost revenue, owned property operating expenses were $8 million lower than originally budgeted as we were able to reduce spend in each area except for the uncontrollables of insurance and property taxes.\nAs a result of the lower than originally budgeted property NOI, ground lease expense was approximately $500,000 less due to a reduction in outperformance rent being paid to our university ground lessor partners.\nAnd joint venture partners' noncontrolling interest in earnings was approximately $1.2 million lower.\nAdditionally, third-party management fee income was approximately $1 million lower and FFOM contribution from our on-campus participating properties was also almost $800,000 lower due to universities refunding a portion of spring rents at properties in both of these business segments.\nLastly, we were able to create approximately $800,000 in G&A and third-party overhead expense savings relative to our original plan for the quarter.\nDue to the continued uncertainty created by the pandemic and the ultimate effect of any actions taken by universities with regard to curriculum delivery for the 2021 academic year, we are not issuing new 2020 earnings guidance at this time.\nWe do however want to make you aware of some additional impacts of the pandemic that you should expect as we close out the current academic year in the first couple of months of the coming quarter.\nJuly will represent the last month of the current in-place leases at a substantial majority of our properties, and we expect delinquencies will not materially differ from recent months.\nWe also have some additional anticipated refunds in our on-campus ACE portfolio for the remainder of the summer term, expected to be in the range of approximately $1.5 million to $2.5 million, which should still keep us within the originally communicated range of expected refunds.\nAnd finally, with regards to other income, we continue to expect a little to no summer camp business, and we are continuing to waive late fees and convenience fees through the remainder of the current academic year, which, combined, is expected to result in the loss of $5 million to $6 million in other income in the third quarter.\nAs William discussed, we now believe it is likely that the three third-party development projects at the University of California, Irvine, Berkley and Concordia University originally scheduled to commence in 2020 will be delayed until 2021.\nThese projects were expected to contribute a combined $4 million in development fee income in 2020.\nWhile there will be some continued financial impacts of the pandemic into the immediate future, the consumer sentiment and university policies Bill discussed give us confidence that longer-term, our operating results will return to normalized levels.\nIn the meantime, we have a strong and healthy balance sheet and substantial liquidity to allow us to absorb the disruption.\nWe further improved the Company's balance sheet liquidity in June with a well-received 10 year $400 million bond offering, using the proceeds to reduce the outstanding balance on the Company's $1 billion revolving credit facility.\nAs of June 30, we had over $800 million of availability on our revolver, with no remaining debt maturities in 2020 and a manageable $167 million in secured mortgage debt maturing in 2021.\nAs detailed on page S15 of our earning supplemental, including all projects currently under development for delivery through 2023, we have only $279 million in remaining development capital needs.\nAs of June 30, the Company's debt to total asset value was 40.9% and net debt to EBITDA was 7.6 times.\nAlthough our leverage ratios are temporarily elevated at this time relative to the targets we have historically communicated due to the short-term COVID related disruption discussed, we feel confident about the capital plan we continue to lay out on page S15, which will bring the Company's debt to total assets back into the mid-30% range and debt to EBITDA back to the high-5 times to low-6 times range.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that Earl joined less than a month ago after the fiscal year end; and although quickly acclimating himself to the business, should you have any questions after today's call, please follow-up with Investor Relations accordingly.\nIt's hard to believe we're already at the close of 2020 and covering our fourth quarter results.\nOn the other hand, we're about to discuss only the second full quarter of COVID-19's impact on our financials.\nIn Q4, we reported revenues of approximately $1.5 billion for the quarter.\nThis represents a 9.9% decline versus last year and a considerable sequential improvement when comparing to our more than 15% decline in Q3.\nOnce again, our diversified client base demonstrates the resilience of our business.\nOur Technology & Manufacturing industry group grew almost 7% and Business & Industry as well as Education posted revenue results that were only slightly down.\nAs one would expect, our Aviation segment drove the majority of our organic decline versus last year.\nTechnical Solutions also saw a large revenue decline and continued to see challenges in site access, which affected churn rates.\nPositively, the backlog of committed work in Technical Solutions is healthy and the pipeline for '21 is robust.\nSo all things considered, it was a good revenue story for the quarter.\nFrom a profit perspective, there was sustained demand for higher margin COVID-related work orders and our enhanced cleaning program, particularly in Business & Industry and Technology & Manufacturing.\nOur financial performance was protected by our variable labor model and our ability to dynamically adjust staffing based on demand, and we continue to see profit arbitrage by efficiently managing labor as we scaled and consolidated staff during the quarter.\nThis has been one of the key contributors of our financial performance through the pandemic.\nAs a result of all of these factors, we grew earnings on both the GAAP and an adjusted basis versus last year.\nIncome from continued operations grew to $53.1 million or $0.78 per share.\nOn an adjusted basis, we delivered $46.7 million or $0.69 per share.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin rose to 6.2% versus 5.6% last year.\nEven more compelling, these results incorporate a non-cash reserve we took for an entertainment-related project within our Technical Solutions segment.\nThis was a unique circumstance in client, and not a reflection of our broader project portfolio within Technical Solutions.\nThis had 120 basis point impact on our adjusted EBITDA margin as well as our earnings.\nSo even when including this distinctive event, quarter-after-quarter, our performance continues to demonstrate consistent strength and execution.\nIn so many ways, 2020 will stand out as a pivotal year for ABM.\nThe pandemic has created a shift in the public mindset as professional Class A janitorial services are now unquestionably viewed as an essential and non-discretionary service.\nFacility owners must demonstrate that they are providing clean, healthy and safe spaces that their occupants can trust.\nNot only will this be required, but it will be a reflection of their brand.\nOur response with our EnhancedClean service, gives our clients the peace of mind that comes with studied protocols and practices that keep facilities safe, and this offering creates even more distance between us and our competitors.\nAs a company that's been around for more than 110 years, ABM has withstood and grown during many global events.\nBut 2020 tested us in historic ways and I've never been more inspired by our organization.\nI want to take a moment to recap some of our team's accomplishments more specifically.\nSince March, we have been on the frontlines battling a pandemic that has disrupted nearly every industry.\nWhile navigating a constantly evolving environment as we learn more about the virus, we prioritized the health and safety of our employees and our clients above all.\nAnd when it came to PPE and our global supply chain, our procurement team did not disappoint when others in our space did, as they couldn't accommodate surging demands.\nAlso, we partnered with large cleaning contractors to form the Cleaning Coalition of America to represent our industry which played a critical role in restoring our country.\nThe Coalition plans to press for vaccine priority for our industry and developed a focused campaign on awareness around what differentiates best-in-class providers.\nAt ABM, we were particularly proud of how we proactively developed our own expert-backed certified programs to answer our client's needs with disinfection protocols, such as specialized training and signage, electrostatic spraying of disinfectant and air filtration.\nAnd all of this is being supported by one of the most comprehensive marketing campaigns we've ever developed.\nWhat shouldn't be minimized is the fact that we mobilized multiple cross-functional task forces across all the critical areas of our business that elevated our adeptness and will endure long past the pandemic.\nThese task forces led to improved operating procedures for labor management, sales and financial activities.\nAs an example, our approach to collections led us to generate more than $450 million in cash flow from operations and $420 million in free cash flow, both records for the firm.\nThis translates to nearly $1 billion of liquidity, including $400 million of cash, which is an extremely powerful position to be in during still uncertain times.\nAs we move into 2021, our intention is to capitalize on the momentum and shift from defense to offense.\nBeginning with our executive team, we recently announced several appointments to further align our internal organizational structure to our business strategies.\nEarl is a seasoned finance executive joining us from Best Buy, a leading Fortune 500 provider of consumer technology products and services with 125,000 employees in North America.\nEarl held several executive positions across finance and most recently he was responsible for leading enterprise capital project planning plus transformation and procurement as well as supporting digital and technology and global real estate.\nDuring his tenure at Best Buy, Earl also spearheaded several strategic initiatives targeting labor and logistics.\nEarl joined less than three weeks ago but is quickly immersing himself in our business.\nI'm also excited that Rene Jacobsen has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer and will lead all of our client-facing industry groups.\nSince joining ABM eight years ago, Rene has consistently driven our operational performance and service excellence and his leadership was unquestionably instrumental in our successful navigation of 2020.\nAs COO, he will provide strategic guidance for our operations and drive our financial results across all of our platforms.\nRene will also continue to work with Sean Mahoney our new President of Sales and Marketing.\nSince Sean's arrival in ABM in 2017, we've broken sales records each succeeding year and we achieved another record in 2020 with new sales at $1.2 billion, an amazing accomplishment for any year but especially in a year when so much of the economy was paused.\nWith both Rene and Sean's leadership, our operations and sales teams proved to be a powerful combination in 2020 and will undoubtedly exceed our expectations in 2021.\nSpeaking of 2021, later in the year, we will be sharing our refresh business strategy which builds on the positive changes and the acceleration we saw with our 2020 vision.\nAt that time, we will be reviewing our technology plan and path toward a digital platform for our employees and clients.\nIn fact, just as I discussed last quarter, some of our near-term investments are reengagements of IT projects that were put on hold due to the pandemic, like our ERP system and data management roadmap.\nOther investments will be new given the opportunities that arose as a result of the pandemic such as EnhancedClean and the associated build of that program.\nOn that front, from a payback standpoint, we concluded the year with over $300 million in sales for our EnhancedClean program and COVID-related activities.\nAnd we have some really exciting sales and marketing plans lined up over the next few months to continue accelerating and differentiating ourselves in the marketplace.\nOf course, we will be responsible for our investment approach given how smooth the operating environment is but we recognize that we must plan for the long-term while also keeping our maniacal focus on what the near term may bring.\nThere's no doubt that conditions remain uncertain, particularly as we operate over the winter months.\nCOVID cases continue to rise throughout the country and I'm sure you've seen or experienced various stages of closures in your own communities.\nUnfortunately, the operating environment isn't any more predictable than it was last quarter.\nClients are still generally managing for the shorter term as they react to resurgences, which caused occupancy volatility and they don't yet have the ability to predict when the workforce at large will return.\nWhile vaccine news is encouraging, the widespread availability and use is also unknown today, which could impact the timing of recoveries and reopenings.\nTherefore, our visibility remains limited and, as you would expect, we are not providing guidance for the full fiscal year in 2021.\nHowever, we are going to share our near-term expectations for the first fiscal quarter.\nThis is the only time we anticipate guiding to such a short-term view, given the uniqueness of the moment.\nFor the first quarter, we expect GAAP earnings per share of $0.53 to $0.58 in earnings per diluted share or adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 to $0.65 per diluted share.\nThese ranges compare to last year's $0.41 and $0.39 respectively, both considerable increases on a year-over-year basis.\nWe also expect adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 6.1% to 6.4%, expanding from 4.3% last year.\nAt this time, we believe we may have seen the bottom in revenue compression as a result of COVID-19.\nSequentially, we could see similar to slightly better organic declines than what we saw in Q4.\nWe also anticipate good demand for pandemic-related work orders and EnhancedClean to continue throughout Q1.\nThe investments I discussed earlier should also continue into Q1, which you will see in both our segment profit and corporate lines.\nIn general, investments will continue throughout fiscal 2021 but the magnitude and cadence will be determined by both our long-term strategy and where we see the broader recovery going.\nEarl will go through more detail on some of the assumptions for the quarter and year, which is obviously still dynamic.\nShould we have better line of sight for the full year by Q2, we would anticipate providing full year guidance at that time.\nThis purpose has never meant more than it does today.\nOur value to clients has risen because our teams have been the ambassadors of our brands and demonstrated the operational excellence that sets ABM apart from our competitors.\nNine months ago, we couldn't have imagined how 2020 would culminate for ABM.\nWe not only exceeded our pre-COVID expectations, but actually accelerated into a long-term EBITDA margin range of 5.5% to 6%.\nOur 2020 vision journey has come to a climactic transition, leading us into the next phase of growth and excellence and building on a strong foundation to propel us into the future.\nNext year, we'll also mark our 50th anniversary on the New York Stock Exchange and we look forward to celebrating this milestone at ABM's history.\nSo, while last year was certainly a memorable one for our organization, I'm now looking forward to the opportunities that lie ahead and I am more excited than ever.\nNow, to Earl, who'll cover our financial results.\nI am so excited to be part of the ABM team.\nI recognized early on that the culture here is so special and unique.\nEven in just my first few weeks here, I have witnessed an exceptional drive to collaborate and execute that clearly sets ABM apart.\nAs I spend the next several months diving into the business, I look forward to developing and sharing my perspectives on our financial strategies over future calls.\nNow, onto our quarterly results.\nRevenue for the quarter were $1.5 billion, a total decrease of approximately 9.9% compared to last year, reflecting our second full quarter of COVID-19 revenue declines, particularly in the Aviation and Technical Solutions segment.\nPartially offsetting this revenue decline was continued demand for higher margin work orders that we have been providing for our clients through the pandemic, particularly within business and industry and technology and manufacturing.\nGAAP income from continuing operations was $53.1 million or $0.78 per diluted share compared to $48.1 million or $0.71 last year.\nThese results reflect the continuation of favorable claims trend related to health insurance reserves.\nWe saw a benefit of $21.3 million in self-insurance adjustments, of which $6.2 million was related to the current year.\nOn an adjusted basis, income from continued operations for the quarter increased to $46.7 million or $0.69 per diluted share compared to $44.7 million or $0.66 last year.\nSimilar to the third quarter, our GAAP and adjusted earnings growth versus last year was driven primarily by a significant increase in higher margin work orders as clients respond to COVID-19 as well as the continued management of direct labor to align with the demand environment for legacy services.\nPartially offsetting these results was a $17.6 million reserve for notes receivables for a project related to a unique family entertainment customer within the Technical Solutions segment.\nWe are currently working with the client to resolve this issue.\nIn addition, operational investments in such areas as our EnhancedClean program continued, which was embedded in our operating segment results.\nWe also reengaged certain corporate projects such as investments in IT, that were previously put on hold as we prioritized business continuity during the pandemic.\nThis amount was approximately $10 million for the quarter.\nOn a year-over-year basis, the fourth quarter also experienced one less workday which equates to approximately $6 million in labor expense savings.\nI'll speak about the cadence of our working days for fiscal 2021 later in the call.\nBut the number of days in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 will be comparable at 65 days.\nOur overall performance during the quarter led to adjusted EBITDA of approximately $92.5 million at a margin rate of 6.2% compared to $93 million or 5.6% last year.\nNow, for a discussion of our segment results.\nAs a reminder, these results reflect the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on revenue.\nOperating profit reflects the mix shift toward higher margin work orders, labor modulation on legacy service demand, as well as operational investments such as EnhancedClean.\nB&I revenues were $794.3 million, down just 1.6%.\nWe're encouraged by the sequential top line improvement compared to a decline of 6.3% last quarter.\nThe pandemic's negative impact on our parking and sports and entertainment business continued this quarter, similar to Q3.\nOffsetting this COVID compression and the loss of some lower margin business, we had consistently strong demand for higher margins pandemic-related work orders.\nThis led to a more favourable mix of B&I business that led to operating profit growth of more than 65% to $84.7 million with a margin rate of 10.7%.\nAnother very resilient segment for us during the pandemic has been our T&M business.\nRevenues were $245.5 million for the quarter, up 6.7% versus last year.\nOperating profit grew more than 30% to $23.5 million for an operating margin of 9.6%.\nThis segment is particularly comprised of essential service providers such as biopharma, logistics and industrial manufacturing.\nAs a result, demand has been driven by work order and EnhancedClean work, more than offsetting any COVID-related and other account losses throughout the year.\nIn education, we reported revenue of $212.2 million, reflecting the new school season and the adoption of hybrid models across our K-12 and higher education portfolios.\nOperating profit of $15.1 million or 7.1% margin reflects labor-related savings as a result of modified staffing at site locations during the pandemic.\nAs many of us are likely experiencing today with our own children, there remains a great deal of variability in this segment as different cities respond to resurgences, particularly ahead of the holiday season.\nWe continue to monitor developments and partner with our clients to address both day-to-day cleaning and disinfection needs, as well as longer term budget constraints, where our technical solutions offering can be compelling.\nAviation reported revenues of $141 million, and an operating profit of $3.5 million, clearly demonstrating how the pandemic continues to have a dramatic impact on the industry.\nHowever, as discussed last quarter, our goal was to achieve a breakeven position or better by the fourth quarter.\nWe are pleased to have closed the year in a profitable position.\nAnd now onto Technical Solutions, which reported revenues of $123.1 million compared to $175.5 million last year.\nAs a reminder, this segment experienced phenomenal growth last year, exceeding 25% during Q4 of fiscal '19.\nIn addition to tougher compare, site access has been disrupted by the pandemic.\nBacklog remains in our healthy zone, which we've historically defined as above the $150 million.\nWe are actively monitoring our ability to churn through these projects.\nThe operating loss of $3.6 million was driven by a reserve of notes receivables related to a single entertainment customer and associated with the client increasing credit risk resulting from the pandemic, which we continue to pursue.\nTurning to cash and liquidity.\nDuring the quarter, we generated a record $198.7 million in cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $189.6 million for the quarter.\nThis led to $457.5 million in cash flow and $419.5 million of free cash flow for the year.\nAs a reminder, these results include $101 million in deferred U.S. payroll taxes as a result of the CARES Act, which will be due in 2021 and 2022.\nEven excluding this, these are records for the year.\nDue to our strong cash position, we ended the quarter with total debt, including standby letters of credit of $883.4 million and a bank adjusted leverage ratio of 2.1 times.\nAdditionally, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $394.2 million.\nDuring the quarter, we paid our 218th consecutive quarterly cash dividend for a total distribution of approximately $12.3 million.\nNow, for a quick recap of our annual results.\nTotal revenues were approximately $6 billion, a decrease of 7.9% versus last year.\nThe decrease in revenues was attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on business operations, predominately during the third and fourth quarters of this year.\nOur GAAP income from continuing operations for fiscal 2020 was $0.2 million.\nOn an adjusted basis, income from continuing operations for the year was $163.5 million or $2.43 per diluted share.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year increased 6.6% to $361.9 million and we ended the fiscal year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 6%.\nNow, turning to our guidance outlook.\nWe are providing guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2021.\nAt this time, we expect GAAP earnings per share to be in a range of $0.53 to $0.58 and adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.60 to $0.65.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin is anticipated to be between 6.1% to 6.4%.\nThis guidance outlook assumes organic growth will be sequentially flat to slightly improved versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nWe anticipate a higher margin work orders and labor efficiencies to continue into the first quarter.\nAnd as Scott discussed extensively, we are planning to invest in fiscal 2021.\nThe first quarter will see the same level of investments that we saw during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 of approximately $10 million.\nThe first quarter will also have one less working day versus last year, which could lead to approximately $6 million in lower labor expense.\nHowever, we are preparing for the potential for higher payroll taxes beginning in January for SUI, FUI, as well as federal taxes such as FICA.\nWith respect to interest, based on our operating expectations for the first quarter and our current cash position, we do not anticipate an increase in borrowings compared to the fourth quarter.\nTherefore, sequentially, interest expense should decrease slightly due to the continuing amortization of our term loan.\nThe tax rate for the quarter is anticipated to be approximately 30%.\nThis rate excludes discrete tax items such as the work opportunity tax credit and a tax impact of stock-based compensation awards, the total impact of which we currently expect will be under $1 million in Q1.\nWith respect to cash flow, we assume government-related benefits in the U.K. and U.S., such as the CARES Act, will not recur.\nThis should be considered when ascertaining free cash flow for the new fiscal year.\nHowever, we drove higher free cash flow as a result of sharper operational practices in response to the pandemic.\nAnd we intend to continue to uphold these standards and disciplines.\nLastly, related to taxes, in fiscal '20, our full-year impact for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit was $4 million, reflecting the pandemic's impact on traditional hiring practices.\nCurrently, WATSI [phonetic] is expected to expire on December 31 of this calendar year.\nHowever, we are actively monitoring Congress for related action, including an extension on WATSI.\nOn the heels of such strong results for 2020, I look forward to sharing more with you over the coming quarters.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are based on management's current expectations.\nActual performance and events may differ materially.\nFactors that could cause results to differ include factors described in our third quarter 2021 report on Form 10-Q, our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and other recent filings made with the SEC.\nAdditionally, some remarks may refer to non-GAAP financial measures.\nI'm pleased to report that AIG had another outstanding quarter as we continue to build momentum and execute on our strategic priorities.\nWe continue to drive underwriting excellence across our portfolio.\nWe're executing on AIG 200 to instill operational excellence in everything we do.\nWe are continuing to work on the separation of life and retirement from AIG.\nAnd we're demonstrating an ongoing commitment to thoughtful capital management.\nI will start my remarks with an overview of our consolidated financial results for the third quarter.\nI will then review our results for general insurance, where we continue to demonstrate market leadership in solving risk issues for clients while delivering improved underwriting profitability and more consistent results.\nI'll also comment on certain market dynamics, particularly in the property market, as well as recent CAT activity and related reinsurance considerations as we approach year-end.\nNext, I'll review results from our life and retirement business, which we continue to prepare to be a stand-alone company.\nI will also provide an update on the considerable progress we're making on the operational separation of life and retirement from AIG and our strong execution of AIG 200.\nI will then review capital management, where our near-term priorities remain unchanged from those I have outlined in the past: debt reduction, return of capital to shareholders, investment in our business through organic growth and operational improvements.\nFinally, I will conclude with our recently announced senior executive changes that further position AIG for the long term.\nThese appointments were possible due to the strong bench of internal talent and significantly augment the leadership team across our company.\nStarting with our consolidated results.\nAs I said, AIG had another outstanding quarter, continuing the terrific trends we've experienced throughout 2021.\nAgainst the backdrop of a very active CAT season and the persistent and ongoing global pandemic, our global team of colleagues continue to perform at an incredibly high level, delivering value to our clients, policyholders and distribution partners.\nAdjusted after-tax income in the third quarter was $0.97 per diluted share compared to $0.81 in the prior-year quarter.\nThis result was driven by significant improvement in profitability in general insurance, very good results in life and retirement, continued expense discipline and savings from AIG 200 and executing on our capital management strategy.\nIn general insurance, global commercial drove strong top line growth.\nAnd we were especially pleased with our adjusted accident year combined ratio, which improved 280 basis points year over year to 90.5%.\nThese excellent results in general insurance validate the strategy we've been executing on to vastly improve the quality of our portfolio and build a top-performing culture of disciplined underwriting.\nOne data point that I believe demonstrates the incredible progress we have made is our accident year combined ratio for the first nine months of 2021, which was 97.7%.\nThis represents a 770-basis-point improvement year over year, with 600 of that improvement coming from the loss ratio and 170 from the expense ratio.\nIn life and retirement, we again had solid results primarily driven by improved investment performance and increased call and tender income.\nThis business delivered a return on adjusted segment common equity of 12.2% for the third quarter and 14.3% for the first nine months of the year.\nAnd we recently achieved an important milestone in the separation process by closing the sale of a 9.9% equity stake in life and retirement to Blackstone for $2.2 billion in cash.\nWe continue to prepare the business for an IPO in 2022 and we'll begin moving certain assets under management to Blackstone.\nWe ended the third quarter with $5.3 billion in parent liquidity after redeeming $1.5 billion in debt outstanding and completing $1.1 billion in share repurchases.\nYear-to-date, we have reduced financial debt outstanding by $3.4 billion and have returned $2.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nWe expect to redeem or repurchase an additional $1 billion of debt in the fourth quarter and to repurchase a minimum of $900 million of common stock through year-end to complete the $2 billion of stock repurchase we announced on our last call.\nThrough these actions, we've made clear our continuing commitment to remain active and thoughtful about capital management.\nNow, let me provide more detail on our business results in the third quarter.\nI will start with general insurance, where, as I mentioned earlier, growth in net premiums written continued to be very strong and we achieved our 13th consecutive quarter of improvement in the adjusted accident year combined ratio.\nAdjusting for foreign exchange, net premiums written increased 10% year over year to $6.6 billion.\nThis growth was driven by global commercial, which increased 15%, with personal insurance flat for the quarter.\nGrowth in commercial was balanced between North America and International, with North America increasing 18% and International increasing 12%.\nGrowth in North America commercial was driven by excess casualty, which increased over 50%; Lexington Wholesale, which continued to show leadership in the E&S market and grew Property and Casualty by over 30%; financial lines, which increased over 20%; and Crop Risk Services, which grew more than 50% driven by increased commodity prices.\nIn international commercial, financial lines grew 25%, Talbot had over 15% growth and Liability had over 10% growth.\nIn addition, gross new business in global commercial grew 40% year over year to over $1 billion.\nIn North America, new business growth was more than 50% and in International, it was more than 25%.\nNorth America new business was strongest in Lexington, financial lines and retail property.\nInternational new business came mostly from financial lines and our specialty businesses.\nWe also had very strong retention in our in-force portfolio, with North America improving retention by 200 basis points and International improving retention by 700 basis points.\nStrong momentum continued with overall global commercial rate increases of 12%.\nIn many cases, this is the third year where we have achieved double-digit rate increases in our portfolio.\nNorth America commercial's overall 11% rate increases were balanced across the portfolio and led by excess casualty, which increased over 15%.\nFinancial lines, which also increased over 15% and Canada, where rates increased by 17%, representing the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit rate increases.\nInternational commercial rate increases were 13% driven by EMEA, excluding specialty, which increased by 22%.\nU.K., excluding specialty, which increased 21%.\nFinancial lines, which increased 24% and Energy, which was up 14%, its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit rate increases.\nTurning to global personal insurance.\nWe had a solid quarter that reflected a modest rebound in net premiums written in travel and warranty, offset by results in the private client group due to reinsurance cessions related to Syndicate 2019 and non-renewals in peak zones.\nShifting to underwriting profitability.\nAs I noted earlier, general insurance's accident year combined ratio ex CAT was 90.5%.\nThe third quarter saw a 150-basis-point improvement in the accident year loss ratio ex CAT and a 130-basis-point improvement in the expense ratio, all of which came from the GOE ratio.\nThese results were driven by our improved portfolio mix, achieving rate in excess of loss cost trends, continued expense discipline and benefits from AIG 200.\nGlobal commercial achieved an impressive accident year combined ratio ex CATs of 88.9%, an improvement of 290 basis points year over year and the second consecutive quarter with a sub-90% combined ratio result.\nThe accident year combined ratio ex CAT for North America commercial and international commercial were 90.5% and 86.8%, respectively, an improvement of 370 basis points and 210 basis points.\nIn global personal insurance, the accident year combined ratio ex CATs was 94.2%, an improvement of 220 basis points year over year driven by improvement in the expense ratio.\nGiven the significant progress we have made to improve our combined ratios and our view that the momentum we have will continue for the foreseeable future, we now expect to achieve a sub-90% accident year combined ratio ex CAT for full year 2022.\nAfter three years of significant underwriting margin improvement, we believe that the sub-90% accident year combined ratio ex CAT is something that not only will be achieved for full year 2022, but that there will continue to be runway for further improvement in future years.\nAs I said earlier, the third quarter was very active, with current industry estimates ranging between $45 billion and $55 billion globally.\nWe reported approximately $625 million of net global CAT losses with approximately $530 million in commercial.\nThe largest impacts were from Hurricane Ida and flooding in Europe, where we saw net CAT losses of approximately $400 million and $190 million, respectively.\nWe have put significant management focus into our reinsurance program, which continues to perform exceptionally well to reduce volatility, including strategic purchases for wind that we made in the second quarter.\nReinsurance recoveries in our International per occurrence, private client group per occurrence and other discrete reinsurance programs also reduced volatility in the third quarter.\nWe expect any fourth quarter CAT losses to be limited given that we are close to attaching on our North America aggregate cover and our aggregate cover for rest of the world, excluding Japan.\nWe have each and every loss deductibles of $75 million for North America wind, $50 million for North America earthquake and $25 million for all other North America perils and $20 million for international.\nOur worldwide retention has approximately $175 million remaining before attaching in the aggregate, which would essentially be for Japan CAT.\nSince 2012 and excluding COVID, there have been 10 CATs with losses exceeding $10 billion.\nAnd nine of those 10 occurred in 2017 through the third quarter of this year.\nAverage CAT losses over the last five years have been $114 billion, up 30% from the 10-year average and up 40% from the 15-year average.\nAnd through 2021, catastrophe losses exceed $100 billion and we're already at $90 billion through the third quarter.\nThis will be the fourth year in the last five years in which natural catastrophes have exceeded this threshold.\nI'll make three observations.\nFirst, while CAT models tended to trend acceptable over the last 20 years, that has not been the case over the last five years.\nSecond, over the last five years, on average, models have been 20% to 30% below the expected value at the lower return periods.\nIf you add in wildfire, those numbers dramatically increase.\nThird, industry losses compared to model losses at the low end of the curve have been deficient and need rate adjustments to reflect the significant increase in frequency in CATs.\nTo address these issues, at AIG, we've invested heavily in our CAT research team to develop our own view of risk in this new environment.\nwind, storm surge, flood as well as numerous other perils in international.\nWe will continue to leverage new scientific studies, improvements in vendor model work and our own claims data to calibrate our views on risk over time to ensure we're appropriately pricing CAT risks.\nAcross our portfolio, our strategy and primary focus has been and will continue to be to deliver risk solutions that meet our clients' needs while aligning within our risk appetite, which takes into consideration terms and conditions, strategic deployment of limits and a recognition of increased frequency and severity.\nThe significant focus that we've been applying to the critical work we've been doing is showing through in our financial results as you've seen over the course of 2021 with improving combined ratios, both including and excluding CATs.\nNow, turning to life and retirement.\nEarnings continue to be strong and in the third quarter were supported by stable equity markets, modestly improving interest rates relative to the second quarter and significant call and tender income.\nAdjusted pre-tax income in the third quarter was approximately $875 million.\nIndividual retirement, excluding retail mutual funds, which we sold in the third quarter, maintained its upward trajectory with 27% growth in sales year over year.\nOur largest retail product, Index Annuity, was up 50% compared to the prior-year quarter.\nGroup retirement collectively grew deposits 3% with new group acquisitions ahead of prior year but below a robust second quarter.\nKevin and his team continued to actively manage the impacts from a low interest rate and tighter credit spreads environment and their earlier provided range for expected annual spread compression has not changed as base investment spreads for the third quarter were within the annual 8 to 6 points guidance.\nWith respect to the operational separation of life and retirement, we continue to make considerable progress on a number of fronts.\nOur goal is to deliver a clean separation with minimal business disruption and emphasis on speed execution, operational efficiency and thoughtful talent allocation.\nWe have many work streams in execution mode, including designing a target operating model that will position life and retirement to be a successful stand-alone public company, separating IT systems, data centers, software applications, real estate and material vendor contracts and determining where transition services will be required and minimizing their duration with clear exit plans.\nWe continue to expect an IPO to occur in the first quarter of 2022 or potentially in the second quarter, subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions.\nAs I mentioned on our last call, due to the sale of our affordable housing portfolio and the execution of certain tax strategies, we are no longer constrained in terms of how much of life and retirement we can sell on an IPO.\nHaving said that, we currently expect to retain a greater than 50% interest immediately following the IPO and to continue to consolidate life and retirement's financial statements until such time as we fall below the 50% ownership threshold.\nAs we plan for the full separation of life and retirement, the timing of further secondary offerings will be based on market conditions and other relevant factors over time.\nWith respect to AIG 200, we continue to advance this program and remain on track to deliver $1 billion in run rate savings across the company by the end of 2022 against a cost to achieve of $1.3 billion.\n$660 million of run rate savings are already executed or contracted, with approximately $400 million recognized to date in our income statement.\nAs with the underwriting turnaround, which created a culture of underwriting excellence, AIG 200 is creating a culture of operational excellence that is becoming the way we work across AIG.\nBefore turning the call over to Mark, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the senior leadership changes we announced last week.\nHaving made significant progress during the first nine months of 2021 across our strategic priorities and in light of the momentum we have heading toward the end of the year, this was an ideal time to make these appointments.\nI'll start with Mark, who will step into a newly created role, global Chief Actuary and Head of Portfolio Management for AIG on January 1.\nAs you all know, over the last three years, Mark has played a critical role in the repositioning of AIG.\nHe originally joined AIG in 2018 as our chief actuary.\nAnd this new role will get him back into the core of our business, driving portfolio improvement, growth and prudent decision-making by providing guidance on important performance metrics within our risk appetite and evolving our reinsurance program.\nShane Fitzsimons will take over for Mark as chief financial officer on January 1.\nShane joined AIG in 2019 and his strong leadership helped accelerate aspects of AIG 200 and instill discipline and rigor around our finance transformation, strategic planning, budgeting and forecasting processes.\nHe has a strong financial and accounting background having worked at GE for over 20 years in many senior finance roles, including as Head of FP&A and chief financial officer of GE's international operations.\nShane has already begun working with Mark on a transition plan and we've shifted his AIG 200 and shared services responsibility to other senior leaders.\nWe also announced that Elias Habayeb has been named chief financial officer of life and retirement.\nElias has been with AIG for over 15 years and was most recently our Deputy CFO and Principal Accounting Officer for AIG as well as the CFO for general insurance.\nElias has deep expertise about AIG.\nAnd his transition to life and retirement will be seamless as he is well known to that management team, the investments team that is now part of life and retirement, our regulators, rating agencies and many other stakeholders.\nOverall, I am very pleased with our team, our third quarter results and the tremendous progress we're making on many fronts across AIG.\nI am extremely pleased with the strong adjusted earnings this quarter of $0.97 per share and our profitable general insurance calendar quarter combined ratio, which includes CATs, of 99.7%.\nThe year over year adjusted earnings per share improvement was driven by a 750-basis-point reduction in the general insurance calendar quarter combined ratio, strong growth in net premiums written and earned and a related 280-basis-point decrease in the underlying accident year combined ratio ex CAT.\nlife and retirement also produced strong APTI of $877 million, along with a healthy adjusted ROE of 12.2%.\nThe quarter's strong operating earnings and consistent investment performance helped increase adjusted book value per share by 3% sequentially and nearly 9% compared to one year ago.\nThe strength of our balance sheet and strong liquidity position were highlights in the period as we made continued progress on our leverage goals with a GAAP debt leverage reduction of 90 basis points sequentially and 350 basis points from one year ago today to 26.1%, generated through retained earnings and liability management actions.\nShifting to general insurance.\nDue to our achieved profitable growth to date, together with demonstrable volatility reduction and smart cycle management, makes us even more confident in achieving our stated goal of a sub-90% accident year combined ratio ex CAT for full year 2022 rather than just exiting 2022.\nShifting now to current conditions.\nThe markets in which we operate persist in strength and show resiliency.\nAIG's global platform continues to see rate strengthening internationally, which adds to our overall uplift unlike more U.S.-centric competitors.\nAs you recall, international commercial rate increases lagged those in North America initially.\nBut beginning in 2021, as noted by Peter in his remarks, International is now producing rate increases that surpass those strong rates still being achieved in North America and in some areas, meaningfully so.\nThese rate increases continue to outstrip loss cost trends on a global basis across a broadband of assumptions and are additive toward additional margin expansion.\nIn fact, for a more extensive view, within North America over the three year period, 2019 through 2021, product lines that achieved cumulative rate increases near or above 100% are found within excess casualty, both admitted and non-admitted.\nProperty lines, both admitted and non-admitted and financial lines.\nWe believe these levels of tailwind will continue driving earned margin expansion into the foreseeable future.\nIn the current inflationary environment, it's important to remember that products with inflation-sensitive exposure bases, such as sales, receipts and payroll, act as an inflation mitigant and furthermore are subject to additional audit premiums as the economy recovers.\nLast quarter, we provided commentary about U.S. portfolio loss cost trends of 4% to 5% and in some aspects were viewed as being near term.\nWe believe that this range still holds but now gravitates toward the upper end given another quarter of data.\nAnd in fact, our U.S. loss cost trends range from approximately three and a half percent to 10%, depending on the line of business.\nFrom a pricing perspective, we feel that we are integrating these near-term inflationary impact into our rating and portfolio tools.\nAnd we are not lowering any line of business loss cost trends since lighter claims reporting may be misconstrued as a false positive due to COVID-19 societal impacts.\nIt's also worth noting that all of our North America commercial Lines loss cost trends, with the exception of workers' compensation, are materially lower than the corresponding rate increases we are seeing.\nThis discussion around compound rate increases and loss cost trends collectively give rise to the related topic of current year loss ratio picks or indications and the result in bookings.\nThe strong market that we now enjoy, in conjunction with the significant underwriting transformation at AIG, has driven other aspects of the portfolio that affect loss ratios.\nIn many lines and classes of business, the degree that cumulative rate changes have outpaced cumulative loss cost trend is substantial.\nAnd these lead to meaningfully reduced loss ratio indications between 2018 and the 2021 years.\nUnfortunately, this is where most discussions usually cease with external stakeholders.\nHowever, in reality, that is not the end of the discussion but merely the beginning.\nSome other aspects that can have material favorable implications toward the profitability of underlying businesses are, one, terms and conditions, which can rival price in the impact.\nTwo, a much more balanced submission flow across the insured risk quality spectrum, thereby improving rate adequacy and mitigating adverse selection.\nThree, strategic capacity deployment across various layers of an insurance tower, which can produce preferred positioning and ongoing retention with the customer.\nAnd fourth, reinsurance that tempers volatility and mitigates net losses.\nAccordingly, even if modest loss ratio beneficial impacts are assigned to each of these nuances, they will additionally contribute to further driving down the 2021 indicated loss ratio beyond that signaled by rate versus loss trend alone.\nAnd these are real and these are happening.\nSo why are product lines booked at this implied level of profitability by any insurer?\nWell, there is at least four reasons.\nFirst, insurers assume the heterogeneous risk of others and each year is composed of different exposures, rendering so-called on-level projections to be imperfect.\nSecond, most policies are written on an occurrence basis, which means the policy language can be challenged for years, if not decades, potentially including novel series of liability.\nThird, many lines are extremely volatile and even if every insured is underwritten perfectly -- even if every insured is underwritten perfectly.\nAnd fourth, booking an overly optimistic initial loss ratio merely increases the chance of future unfavorable development.\nTherefore, these types of issues require prudence in the establishment of initial loss ratio picks for most commercial lines of business.\nShifting now to our third quarter reserve review.\nApproximately $42 billion of reserves were reviewed this quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately 90% of carried pre-ADC reserves.\nI'd like to spend a little time taking you through the results of our quarterly reserve analysis, which resulted in minimal net movement, confirming the strength of our overall reserve position.\nOn a pre-ADC basis, the prior-year development was $153 million favorable.\nOn a post-ADC basis, it was $3 million favorable.\nAnd when reflecting the $47 million ADC amortization on the deferred gain, it was $50 million favorable in total.\nThis means that our overall reserves continue to be adequate, with favorable and unfavorable development balanced across lines of business, resulting in an improved yet neutral alignment of reserves.\nNow, before looking at the quarter on a segment basis, I'd like to strip away some noise that's in the quarter so we don't get overly lost in the details.\nOne should think of this quarter's reserve analysis as performing all of the scheduled product reviews and then having to overlay two seemingly unrelated impacts caused by the receipt of a large subrogation recovery associated with the 2017 and 2018 California wildfires.\nThe first of these two impacts is the direct reduction from North America personal insurance reserves of $326 million, resulting from the subrogation recoveries.\nAs a result, we also had to reverse a previously recorded 2018 accident year reinsurance recovery in North America commercial Insurance of $206 million since the attachment point was no longer penetrated once the subrogation recoveries were received.\nThese two impacts from the subrogation recovery resulted in a net $120 million of favorable development.\nSo excluding their impact restates the total general insurance PYD as being $70 million unfavorable in total rather than the $50 million of favorable development discussed earlier.\nThis is a better framework to discuss the true underlying reserve movements this quarter.\nThis $70 million of global unfavorable stems from $85 million unfavorable in global CAT losses together with $50 million favorable in global non-CAT or attritional losses.\nThe $85 million unfavorable in CAT is driven by marginal adjustments involving multiple prior-year events from 2019 and 2020.\nThe $15 million non-CAT favorable stems from the net of $255 million unfavorable from global commercial and $270 million of favorable development, predominantly from short-tail personal lines businesses within accident year 2020, mostly in our International book.\nConsistent with our overall reserving philosophy, we were cautious toward reacting to this $270 million favorable indication until we allow the accident year to season.\nNorth America commercial had unfavorable development of $112 million, which was driven by financial lines' strengthening of approximately $400 million with favorable development and other lines led by workers' compensation with approximately $200 million, emanating mostly from accident years 2015 and prior and approximately $100 million across various other units.\nNorth America financial lines were negatively impacted by primary public D&O, largely in the more complex national accounts arena and within private not-for-profit D&O unit, in addition to some excess coverage mostly in the public D&O space, with 90% emanating from accident years 2016 to 2018.\nInternational commercial had unfavorable development of $143 million, which was comprised of financial lines' strengthening in D&O and professional indemnity of approximately $300 million led by the U.K. and Europe, but the accident year impacts are more spread out.\nFavorable development was led by our specialty businesses at roughly $110 million with an additional favorable of approximately $50 million stemming from various lines and regions.\nNow, as Peter noted, the changes we've made to our underwriting culture and risk appetite over the last few years, coupled with strong market conditions, are now showing through in our financial results.\nU.S. financial lines, in particular, through careful underwriting and risk selection has meaningfully reduced our exposure to securities class actions or SCA lawsuits over the last few years.\nEvidence of this underwriting change is best seen through the proportion of SCAs for which the U.S. operation has provided coverage.\nIn 2017, AIG provided D&O coverage to 67 insurers involved in SCAs, which represents 42% of all U.S. federal security class actions in that year.\nWhereas in 2020, that shrunk to just 18% and through nine months of 2021 is only 15 insurers or 14%.\nThis is significant because roughly 60% to 70% of public D&O loss dollars historically emanate from SCAs.\nThe North America private not-for-profit D&O book has also been significantly transformed.\nThe policy retention rate here between 2018 and 2021, which is a key strategic target, is just 15%.\nAnd yet it should also be noted that the corresponding cumulative rate increase over the same period is nearly 130%.\nThis purposeful change in risk selection criteria away from billion-dollar revenue large private companies and nonprofit universities and hospitals to instead a more balanced middle market book will also drive profitability substantially.\nInternational financial lines has implemented similar underwriting actions with comparable three year cumulative rate increases, along with a singular underwriting authority around the world as respect U.S.-listed D&O exposure through close collaboration with the U.S. Chief Underwriting Office.\nIn summary, our reserving philosophy remains consistent in that we will continue to be prudent and conservative.\nThis is evidenced by our slower recognition of attritional improvements in short-tail lines from accident year 2020 and from the sound decision to strengthen Financial Line reserves, even though there are some interpretive challenges stemming from a difficult claims environment, changes within our internal claims operations over the last couple of years and potential COVID-19 impacts on claim reporting patterns.\nAll of these underwriting actions we've taken over the last few years make us even more confident in our total reserve position across both prior and current accident years.\nMoving on to life and retirement.\nThe year-to-date ROE has been a strong 14.3% compared to 12.8% in the first nine months of last year.\nAPTI during the third quarter saw higher net investment income and higher fee income, offset by the unfavorable impact from the annual actuarial assumption update, which is $166 million pre-tax, negatively affected the ROE by approximately 250 basis points on an annual basis and earnings per share by $0.15 per share.\nThe main source of the impact was in the Individual retirement division associated with fixed annuity spread compression.\nlife insurance reflected a slightly elevated COVID-19-related mortality provision in the quarter.\nBut our exposure sensitivity of $65 million to $75 million per 100,000 population deaths proved accurate based on the reported third quarter COVID-related deaths in the United States.\nMortality exclusive of COVID-19 was also slightly elevated in the period.\nWithin Individual retirement, excluding the Retail Mutual Fund business, net flows were a positive $250 million this quarter compared to net outflows of $110 million in the prior-year quarter largely due to the recovery from the broad industrywide sales disruption resulting from COVID-19, which we view as a material rebound indicator.\nPrior sensitivities in respect to yield and equity market movements affecting APTI continue to hold true.\nAnd new business margins generally remain within our targets at current new money returns due to active product management and disciplined pricing approach.\nMoving to other operations.\nThe adjusted pre-tax loss before consolidations and eliminations was $370 million, $2 million higher than the prior quarter of 2020, driven by higher corporate GOE primarily from increases in performance-based employee compensation, partially offset by higher investment income and lower corporate interest expense resulting from year-to-date debt redemption activity.\nOverall net investment income on an APTI basis was $3.3 billion, an increase of $78 million compared to the prior-year quarter, reflecting mostly higher private equity gains.\nBy business, life and retirement benefited most due to asset growth, higher call and tender income and another strong period of private equity returns.\ngeneral insurance's NII declined approximately 6% year over year due to continued yield compression and underperformance in the hedge fund position.\nAlso, general insurance has a much higher percentage allocation to private equity and hedge funds, which is likely to change moving forward.\nAs respect share count, our average total diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 864 million and we repurchased approximately 20 million shares.\nThe end-of-period outstanding shares for book value per share purposes was approximately 836 million and anticipated to be approximately 820 million at year-end 2021 depending upon share price performance, given Peter's comments on additional share repurchases.\nLastly, our primary operating subsidiaries remain profitable and well capitalized, with general insurance's U.S. pool fleet risk-based capital ratio for the third quarter estimated to be between 450% and 460%.\nAnd the life and retirement U.S. fleet is estimated to be between 440% and 450%, both above our target ranges.\nOperator, we'll take our first question.\nSummary: ",

diluted share, compared to $0.38 for the second quarter of 2019.\nFor year-to-date, consolidated earnings were $0.98 per diluted share for 2020, compared to $2.14 last year.\nNow, I'll turn the discussion over to Dennis.\nWe hope everyone is staying safe and healthy during these uncertain times.\nIt's hard to believe that we've been managing through the COVID-19 pandemic for five months now.\nAnd every day, I continue to be inspired by how our employees continue to rally on all fronts to respond to the crisis.\nI couldn't be more proud of how we're staying vigilant and adapting across the organization to the new policies and procedures that can quickly change in the states where we serve.\nI appreciate their patience, their persistence and professionalism, as we all navigate through these unchartered waters to seek out our new normal, all while still providing the energy that is so essential to our customers.\nAs always, our top priority is to preserve the health and safety of our customers, our employees, contractors and our communities.\nAs the regional economies across the areas we serve move forward with fits and start, we're doing our best to support those customers, who we know are struggling.\nYou may have seen recently the Avista Foundation provided more than $500,000 to support 37 different organizations throughout our service area.\nAnd so far in 2020, our foundation has provided more than $1.5 million to help those in need.\nAlthough the majority of our employees are still working from home, it hasn't impacted our ability to complete important work across our business.\nWildfires continue to be an important topic for our industry and our company, especially this time of year.\nBefore the wildfire season arrived, we enhanced our 10-year wildfire resiliency plan to expand our current safeguards for preventing, mitigating and reducing the impact of wildfires to help minimize the possibility of wildfires and the related service disruptions.\nOur team spent the last year developing our plan through a series of internal workshops, industry research and engagement with state and local fire agencies.\nThe plan has certain key areas that include grid hardening, vegetation management, situational awareness, operations and emergency response and worker and public safety.\nIn total, we expect to spend approximately $330 million implementing the plan components over the life of the 10-year plan.\nWe're also excited for construction to be completed on the Catalyst Building and the Scott Morris Center for Energy Innovation.\nWe can hardly wait for the buildings to open next month and when they do, Scott Morris' vision to create the five smartest blocks in the world will become a reality.\nAvista will be able to continue to innovate and test new ideas about how to share energy in a shared economy model.\nAnd what we learn could not only shape how the grid of the future will operate, but also could provide a transformative new model for the entire utility industry.\nLast year, we established a goal to serve our customers with a 100% clean electricity by 2045 and a 100% carbon-neutral resources by 2027.\nConsistent with our goal and our 2020 Integrated Resource Plan, we are seeking proposals from renewable energy project developers, who are capable of constructing, owning and operating up to 120 average megawatts.\nOur intent is to secure the output from the renewable generation resources, including energy, capacity and associated environmental attributes.\nThis will allow us to offset market purchases and fossil fuel thermal generation, which is a key step to achieving our goals.\nWith respect to results, our second quarter consolidated earnings were in line with expectations and we are on track to meet our 2020 earnings guidance at Avista Utilities, AEL&P and our other businesses.\nAs such, we are confirming our 2020 consolidated earnings guidance, a range of $1.75 to $1.95 per diluted share.\nAnd finally, one last point.\nOur Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Counsel, and Corporate Secretary, Marian Durkin, just retired on August 1.\nDuring her tenure, Marian defined our business needs and -- to build our legal department from the ground up to the robust team that it is today.\nAs the focus and scrutiny on compliance has grown across many different industries, Marian also centralized the company's compliance efforts and has taken our compliance department to a new level.\nAlso, under Marian's leadership, earlier this year, Avista was named as one of Ethisphere's World's Most Ethical Companies.\nI have big news for you.\nI'm very excited about that.\nThe Blackhawks, because of the pandemic, made the playoffs and we're currently 1-1 with Edmonton with a game tonight.\nSo, those on the East Coast, it's a 10:30 game, but I'd like you to stay up and route for my Blackhawks.\nFor the second quarter of 2020, Avista Utilities contributed $0.26 per diluted share, compared to $0.32 in 2019.\nCompared to the second quarter of 2019, our earnings decreased due to lower electric utility margin and from higher power supply costs and decreased loads related to COVID-19, which was partially offset by rate relief and customer growth.\nWe also had lower operating expenses in the second quarter of 2020.\nThe Energy Recovery Mechanism in Washington was a small benefit in this year of $0.4 million, compared to a much larger benefit in 2019 of $6 million.\nFor the year-to-date, we recognized a pre-tax benefit of $5.6 million in 2020, compared to $3.5 million in 2019, all with respect to the ERM.\nWith respect to the COVID-19 impacts on our results, we recorded an incremental $3.3 million of bad debt expense for the year-to-date and we expect the incremental amount to be $5.7 million for the full-year, including the first quarter as -- first half, as compared to our original forecast.\nIn July, the Idaho Commission issued an order that allows us to defer certain costs, net of any decreased costs and other benefits related to COVID-19.\nDuring the second quarter, we deferred $1.1 million of bad debt expense associated with this order.\nCompared to normal, in the second quarter there was a -- our loads, there was a decrease of approximately 6% on overall electric loads, which consisted of approximately 10% decrease in commercial and a 14% decrease in Industrial, which was partially offset by about 4% increase in our residential loads.\nThese loads decreased earnings by about $0.03 in the second quarter and we expect to have continued lower loads throughout most of the year, with a gradual recovery toward the end of the year.\nWe expect to be able to mostly offset the lower utility margin through our cost management activities, and this is reflected in our consolidated guidance.\nWe do expect a gradual economic recovery, but prolonged high unemployment that will depress load and customer growth into 2021.\nWe have decoupling and other regulatory mechanisms, which help mitigate the impact of these load changes on our -- the impact on our revenues for residential and certain commercial customers.\nOver 90% of our utility revenue is covered by regulatory mechanisms.\nDuring the second quarter, we began experiencing some supply chain delays due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, with delays ranging from a couple of weeks to up to six weeks in some cases.\nHowever, we do not expect this to have a significant impact on our planned projects and we continue to be committed to investing the necessary capital in our utility infrastructure and expect our spending in 2020 to be still be about $405 million.\nWith respect to liquidity, at June 30, we had $160 million of available liquidity under our $400 million line of credit and we had $100 million in cash from our term loan.\nIn the second quarter, we extended our line of credit agreement a year to April 2022.\nWe expect to issue this year approximately $165 million of long-term debt and up to $70 million of equity, and that includes $24 million that we've issued through June.\nAs Dennis mentioned earlier, we are confirming our 2020 guidance, with a consolidated range of $1.75 to $1.95.\nWe're expecting that COVID-19 impacts at Avista Utilities of increased operating expenses include bad debt expense, reduced industrial loads and increased interest will be mostly offset by expected tax benefits from the CARES Act and other efforts to identify cost reduction opportunities that we have implemented.\nWe have filed for deferred accounting treatment in each of our jurisdictions.\nAnd as I said earlier, in Idaho, the Idaho Commission issued an order that allows us to defer certain costs related to COVID-19, net of any decreased costs and other benefits.\nThe Idaho Commission will determine the appropriateness and prudency of any deferred expenses when we seek recovery.\nWe continue to expect -- to experience regulatory lag until 2023, we filed the general rate case in Oregon in March of 2020 and continue to anticipate filing in Washington and Idaho in the fourth quarter of this year.\nWe expect our long-term earnings growth after 2023 to be 4% to 6%.\nNow, with the specifics on the ranges for each segment.\nWe expect Avista Utilities to contribute in the range of $1.77 to $1.89 per diluted share.\nThe midpoint of our range does not include any expense or benefit under the ERM and our current expectation is that we will be in a benefit of a 90/10 sharing band, which is expected to add $0.06 per diluted share.\nOur outlook for Avista Utilities assumes, among other variables, normal precipitation, temperatures and hydroelectric generation for the remainder of the year and we have implemented the cost reduction measures to help mitigate the impacts of costs related to COVID-19.\nFor 2020, we expect AEL&P to contribute in the range of $0.07 to $0.11 per share and our outlook for AEL&P assumes, among other variables, normal precipitation and hydroelectric generation for the remainder of the year.\nAnd we continue to expect our other businesses to have a loss of between $0.09 and $0.05 per diluted share.\nOur guidance generally includes only normal operating conditions and does not include any unusual items; such as settlement transactions or acquisitions and dispositions until the effects are known and certain.\nWe cannot predict the duration or severity of the COVID-19 global pandemic.\nAnd the longer and more severe economic restrictions and business disruption, the greater the impact on our operations, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:With me on the call today are Vic Grizzle, our CEO; and Brian MacNeal, our CFO.\nActual outcomes may differ materially from those expected or implied.\nBoth are available on our website.\nIt's good to be with you today to review our first quarter results.\nA solid start to what we expect will be a robust year of growth for Armstrong.\nOverall in the quarter, we continue to see sequential improvement and the recovery of our markets.\nOur total company daily shipping rate sequentially improved and accelerated through the end of the quarter and that acceleration has continued nicely into April.\nThis first quarter comparison is against the last of the pre-COVID market conditions as we saw very little impact from our -- from COVID in our base period.\nIn this first quarter of 2021, adjusted revenue of $253 million increased 2% from prior year, driven by sales of our 2020 acquisitions, which more than offset COVID-driven volume reductions in our organic business.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $85 million declined 12% from the prior year driven by COVID-related volume declines, continuing investments in our growth initiatives and the resumption of spending that was deferred when the pandemic hit.\nThe Mineral Fiber business has started the year as we expected.\nOur Mineral Fiber daily shipping rate posted a third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement as people return to work and markets continue to reopen.\nLike-for-like pricing exceeded input cost inflation, top-line mix was positive as sales of our premium products continue to outpace the rest of our product offerings and channel mix was once again a headwind, although to a lesser extent driven by relatively strong sales in the lower price point home center channel.\nChannel mix as we have experienced during the pandemic has already begun to subside and is not expected to be a headwind going forward.\nThe territory mix challenges we faced for the past few quarters have diminished as New York City and the other six major metro areas we've recently called out are essentially in line with the rest of the country.\nOn the operations side, our Mineral Fiber plants ran well with solid productivity despite the challenges created by the winter storms.\nAnd our WAVE joint venture performed well and was able to price ahead of rising steel costs to deliver a strong first quarter.\nOur architectural specialty business delivered solid top-line growth of 25% versus prior year quarter driven again by our 2020 acquisitions of Turf, Moz and Arktura.\nA real highlight in the quarter was the acceleration in order intake with the sequential organic order intake at a record level that's resulted in a stronger-than-expected backlog.\nWe continue to be encouraged by our win rates on projects and our ability to differentiate our offering versus our competition.\nGiven our strong backlog, we remain confident in delivering our 2021 sales outlook of more than 30% growth.\nIn the quarter, we continued our investment in architectural specialties to further extend our capabilities and our capacity to support our expectation of continuing strong growth in this segment.\nIntegration of our three new acquisitions continues to go well and I remain excited by the potential for incorporating their technology and design capabilities across the Armstrong platform.\nOur acquisition pipeline is robust and continues to grow, and we have the balance sheet, liquidity and appetite to execute additional acquisitions and alliances.\nIn terms of the overall macroeconomic environment and marketplace conditions, markets have improved and are showing signs of gaining momentum.\nI am encouraged by the trends we are seeing in the data and by the tone of the conversations with our customers and distribution partners.\nBidding activity continued to improve through the quarter and more projects delayed last year are being released.\nGDP estimates are being revised upwards, which is a positive leading indicator for increasing renovation activity.\nCEO confidence is rising and return-to-office statistics are improving signaling a desire for an expectation of return to the marketplace.\nThere's a strong desire to get students and teachers back in the classroom, where they can be most productive and to get work teams back together, so they can be most effective in collaborating, innovating and networking.\nThese trends along with the potential for trillions of dollars in government spending on infrastructure, including spending specifically targeted for renovating schools is creating greater optimism and a more favorable economic backdrop.\nAlong with stronger economic outlook inflationary pressures are ramping up.\nThe raw material most impacted in our operations thus far has been steel used primarily at our WAVE joint venture in the manufacturing of our suspension systems.\nAs a result, beginning back in December, we have implemented five price increases totaling more than 40%.\nIt's been a challenging body of work for both our sales teams and our distribution partners to manage, but they have performed well and as evidenced by WAVE's first quarter results.\nWe are also experiencing rising input and freight costs in our Mineral Fiber and Architectural Specialties segments.\nAs a result, we have announced a heavier-than-normal 10% price increase on Mineral Fiber products and pulled the effective date up to May, earlier than normal.\nThis is on top of the implemented February increase of 7%.\nIn Architectural Specialties, we have also increased pricing on standard products and are adjusting our quoting processes on custom projects.\nWith these actions, I remain confident that we will once again deliver like-for-like price realization greater than input cost inflation.\nOverall, both segments are operating at a high level.\nWe have fortunately not experienced any supply chain disruptions, allowing for outstanding service levels.\nAnd because of our recent digitalization initiatives, we are staying more closely connected to our customers and partners than ever before supporting a strong project backlog position.\nAnd our teams are executing well on our price initiatives to stay ahead of inflation.\nSo with this healthy state of operation, a solid first quarter result and our market outlook for the remainder of the year, we are reiterating the full year 2021 guidance we provided in February.\nToday, I will be reviewing our first quarter 2021 results and our guidance for the full year.\nOn Slide 4, we'll begin with our consolidated first quarter results.\nAdjusted sales of $253 million were up 2% versus prior year.\nThese adjusted sales include approximately $700,000 of purchase accounting adjustments related to our 2020 acquisitions.\nThis is the last quarter for this adjustment.\nAdjusted EBITDA fell 12% and EBITDA margins contracted 520 basis points.\nAs Vic stated earlier, this contraction was expected given the pressure that persists this quarter from COVID-related demand declines, the investments we continue to make in our growth initiatives and the fact that we have reinstituted the cost we temporarily cut last year.\nFurthermore, as a reminder, when you look at our adjusted EBITDA reconciliation in the appendix on slide 12, Q1 of 2020 earnings as reported were significantly impacted by our Q1 pension annuitization.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.84 were 23% below prior year results.\nThis result includes $6 million or $0.09 of amortization expense related to our 2020 acquisitions.\nAdjusted free cash flow declined by $13 million versus the prior year.\nOur balance sheet remains in a strong position as we ended the quarter with $397 million of available liquidity, including a cash balance of $122 million and $275 million of availability on our revolving credit facility.\nWhile net debt of $587 million was $43 million above Q1 2020 results, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.9 times as calculated under the terms of our credit agreement remains well below our covenant threshold of 3.75 times.\nWe have considerable headwind in this measure.\nIn the second quarter, we repurchased 126,000 shares for $10 million or an average price of $79.60 per share.\nSince the inception of our repurchase program in 2016, we have bought back 9.9 million shares at a cost of $616 million for an average price of $62.57 per share.\nWe currently have $584 million remaining under our repurchase program, which expires in December 2023.\nSlide 5 summarizes our Mineral Fiber segment results.\nIn the quarter, sales declined 5% versus prior year due to the impact of COVID.\nMineral Fiber shipments exited the quarter on a positive note with March shipments flat to prior year on a rate-per-day basis.\nThrough Friday, April's month-to-date daily ship rate is up 58% versus prior year and higher than 2019.\nThe positive like-for-like pricing and favorable product mix continued.\nBut as Vic mentioned channel mix was a headwind in the quarter and affected the fall-through rate.\nWe expect this will be the last quarter we face this channel mix fall-through rate headwind.\nMineral Fiber segment adjusted EBITDA was down 10% as a result of the COVID-driven volume declines, SG&A spending to support our growth of investments and the reinstitution of the 2020 temporary cost reductions.\nThe Mineral Fiber plants ran well and drove productivity that fell through to the bottom line.\nInput cost inflation was temporarily offset by inventory valuations, but inflation is clearly ramping up and driving our proactive pricing actions.\nAs Vic mentioned, WAVE has been pricing out ahead of rising steel costs.\nMoving to our Architectural Specialties or AS segment on Slide 6.\nAdjusted sales grew 25% versus prior year were $13 million as the 2020 acquisitions of Turf, Moz and Arktura contributed $17 million in the quarter and more than offset COVID-driven organic sales decline of $4 million.\nEBITDA for our AS segment declined $3 million as EBITDA contributions from the 2020 acquisitions were more than offset by AS organic performance.\nSales for our AS organic business continue to be lumpy as projects were delayed out of the first quarter and we made growth investments in both capacity and capability to support our top line expectations for AS.\nWe remain confident in our sales guidance for the AS business as a result of the favorable trajectory of order intake in the first quarter that Vic mentioned.\nAs sales ramp up throughout the year, we expect EBITDA margins to improve.\nSlide 7 shows drivers of our consolidated adjusted EBITDA results for the quarter including a breakout of the impact from our 2020 acquisitions.\nSales from our acquisitions essentially offset organic volume declines.\nAUV was a positive contributor driven by like-for-like pricing in the Mineral Fiber segment, but was offset by higher SG&A.\nSlide 8 shows adjusted free cash flow performance in the quarter versus the first quarter of 2020.\nCash flow from operations was down $13 million driven by lower earnings.\nKeep in mind that the first quarter is typically our weakest for free cash flow generation as we build inventory to service the strong summer demand period.\nWe remain confident that we will deliver the 19% free cash flow margin that we have guided too for the year.\nSlide 9 summarizes our guidance for 2021.\nWe are reiterating our overall expectations to grow sales 10% to 13%; adjusted EBITDA 9% to 13%; adjusted earnings per share 5% to 15%; and deliver free cash flow yield of 19%.\nApril is off to a good start and we are optimistic with the trends developing in the second quarter.\nIt is too early to make any adjustments to our annual guidance and we will provide an update on our guidance in July when we have more data.\nSlide 10 reiterates the seasonality we expect for sales in 2021.\nThis is not something we typically share as our seasonality is usually very consistent year-to-year.\nHowever, given the disruptions experienced in 2020, the seasonal pattern of our year-on-year sales will be unusual in 2021, so we've included this page to provide additional insights.\nIn conclusion, I remain positive about the outlook for 2021, with an improving health and economic backdrop, an evolving portfolio of healthy spaces products, and new digital tools and capabilities, Armstrong is well positioned to advance our value creation model in 2021.\nBefore we get to some Q&A, I want to touch on a few important initiatives in the company namely ESG, Healthy Spaces, and our new digital platform Kanopi by Armstrong.\nOn our last call I mentioned that, ESG would be an area of focus for us in 2021 and beyond.\nAs we build on our history of community engagement and corporate responsibility, it's increasingly important to all our stakeholders and it has a natural fit with our mission, our history, our culture and our strategy.\nAs many of you have seen earlier this month, we launched a redesigned sustainability section of our website that reflects our three pillars of focus: People, planet and product and establishes our 2030 goals in these areas.\nIn addition, work is under way and on track to complete our first sustainability report this summer.\nThis comprehensive report will address the needs of GRI, SASB and TCFD.\nAnd because of the importance of this work, I want to take a moment and recognize the great deal of effort and commitment by our teams that has gone into capturing our achievements thus far, baselining our opportunity for improvement and to developing meaningful long-term goals.\nMore to come on this total effort as we progress along this important journey, which aligns well with our strategic emphasis on Healthy Spaces.\nAs Healthy Spaces continues to be a focal point in economic recovery, ceilings are becoming increasingly more relevant.\nAs the capstone to an interior space, ceilings are critical for managing air flow and providing for optimal ventilation, as well as delivering acoustical performance in design aesthetics.\nThese trends are revitalizing the ceilings category and making this category more relevant for the current and future need of healthy indoor spaces.\nAnd of course, this suits Armstrong well.\nAs the longtime category leader, Armstrong is becoming recognized as a thought leader on the importance of holistic space planning, design and construction, and the impact this approach can have on the confidence and well-being of people, while they're in doors, which is where we spend a large majority of our time.\nWe believe that the growth investments we've made in 2020 will bear fruit in 2021, with gains from new Healthy Spaces solutions and our new digital capabilities.\nOur product innovations are on target for what a post pandemic market will demand.\nHealthy Spaces is much more than an event-driven opportunity.\nIt's here to stay.\nHealthy Spaces has always been important, but the pandemic has forever changed the definition of healthy and our health and safety expectations for indoor spaces.\nArchitects, designers, facility managers, business owners are all looking for solutions that bring people back into commercial spaces and make them more suited for future use.\nAs offices dedensify and expansive collaborative space has become the norm, the need for acoustical performance in ceilings will only increase, as we -- as will the need to better clean and manage air flow.\nCeilings are central to providing these solutions.\nOur 24/7 defend family of products including AirAssure, CleanAssure and VidaShield ceiling solutions are designed specifically to help improve air quality and ventilation sustainably.\nWhat's encouraging is that despite being launched just five months ago, 24/7 defend products have been sold into all of our core sectors: office, education, healthcare, retail and transportation.\nThis clearly demonstrates the broad-based opportunity for Healthy Spaces.\nThese product innovations timed for the Healthy Spaces catalyst coupled with our new digital platform of Kanopi by Armstrong, positions Armstrong well to capture the evolving market recovery opportunity.\nLaunched earlier this year, kanopi by Armstrong that's what a small K is online at kanopibyarmstrong.com.\nKanopi utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide early access and enhanced visibility to a large part of the market opportunity, we were previously unable to efficiently track.\nThis technology is allowing us to influence an Armstrong solution, and is making purchasing easy.\nKanopi provides facility owners and managers an end-to-end solution, including diagnostic tools, consulting and pre-certified installation services.\nOnline consumer-friendly and fulfilled by our best-in-class distribution network, kanopi is tapping into pent-up renovation demand in smaller scale commercial spaces and driving Mineral Fiber volume growth.\nEarly results are encouraging.\nWe are seeing growth across all our critical metrics website traffic orders, order value and sales.\nTo date, each month has been significantly better than the last, and I expect this will continue throughout the year.\nAgain, we are encouraged by the improving market conditions and the increasing relevance of the ceiling category.\nAnd we are especially excited about the market opportunities ahead that Armstrong is so well positioned to capture that will enable us to deliver on our commitment, to deliver strong results for our shareholders, and on our mission to make a positive difference by creating healthier spaces, where we live work learn heal and play.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:They will be joined by Scott Oaksmith, Senior Vice President, Real Estate and Finance.\nWe appreciate you taking the time to join us.\nI'm pleased to report that Choice Hotels continued to deliver strong RevPAR growth in the third quarter that once again significantly outperformed the industry.\nWe also continue to gain share across all segments in which we compete.\nAs a result of these performance trends, we expect to surpass 2019 RevPAR and adjusted EBITDA levels for full year 2021.\nBy continuing to implement our long-term strategy, we have positioned Choice Hotels to further benefit from post-pandemic trends that favor leisure travel, limited service hotels and longer stays.\nAdditionally, our business traveler demand has returned to levels similar to the third quarter of 2019.\nThe third quarter was exceptional, our strongest quarter of the year.\nOur RevPAR increased 11.4% compared to the third quarter of 2019, surpassing our prior quarterly RevPAR guidance.\nIn fact, RevPAR has now exceeded 2019 levels for five consecutive months, with trends continuing into the fourth quarter.\nFor over 1.5 years, we've maintained significantly higher RevPAR index share gains against the competition compared to 2019.\nWe continued this trend in the third quarter, increasing RevPAR index versus our local competitors by nearly four percentage points as compared to 2019, reflecting continued growth in both weekday and weekend RevPAR index as reported by STR.\nChoice's ability to continue to gain share even as the broader industry recovers, demonstrates that our strategic investments are paying off and gives us further confidence in our future revenue trajectory.\nBecause of our strategic investments, both before and during the pandemic, we are in a stronger position today to capitalize on outsized growth opportunities over the long term, which we expect will create value and drive our performance to new levels.\nWhat's most impressive is that we continue to drive strong performance through both rate improvement and occupancy share gains.\nChoice's average daily rate growth has been stronger than the industry in the third quarter due to our new revenue management tool and broader capabilities.\nIn addition, our robust merchandising strategy has allowed us to drive occupancy share gains versus our local competitors.\nWe continue to make major investments that are enhancing our owners' performance and contributing to our brand's outperformance.\nEarlier this year, we launched our new revenue management capability designed to improve the ability of our franchise owners to effectively drive top line revenue.\nThis tool marks a step change improvement that we were able to put in the hands of our franchisees at a critical juncture in the recovery.\nAs the first mobile-enabled revenue management app, it allows our franchisees to more effectively manage their channels rates and inventory by adapting to local market trends in real time through repricing and competitive rate shopping multiple times during the day, and they can do this from virtually anywhere.\nThis enhanced capability has contributed to choice taking significant RevPAR index share specifically driving average daily rate index gains versus local competitors, and we expect this trend to continue.\nThe acceptance of rate recommendations by our franchisees has been significantly higher than our prior tool, demonstrating our owners' confidence in the solutions that we are providing.\nThis tool, combined with expert advice from our experienced revenue management consultants is helping our franchise owners to swiftly execute the right pricing strategy, which is particularly important in an inflationary environment.\nAt the same time, we continue to improve the unit economics for our franchisees, concentrating on investments like housekeeping upon request that lower their cost of ownership while driving continued performance improvements.\nRecently, we deployed a new digital registration capability, which is integrated with our property management system.\nThis cost-effective cloud-based solution is designed to simplify the hotel registration process for front desk staff, save on labor, speed up check-in and improve our guests' overall experience.\nMoreover, our recent brand investments are designed to appeal to the guest of tomorrow while providing a compelling return on investment for our franchisees.\nJust a few weeks ago, we introduced a new Cambria hotel prototype option designed for secondary and leisure markets.\nWe're excited about the future growth opportunity for Cambria as we expect this prototype will allow developers the flexibility to build at a reduced cost, expanding the markets available for growth while retaining our design forward experience.\nI will now provide a brief update on our key segments, where 11 out of our 12 brands achieved RevPAR index gains versus their local competitors in the third quarter as compared to 2019.\nOur strategic investments in the extended-stay segment allowed us to quadruple the size of the portfolio over the past five years to reach 467 domestic units with a domestic pipeline of nearly 310 hotels.\nThis segment, a significant growth engine for the company, expanded by over 45 hotels in the third quarter year-over-year and now represents over 10% of our total domestic rooms.\nIn addition to strong unit growth, we've also driven impressive RevPAR growth across our extended stay brands.\nSpecifically, when compared to the third quarter of 2019, our extended-stay portfolio grew RevPAR a by over 18%, driven by occupancy levels of 82% and a 9% increase in average daily rate.\nAnd outperformed the industry's RevPAR change by over 20 percentage points.\nThe WoodSpring Suites brand celebrated a key milestone with the recent opening of its 300th hotel.\nThe brand's pipeline expanded by over 20% year-over-year as of the end of September, reaching nearly 160 domestic hotels which further exemplifies developer demand for this brand, given its cycle resilience.\nWe expect that WoodSpring's robust pipeline will provide a strong platform for future growth of the brand.\nBroadly speaking, we are pleased with the significant increase in developers' interest in extended stay projects.\nIn the third quarter, we executed two dozen extended-stay domestic franchise agreements, an 85% increase year-over-year and a 20% increase compared to 2019 levels.\nIn addition, the first hotel for our newest extended-stay brand, Everhome Suites is currently under construction and scheduled to open next summer, with nearly 20 additional projects already in the pipeline.\nOur mid-scale brands, which represent over 2/3 of our total domestic room portfolio and approximately half of the total domestic pipeline continued to outperform the segment's RevPAR growth.\nOur mid-scale and upper mid-scale portfolio grew RevPAR by nearly 10%, driven by average daily rate growth of over 9% and outpaced the industry's mid-scale and upper mid-scale segment growth by nearly seven percentage points when compared to third quarter 2019.\nOur flagship brand, Comfort, recently celebrated the highest number of conversion hotel openings since 2014, while increasing new construction agreements threefold in the third quarter year-over-year.\nThe Comfort brand's domestic unit growth of over 2% and and RevPAR index outperformance versus local competitors demonstrate the attractiveness of this iconic brand to hotel developers and guests alike.\nOur upscale portfolio achieved impressive growth in the third quarter year-over-year as we increased our domestic room count by nearly 22%, driven by both Cambria and the Ascend Hotel Collection.\nThe upscale portfolio also achieved a record for domestic openings in the first three quarters of the year.\nThe Cambria brand continued its positive momentum, growing by over 9% to 58 units year-over-year with 17 projects under active construction at the end of September, and five additional hotels planned to open this year.\nIn August, we celebrated the Cambria opening in the heart of one of the world's premier wine regions, Napa Valley.\nOur upscale portfolio increased its RevPAR index relative to its local competitive set and outperformed the industry's RevPAR change by 15 percentage points while increasing the average daily rate by 11% when compared to the third quarter of 2019.\nThis progress shows the attractiveness of Choice Hotels value proposition in the upscale segment for current and prospective owners.\nThe strong performance across our entire brand portfolio confirms our focus on growing in our strategic segments which we believe will further fuel the long-term revenue intensity of our system.\nTurning now to demand trends.\nWe continue to achieve gains in our weekday occupancy index share during the third quarter compared to 2019.\nAs discussed on our prior calls, we believe that these share gains are partially driven by long-term consumer trends, such as remote work and an increase in early retirements, which afford Americans flexibility as to when and where they travel for leisure.\nIn fact, we observed our guests extending their trips into shoulder days of the weekend, giving us further optimism about future travel trends following the historically busy summer travel season.\nIn addition, we continue to observe a greater share of revenue coming from longer stays as compared to 2019.\nSimilar to our broader occupancy share gains, these weekday demand gains were achieved through our merchandising capabilities and strategy with targeted promotions at the right time of the week, during the right time of the year and for the right customer.\nThe investments we've made have allowed us to capitalize on demand that historically propelled our core business while attracting and capturing an even larger share of leisure demand.\nWhile our most loyal Choice Privileges members continue to spend more at our hotels during the third quarter, we were also successful in appealing to those who are new to our brands, increasing their revenue contribution as compared to 2019 levels.\nWe also see continuing momentum in our business travel trends, with anticipated additional runway for growth.\nWe've continued to witness sequential quarter-over-quarter increases in our business travel bookings in the third quarter of 2021, with overall business performance similar to 2019 levels.\nAs a company with a strong emphasis on a customer-first approach, Choice is always looking for innovative ways to better serve the changing needs of today's consumers and anticipate the expectations of the guest of tomorrow.\nFor example, we are the first lodging company to launch a collaboration with Bakkt a trusted digital asset marketplace, enabling us to cater to guests with more currency options and more ways to redeem this currency.\nOur more than 50 million Choice Privileges loyalty members can now unlock new redemption opportunities by converting their rewards points to cash and then use it to buy Bitcoin, transfer their points to a friend or even redeem them online or in-store anywhere, Apple Pay or Google Pay is accepted.\nTurning now to our franchisee business delivery and demand for our brands.\nIn addition, we drove growth as compared to 2019 and 2020 through increased revenue contribution in the third quarter from choicehotels.com and other proprietary digital channels.\nBusiness delivery through these channels significantly improves our owners' profitability as they deliver strong rates at the lowest cost.\nAs a result, these channels remain a key focus area for enhancing our value proposition.\nWith such a powerful value proposition, it is no surprise why Choice maintains an industry-leading franchisee voluntary retention rate and our franchise owners continue to seek and develop our brands.\nAided by our strong value proposition for our current and future owners and our record outperformance, we also continue to experience demand for new franchise contracts.\nIn the third quarter, we awarded 89 new domestic franchise agreements, a 10% increase over the same period of 2020.\nSpecifically, we're very pleased to see that demand for our new construction brands in the third quarter increased by over 50% year-over-year.\nAnd we are also excited to announce that our WoodSpring brand expanded internationally at the end of October, entering the Canadian market with a more than 15 unit commitment from a well-known developer and operator.\nIn addition, a team within our development and franchise service departments that is fully dedicated to driving diverse ownership of Choice franchise hotels among underrepresented and minority owners has awarded 18 franchise contracts year-to-date through September, bringing the total agreements executed to over 280 since the program began over 15 years ago.\nI'm proud to say that more than half of the 18 agreements this year were awarded to women entrepreneurs.\nNone of these accomplishments would have been possible without the resilience and hard work of our dedicated associates.\nWe are committed to continuing to invest in and support our associates, and we are proud to be the hotel industry's only company to recently earn recognition as a Best Work-life Balance Employer by Comparably.\nIn closing, I'm confident in our continued ability to create value and deliver results for our owners and shareholders through our effective strategic investments, impressive performance and award-winning culture centered around diversity, equity and belonging.\nWith that, I will hand it over to our CFO.\nI hope you and your families are all well.\nToday, I'd like to provide some additional insights on our third quarter results, update you on our liquidity profile and capital allocation and share our thoughts on the outlook for what lies ahead.\nAs we discussed in the previous quarter, we are comparing our financial performance and RevPAR results to 2019, which we believe offers a more meaningful basis for analyzing trends as the prior year's quarterly results were significantly impacted by the pandemic.\nFor third quarter 2021 as compared to the same period of 2019, total revenues, excluding marketing and reservation system fees, were $166.5 million, an 8% increase.\nAdjusted EBITDA rose 18% and to $133.2 million, driven by improving RevPAR performance, revenue intense unit growth and strong effective royalty rate growth, coupled with continued cost discipline.\nOur adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 80%, a rise of seven percentage points.\nAnd as a result, our adjusted earnings per share were $1.51 in for the third quarter, an increase of 10% versus 2019.\nLet's now turn to our three key revenue levers beginning with royalty rate.\nOur effective royalty rate remains a significant source of our revenue growth.\nThe company's domestic effective royalty rate increased by eight basis points year-over-year to approximately 5% compared to the third quarter of 2020.\nThis performance reflects the continued strengthening of the value proposition we provide to our franchise owners, their continued interest in being affiliated with our proven brands and the promising prospects in our pipeline.\nIt also provides further validation of our long-term past, current and future investments on behalf of our franchisees.\nWe expect to maintain the current growth trajectory of this lever for full year 2021 and grow at our historical rate in the future as owners continue to seek Choice Hotels' proven capabilities of delivering strong top line revenues that maximize return on investment while helping them reduce their total cost of ownership.\nOur domestic systemwide RevPAR outperformed the overall industry by 16 percentage points for the third quarter, increasing 11.4% over 2019.\nSpecifically, our average daily rate grew by nearly 9%, and our occupancy levels increased by nearly two percentage points compared to the same quarter of 2019.\nOur third quarter results showed that we continue to outpace the primary chain scale segments in which we compete as reported by STR by six percentage points versus 2019.\nImportantly, our strong RevPAR trends have continued into the fourth quarter.\nAs you know from our prior calls, we've long focused our brand strategy on driving growth across the higher value and more revenue intense, upscale, extended-stay and mid-scale segments.\nThe investments we've made continue to pay off as these strategic segments have enabled us to materially outperform the industry in RevPAR growth and achieve gains versus our local competitors.\nLet me highlight just a few impressive performance achievements for our brands in the third quarter.\nJust a reminder, we're comparing the growth figures with the same period of 2019.\nOur WoodSpring brand achieved 23% RevPAR growth, reaching an average occupancy rate of nearly 86% and experiencing an 11% increase in average daily rate.\nAscend Hotels saw their growth in average daily rate of over 17% and outperformed the upscale segment's RevPAR growth by over 20 percentage points.\nAt the same time, the Comfort family grew RevPAR by over 8% on reflecting a 9% increase in average daily rate.\nFinally, both our Cambria and MainStay Suites brands captured 12 percentage points in RevPAR index gains versus their local competitors.\nMore specifically, our average daily rate and occupancy improved from the prior quarter, and our average daily rate index and occupancy index continue to increase compared to 2019 as a result of our investments in revenue management tools for our franchisees and the merchandising capabilities and strategy we have put in place.\nOur third revenue lever is units and rooms growth, which benefits from the absolute size of our portfolio and the revenue intensity of the totals.\nTo ensure the quality of our brand portfolio over the long term, we continue to terminate underperforming economy hotels at the bottom end of the portfolio as well as quality hotels that are unable to maintain the standards of a mid-scale brand.\nWe believe that these actions will not only ensure an even stronger brand portfolio over the long term, but we also expect these targeted terminations to be an opportunity for royalty revenue growth as we plan to replace these hotels with higher quality and more revenue-intense units.\nNevertheless, we continue to grow the overall size of our domestic franchise system.\nAcross our more revenue intense brands in the upscale, extended-stay and mid-scale segments, we observed stronger unit growth, increasing the number of hotels by 2% and rooms by 2.6% year-over-year.\nOur developers are increasingly optimistic about the long-term fundamentals of the lodging industry.\nIn fact, 1/3 of total domestic franchise agreements awarded in the third quarter were for new construction contracts representing an increase of more than 50% versus the same quarter of the prior year.\nAt the same time, demand for our conversion brands year-to-date through September increased by 25% year-over-year.\nLet me share a few highlights on specific brands.\nThe Ascend Hotel Collection leads the industry as the first launch and today, the largest soft brand expanding its domestic room count by 27% year-over-year.\nAt the same time, Clarion Point has nearly doubled its portfolio year-over-year ending the third quarter with nearly 35 hotels open in the U.S. and 15 additional hotels awaiting conversion this year.\nOur MainStay Suites mid-scale extended-stay brand portfolio expanded to nearly 100 domestic hotels open, representing more than 30% unit growth year-over-year.\nAnd finally, our suburban extended stay portfolio of 70 domestic hotels open experienced 13% year-over-year unit growth.\nNow a few words about our liquidity profile and an update on capital allocation.\nAs a result of our strong performance, the company has an even stronger liquidity position.\nMore specifically, at the end of the third quarter of 2021, the company had over $1 billion in cash and available borrowing capacity through its revolving credit facility.\nWe are also pleased to report cash flow from operations of $142.8 million for the third quarter 2021, a 53% increase versus the third quarter 2019.\nToday, our gross debt-to-EBITDA leverage levels remains at the low end of our target range of three to 4 times.\nAt the end of third quarter 2021, our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage level was at 1.8 times.\nThese impressive results combined with our strong liquidity and confidence in our ability to generate strong levels of cash, leave us well positioned to continue to grow our business and return excess cash flow to shareholders well into the future.\nYear-to-date through October, we have returned over $35 million back to our shareholders in the form of cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock.\nWe will continue to monitor the environment for other investment opportunities and evaluate capital returns in the context of our leverage levels, market conditions and our overall capital allocation strategy.\nFinally, let's turn to our expectations for what lies ahead.\nWe currently expect full year domestic RevPAR to surpass 2019 levels and grow at approximately 1% as compared to full year 2019.\nAssuming the broader RevPAR and economy recovery trends continue, we now expect to see our 2021 adjusted EBITDA exceed 2019 levels and range between $382 million and $387 million, even with planned incremental investments in the fourth quarter.\nOur view is reinforced by our third quarter results which extend our strong year-to-date financial performance, broader macro trends and our continued investments to support growth for the remainder of 2021 and beyond.\nWe will continue to evaluate the impact of COVID-19

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nParticipants in today's call include our President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Strah; Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Taylor; and our Vice Chairperson and Executive Director, John Somerhalder.\nWe will also have several other executives available to join us for the Q&A session.\nYesterday, we reported first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $0.62 per share and operating earnings of $0.69 per share, which is in the upper end of our guidance range.\nAs Jon will discuss, our results reflect the continued successful implementation of our investment strategies, higher weather-adjusted load in our residential class and strong financial discipline in managing our operating expenses.\nLast month, I was honored to be named FirstEnergy's CEO and appointed to the Board of Directors.\nI greatly appreciate the trust and confidence the Board has placed in me, since I was named President last May and Acting CEO in October.\nI have great pride in FirstEnergy and the work our employees do to serve our customers and communities.\nIt's my privilege to continue leading the company as we navigate our current challenges and position our business for long-term stability and success.\nAs we work to move FirstEnergy forward, my priorities are the continued safety of our employees and customers.\nEnsuring that ethics, accountability and integrity are deeply ingrained in our culture and supported by a strong corporate compliance program.\nExecuting FE forward, our transformational effort to capitalize on our potential, deliver long-term results and maximize near-term financial flexibility and continuing our investments in infrastructure growth opportunities from electrification, grid modernization and renewable integration to benefit our customers.\nDuring today's call, I'll provide an update on the Department of Justice investigation, regulatory matters and our FE Forward initiative and other business developments.\nJohn Somerhalder will join us for an update on the Board and management's work toward instilling a culture of compliance built upon the highest standards of ethics and integrity.\nAs we discussed on our fourth quarter call, we are committed to taking decisive actions to rebuild our reputation and focus on the future and continuing to cooperate with the ongoing government investigations.\nWe have begun discussions with the DOJ regarding the resolution of this matter, including the possibility FirstEnergy entering into a deferred prosecution agreement.\nWe can't currently predict the timing, outcome or the impact of the possible resolution with the DOJ.\nOur goal is to take a holistic and transparent approach with a range of stakeholders across the spectrum of matters under review.\nThis approach is consistent with the changes we're making in our political and legislative engagement and advocacy.\nFor example, we are stopping all contributions to 501(c)(4)s.\nWe've paused all other political disbursements, including from our political action committee.\nAnd we have limited our participation in the political process.\nWe have also suspended and/or terminated various political consulting relationships.\nIn addition, we'll be expanding our disclosures around political spending in order to provide increased transparency.\nFor example, we have committed to post updates on our website, on our corporate political activity, relationship with trade associations and our corporate political activity policy, which is under revision.\nA comprehensive and open approach is also the cornerstone in our regulatory activity.\nIn Ohio, we continue taking proactive steps to reduce the regulatory uncertainty, affecting our utilities in the state.\nThis includes our decision in late March to credit our Ohio utility customers approximately $27 million.\nThis comprises the revenues that were collected through the decoupling mechanism authorized under Ohio law plus interest, the partial settlement with the Ohio Attorney General to stop collections of decoupling revenues and our decision not to seek recovery of lost distribution revenues from our Ohio customers.\nTogether, these actions fully address the requirements approved in Ohio House Bill 128 as well as the related rate impact of House Bill 6 on our customers.\nThese are important steps to put this matter behind us.\nIn other Ohio regulatory matters, we proactively updated our testimony in the ESP quadrennial review case to provide perspective SEET values on an individual company basis.\nWe are engaged in settlement discussions with interested parties on this matter as well as the 2017, 2018 and 2019 SEET cases that were consolidated into this proceeding.\nDuring our last call, we mentioned that we were proactively engaging with our regulators to refund customers for certain vendor payments.\nThose conversations are under way in each effective jurisdiction.\nIn Ohio at the PUCO's request, the scope of our annual audit of Rider DCR has been expanded to include a review of these payments.\nOutside of Ohio, our state regulatory activity is concentrated on customer-focused initiatives that will support the transition to a cleaner climate.\nFor example, on March 1, JCP&L, filed a petition with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities seeking approval for its proposed EV driven program.\nIf approved, the four-year $50 million program would offer incentives and rate structures to support the development of EV charging infrastructure throughout our New Jersey service territory, in an effort to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles and provide benefits to our residential, commercial and industrial customers.\nAnd in late March the Pennsylvania PUC approved our five-year $390 million energy efficiency and conservation plan, which supports the PUC's consumption reduction targets.\nIn March, we closed the transaction to sell JCP&L's 50% interest in the Yards Creek pump-storage hydro plant and received proceeds of $155 million.\nAnd we also announced plans to sell Penelec's Waverly New York distribution assets, which serves about 3,800 customers to a local co-op.\nThe deal, which is subject to regulatory approval will simplify Penelec's business by solely focusing on Pennsylvania customers.\nDuring our fourth quarter call, we introduced you to FE Forward, our companywide effort to transform FirstEnergy into a more resilient, effective industry leader delivering superior customer value and shareholder returns.\nWe expect the FE Forward initiatives to provide a more modern experience for our customers with efficiencies in operating and capital expenditures that can be strategically reinvested into our business, supporting our growth and investments in a smarter and cleaner electric grid, while also maintaining affordable electric bills.\nDuring the first phase of the project, we evaluated our processes, business practices and cultural norms to understand where we can improve.\nWhile our safety and reliability performance is strong, we found opportunities in many areas to enhance and automate processes, take a more strategic focus on operating expenditures and modernize experiences for our customers and employees.\nWe've identified more than 300 opportunities and now we are diving deeper into these ideas, developing detailed executable plans as we prepare for implementation beginning later this quarter.\nExamples of this work include, improving the planning and scheduling through integration of systems to allow our employees to deliver their best to our customers, leveraging advanced technologies such as drones and satellite imagery to improve our vegetation management programs, using predictive analytics and web-based tools to provide our customers with more self service options and improve their experience and leverage purchasing power to optimize payment terms.\nAs part of these efforts, we intend to evaluate the appropriate cadence to initiate rate cases on a state-by-state basis to best support our customer focused strategic priorities.\nWe will also remain focused on emerging technologies, smart grid, electric vehicle infrastructure and our customers' evolving energy needs as we think through how to reduce our carbon footprint.\nWe're off to a great start this year, and yesterday we reaffirmed our 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share.\nOur leadership team is committed to upholding our core values and behaviors and executing on our proven strategies as we put our customers at the center of everything we do.\nWe will take the appropriate steps to deliver on our promise to make FirstEnergy a better company, one that is respected by our customers, the investment community, regulators and our employees.\nIt's a privilege and a pleasure to join you today.\nI'd like to start by sharing my impressions of FirstEnergy after almost two months in this role.\nThis is a company with a firm foundation, including a commitment to improve in the area of governance and compliance, our commitment to customers by embracing innovation and technology to help ensure the strength, resilience and reliability of its transmission and distribution businesses, a deep seeded and strong safety culture and a strong potential to deliver significant value to investors through customer focused growth.\nSince joining the team, I've been supporting senior leadership in advancing the company's priorities, strengthening our governance and compliance functions and enhancing our relationships with external stakeholders, including regulators and the financial community.\nSteve spoke about our business priorities.\nSo, I will focus my remarks today on our compliance work including remedial actions.\nFirst, I'd like to update you on our internal investigation which has rebuild no new material issues since our last earnings call.\nThe focus of the internal investigation has transitioned from a proactive investigation to continued cooperation with the ongoing government investigations.\nManagement and the Board with the assistance of the compliance subcommittee of the Audit Committee, have been working together to build a best-in-class compliance program.\nThrough these efforts, we have identified improvement opportunities in five broad categories, including governance, risk management, training and communications, concerns management and third-party management.\nAs part of these efforts FirstEnergy is embracing a commitment to enhancing its compliance culture to be best-in-class.\nSome of the actions completed to date include hiring, our Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer, Hyun Park in January; Antonio Fernandez, who joined as Vice President and Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer last week; and myself.\nOn the Board side, Jesse Lynn and Andrew Teno, joined us from Icahn Capital in March.\nAnd the Board has nominated a new Independent Member, Melvin Williams for election at the Annual Shareholders Meeting when Sandy Pianalto's term ends next month.\nI believe the insights and experience of these new leaders are helping to round out a very committed and confident Board and management team.\nIn March, the Board affirmed our confidence in Steve by naming him CEO.\nSteve has consistently demonstrated the integrity, leadership skills, strategic acumen and deep knowledge of our businesses needed to position FirstEnergy for long-term success and stability.\nThese changes along with the Board's reinforcement of the executive team's commitment to setting the appropriate tone at the top or support a culture of compliance going forward.\nFor instance, we recently held an event where the Chairman and the Chair of the Compliance subcommittee addressed the company's top 140 leaders, regarding the expectations to act with integrity, in everything we do.\nOur legal department recently completed training on up the ladder reporting and we have enhanced our on-boarding process for new employees and for third-parties on expectations around our code of business conduct.\nOver the course of the next few months, there will be many more steps the company will take to enhance our compliance program such as, continuing to build the new more centralized compliance organization under Antonio's leadership; addressing our processes, policies and controls, which include additional oversight for political contributions; continuing to emphasize our values and expectations in ongoing communications with our employees, incorporating compliance into our goals and performance metrics and holding all employees regardless of title to the same standards; enhancing the channels for incident reporting and developing thorough and objective processes to investigate and address allegations of misconduct; and insuring increased communications with and training of employees with respect to our commitment to ethical standards and integrity of our business procedures; compliance requirements; our code of business conduct; and other company policies; and understanding and utilizing the process for reporting suspected violations of law or code of business conduct.\nWe have also enhanced our internal controls around disbursements to require additional approvals, targeted reviews of any suspicious payments and a reassessment of approval levels across the entire company.\nAdditionally, in the area of disbursements, we will update and clarify policies and procedures, conduct training and institute a regular audit program that reviews payments and services performed.\nA detailed list of the corrective actions we are taking can be found on Pages 8 and 9 of our first quarter FactBook.\nOver the next several months, we expect to make significant progress in the areas of compliance led by Antonio's organization, where it will continue to be overseen by the Board and the newly established management steering committee for Ethics and Compliance.\nThrough these efforts, we expect the material weakness associated with the tone at the top to be remediated by the time we file our fourth quarter earnings.\nOur leaders are continuing to elevate the importance of compliance and working to regain the trust of employees and our stakeholders by modeling appropriate behavior and consistently communicating that compliance and ethics are core values, just like safety.\nWe are committed to ensuring that employees understand what is expected of them and are comfortable reporting ethical violations without fear precautions.\nBy continually emphasizing the importance of compliance to our strategies and future as well as demonstrating that we are setting the right tone at the top, we strive to bolster confidence among our employees that the management team and the Board are taking the proper decisive actions to move the company forward.\nI believe we have learned a lot from recent challenges and are taking the right actions to emerge as a better, stronger company with a bright future.\nNow I'll turn the floor over to Jon Taylor for a review of first quarter results and the financial update.\nWe have provided new disclosures in three main areas within our Investor FactBook.\nOur steps to support a cleaner, smarter grid and the movement to more green and renewable resources, additional disclosures on our balance sheet, including our funds from operations target and the steps we're taking to achieve our goals and third, enhanced ESG disclosures.\nAlso note that we continue to provide more robust disclosures on ROEs including more granular sensitivities.\nYesterday we announced GAAP earnings of $0.62 per share for the first quarter of 2021 and operating earnings of $0.69 per share, which was at the upper end of our guidance range.\nGAAP results for 2021 include two special items, regulatory charges related to customer refunds associated with previously collected Ohio decoupling revenues and expenses associated with the investigation.\nIn our distribution business our results for the first quarter of this year as compared to 2020 reflect higher residential usage on both in actual and weather-adjusted basis as well as growth from incremental riders and rate increases, including DCR and grid modernization in Ohio, the distribution system improvement charge in Pennsylvania and the implementation of our base rate case settlement in New Jersey.\nThese drivers were partially offset by $0.10 per share related to the absence of Ohio decoupling revenues and our decision to forgo the collection of lost distribution revenues from our residential and commercial customers.\nOur total distribution deliveries for the first quarter of 2021 decreased 2% on a weather-adjusted basis as compared to the last year, reflecting an increase in residential sales of 2% as customers continue to spend more time at home in the first quarter of 2021, a decline of 7% in commercial sales and in our industrial class first quarter low decreased 3%.\nIt's worth noting that total distribution deliveries through the first quarter are consistent with our internal load forecast, with residential demand 2% higher versus our forecast, while industrial load is down 2%.\nIn our regulated transmission business earnings decreased as a result of higher net financing costs, which included an adjustment to previously capitalized interest, partially offset by the impact of rate base growth at our ATSI and MAIT subsidiaries.\nFinally, in our corporate segment, results reflect lower operating expenses, offset by the absence of a first quarter 2020 pension OPEB credit, related to energy harbors emergence from bankruptcy as well as higher interest expense.\nWe are off to a solid start for the year and are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share for 2021.\nWe've also introduced second quarter guidance of $0.48 to $0.58 per share.\nIn addition, our strong focus on cash helped drive a $125 million increase in adjusted cash from operations and a $185 million increase in free cash flow versus our internal plan for the first quarter.\nAs to a couple of other financial updates, our 2021 debt financing plan remains on track.\nIn March FirstEnergy transmission issued $500 million in senior notes and a strong well supported bond offering that showcase the strength of our transmission business.\nThe deal was oversubscribed and on par with an investment grade offering.\nWe used the proceeds to repay $500 million in short-term borrowings under the FET revolving credit facility.\nIn addition, we repaid $250 million at the FirstEnergy Holding Company.\nWe also successfully issued $200 million in first mortgage bonds at MonPower in April, that was also very well supported.\nThis supports our earlier commitment to reduce short-term borrowings as well as our goal to improve our credit metrics at FirstEnergy, return to investment grade as quickly as possible and maintain the strong credit ratings at our utilities.\nWe continue to provide the rating agencies with regular updates on our business and we are working with them to develop a clear outline of what is needed to return FirstEnergy to investment grade credit ratings.\nKey milestones include governance and compliance changes at our company, resolution of the DOJ investigation and solid credit metrics.\nAs to more longer term financing needs through the execution of FE Forward, we have reduced our debt financing plan by approximately $1 billion through 2023, mainly at the FirstEnergy and FirstEnergy Transmission holding companies.\nAdditionally, as we have previously mentioned, equity is an important part of our overall financing plan, with plans to raise up to $1.2 billion of equity over 2022 and 2023.\nAs we said previously, we'll flex these plans as needed and we are also exploring various alternatives to raise equity capital in a manner that could be more value enhancing to all stakeholders.\nThese actions combined with new rates at JCP&L and our 60% plus formula rate capital investment program will generate $150 million to $200 million of incremental cash flow each year, while maintaining relatively flat adjusted debt levels through 2023, all of which will support our targeted 12% to 13% FFO to debt range.\nTurning to our pension.\nOur funding status was 81% at March 31, up from 78% at the end of last year, resulting in a $500 million reduction in our unfunded pension obligation, which improves our adjusted debt position with the rating agencies.\nThe extended funding timeframe permitted under the American Rescue plan, together with the modification of interest rate stabilization rules means that we do not expect any funding requirements for the foreseeable future, assuming our plan achieves a 7.5% expected return on assets.\nAlthough, we plan to make contributions into the pension next year, this legislation provides us with additional discretion and flexibility to make voluntary contributions as we assess our capital allocation plans.\nAs Steve mentioned discussions have begun with the Department of Justice.\nWhile no contingency has been reflected in our consolidated financial statements, we believe that it is probable we will incur a loss in connection with the resolution of this investigation.\nHowever, we cannot yet reasonably estimate the amount.\nFinally last month President Biden introduced the American Jobs Plan, which includes a corporate tax increase and proposed minimum tax as well as potential opportunities related to proposed infusion into the electric vehicle infrastructure and the energy grid.\nClearly, it's very early in the process, but the corporate tax provision could be slightly cash positive for us if implemented in its current form.\nOur solid first quarter results and expectations for the year reflect our strong operating fundamentals and the continued success of our strategies to modernize and enhance our distribution and transmission systems.\nAs we move our company forward, we are laser focused on unlocking opportunities and increasing value for our shareholders, customers and employees.\nNow, let's open the call to your Q&A.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:As required by applicable SEC rules, we provide reconciliations of any such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on our website.\nIt is my pleasure to now hand the call over to our CEO, David Hult.\nIn the fourth quarter, we closed on the transformative acquisitions of Larry H. Miller and Total Care Auto, powered by Landcar, Kahlo Chrysler Jeep Dodge, Arapahoe Hyundai-Genesis and the Stevinson Automotive Group, representing approximately $6.6 billion in annualized revenue.\nThese acquisitions represent the right brands in high-growth markets and are aligned with Asbury's culture.\nWe look forward to deploying our joint capabilities and growing together, and I'm excited to have our new team members as part of the Asbury family.\n2021 was an all-time record year for Asbury.\nFor the full year, we grew adjusted EBITDA by 94% and adjusted earnings per share by 112%.\nWe delivered an operating margin adjusted at 8.1%.\nWe succeeded in adding great stores in targeted high-growth markets and we completed the rollout of our online transactional tool, Clicklane to all the legacy Asbury stores.\nIn a challenging new vehicle environment, we delivered record profitability by improving our new vehicle margin, increasing our used vehicle sales and growing our parts and service business, all while maintaining our improved employee productivity levels and using our strong cash flow for acquisitions.\nOur multiple business lines allow us to adapt and continue to deliver strong earnings in any business environment.\nWe will also deploy Total Care Auto into our legacy stores and roll out Clicklane into our recent acquisitions, allowing us to further grow our earnings.\nDue to our record performance and strong cash flow, our balance sheet remains solid.\nOur adjusted operating cash flow for 2021 was $632 million, an increase of $189 million over 2020.\nOur net leverage ended this quarter at 2.7 times.\nWe will continue to use our free cash flow to manage our leverage and maximize shareholder return through share buybacks and acquisitions.\nNow, I'd like to give you a quick update on our five-year plan.\nOur same-store adjusted revenue grew almost 12% last year, exceeding expectations.\nClicklane continues to deliver impressive metrics, generating over $570 million in additional revenue for three quarters in 2021.\nDespite lower new vehicle levels, inventory levels, Clicklane contributed an incremental 7% to our same-store growth.\nAs previously noted, we had a very successful year regarding acquisitions.\nWith these results, we maintain full confidence in the execution of our growth strategy.\nBased upon our results in 2021, we will update our five-year plan during our Q1 2022 earnings call.\nI will now hand the call over to Dan to discuss our operating performance.\nWe delivered strong results, enabling us to deliver an impressive gross margin of 20.4%, an all-time record and an expansion of 370 basis points versus the fourth quarter last year.\nOur teams continue to maximize productivity per employee, resulting in adjusted SG&A as a percentage of gross profit of 54.3%, a 710 basis point improvement versus prior year.\nOur total revenue for the quarter was up 19% year over year and total gross profit was up 46%.\nWe improved our adjusted operating margins for the quarter from 6% in 2020 to 8.9% in 2021, and we'll continue to optimize our portfolio in the future.\nNow, I will turn to our same-store performance compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, unless stated otherwise.\nStarting with new vehicles.\nBased on current market conditions, we continue to be focused on being opportunistic with our inventory and improving grosses to maximize profit.\nOur new average gross profit per vehicle was $6,335, up $3,441 or 119% from the prior-year period.\nAll segment margins were up significantly from the prior-year period.\nAt the end of December, our total new vehicle inventory was $207 million and our day supply was at eight days, down 32 days from the prior year.\nWe expect the days supply to remain low as we progress into 2022, trending up moderately toward the end of the year.\nTurning to used vehicles.\nOur used retail volume increased 15%, while gross margin was 8.2%, representing an average gross profit per vehicle of $2,623.\nAs a result of our performance, our retail gross profit was up 64%.\nOur total used vehicle inventory ended the quarter at $402 million, which represents a 34-day supply, up three days from the prior year.\nOur used to new ratio for the quarter was 109%.\nOur strong, consistent and sustainable growth in F&I delivered an increase of $213 to $1,961 per vehicle retailed from the prior-year quarter.\nIn the fourth quarter, our front-end yield per vehicle increased $2,169 per vehicle to an all-time record of $6,362.\nAnd now to parts and service.\nOur parts and service revenue increased 13% in the quarter.\nThe warranty revenue dropped 19%.\nOur customer pay revenue continues its healthy recovery, posting a 17% growth.\nWe achieved over 149,000 online service appointments, an all-time record and a 16% increase over the prior-year quarter.\nSome of the benefits of increasing online service appointments include enhancement to the customer experience, higher customer retention, higher conversion rates, higher margins and higher returns to our shareholders.\nWith three full quarters of Clicklane at all legacy stores under our belt, we would like to share some performance metrics.\nWe sold over 5,000 vehicles through Clicklane in Q4, of which 47% of them were new vehicles and 53% used.\n91% of our transactions this quarter were with customers that were new to Asbury's dealership network.\nAverage transaction time continues to be consistent with previous quarter, eight minutes for cash deals and 14 minutes for finance deals.\nTotal variable front-end yield of $4,298 and F&I front-end yield of $1,846.\nAverage credit score is higher than the average credit score at our stores.\n80% of consumers seeking financing received instant approval, while an additional 10% require some off-line assistance.\n90% of those that applied were approved for financing.\n43% of Clicklane sales had trade-ins with 78% of such trades reconditioned in retail to consumers with a total front-end yield of $4,490.\nAnd 92% of our Clicklane deliveries are within a 50-mile radius of our stores, thus allowing us the opportunity to retain our new customers in our parts and service departments.\nAs expected, Clicklane customers are converting at greater rates than traditional Internet leads.\nDuring our first few months after launching Clicklane, approximately 60% of our sales were new vehicles.\nUntil inventory levels somewhat normalized, we will not be able to fully assess the full potential of Clicklane.\nWe remain quite excited about the continued growth of Clicklane.\nAll of you have built tremendous organizations that properly align with our North Star of being the most guest-centric automotive retailer.\nOur future is bright, and I look forward to meeting all of you.\nI will now hand the call over to Michael to discuss our financial performance.\nI would like to provide some financial highlights, which marked yet another record quarter for our company.\nOverall, compared to the fourth quarter of last year, our actions to manage gross profit and control expenses resulted in a fourth quarter adjusted operating margin of 8.9%, an increase of 290 basis points above the same period last year and an all-time record.\nAdjusted net income increased 89% to $163 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased 68% to $7.46.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2021 was adjusted for acquisition expenses and acquisition-related financing expenses of $289 million or $1.02 per diluted share.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2020 was adjusted for a gain on dealership divestiture of $3.9 million or $0.15 per diluted share.\nIn addition to the net income adjustments mentioned above, our fourth quarter 2021 earnings per share was negatively impacted by the interest and additional shares issued as part of the acquisition financing that was completed prior to the acquisition closing.\nIf the financing had closed simultaneously with the Larry H. Miller acquisition, our adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter would have been positively impacted by $0.87 as a result of lower interest expense and fewer outstanding shares.\nNow for the full year 2021 results compared to 2020.\nAdjusted operating margin was 8.1%, an increase of 240 basis points at an all-time record.\nAdjusted net income increased 120% to $549 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 112% to $27.29.\nOur effective tax rate was 23.7% for 2021 compared to 24.8% in 2020.\nThis quarter, we acquired $6.6 billion in annualized revenue.\nIn order to finance the acquisitions, we completed debt and equity offerings totaling approximately $2.1 billion, a syndicated mortgage facility of approximately $700 million and borrowed under our upsized syndicated credit facility.\nIn addition, we spent approximately $34 million of capital expenditures in the quarter.\nWe generated $632 million of adjusted operating cash flow for the year.\nOur balance sheet remains healthy as we ended the quarter with approximately $437 million of liquidity, comprised of cash, excluding cash to Total Care Auto, floorplan offset accounts and availability on both our used line and revolving credit facility.\nAlso at the end of the quarter, our net leverage ratio stood at 2.7 times, below our targeted net leverage of three times.\nAs David stated earlier, today, we announced that our board has approved an increase to our share repurchase authorization by $100 million to $200 million.\nFor 2022, we are planning for a tax rate of approximately 25% to 26% and capex of approximately $150 million.\nThis amount excludes real estate purchases and potential lease buyout opportunities that we consider to be financing transactions.\nOur key objectives are: Continue our smooth transition with all of our new value team members; execute superior allocation of capital to maximize shareholder return; continue the innovation and growth of Clicklane, rolling out this fully transactional tool coast to coast into our recent acquisitions; integrate our insurance and F&I product provider, Total Care Auto, across the entire Asbury platform of dealerships, which will allow us to expand our F&I PVR; execute our companywide training initiative to continue the development and growth of our teammates; and maintain our best-in-class operating margins and SG&A.\nI would also like to make a few comments regarding our expectations for this year.\nWe are excited about 2022.\nWe see good opportunities for automotive retail, and we expect that demand will continue to exceed supply for most of the year.\nWe do anticipate a gradual recovery in inventory levels in the second half of '22 as OEM production improves.\nAs a result, we are planning our business for a SAAR of 15.5 million to 16 million units and vehicle margins consistent with 2021.\nWe will remain nimble and vigilant to adapt as conditions evolve.\nSG&A as a percentage of gross profit should continue to benefit from active expense management and improved employee productivity.\nWe look forward to continuing to deliver strong results for our shareholders, be outstanding partners with our OEMs to steward their great brands and offer an environment where our team members can thrive while providing the most guest-centric experience in automotive retail.\nFinally, I'd like to address all of my teammates at Asbury.\nOur ability to add quality stores, who, like us, care about serving our guests and being highly engaged in our communities could not have happened without you.\nYou all have given us the ability to thoughtfully grow our core business because you align behind our vision.\nPeople make the difference in any organization and you are making us a better place to work, and you are creating an environment where people want to do business.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Chief Investment Officer Greg Wright, Chief Technology Officer Chris Sharp, and Chief Revenue Officer Corey Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A.\nFor a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC.\nReconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.\nWe continue to enhance our product mix with a record contribution from our sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection category.\nWe extended our sustainability leadership with the publication of our third annual ESG report.\nWe raised revenue and EBITDA guidance for the second quarter in a row, setting the stage for accelerating growth in cash flow.\nLast but not least, we further strengthened the balance sheet with the redemption of high coupon preferred stock and the issuance of low-cost, long-term fixed rate debt.\nOur formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework.\nWe continue to advance along these lines during the second quarter.\nOur business continues to globalize.\nAnd, once again, we generated solid performance and strong bookings across all regions.\nOur full-spectrum product offering continues to blossom with record sub-1 megawatt bookings in the second quarter and regional highs in both EMEA and APAC.\nTogether, with interconnection, the sub-1 megawatt category comprised nearly half of our total bookings, demonstrating customers' enthusiastic adoption of PlatformDIGITAL to help accomplish their digital transformation initiatives.\nI'll discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3.\nIn June, we were awarded the Green Lease Leader Gold award from the Institute for Market Transformation and the U.S. Department of Energy for the third year.\nWe remain the only data center provider to receive this award, which recognizes Digital Realty as a leader in the real estate industry that incorporates green leasing provisions to better align our interest with our customers and drive high performance and healthy buildings.\nDuring the second quarter, we published our third annual ESG report, detailing our 2020 sustainability initiatives, including the utilization of renewable energy for 100% of our energy needs across our entire portfolio in Europe as well as our U.S. colocation portfolio and reaching 50% of our global needs.\nWe also reported progress toward our science-based target, ensuring a deep focus on our renewable energy, energy efficiency and supply chain sustainability initiatives.\nOur ESG report highlights many of our ongoing initiatives, including our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts along with our community involvement.\nDigital Realty is committed to being an active member of and giving back to the communities where we operate globally.\nWe encourage and celebrate community involvement and employee engagement activities through our Do Better Together initiative.\nWe also recently underscored our commitment to transparency and accountability on our diversity, equity and inclusion journey with the publication of our EEO-1 report.\nEvents over the past year and a half have demonstrated that now more than ever, ESG belongs at the forefront of our business.\nI'm proud of our leadership in this area as we advance our broader goal of delivering sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders, investors, customers, employees, and the communities we serve around the world.\nLet's turn to our investment activity on Page 4.\nWe are continuing to invest in our global platform with 39 projects underway around the world as of June 30, totaling nearly 300 megawatts of incremental capacity, most of which is scheduled for delivery over the next 12 months.\nWe are investing most heavily in EMEA with 19 projects totaling over 150 megawatts of capacity under construction.\nMost of this capacity is highly connected, including projects in Frankfurt, Marseille, Paris, and Zurich.\nDemand remains strong across these metros, and each continues to attract service providers as well as enterprise customers from around the world, many of which contributed to a truly standout performance by the region during the second quarter in the up-to-1 megawatt category.\nIn North America, over half of our capacity under construction is concentrated in two hot markets, Portland and Toronto, that can sometimes be overlooked in favor of more traditional North American data center metros.\nWe've had tremendous recent success in these two metros.\nWe have 30 megawatts under construction in Portland or, more specifically, Hillsboro, that are now fully pre-leased, while our Toronto connected campus continues to gain momentum as the premier Canadian hub for global cloud service providers and enterprise customers.\nFinally, in Asia Pacific, we are accelerating our organic growth in this underserved region.\nWe opened our third data center in Singapore, a 50-megawatt facility that received permitting prior to the moratorium on new data center construction.\nDemand for this scarce capacity is robust, and we have another 18 megawatts largely presold and scheduled to open this quarter.\nAlso coming soon in this region are a pair of MC Digital Realty data centers in Japan.\nWith the world's eyes currently on Tokyo for the Olympics, we are opening a new Tokyo facility that's poised to win the gold medal.\nWe are also opening another data center in Osaka this quarter, along with our first data center and the first carrier-neutral offering in Seoul, Korea, during the fourth quarter.\nWe are very excited about the opportunity in Seoul.\nFinally, earlier this month, we announced our intention to enter India in partnership with Brookfield Infrastructure.\nGiven the success of our existing partnership on the Ascenty platform in Latin America, the complementary skills and expertise that we both bring to this partnership, and with the significant growth opportunity available in India, we are excited to expand our footprint in this robust and dynamic market.\nLet's turn to the macro environment on Page 5.\nWe are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers.\nOur leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on PlatformDIGITAL.\nThe first of these trends is the growing importance of data gravity for Global 2000 enterprises.\nLast year, we introduced the Data Gravity Index, our market intelligence tool, which forecasts the growing intensity of enterprise data creation life cycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure between key global markets.\nEarlier this year, we took the next step and published an industry manifesto, enabling connected data communities to guide cross-industry collaboration, tackle data gravity head-on, and unlock a new era of growth opportunity for all companies.\nEarlier this week, we announced a collaboration with Zayo to further interconnection business through the creation of an open fabric-of-fabrics.\nWith data sets exploding and data gravity challenges expanding, this initiative will enable multinational enterprises to connect these data oceans through fabric and orchestration.\nThird-party research continues to support data gravity's growing importance.\nMarket Intelligence firm, Gartner, recently conducted its 6th annual survey of chief data officers, and less than 35% of these executives reported their business have achieved their data sharing objectives, including data exchange with external data sources that drive revenue-generating business outcomes.\nIssues often arise due to multiple data hosting and processing meeting places together with the need for appropriate security controls and the inability to overcome latency challenges with direct private interconnection between many counterparties.\nPlatformDIGITAL was designed to solve these problems.\nDigital transformation is compounding this enterprise data and connectivity problem.\nRecent research indicates that enterprise workflows utilize an average of 400 unique data sources, while exchanging data with 27 external cloud products.\nDigital Realty's enterprise and service provider customers are turning to PlatformDIGITAL to overcome these issues by deploying their own data hubs and using interconnection to securely exchange data in and across multiple metros.\nOur leadership position is resonating with industry experts and influencers.\nFor the second consecutive year, Digital Realty was named a global leader by IDC MarketScape for data center colocation and interconnection services, further acknowledgment of our consistently improving customer capabilities.\nThis recognition reflects our execution against the PlatformDIGITAL road map, providing unique differentiated value for customers with our fit-for-purpose, full-spectrum global capabilities.\nEarlier this month, Cloudscene again ranked Digital Realty as the strongest provider of data center ecosystems in EMEA for the second consecutive year.\nDigital Realty was ranked second in both North America as well as Latin America and jumped up three spots to No.\nAlso, in July, GigaOm published their analysis of edge infrastructure capabilities.\nDigital Realty ranked as an industry leader on multiple criteria across three broad categories.\nOur capabilities were ranked highest in vendor positioning and evaluation metrics comparison and second among the key criteria comparison.\nGiven the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business, and the relevance of our platform to meeting customers' needs, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store.\nLet's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7.\nWe signed total bookings of $113 million in the second quarter, including a $13 million contribution from interconnection.\nNetwork and enterprise-oriented deals of 1 megawatt or less reached an all-time high of $41 million, demonstrating our consistent momentum and the growing success of PlatformDIGITAL as we continue to capture a greater share of enterprise demand.\nThe weighted average lease term was over eight years.\nWe landed 109 new logos during the second quarter, with a strong showings across all regions, again, demonstrating the power of our global platform.\nThe geographic and product mix of our new activity was quite healthy, with APAC and EMEA, each contributing approximately 20%, the Americas representing nearly 50%, and interconnection responsible for a little over 10%.\nThe megawatt or less plus interconnection category accounted for almost half of our total bookings with particular strength in the cloud, content and financial services verticals.\nIn terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, we landed a top five cloud service provider to anchor our new Tokyo campus.\nClose on the heels of this magnetic customer deployment, Japan's most popular social media applications selected PlatformDIGITAL on the same campus.\nNAVER, the leading Korea-based cloud provider serving the greater APAC region, selected our new carrier-neutral facility in Singapore to support data-intensive workloads for their high-performance computing and I -- AI-intensive technology-based platform.\nA European broadcaster is leveraging PlatformDIGITAL in Vienna and Frankfurt to rewire their network in favor of data-intensive interconnection with benefits in performance, scalability, and cost savings.\nA Global 2000 enterprise data platform is adopting PlatformDIGITAL in Amsterdam, Dublin and Frankfurt to orchestrate workloads across hundreds of ecosystem applications, delivering improved performance, security, cost savings, and simplicity.\nIn London, PlatformDIGITAL is supporting a top three global money center banks fortification of their business continuity capabilities without compromising their data-intensive interconnection requirements.\nOn the continent, our connectivity and operational capabilities are helping two independent fintech customers improve performance enhance -- and enhance access to their connected data communities.\nFinally, in North America, a life sciences digital marketing firm chose PlatformDIGITAL to improve their network architecture and enable future growth.\nTurning to our backlog on Page 9.\nThe current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced ticked down from $307 million to $303 million as commencement slightly eclipsed space and power leases signed during the quarter.\nThe lag between signings and commencements was a bit longer than our long-term historical average at just over seven months.\nMoving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 10.\nWe signed $178 million of renewals during the second quarter in addition to new leases signed.\nThe weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the second quarter was just under three years, again, reflecting a greater mix of enterprise deals smaller than 1 megawatt.\nWe retained 77% of expiring leases, while cash releasing spreads on renewals were slightly positive, also reflective of the greater mix of sub-1 megawatt renewals in the total.\nIn terms of second quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy ticked down by 60 basis points as we brought additional capacity online across six metros during the quarter.\nSame capital cash NOI growth was negative 1.5% in the second quarter, largely driven by the churn in Ashburn at the beginning of the year.\nAs a reminder, the Westin Building in Seattle, the Interxion platform in EMEA, Lamda Helix in Greece and Altus IT in Croatia are not yet included in the same-store pool.\nSo these same capital comparisons are less representative of our underlying business today than usual.\nLet's turn to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 11.\nThe U.S. dollar fluctuated during the second quarter but remained below the prior year average, providing a bit of an FX tailwind.\nAs a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective.\nIn addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing.\nGiven our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed-rate debt, a 100 basis-point move in benchmark rates would have roughly a 75 basis-point impact on full year FFO per share.\nIn terms of earnings growth, second quarter core FFO per share was flat year-over-year but down 8% from last quarter driven by $0.12 noncash deferred tax charge related to the higher corporate tax rate in the U.K., which came into effect during the second quarter.\nExcluding the tax charge, which was not previously contemplated in our guidance, we outperformed our internal forecast due to a beat on the top line with a slight assist from FX tailwinds as well as operating expense savings, partially due to lower property-level spending in the COVID-19 environment.\nFor the second time this year, we are raising our full-year outlook for total revenue and adjusted EBITDA to reflect the underlying momentum in our business.\nThe deferred tax charge does run through core FFO per share.\nSince it is noncash, the deferred tax charge does not hit AFFO.\nMost of the drivers of our guidance table are unchanged.\nBut I would like to point out that we are lowering our expected recurring CapEx spend for the remainder of the year, setting a stage for accelerating growth in cash flow.\nAs you could see from the bridge chart on Page 12, we expect our bottom line results to improve sequentially over the balance of the year as the deferred tax charge comes out of the quarterly run rate and the momentum in our underlying business continues to accelerate.\nWe do still expect to see some normalization in our cost structure with an increase in property-level operating expenses that have been deferred due to COVID, along with an uptick in G&A expense as we return to the office and resume a more normal travel schedule.\nSo your model should reflect these higher costs.\nLast, but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 13.\nAs you may recall, we closed on the sale of a portfolio of noncore assets in Europe for $680 million late in the first quarter, which impacted second quarter adjusted EBITDA to the tune of approximately $10 million.\nAs a result, net debt to adjusted EBITDA was slightly elevated 6x as of the end of the second quarter but is expected to come back down in line with our long-term range over the course of the year through a combination of proceeds from asset sales and growth in cash flows as signed leases commence.\nFixed charge coverage ticked down slightly, also reflecting the near-term impact from asset sales, but remains well above our target and close to an all-time high at 5.4x, reflecting the results of our proactive liability management.\nWe continue to execute our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related costs and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets.\nIn mid-May, we redeemed $200 million of preferred stock at 6.625%, which brought total preferred equity redemptions over the prior 12 months to $700 million at a weighted average coupon of just over 6.25%, effectively lowering leverage by 0.3 turns.\nIn mid-June, we issued 0.5 million shares under our ATM program, raising approximately $77 million.\nIn early July, we raised another $26 million with the sale of the balance of our Megaport stock.\nWe also took our first trip to the Swiss bond market in early July, raising approximately $595 million in a dual tranche offering of Swiss green bonds with a weighted average maturity of a little over six and a half years and a weighted average coupon of approximately 0.37%.\nThis successful execution against our financial strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers, enables us to prudently fund our growth.\nAs you can see from the chart on Page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is nearly six and a half years, and our weighted average coupon is down to 2.2%.\ndollar-denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform and serving as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment, and 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling.\nFinally, as you can see from the left side of Page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years.\nOur balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy.\nAndrew, would you please begin the Q&A session?\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:With me here today are Jenna Foger, Peter Moglia, Steve Richardson, and Dean Shigenaga.\nAs Michael Jordan once said, some people want it to happen, some people wish it to happen, others make it happen.\nAlexandria makes it happen.\nFor a moment, keys to the second quarter, historic high demand for Alexandria's lab space and our critical lab operations, which go along with that.\nAlexandria is at the vanguard of meeting the historic and high unprecedented demand from many of our more than 750 tenants for growth needs now and a critical path for future growth very importantly.\nFundamental drivers of demand are the strongest we've ever seen.\nRental rate growth continues unabated and no excess supply on the horizon at this time.\nWe're very proud that we've got almost 7% quarter-to-quarter per share FFO growth, more than 40% rental rate growth, almost 18% NOI growth, almost 8% same-store NOI growth and a $1.3-plus billion annual NOI run rate, not to mention about $545 million in incremental revenue in our development and redevelopment pipeline.\nAlexandria truly has a demonstrable pricing power advantage in each of our cluster markets.\nAnd when life science tenants choose, they almost always prefer Alexandria's lab space and our operational excellence based on our critical lab operations.\nNature Biotechnology, a magazine back in April wrote the following: 2020 was a year that smashed many records.\nBiotech saved your role and the pandemic attracted a stampede of private and public investors alike.\nThe pandemic apparently reinforced the requirement for long-term value-based investors of any kind to have exposure to life sciences.\nAnd life science demand has in fact hit an all-time high as the world has recognized the importance of next-generation therapies to solve current and future really difficult healthcare challenges.\nAnd Jenna will talk a bit more about it.\nI'm going to highlight just a couple of things for the moment.\nThe pandemic has underscored the support for the National Institutes of Health and investment in basic science, which are keys to ensuring that the U.S. maintain its leadership position in life science and maximizing national preparedness to address current and future healthcare challenges.\nThere is a proposal right now to increase the fiscal year '22 NIH budget up to $51 billion, nearly a 20% boost over fiscal year '21.\nThe FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, better known as CDERS approved 23 new molecular entities in the first half of 2021, putting it on the pace to exceed 2020's near-record approval high of 53.\nFollowing a historic year of 2020, venture capital in Life Science continues at a very strong pace of almost $36 billion already raised in the first half of 2021, on pace to eclipse 2020's all-time high of $46 billion.\nThis unprecedented level is likely to continue throughout the year due to substantial dry powder available to life science funds and increased investment from institutional, generalists and traditional life science investors.\nFollowing a record 2020 for IPOs and follow-on offerings, the first half of this year have continued to reach new highs, with over $8 billion raised in 52 IPOs and over $17 billion raised in many follow-ons, positioning 2021 for an all-time record year of public market investment in life science.\nR&D continues with amazing productivity and resilience through COVID, enabling the industry to expediently deliver novel vaccines and therapies to combat the global pandemic.\nNew biology, drug discovery platforms and increasing focus on complex medicines as the future therapeutic innovation have all demonstrated the life science industry's ability to effectively drive solutions to current and future healthcare challenges and yield strong returns to investors.\nAnd maybe a final comment would be as Project Warp Speed did in bringing a historic public private partnership together of the government on the one hand and the private industry, biotech and pharma companies on the other hand, at a warp speed rate to bring research and development and commercialization of the COVID vaccines in record time as well as ensure a timely manufacturing supply.\nWe really do need a 21st infrastructure package, not a 20th century package like the one Congress is now debating.\nWe need to make the U.S. self-sufficient in semiconductors.\nWe only produce now about 11% to 13% and self-sufficient in next-gen manufacturing of complex medicines.\nAs Joel highlighted last quarter and continues to be reaffirmed by the fundamental he just shared is the tremendous paradox of this pandemic moment for the life science industry.\nDespite the challenges of these past many months, COVID has illuminated the power of science and the industry's ability to transform the future of human health.\nNot only are so many of our tenants in the industry, as Joel mentioned, risen to the challenge of combating global pandemics, but R&D and bioinnovation broadly have persisted with amazing productivity, resilience and experiences throughout this time.\nAnd we cannot stress not how critical it is for us a halt to preserve and prioritize and continue to catalyze this groundbreaking innovation that has and will continue to save so many lives.\nSo turning to COVID-specific update for a few moments.\nA total of 3.7 billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide with nearly 10% of these doses in the U.S. alone.\nRoughly 57.5% of the vaccine-eligible population in our country, that's 12 and over have been fully vaccinated by either tenant Pfizer or Moderna's 2-shot mRNA-based vaccine or tenant Johnson & Johnson's single shot.\nThis is just over 49% of the total U.S. population, and we hope this number of fully vaccinated individuals will continue to steadily rise.\nThese numbers are astounding.\nAnd before we get into the where are we now, I want to emphasize that despite the COVID fatigue, we all continue to fuel even despite some relief from the easing of restrictions over the past few months, albeit with the likely return of some new ones, none of where we are in the recovery process can be taken for granted.\nThe fact that the biopharma industry spearheaded by many of our tenants was equipped with the know-how, resources and technology to create safe and effective vaccines to combat a novel viral pathogen would have been unimaginable just a few decades ago.\nThe fact that our tenants Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson were able to develop, run robust clinical trials, manufacture and distribute billions of vaccines at scale in less than 12 months is absolutely unprecedented.\nThese vaccines achieved such astounding safety and efficacy in the 90-plus percent range when the FDA has set the original bar at 50%, with an amazingly low incidence of side effects reported from the millions of people who have now received that is truly astounding.\nThe fact that the biopharma industry, government and many other public and private agencies came together to ensure all of the above transpired at a pace and level sufficient to provide adequate vaccine supply to inoculate the entire U.S. population as we now have, unlike most nations around the world, is not to be undervalued.\nAnd the fact that we have a regulatory agency in the FDA that has worked around the clock to review thousands of COVID-19-related applications to maximize the availability of high-quality testing and safe and effective vaccines and therapies against COVID-19 cannot go unrecognized.\nSo where are we now?\nIt's been just over 18 months since the first U.S. COVID case was reported on January 21, 2020.\nYet despite all of the progress with vaccines, etc.\n, countries around the world are still very much combating new COVID-19 surges, driven most recently in part to the increasing prevalence of the so-called Delta variant.\nIn the U.S., this highly continuous Delta variant, approximately 50% more transmissible with 1,000 times higher viral load account for at least 83% of COVID cases.\nAverage daily confirmed COVID case count now exceed 50,000, which is guide x that of the mid-June lows with hospitalization and deaths rising as well.\nHowever, as worrying is this trend may seem breakthrough infections, those are infections that occur in vaccinated people are still relatively uncommon.\nAnd the vast majority of these breakthrough cases have not caused serious illness, hospitalization or death.\nMore than 95% of people hospitalized for COVID-19 are unvaccinated, and the vaccine still remain effective even against the Delta variant.\nSo while they may not entirely prevent transmission, they do seem almost entirely able to prevent severe disease and death.\nWith regards to vaccine safety.\nThere have been very few adverse events, less than seven per million reported overall with nearly all cases resolving and without long-term side effects reported.\nAs such, the strong safety and efficacy profile will likely garner full FDA approval for mRNA-based vaccines for Pfizer and Moderna this fall.\nWith regards to pregnancy and women of childbearing age, though data is more limited, based on the safety data generated to date and how we know vaccines work in the body, the CDC does encourage pregnant women to get vaccinated, especially given that pregnant and recently pregnant women are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.\nWith regards to children, Pfizer has an emergency use authorization for children over 12, and the FDA is urging Pfizer and Moderna to expand their studies in children aged five to 11.\nSo what's next and where are we headed?\nThe evolving data and the duration of immunity and COVID-19 variants of concern suggests that COVID-19 and the need for vaccines and boosters will likely persist long term.\nHowever, the faster we can vaccinate the population in this country and increase access to vaccines in the rest of the world, the more effectively we can slow the emergence of new variants and the sooner we can turn this virus into a less deadly pathogen even if still contagious.\nAnd given that COVID will likely remain on the planet for the foreseeable future, therapies are going to continue to be important in mitigating the severity of COVID-19, such as recently authorized to our tenant Bayer and GSK for their new antibody.\nEqually as important, is continued COVID testing, of course, for active virus in symptomatic individuals as well as surveillance testing across the population to detect new outbreaks, sequence emerging variants and track overall transmission.\nThe last point I want to make is regarding the FDA, which has received somewhat unyielding flack over the past several months despite the herculean COVID efforts while maintaining a near all-time record high pace of new drug approvals, as Joel highlighted.\nThis criticism has been mounting on account of several factors, including the lack of a fully appointed FDA commissioner, the growing backlog of review requirements for new investigational drug applications given the strong pace of innovation of our industry, the lack of fully approved vaccines despite their being authorized under the emergency use authorization pathway and most recently, the historic and highly controversial approval of Biogen's Aduhelm to treat Alzheimer's disease.\nThis was the first approval in nearly two decades for this chronic neurodegenetive disease affecting over six million people in the U.S. alone.\nI will save commentary on all of this for another time, but it needs to be said that without the FDA's steadfast and tireless work throughout COVID to maximize the review of the immense COVID-relating testing, therapeutic and vaccine applications will try to keep up pace with the record numbers of submissions from the industry, we as a nation would fall way behind.\nIt is nothing short of astounding and worthy of the utmost recognition.\nThe FDA is critical for ensuring the safety of all drug products that are available in the U.S. while balancing efficacy and expediency.\nThe future productivity and leadership of the agency, which will be announced by November of this year is of the utmost importance to all of us.\nAs the FDA is instrumental in ensuring the continued pace and vitality of biomedical innovation in our country.\nBiopharma is emerging from COVID as a dawn of historic new era for biotech and scientific innovation.\nThe world recognizes the value of this industry and the potential for next-generation medicines as evidenced by Moderna and Pfizer's next-generation vaccines to address current and future healthcare challenges.\nAnd clearly, the paradox of this pandemic moment has only reaffirmed why Alexandria has dedicated our business, our passion and our purpose to help drive this mission-critical industry forward.\nI'd like to take a step back at the start of my comments and provide some historical context for the accelerating demand which really translates into leasing at warp speed for Alexandria's mega campuses.\nAt Alexandria's Annual Investor Day during December 2017, we presented a bold framework to nearly double the company's annual rental revenues from a little more than $800 million to $1.5 billion by the end of 2022.\nWe are pleased to share those annualized revenues for Q2 2021 are, in fact, in excess of $1.5 billion.\nAnd so the Alexandria team has accomplished this lofty goal in an accelerated time frame more than one year sooner than anticipated.\nThe company has also grown from a mission-critical operating asset base and development pipeline of 29 million square feet at the end of 2017, to a total of 62 million square feet at the end of Q2 2021.\nTruly exceptional growth, more than doubling the footprint of the company, and importantly, concentrated in our core clusters with disciplined execution, enabling the continuation of high-quality cash flows.\nAnd as we fielded questions during the 2020 as to whether the healthy leasing activity for Alexandria's mega campus platform was perhaps a short-term blip driven by COVID-19, the second quarter of this year's leasing volume of more than 1.9 million square feet, the highest quarterly leasing volume in the history of the company is again evidence of the company's unique position as a trusted partner to the growing life science industry, providing a durable and sustainable competitive advantage in the market.\nI'll go ahead and review a few of the exceptional highlights, including the following: leasing outperformance.\nAs we just stated, the 1.9 million square feet lease represents the highest quarterly leasing activity during the 27-year history of the company.\nTruly leasing at warp speed.\nI'll direct you to page two of the supplemental, where it indicates the 3.4 million square feet under construction is 80% leased and the additional 3.6 million square feet anticipated to commence construction during 2021, 2022 is 89% leased and negotiating.\nSo robust leasing and our growth pipeline provides exceptional clarity, and these projects in total will drive incremental revenues in excess of $545 million.\nWe also have exceptional core results.\nCash increases this quarter of 25.4% and GAAP increases of 42.4%.\nOccupancy remained very solid at 94.3% and the operating portfolio, which would have been 98.1% if were not for the 1.4 million square feet of vacancy in recently acquired properties, which provide for near-term incremental annual rental revenues in excess of $55 million.\nIn market health, demand, as we've outlined, continues to accelerate, and Alexandria's branded and highly desirable mega campuses and supply does continue to be restrained during 2021 across all of our markets, and we do not see any disruptive large-scale projects delivering 2022, '23.\nWe're closely evaluating Greater Boston's ground-up pipeline, which is 56% leased.\nAnd in the San Francisco area, we are monitoring leasing activity at two or three ground-up lab projects.\nAnd as we've stated before, there have been no significant lab sublease spaces put in the market for several quarters now.\nSo in conclusion, the first half of 2021 continues the very strong outperformance by Alexandria and our intent focus on operational excellence has positioned the company very well to enhance its industry-leading brand.\nWith that, I'll hand it off to Peter.\nI'm going to update you all on our development pipeline and construction cost trends, comment on our recent asset sales and report on a couple of comps that reflect that the private market appetite for life science assets is still very healthy.\nAs Steve and Joel both noted, we're experiencing historic demand and have responded by executing our differentiated life science strategy at an accelerated pace through expanding our collaborative campuses and asset base in each of our cluster markets.\nA significant sign of the health of the underlying life science industry is that we're expanding significantly in almost all of our markets.\nIn many of our submarkets, the supply and demand imbalance has been exacerbated by a lack of near-term opportunities to expand, leading Alexandria to push the boundaries of those markets.\nExamples of this are successful forays into Watertown and Seaport in Greater Boston, new mega campuses in Sorrento Mesa, and expansion of San Diego Science sector to the north and east, and a highly successful mega campus underway in San Carlos.\nThis high demand paired with our highly experienced development teams resulted in another very productive quarter for Alexandria.\nIn the second quarter, we delivered 755,565 square feet, spread over five assets located in South San Francisco, San Carlos, Long Island City, San Diego and the Research Triangle.\nThis is double what we delivered in the first quarter, and these deliveries will provide more than $31 million in annual rental revenue over the next year.\nIn addition, this historic demand has led to improved quarter-over-quarter leasing and leases under negotiation numbers despite adding two new assets that have had little marketing time.\nAssets contributing notably to this outcome include 840 Winter Street and Waltham Mass, which is a testament to our ability to capture demand from companies needing facilities for next-gen manufacturing.\n3160 Porter Drive in Palo Alto, a joint effort with Stanford to commercialize the University's most innovative science.\nAnd 5505 Morehouse in Sorrento Mesa, which is benefiting from Alexandria's place-making expertise and strong demand drivers in San Diego.\nIn addition, we expect to have another 3.6 million square feet in 19 properties commenced construction this year, and next that are already 89% leased or under negotiation.\nAs Steve also mentioned, these properties will cumulatively add approximately $545 million of annual rental revenue once fully delivered.\nI felt it necessary to remind everybody of that.\nConstruction costs remain elevated from trade -- from some trades and commodities holding study and others continuing to be unexplainable and unprecedented levels.\nLumber is a positive story and could be a microcosm for what will happen with other commodities.\nA year ago, lumber was $500 per thousand board feet, which was about $100 above its historical norm.\nIt climbed to $1,700 per thousand board feet in early May, but has since dropped back down to $600 per thousand board feet, and is still dropping.\nThe reason for the drop was a large number of residential projects were put on hold due to the price of lumber.\nWith this pullback in demand, the mills have been able to catch up, leading to stabilization in pricing.\nA correction due to a decrease in demand is essentially what's going to eventually normalize all construction commodities.\nCopper has shown signs of dropping, but it's still two times above historical norms.\nAlternatives such as aluminum are being considered to alleviate the pricing pressures.\nAnd if there's enough adoption, it could lead to a stabilization in pricing.\nDespite the promising news with lumber and copper, rolled steel remains very volatile and is not showing any signs of stabilizing.\nRolled steel is used for things such as metal decks, metal studs and ductwork.\nSo it's very impactful on multilevel buildings with large HVAC needs such as lab buildings.\nSo we have to keep our cost escalation assumptions on the high end despite the noted drop in some commodities.\nThe reason being reported is both a commodity and labor issue at the shops that create the products from raw materials.\nCOVID caused many to shut down.\nAnd then when demand exploded, the shops had a hard time getting the labor to come back.\nThe shops try to solve this by scheduling longer shifts, but the amount of rolled steel showing up was not enough to support those shops.\nThus, prices remained very high with metal studs up 75% since January.\nWe want to assure you that we're keeping a very close eye on commodities and have been developing strategies to counter these increases.\nAnd together with our prudent underwriting, we will continue to deliver our projects on time and on budget as we always have.\nI'll conclude by commenting on our recent sales and provide a couple of comps that were announced recently.\nI discussed our record 4% cap rate at 213 East last quarter, but I want to add that in addition to achieving that cap rate, we also achieved an unlevered IRR of 9.6%.\nAnd a value creation margin, which is calculated by dividing our gain by gross book value of 56%.\nWe achieved a 12% unlevered IRR on this sale and a value creation margin of 61%, a truly remarkable outcome, and it's very reflective of the high-quality assets we've developed and continue to develop in the Seattle region and elsewhere.\nOutside of those Alexandria transactions, there are a couple of transactions of note in our submarkets that reflect the high value that private investors are putting on life science assets today.\nIn Sorrento Mesa, an asset known as The Canyons, which contains a little over 1/3 of lab and manufacturing space with the balance being office, sold at a 4.48% cap rate and a value of $575 per square foot.\nThe cash flow is from a credit tenant and there is no near-term upside, so the cap rate really reflects the yield a private investor was willing to pay in a submarket that a couple of years ago would have commanded a cap rate with a six handle.\nIn a similar vein, the other comp we're reporting comes from Rockville, Maryland, which was received to be a seven cap rate submarket by some analysts not too long ago.\n9615 Medical Center Drive, located in the Shady Grove submarket and adjacent to a number of Alexandria properties was sold to a U.S. insurance company for a 5.18% cap rate and a valuation of $610 per square foot.\nThe asset is a leasehold interest subject to a long-term ground lease that happens to be owned by Alexandria.\nAnd with that, I'll pass it over to Dean.\nWe reported exceptional operating and financial results for the first half of '21 and provided a very strong outlook for the remainder of the year.\nRevenue and net operating income for the second quarter was up 16.6% and 16.8% over the second quarter of 2020, respectively.\nAnd NOI for the second quarter was up 6.9% over the first quarter of '21.\nNow venture investment gains included in FFO per share were $25.5 million for the second quarter and was consistent with the first quarter of '21.\nNow looking back over the last two quarters, we raised our outlook for FFO per share, $0.03 when we reported first quarter results.\nAnd during the second quarter, we raised our outlook for FFO per share again by another $0.02.\nNow this $0.02 increase was announced in connection with our Form 8-K filing date at June 14, when we were substantially through the second quarter and had solid visibility into the strength of core results for the quarter.\nSame-property NOI growth for the first half of '21 continue to benefit from our high-quality tenant roster, with 53% of our annual rental revenue from investment-grade rated or large-cap publicly traded companies.\nSame-property NOI growth for the first half of '21 was very strong at 4.4% and 7.4% on a cash basis.\nHigh rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing the space was the key driver for the improvement in our outlook for 2021 same-property net operating growth to 2% to 4% and 4.7% to 6.7%, an increase of 30 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively.\nNow while the primary focus of our acquisitions for 2021 has been driven by strong demand from our tenant relationships for both current and future development and redevelopment projects, certain acquisitions have also included operating properties with opportunities to drive growth and cash flows through lease-up of vacancy.\nNow these operating properties have contributed to NOI growth in the first half of '21.\nIt's important to highlight that the lease-up of 1.4 million rental square feet of vacancy at these properties will provide further growth in annual rental revenue in excess of $55 million.\nNow occupancy that we reported for June 30 was 94.3% and 98.1% on a pro forma basis, excluding vacancy from recently acquired properties.\nAnd it's also important to highlight that if we set aside recently acquired properties, our occupancy is on track to improve by 100 basis points in 2021.\nNow we believe it's important to highlight the strategic benefits of having the team with tremendous experience and expertise with designing, building and operating sophisticated laboratory office buildings and the team with decades of trusted partnerships with our highly innovative tenants.\nAs mentioned earlier, we have one of the highest credit tenant rosters in the REIT industry.\nWe have one of the highest adjusted EBITDA margins in the REIT industry at 69%.\nWe reported our lowest AR balance since 2012 at $6.7 million, truly amazing when you consider that our total market capitalization was over $26 billion as of June 30.\nAnd we continue to consistently report high collections at 99.4% for July.\nWe reported record leasing velocity at over 3.6 million rentable square feet executed in the first half of this year.\nAnd this run rate is significantly exceeding the strong leasing volume for 2020 and on track for exceptional rental rate growth in the range of 31% to 34% and 18% to 21% on lease renewals and releasing the space the last figures on a cash basis, by the way.\nNow as a trusted partner with access to over 750 tenants in our portfolio, we are well positioned to capture the tremendous demand from our tenant roster and life science industry relationships.\nWe have a super exciting pipeline of projects under construction, aggregating 3.4 million rentable square feet, 80% lease negotiating.\nNear-term projects starts 89% leased were under negotiations, aggregating 3.7 million square feet.\nNow this aggregates about 6.9 million square feet, 90% of which is related to space requirements from our existing relationships.\nThese projects will generate an amazing amount of incremental annual rental revenue exceeding $545 million or a 34% increase above the second quarter rental revenues annualized of $1.6 billion.\nNow importantly, we also expect to start additional projects between now and December of 2022.\nOur venture investments portfolio continue to highlight the exceptional talent of our science and technology team for underwriting high-quality innovative entities.\nAs of June 30, unrealized gains were $962 million on an adjusted cost basis of $990 million.\nRealized gains on our venture investments for the second quarter were $60.2 million, including $34.8 million of realized gains excluded from FFO per share.\nNow for the first half of '21, we realized gains aggregating about $57.7 million that related to significant gains in three investments that were excluded from FFO per share as adjusted.\nNow we're pleased that the venture investment program is generating capital exceeding our initial forecast for 2021, and we hope this will be in the range of about $100-plus million for the entire year.\nNow continuing on to our very strong and flexible balance sheet to support our strategic growth initiatives.\nWe continue to be very pleased to have one of the best balance sheets in the REIT industry, providing us access to attractive long-term cost of capital.\nWe remain on track for net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5.2 times by year-end.\nOur fixed charge coverage ratio for the fourth quarter has increased to greater than five times.\nWe continue to maintain significant liquidity of $4.5 billion as of June 30.\nWe're in a solid position with debt maturities with our next maturity representing only $184 million comes due in 2024.\nAnd while it's challenging to predict when owners of real estate will decide to sell, two to three transactions drove most of the amount of acquisitions and accounted for about half of our target for 2021.\nFor the remainder of the year, our goal is to remain very selective with acquisitions.\nOur team is advancing a number of important dispositions primarily focused on partial interest sales in high-value, low cap rate properties for reinvestment into our strategic value creation development and redevelopment projects.\nNow to date, in 2021, we have completed $580 million at cap rates in the 4% to 4.2% range.\nAnd we have about $1.4 billion in process at various stages and expect to move along other dispositions that will push us well above the top end of our range for dispositions, which are currently at $2.2 billion.\nNow we are targeting about $1 billion in dispositions to close in the third quarter and the remainder in the fourth quarter.\nImportantly, each of these key pending transactions will continue to highlight the tremendous value we have and continue to create for our stakeholders.\nThis guidance is an update to our guidance for the year that was disclosed on our Form 8-K dated June 14.\nWe narrowed the range of guidance from $0.10 to $0.08 for both earnings per share and FFO per share.\nEPS was updated to a range from $3.46 to $3.54 and FFO per share as adjusted was updated to a range from $7.71 to $7.79 with no change in the midpoint of FFO per share diluted as adjusted of $7.75.\nNow as a reminder, since our initial FFO per share guidance for 2021, we have increased the midpoint of our guidance by $0.05 for growth in 2021, representing an increase of 6.1% over 2020.\nI also wanted to express our team's appreciation for continued recognition by an independent panel of judges for a six NAREIT Gold Award for Communication and Reporting Excellence to the investment community.\nOperator, we can go to questions, please.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These statements are based on how we see things today.\nActual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties.\nSome of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results.\nTom will provide some comments on our performance as well as an overview of the current operating environment.\nBernadette will then provide details on our second quarter results and updated fiscal 2022 outlook.\nWe're pleased with the improvement in our manufacturing and supply chain operations as well as the progress in our financial performance in the quarter and I'm proud of how Lamb Weston team has been able to navigate through this difficult macro environment.\nWe generated strong sales and solid demand across our food away-from-home channels drove volume growth and the initial benefits of our recent pricing actions began to offset inflationary pressures.\nIn addition, our efforts to stabilize our manufacturing operations are on track, including increasing staffing in our processing plants to improve production run rates and throughput.\nTogether, our sales and operating momentum drove sequential gross margin improvement in the quarter and have us well positioned to better manage the upcoming cost pressures from this year's exceptionally poor potato crop in the Pacific Northwest.\nWhile our operations and financial results are not yet where we want them to be, we're on track to deliver our financial targets for the year and our investments in capacity and productivity will get us well positioned to deliver higher margins and sustainable growth over the long term.\nBefore Bernadette gets into some of the specifics of our second quarter results and outlook, let's briefly review the current operating environment, starting with demand.\nIn the U.S., overall fry demand and restaurant traffic in the quarter remained solid, especially at quick service restaurants where demand has continued to be strong and above pre-pandemic levels.\nTraffic at full-service restaurants during the quarter was also solid but remained below pre-pandemic levels.\nRestaurant traffic, though, has softened recently as the spread of COVID variants have tempered consumer demand for on-premise dining and as restaurants closed temporarily due to staff shortages.\nWhile we expect that COVID wave will continue to temper demand for on-premise dining in the near term, we do not anticipate that it will have a meaningful effect on traffic or demand at QSRs.\nDemand at noncommercial outlets also improved during the quarter but continued to be below pre-pandemic levels.\nAs with on-premise dining, we expect the spread of COVID variants will affect near-term demand.\nThe fry attachment rate in the U.S., which is the rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets, continue to be above pre-pandemic levels.\nThis served to support our out-of-home fry demand in the quarter.\nThe increase in the fry attachment rate has been fairly consistent since the beginning of the pandemic and we do not see that changing in the near term.\nFry demand in U.S. retail channels in the quarter was up mid-teens from pre-pandemic levels and we anticipate it will remain strong in the near term as the pandemic continues to affect demand in out-of-home channels.\nNow, outside the U.S., demand in Asia and Oceania has been solid, although the lack of shipping containers and disruptions to ocean freight networks continues to hinder our ability to fully serve our customers in these markets.\nDemand in Europe, which is served by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture, has also been solid, although consumer reaction and the effect of recently imposed government lockdowns may reverse some of the recovery in restaurant traffic and fry demand in the near term.\nSo overall, we're encouraged by the resiliency of demand and the long-term trends for the category but expect that there will be some near-term softness with another COVID wave in the U.S. and our key international markets.\nWith respect to pricing, we're making good progress in implementing recent pricing actions to manage input cost inflation.\nIn the second quarter, we began to see the initial benefits of the price increases that took effect in the summer in our foodservice and retail segments as well as in some of our international businesses.\nWe expect the benefit of these prices will continue to build as the year progresses.\nIn December, we began implementing another round of pricing actions in our foodservice and retail segments.\nWhile these actions did not affect our second quarter results, we'll see a gradual benefit from them over the next six months.\nIn our global segment, we saw some benefit of pricing actions in the second quarter but expect to see a greater impact during the back half of the year.\nThis reflects price increases related to contract renewals as well as the benefit of price escalators for most of the global contracts that are not up for renewal this year.\nWe expect these price increases across our business segments will in aggregate mitigate much but not all of our cost inflation pressures.\nWe will continue to assess the pace and scope of further cost inflation and we may take further price actions as the year progresses.\nWith respect to costs, input cost inflation remains the primary driver to the increase in our cost per pound in the quarter.\nCommodity and transportation costs were each up double digits and we expect that trend will continue through fiscal 2022, especially as our raw potato costs significantly increased in the second half of the year.\nOutside of cost inflation, we're making good progress to stabilize our supply chain in order to improve cost, production run rates and throughput.\nWe've taken actions to simplify our manufacturing processes and drive savings through a series of productivity initiatives, eliminating underperforming SKUs and increasing potato utilization rates.\nImportantly, after making changes to how we staff production crews, compensation and other incentives, we steadily reduced our staffing shortfall.\nWe're working to continue this positive trend but realize it's difficult in a very challenging labor environment.\nThe pending implementation of government-mandated COVID testing and vaccine regulations may also slow our progress and that of our suppliers in attracting and retaining workers in the near term.\nNow, turning to the crop.\nThe yields and quality of the potato crops in our primary growing regions in the Columbia Basin, Idaho and Alberta are well below average due to the extreme heat over the summer.\nSimilar to prior years, we had contracted with farmers to purchase potatoes to meet our production needs, assuming an average crop year.\nBut because of the extreme heat, the contracted acres yielded fewer potatoes and the quality is also poor.\nAs a result, we're purchasing our remaining potato needs in the open market to meet our production forecast.\nWe were able to reduce the number of potatoes we'd otherwise have been required to purchase in the open market by successfully partnering with our customers to secure changes product specifications.\nGiven that raw potato supply is tight and that fry demand has largely recovered, we've been purchasing open potatoes at a premium to contracted potato prices.\nWhen possible, we've been securing them from our nearby growing regions, but we have also transported potatoes from the Midwest and Eastern North America which results in increased transportation costs.\nWe included an estimate of these additional costs in our updated earnings outlook.\nWe'll begin to see more of the financial impact of this year's poor crop, including the high cost of open market potatoes in our third quarter results.\nSo in summary, we feel good about our financial and operating progress in the quarter.\nThe overall demand environment is solid but may soften in the near term due to another COVID wave and we're pulling the right pricing and operating levers to manage through this challenging environment.\nAs Tom discussed, we're pleased with our progress in the quarter.\nWe generated strong sales and solid demand across our restaurant and foodservice channels in North America, drove volume growth and we implemented pricing actions.\nWe believe our pricing and cost-mitigation actions have us positioned to navigate through this difficult operating environment and to support sustainable profitable growth over the long term.\nSpecifically, in the quarter, sales increased 12% to a little over $1 billion.\nThis is only the fourth time in Lamb Weston's history that we topped $1 billion of sales in a quarter.\nSales volumes were up 6%.\nVolume growth was driven by our foodservice segment, which reflects the continued year-over-year recovery in on-premise dining and by strong shipments to our large chain restaurant customers in North America that is served by our global segment.\nSales volumes of branded products in our retail segment were also up in the quarter, but the segment's overall volume declined due primarily to lower shipments of private label products.\nWhile our overall volume growth in the quarter was strong, it was tempered by industrywide upstream and downstream supply chain constraints, including delays in the availability of spare parts, edible oils and other key materials to our factories as well labor shortages, which impacted production run rates and throughput at our processing plant.\nIn our global segment, volume growth was also tempered by the limited availability of shipping containers and disruptions at ports and in ocean freight networks.\nWe expect these production and logistics challenges as well as the near-term impact of COVID variants to limit our volume growth through at least the end of fiscal 2022.\nPrice mix was up 6% as we realized benefits from our previously announced pricing actions in each of our four segments.\nAs a reminder, we began implementing product pricing actions in the first quarter as the primary lever to offset inflationary cost pressures and it generally takes a couple of quarters before these actions are fully realized in the marketplace.\nWe've also taken actions to more frequently change the freight rates that we charge to customers, so they better reflect market rates.\nHistorically, we only adjusted these rates once or twice a year.\nMost of the increase in price mix in the quarter reflects these product and freight pricing actions with favorable mix providing only a modest benefit.\nGross profit in the quarter declined $18 million as the benefit of increased sales was more than offset by higher manufacturing and transportation costs on a per pound basis.\nDouble-digit inflation for commodities and transportation costs accounted for almost 90% of the increase in cost per pound.\nOf the two, commodities played a bigger role and were again led by edible oils, including canola oil, which nearly doubled versus the prior-year quarter, ingredients such as wheat and starches used to make batter, and other coatings and containerboard and plastic film for packaging.\nFreight costs rose, especially for ocean freight and trucking, as global logistics networks continued to struggle.\nOur costs also increased due to an unfavorable mix of higher cost trucking versus rail in order to meet service obligations for certain customers.\nAs Tom mentioned, we also incurred higher cost per pound versus the prior year due to incremental costs and inefficiencies driven by lower production run rates and throughput at our factories which resulted in fewer pounds to cover fixed overhead.\nLost production days and unplanned downtimes were primarily due to labor shortages across our manufacturing network, including COVID-related absenteeism.\nWhile the cost drivers in the first two quarters of the year have been largely consistent, in the second quarter, we began to realize the initial benefits of the pricing and cost-mitigation actions that we discussed during our last earnings call.\nAs a result of these efforts, gross margin increased sequentially versus the first quarter by 500 basis points to more than 20%.\nWhile pricing actions provided the larger lift to the sequential improvement to gross margins, our production run rates and throughput improved sequentially, primarily due to our efforts to stabilize factory labor.\nWhile still lower than average, labor retention rates improved modestly versus the first quarter and the number of new applicants has been steady.\nWith more stability, we in turn drove more factory throughput.\nFinally, our actions to optimize our portfolio are also providing benefit.\nWe've eliminated underperforming SKUs to simplify our portfolio and increase throughput in our factories.\nWe've also successfully partnered with our large customers to secure changes to product specifications to mitigate a portion of the operating impact of the poor quality of this year's potato crop.\nIn short, while our run rate and cost structure are not yet where we want them to be, we look forward to building on the notable sequential progress that we made in quarter and believe that we've positioned ourselves to manage through this challenging near-term increased cost and poor potato crop environment.\nMoving on from cost of sales.\nOur SG&A increased $7 million in the quarter, largely due to a couple of factors.\nFirst, it reflects higher labor and benefit costs and higher sales commissions associated with increased sales volumes.\nSecond, it includes a $2.5 million increase in advertising and promotional expenses as we stepped up support for our retail products.\nWhile these expenses are up compared with the prior year, they are still below pre-pandemic levels.\nThe increase in SG&A was partially offset by a reduction in consulting expenses associated with improving our commercial and supply chain operations as those consulting projects ended as well fewer expenses in the current quarter related to the design of a new enterprise resource planning system.\nWe had approximately $2 million of ERP-related expenses in the quarter, which consisted primarily of consulting expenses.\nThat's down from about $5 million of similar-type expenses in the prior-year quarter.\nWe're resuming our efforts in the second half of fiscal 2022 to design the next phase of our new ERP system.\nDiluted earnings per share in the quarter was $0.22, down $0.44.\nAbout $0.28 of the decline was related to costs associated with the redemption and write-off of previously unamortized debt issuance costs related to the senior notes that were originally issued in connection with our spin-off from ConAgra in November 2016.\nWe identified these costs as items impacting comparability in our non-GAAP results.\nExcluding the impact of these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.50, which is down $0.16 due to lower income from operations and equity method earnings.\nMoving to our segments.\nSales for our global segment were up 9% in the quarter.\nprice mix was up 5%, reflecting a balance of higher prices charged for freight, pricing actions associated with customer contract renewals and inflation-driven price escalators.\nVolume was up 4%.\nHigher shipments to large chain restaurant customers in North America drove the volume increase, while logistics constraints temper our international shipments.\nOverall, the global segment's total shipments continued to trend above pre-pandemic levels.\nGlobal's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less A&P expenses, declined 13% to $81 million.\nHigher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound more than offset the benefit of favorable price mix and higher sales volumes.\nMoving to our foodservice segment.\nSales increased 30% with volume up 22% and price mix up 8%.\nThe ongoing recovery in demand from small and regional restaurant chains and independently owned restaurants as well as from noncommercial customers drove the increase in sales volumes.\nThe initial benefits of product and freight pricing actions that we began implementing earlier this fiscal year as well favorable mix drove the increase in price mix.\nFoodservice's product contribution margin rose 19% to $104 million as favorable price mix and higher sales volumes more than offset higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound.\nMoving to our retail segment.\nprice mix increased 5%, reflecting the initial benefits of pricing actions in our branded portfolio, higher prices charged for freight and improved mix.\nSales volume declined 4% as an increase in branded product volume was more than offset by lower shipments of private label products, resulting from incremental losses of certain low-margin business.\nRetail shipments in the quarter were also tempered by the industrywide supply chain constraints and production disruptions that I discussed earlier.\nRetail's product contribution margin declined 29% to $21 million.\nHigher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound, a $2 million increase in A&P expenses and lower sales volumes drove the decline.\nMoving to our liquidity position and cash flow.\nOur liquidity position remained strong.\nWe ended the first half of fiscal 2022 with almost $625 million of cash and $1 billion of availability on our undrawn revolver.\nIn the first half, we generated more than $205 million of cash from operations.\nThat's down about $110 million versus the first half of the prior year due primarily to lower earnings.\nDuring the first half of the year, we spent nearly $150 million in capital expenditures as we continued construction of our chopped and formed expansion in American Falls, Idaho and our new processing lines in American Falls in China.\nWe continue to put significant effort into managing certain material equipment and labor availability issues to keep our capital projects on track.\nIn the first half of the year, we returned $145 million to shareholders, including nearly $70 million in dividends and $76 million of share repurchases.\nThis includes $50 million of share repurchases in the second quarter alone.\nLast month, we announced a 4% increase in our quarterly dividend rate, which equates to approximately $144 million annually and a $250 million increase to our current share repurchase plan, reflecting our confidence in the long-term potential of our business.\nAs a result, we have about $344 million authorized for share repurchases under the updated plan.\nAs I referenced earlier, during the quarter, we redeemed and issued nearly $1.7 billion of senior notes.\nIn doing so, our average debt maturity increased from four years to more than seven years and we reduced our annual interest expense by approximately $8.5 million.\nWe remain committed to our capital allocation priorities.\nFirst, to reinvest in our business both organically and with M&A.\nAnd then to return free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases over time.\nNow, turning to our updated outlook.\nWe continue to expect our full year sales growth in fiscal 2022 to be above our long-term target of low to mid-single digits.\nIn the third quarter, we anticipate price mix will be up sequentially versus the 6% increase that we delivered in the second quarter as the benefit of previously announced product pricing actions in each of our core segments continues to build.\nWe expect volume growth in the third quarter will decelerate sequentially versus the 6% we delivered in second quarter as a result of the near-term impact of COVID variants on restaurant traffic and demand, the macro industry supply chain constraints and labor challenges that will continue to affect production run rates and throughput in our factories and global logistics disruptions and container shortages that affect both domestic and export shipments.\nWe expect further deceleration in the fourth quarter as we begin to lap some of the higher-volume comparisons from the prior year.\nWith respect to earnings, we continue to expect net income and adjusted EBITDA including joint ventures will be pressured through fiscal 2022 reflecting significantly higher potato costs in the second half of the year, resulting from the poor crop, double-digit inflation for key production inputs and freight and higher SG&A expenses.\nFor the full year, we expect our gross margin will be 600 to 700 basis points below our pre-pandemic margin rate of 25% to 26%, implying a target range of 18% to 20%.\nThat's a change from the 17% to 21% range that we provided in our previous outlook.\nWe narrowed the range for a number of reasons.\nFirst, we're confident about the pace and execution of the product and freight price increases that we are implementing in the market.\nSecond, we expect to build upon the incremental progress that we made in the second quarter to stabilize our supply chain operations and drive savings behind our cost-mitigation initiatives.\nHowever, we expect that the improvement in our run rate, throughput and costs will continue to be gradual, reflecting the broader macro challenges facing the labor market that will likely persist through fiscal 2022.\nAnd third, we have greater clarity on the net cost impact from this year's exceptionally poor potato crop.\nAs a reminder, we'll begin to realize the full financial impact of this year's poor potato crop in the third quarter and will continue to realize its effect through most of the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\nBelow gross margin, we expect our SG&A expenses to step up $100 million to $110 million in the third and fourth quarters as we begin to design the second phase of our new ERP project.\nEquity earnings will likely remain pressured due to input cost inflation and higher manufacturing costs, both in Europe and the U.S.\nWe expect our interest expense to be approximately $110 million, excluding the $53 million of costs associated with the redemption of the senior notes in the second quarter.\nWe previously estimated interest expense to be approximately $115 million.\nOur estimates for total depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $190 million and effective tax rate of approximately 22% and capital expenditures of approximately $450 million remains unchanged.\nSo in sum, we're seeing the benefit of our pricing actions which drove the sequential improvement in our top line and gross margin in the quarter.\nAlong with our pricing actions, we're on track with our other cost-mitigation initiatives, positioning us to manage through the impact of the very poor crop.\nAnd finally, for fiscal 2022, we continue to expect net sales growth will be above our long-term target of low to mid-single digits and we have enough clarity in our sales and cost outlook to narrow our previous target gross margin rate.\nNow, here's Tom for some closing comments.\nLet me just quickly reiterate our thoughts on the quarter by saying we are pleased with our progress in the quarter and we're taking the right steps on pricing actions and in our supply chain operations to navigate through this difficult operating environment.\nWe are on track to deliver on our targets for the year and we believe we're on a path to get back to pre-pandemic profit levels after we get past the impact of the poor crop in the first half of fiscal 2023 and remain committed to investing support growth and create value for our stakeholders over the long term.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We had a very strong start to the year with first quarter consolidated net income of $64.4 million and earnings per share of $0.59.\nThese results were 93% and 90%, respectively, above the same quarter last year and were driven by stronger earnings at both the utility and the bank.\nIn the first quarter, Hawaiian Electric benefited from continued savings from the robust cost management program we started last year.\nThe savings will be delivered to customers in rates beginning in June, and, along with other timing elements, we expect the utility to remain within the full year guidance range we announced in February.\nAmerican's first quarter results reflect good execution in an environment that remains challenging for bank profitability.\nOur results benefited from a release of provision as we continue to conservatively manage credit in the improving Hawaii economy.\nAs Greg will cover in more detail, we're increasing our bank guidance and consolidated HEI guidance for the year to reflect this improvement.\nWe're seeing strengthening in the local economy as Hawaii continues to manage the virus well and the vaccine rollout continues.\nUnemployment declined to 9% in March.\nWhile still above the national average, it's headed in the right direction, having declined from a peak of nearly 24% a year ago.\nWe've seen significant growth in tourism arrivals this year.\nAnd lately, we've experienced multiple days where arrivals have approached prepandemic averages.\nAt this point, almost all our arrivals are from the U.S. mainland as the COVID situation and vaccinations abroad have been more challenging than domestically.\nHawaii real estate fundamentals are strong and continue to support the conservative portfolio mix at the bank.\nYear-to-date March, Oahu's sales volumes are up 19% for single-family homes and 53% for condos.\nMedian prices are also up 17% to $950,000 for single-family homes and 4% to $450,000 for condos.\nIn its March outlook, the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization accelerated its forecast for the state's economic recovery by 18 months with the GDP now expected to rise 3.7% in 2021 and 3.1% in 2020.\nCOVID-19 cases in Hawaii have remained far below the mainland.\nThe seven-day rolling average was 94 for the state and is the fifth lowest per capita among U.S. states as of May six.\n40% of our residents are now fully vaccinated and more than half have had at least one dose.\nWhile this is encouraging, we're mindful that we're still in the early stages of Hawaii's economic recovery, and there is still some uncertainty about the pandemic's course.\nAt the utility, cost efficiency, our transition to the new PBR framework and our clean energy future have been and continue to be our major focus.\nWe and our stakeholders are all learning the new PBR framework, which is designed to align our interests as we work together to increase renewable energy and decarbonize our economy in a way that is affordable, reliable, resilient and equitable.\nOur commitment to cost efficiency positions us well as we transition into PBR.\nThe utility has been successful in implementing efficiencies and achieving savings to deliver on our management audit savings commitment and the customer dividend.\nWe'll start returning these savings to customers through the Annual Revenue Adjustment, or ARA, when PBR goes into effect June one.\nCost management will continue to be a focus as we operate under PBR.\nWe've been working with stakeholders to finalize the new PBR performance incentive mechanisms, or PIMs, as well as the scorecards and metrics we'll report on going forward.\nWe are expecting the PUC to issue an order setting forth the parameters of the new PIMs in the near future.\nAs we've said before, reaching our collective clean energy and decarbonization goals must be done in a way that is kakou, a Hawaiian word that means it takes everyone working together.\nWe're working to bring projects from Hawaii's largest ever renewable energy and storage procurement online as soon as possible.\nWe are fully committed to this effort, which is no easy task given the number of projects, the scale of this procurement relative to our small system, community considerations, land constraints and the need to ensure reliability on isolated island grids.\nWe're actively working with independent power producers, government agencies and other stakeholders to overcome obstacles to bring projects online faster.\nLast week, the PUC directed us to establish regulatory liabilities to track costs to customers resulting from delays in commercial operations of approved Stage one, Stage two and CBRE Phase one projects.\nWhile we do not believe we are liable for any amount, we believe the PUC's intention may be to track rather than record costs before determination is made.\nSo we will be seeking reconsideration or clarification.\nLast week, the PUC also approved, with conditions, our agreement for the Kapolei Energy Storage project, a stand-alone battery project that will help ensure reliability when the Oahu coal plant retires and enable integration of more renewable energy.\nWhile technically an approval, the order imposes conditions that may prevent us and the developer from moving forward with this project.\nThe regulatory process allows us to raise our concerns to the PUC, and we will be filing a motion for reconsideration on Monday.\nAnother key focus is accelerating the addition of more distributed energy resources, or DERs, and demand response.\nOn May 3, we filed our recommendations to achieve this acceleration while underscoring the importance of equity and fairness in how the programs are designed.\nWe're advancing programs to benefit all customers, including expanding our community solar program, proposing a rooftop rental program and procuring aggregated grid services from DERs.\nGrid modernization is key to facilitating faster deployment and effective use of demand response and DERs.\nIn March, the PUC approved our proposal to shift from an opt-in to an opt-out approach for advanced meters in targeted areas, allowing us to deploy advanced meters more quickly and thus enabling operational efficiencies and more advanced rate programs.\nTurning to the bank.\nAmerican continues to perform well in a challenging environment.\nIn the first quarter, we continued to have strong mortgage production and deployed an additional $150 million of ASB CARES or Paycheck Protection Program loans to support small businesses in round two of that program.\nYear-to-date, that amount has increased to over $170 million.\nRecord deposit growth, in large part driven by federal stimulus, continues to outpace lending opportunities in this early stage of Hawaii's economic recovery.\nWe're taking a balanced approach to managing our portfolio, optimizing fee income and loan portfolio growth in a low interest rate environment.\nWhile net interest margin is still pressured, record-low funding costs and balance sheet growth are helping grow net interest income consistent with our expectations.\nOur first quarter release of reserves for credit losses reflects the resilience of our customers as well as the moderating credit risk environment as Hawaii's economy begins to recover.\nWe continue to manage our reserves for credit losses conservatively.\nAmerican has also continued its cost control efforts, leading to lower noninterest expense in the first quarter even as we invest in our anytime, anywhere banking transition.\nImproved profitability is also allowing the bank's dividend to HEI to increase.\nWe're accelerating our digital transformation to enable customers to bank with us anytime and anywhere.\nToday, 44% of deposits are made through self-service channels such as ATMs and mobile, more than double prepandemic levels.\nAnd we've seen increased customer satisfaction across all channels over that time.\nWe're enhancing our digital offerings to make banking even easier for our customers.\nThis includes providing new online financial wellness tools, upgrading our ATM fleet, strengthening our mobile app, expanding online capabilities and opening new digital centers where our teammates will help customers with digital banking solutions.\nNow Greg will discuss our financial results and our outlook.\nOver to you, Greg.\nTurning to our first quarter results.\nConsolidated earnings per share were $0.59 versus $0.31 in the same quarter last year.\nBoth the utility and the bank reported strong performance, reflecting the resilience of our company's and the Hawaii economy that has showed signs of a strengthening recovery.\nAt the utility, earnings reflect lower O&M expenses from cost reduction efforts and delays on timing of generation overhauls, coupled with higher revenues from our annual rate adjustment mechanism, including timing-related charges for target revenue recognition to eliminate seasonality impacts.\nThe bank benefited from the release of provision for credit losses as certain credits earned upgrades, and we saw stable credit trends in an improving economic outlook.\nWhile the holding company loss is well in line with plan, we increased charitable giving during the quarter, including a $2 million contribution to support our community through challenging times.\nCompared to the same time last year, consolidated trailing 12-month ROE improved 80 basis points to 10%.\nUtility ROE increased 160 basis points to 9%; and bank ROE, which we look at on an annualized basis, was 16%.\nThe utility outlook remains unchanged, however, and the ROE expectations will be impacted by the management audit savings and customer dividend as O&M cost reductions that have improved earnings for the quarter are used to fund customer bill reductions under PBR.\nRegarding the utility's results, net income for the quarter was $43.4 million compared to $23.9 million in the first quarter of 2020.\nThe most significant variance drivers were $10 million lower O&M expenses compared to the first quarter last year.\nThere were three main factors that drove O&M lower: lower staffing and efficiency improvements from the ongoing cost management program; timing-related items, including higher bad debt expense in the first quarter of 2020 related to COVID-19, which has since been deferred; and fewer generating facility overhauls, some of which will be performed later in the year.\nThere were also higher costs in 2020 related to an increased environmental reserve and higher outside service costs to support the PBR docket and other customer service projects.\nIn addition to lower O&M, we benefited from a $5 million revenue increase from higher rate adjustment mechanism revenues; a $4 million revenue increase related to timing of the recognition of target revenues during the year, which we -- will have no net impact on 2021 and which is due to a change in methodology that eliminates seasonality for recognizing target revenues within the year; a $1 million lower enterprise resource planning system implementation benefits to be passed on to customers; and $1 million lower nonservice pension costs due to a reset of pension costs included in rates as part of a final rate case decision.\nThese items were partially offset by $1 million higher depreciation.\nRegarding the drivers of utility performance for the rest of the year, we expect no meaningful contribution from the performance incentive mechanisms during 2021.\nWe currently have approximately $22 million of COVID-related cost, primarily bad debt expense accrued in a deferred regulatory asset account.\nWe will continue deferring COVID-related costs through June 30.\nThe moratorium on customer disconnections is in place through May 31 2021, and we will -- and we continue to work with customers on extended payment plans and assisting with other bill assistance alternatives.\nWe plan to file a separate application to seek recovery of costs once actual costs are known.\nWe will also be filing a request for approval to continue deferring COVID-related costs beyond June 30.\nAs mentioned, our O&M expense was positively impacted by the timing of overhauls.\nWe do expect some of these overhauls to occur later in the year, in line with our annual guidance.\nThe utility's ability to achieve accelerated management audit savings commitment is an important driver of O&M expenses.\nThe utility is on track to achieve the savings necessary to meet the annual $6.6 million commitment, which will be returned to customers starting June one.\nUtility capital investments for the quarter of approximately $60 million were lower than planned due to unexpected delays.\nSome of the delays were due to extended repairs being made at one of our substations, limiting work that can be done on other parts of the electric system.\nWe also experienced additional design work required for T&D projects, COVID travel limitations and meter deployment delays that impacted our grid modernization work.\nDespite the delays, we still expect to achieve our utility capital investment plan for 2021.\nAnd we are maintaining the capex and rate base growth guidance we issued during our previous earnings call and still expect 2021 capex of approximately $335 million to $355 million, reflecting rate base growth of 4% to 5%.\nTurning to the bank.\nASB's net income for the quarter was $29.6 million compared to $15.7 million last quarter and $15.8 million in the first quarter of 2020.\nThe increase primarily reflected moderation of the elevated credit risk environment as Hawaii's economy begins to recover, and the results benefited from a release of reserves for credit losses, which I'll discuss further.\nNet interest income reflects the impact of strong deposit growth, lower loan demand and increased growth of our investment portfolio.\nNoninterest income benefited from strong mortgage origination and sales in line with plan despite being below the prior year's quarter.\nNoninterest expense remained in line with the plan as ASB continues to focus on strategic investments to drive efficiency and productivity.\nASB's net interest margin compressed 17 basis points during the quarter.\nNIM was 2.95% compared to 3.12% in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nThe low interest rate environment and record deposit growth each contributed to NIM compression.\n$3.1 million in fees from PPP lending and a record low cost of funds helped soften the pressure on asset yields.\nThe average cost of funds was 0.08%, down one basis point from the linked quarter and 16 basis points from the prior year.\nWe expect continued pressure from low interest rates and from excess liquidity due to strong deposit growth and lower reinvestment yields.\nConsequently, we're updating our NIM guidance range to 2.80% to 3%.\nWe anticipate that balance sheet growth should still lead to net interest income in line with expectations for the year.\nIn the first quarter, the bank released $8.4 million in provision for credit losses compared to provisions of $11.3 million in the fourth quarter and $10.4 million in the first quarter last year.\nThis reflects credit upgrades in the commercial loan portfolio, reduced exposure to riskier but profitable consumer unsecured loans and lower net charge-offs as Hawaii's economy begins to recover and credit -- the credit risk environment moderates.\nASB's net charge-off ratio for the quarter was 0.18% compared to 0.36% in the fourth quarter and 0.44% in the first quarter 2020.\nNonaccrual loans were up slightly to 1% compared to 0.89% in the fourth quarter and 0.90% in the prior year.\nWe remain conservative as we take a wait-and-see approach to Hawaii's economic recovery.\nAnd at 1.73% as of quarter end, our allowance for credit losses was the highest among Hawaii peers.\nWe're seeing positive loan deferral trends across ASB's portfolio.\nNearly all deferred loans have returned to scheduled payments.\nActive deferrals are just 0.2% of the total loan portfolio.\nWe're -- we've experienced declining delinquencies in the higher-risk commercial and consumer portfolios.\nWhile realizing a slight uptick in delinquencies in the residential portfolio, that portfolio is a low-risk -- is low risk and secured by rising value in the Hawaii real estate market.\nThese two factors have contributed to a decreasing profile of our overall -- risk profile of our overall loan portfolio.\nASP continues to manage liquidity and capital conservatively, maintaining ample liquidity and healthy core capital ratios.\nThe bank has approximately $4 billion in available liquidity from a combination of reliable resources.\nASB's Tier one leverage ratio of 8.33% was comfortably above well-capitalized levels.\nProspectively, given the lower risk profile of our portfolio, we're anticipating managing closer to an 8%-or-above Tier one leverage ratio and drive competitive profitability metrics, growth of the ASB dividend while maintaining a strong capital position.\nWe expect higher bank dividends to HEI this year than reflected in our February guidance given ASB's strong performance and outlook and efficient capital structure.\nWe now expect dividends of approximately $50 million to $60 million versus the previously estimated $40 million.\nFor the quarter, the ASB Board has declared a $23 million dividend to HEI.\nWe still do not anticipate the need to issue any external equity in 2021 at HEI unless we identify significant additional accretive investment opportunities.\nWe are committed to maintaining an investment-grade profile.\nAt the utility, we're pleased to have had recent utility credit rating upgrades by S&P to BBB flat and Moody's to Baaone, both with stable outlooks.\nTurning to our guidance.\nWe're reaffirming our previously issued utility guidance.\nWhile the utility had a strong first quarter, we'll be returning cost savings to customers beginning June one and expect additional overhauls later in the year.\nIn addition, while the first quarter benefited from higher revenues due to a methodology change to remove seasonality in recognizing target revenues, a portion of that will reverse later in the year.\nHowever, we are revising our banking consolidated guidance.\nOur revised guidance is $0.67 to $0.74 per share, up from our prior guidance of $0.52 to $0.62.\nWe're revising our NIM expectations at the bank to 2.8% to 3%, down from 2.90% to 3.15%.\nThe impact on net interest income should be muted by balance sheet growth.\nGiven strengthening credit dynamics and outlook for the Hawaii economy, we now expect provision to range from $0 to $10 million, which we believe remains appropriately conservative given continued uncertainty for the economy until we see increased vaccination levels and the eventual return of international travel.\nWe expect that, that stronger bank profitability will translate into consolidated earnings growth as well as increase bank dividends to the holding company.\nAnd we're increasing HEI guidance -- earnings per share guidance to $1.90 to $2.05 per share.\nI'm proud of the dedication of our employees and the resilience of our companies as we continue to provide essential electricity and banking services and deliver solid financial results while helping Hawaii reach its aggressive climate goals and build back better.\nLast month, we issued our second consolidated ESG report, which includes our ESG priorities and our first Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures-aligned reporting.\nWe're considering the implications for our companies of the Biden administration's goal to cut carbon emissions 50% from a 2005 baseline by 2030.\nWe believe our goals and plans here in Hawaii and the work we've been doing for some time place us on a strong path to achieve a net-zero future.\nWe're updating our planning and analysis, and we'll report further on that in the future.\nAnd finally, we say aloha to Rich today as he is leaving American to pursue other interests.\nRich accomplished a great deal during his more than 10 years at the helm of American.\nRich leaves American in great shape, as evidenced by ASB's strong first quarter earnings and Greg's comments earlier.\nUnder Rich's leadership, ASB has grown its assets, expanded its customer base, products and services and improved operational efficiency.\nHe and his team have provided great customer service and made banking easy for customers.\nAnn Teranishi, currently the bank's Executive Vice President of Operations, will succeed Rich as President and CEO later today.\nAnn is a strong, collaborative leader with deep banking industry knowledge and a 14-year track record of success at American.\nWe look forward to Ann's leadership.\nSummary: ",

10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC.\nIt's a pleasure to be with you today.\nLabcorp is carrying on our mission to improve health and improve lives by harnessing the power of science, technology and innovation.\nIn doing so, we're able to execute against our strategy, to deliver strong results for stakeholders and to effectively respond to global challenges like the pandemic.\nOur company rounded out a historic 2021 with another strong quarter that sets the stage for further success in 2022 and beyond.\nIn the fourth quarter, revenue totaled $4.1 billion, adjusted earnings per share reached $6.77, and free cash flow was $548 million.\nFor the full year, revenue was $16.1 billion, adjusted earnings per share totaled $28.52, and free cash flow reached $2.6 billion.\nOur base business continued its progress during the quarter, with diagnostics and drug development revenue growing 8.8% and 8.2%, respectively.\nIn diagnostics, base business organic volume increased as esoteric and routine procedures continued their year-over-year growth.\ndrug development ended the year with a solid trailing 12-month net book-to-bill of 1.25 and a strong backlog of $15 billion, representing a $579 million increase in the third quarter.\nAlso decentralized clinical trial awards were up 62% over the prior year.\nMoving to the pandemic.\nOur ongoing response remains an example of how innovation can drive success.\nFor nearly two years, Labcorp has dedicated significant resources to stemming the spread of the virus.\nWe are proud of the progress we've made thus far, though the rise of variants like Omicron and surges in infection rates make it clear that our work is not over.\nWe continue to leverage Labcorp's comprehensive capabilities to expand testing access, to identify and monitor new variants and to advance vaccine and therapy development.\nIn the fourth quarter, COVID testing volumes were greater than anticipated.\nWe have performed over 74 million tests for COVID to date, of which approximately 8.6 million were in the fourth quarter.\nThis heightened demand continued into the new year, although volume is significantly less now than in December or in January.\nTime to results for COVID PCR test remained one to two days on average even during the latest surge.\nAs we've done throughout the pandemic, we are keeping capacity levels high to quickly respond to spikes and testing needs.\nWe are continuing to invest in equipment, elevated staffing levels and our supply chain.\nIn addition, we remain prepared and staffed to support additional drug development work for vaccines including boosters or additional therapies.\nThe company's COVID-related innovations in the quarter included the rollout of observed self-collection for COVID PCR testing at over 1,000 patient service centers.\nAnd at the start of the fourth quarter, we announced the receipt of FDA Emergency Use Authorization for a combined COVID and flu at-home collection kit.\nThese offerings are reflective of our work to make COVID testing faster, easier and more accessible.\nI'll now turn to our enterprise strategy, where we made significant progress in 2021.\nI'll provide a few highlights that will give you a sense of our growth and our forward momentum.\nIn oncology, we made significant strides in fortifying our position as a leader by expanding diagnostic offerings and clinical trial opportunities.\nAt the same time, we followed through on our commitment to improve cancer care access.\nLast year, we formed our oncology business unit, and we introduced our enterprise oncology offering.\nGenomic profiling of tumors is key to identifying the best targeted therapy for oncology patients.\nIn December, we announced our agreement to acquire Personal Genome diagnostics or PGDx.\nThe company has a strong portfolio of innovative liquid biopsy and tissue-based products which complement our existing capabilities.\nThrough PGDx' kitted solutions, we can provide oncologists access to tumor profiling at the hospitals where the patients are treated or centralized to one of our laboratories.\nThese solutions may also enable us to expand tumor profiling globally to help our pharmaceutical sponsors find the right novel treatment for patients.\nWe expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of this year.\nOther exciting expansions of our oncology test menu included clonoSEQ, the first and only FDA-cleared test for monitoring residual blood cancer; and OmniSeq INSIGHT, a pan-cancer tissue-based sequencing test for people with late-stage solid tumors.\nAll of these offerings can help physicians make more informed decisions about treatments for their patients and help bring new medicines to market for cancer.\nIn 2021, we intensified our customer focus and embedded technology and data throughout our business.\nThis included improvements to the patient experience in our service centers.\nThese upgrades focused on creating a seamless journey from appointment scheduling to service center visits to easier access to results.\nOur acquisition of Ovia Health enhanced our position as an important source of information for women's health which we support through diagnostic, genetic and specialty testing expertise as well as clinical trials.\nWe will continue to identify opportunities to enhance Ovia Health's innovative platform that provides family planning, pregnancy and parenting support.\nAdditionally, we began to deploy Labcorp Diagnostic Assistant.\nThis new tool delivers a detailed view of a patient's lab history along with clinical insights directly to the point of care to inform diagnostic decisions.\nWe opened an automated kit production line in Belgium in the spring.\nAnd in the fourth quarter, we opened an integrated laboratory in Singapore, which strengthens our bioanalytical services in the Asia Pacific region.\nAnd just this month, we announced the launch of Labcorp OnDemand which builds on the success of Pixel by Labcorp.\nThis suite of health tests and services offers easy and convenient access to a wide variety of trusted tests.\nIt's another way that Labcorp is meeting people where they are and offering more options for people to stay healthy.\nWe pursued numerous opportunities throughout the year that have long-term and high-growth potential.\nWe did this through tuck-in deals and strategic acquisitions including: OmniSeq, Ovia Health, PGDx, and Myriad Autoimmune's Vectra test which analyzes biomarkers to measure rheumatoid arthritis.\nYesterday, we announced a comprehensive strategic agreement with Ascension, one of the largest health systems in the United States.\nThrough our new long-term relationship with Ascension, we will manage its hospital-based laboratories in 10 states, and we will purchase select assets of its outreach laboratory business for approximately $400 million.\nWe expect the first year annualized revenues to be between $550 million and $600 million from the combined hospital business and lab asset acquisition.\nWhile operating margins are expected to be less than segment margins initially, they are expected to improve each year.\nThe transaction is expected to be accretive to our earnings and cash flow in year 1 and should return its cost of capital by year 2.\nThis is a notable opportunity for us and one of the most significant deals of its kind in the sector.\nIt expands our clinical services in several states across the country, and it builds on our strong track record of building similar relationships.\nThe deal with Ascension also underscores our ability to help health systems manage industrywide shifts.\nAs part of the collaboration, we will explore clinical trial and oncology opportunities that enhance patient access.\nWe look forward to this new partnership and ultimately to welcoming new colleagues to Labcorp.\nWe also reached agreements with other hospitals and hospital systems including Minnesota-based North Memorial Health.\nWe continue to be excited about our robust M&A pipeline and expect more activity in the coming months.\nIn 2021, we provided the highest-quality service to customers and patients, and we made meaningful investments in our people.\nIn fact, Labcorp has consistently been recognized for the impact of our work and for the value we place on our employees.\nWe were recently named again to Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies.\nAnd for the fifth consecutive year, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation designated Labcorp as the best place to work for LGBTQ+ equality.\nWe were also deemed one of America's most responsible companies for 2022 by Newsweek.\nImportantly, in 2021, management and the board of directors, working with outside advisors, thoroughly reviewed our structure and capital allocation.\nAs part of the comprehensive review of our structure, we had extensive discussions with third parties, and the board considered a wide range of options including significant acquisitions, divestitures, spinning off businesses as well as spinning and merging those businesses with strategic partners.\nThe board unanimously concluded that the company's existing structure is in the best interest of all stakeholders at this time.\nThat said, we continue to believe that Labcorp shares are not fully valued in the marketplace.\nTo that end, we announced several actions designed to further enhance shareholder value.\nAmong them are the initiation of a dividend starting in the second quarter of 2022 as well as a $2.5 billion share repurchase program, $1 billion of which is being repurchased on an accelerated basis.\nWe are also implementing a new LaunchPad business process improvement initiative that targets $350 million in savings over the next three years.\nAnd today, in addition to giving 2022 guidance, we will also share a longer-term outlook.\nAnd beginning with first quarter results, we will provide additional business insights through enhanced disclosures.\nMoving forward, we are committed to profitable growth through investments in science, innovation and new technology.\nAs we execute on our strategy, management and board will continue to evaluate all avenues for enhancing shareholder value.\nIn conclusion, our strong base business performance, coupled with formidable progress against our strategic priorities in 2021, sets us up for long-term success.\nThis gives us great confidence in our longer-term, growth-oriented, bright outlook which Glenn will take you through, along with our 2022 guidance.\nI am proud of what the team at Labcorp accomplished together in 2021, and I am excited for all that's to come this year and into the future as we continue to deliver for all of our stakeholders.\nI'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment, our 2022 full year guidance and then conclude with our longer-term outlook through 2024.\nRevenue for the quarter was $4.1 billion, a decrease of 9.7% compared to last year due to declines in organic revenue of 10.3% and divestitures of 0.1%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.6% and favorable foreign currency translation of 10 basis points.\nThe 10.3% decline in organic revenue was driven by a 15.3% decrease in COVID testing, partially offset by a 5% increase in the company's organic base business.\nOperating income for the quarter was $731 million or 18% of revenue.\nDuring the quarter, we had $93 million of amortization and $79 million of restructuring charges and special items.\nExcluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $902 million or 22.2% of revenue compared to $1.4 billion or 31.8% last year.\nThe decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing.\nExcluding COVID testing, the base business compared to the base business last year experienced higher adjusted operating income and margins due to organic growth and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs.\nThe tax rate for the quarter was 19.3%.\nThe adjusted tax rate excluding restructuring charges, special items and amortization, was 24.6% compared to 24.8% last year.\nGoing forward, we continue to expect the adjusted tax rate to be approximately 25% excluding any impact from potential tax reform.\nNet earnings for the quarter were $553 million or $5.75 per diluted share.\nAdjusted earnings per share which exclude amortization, restructuring charges and special items, were $6.77 in the quarter, down from $10.56 last year.\nOperating cash flow was $698 million in the quarter compared to $775 million a year ago.\nThe decrease in operating cash flow was due to lower cash earnings, partially offset by favorable working capital.\nCapital expenditures totaled $150 million compared to $99 million last year.\nAnd as a result, free cash flow was $548 million in the quarter compared to $675 million last year.\nDuring the quarter, we used $1 billion of our cash flow for our accelerated share repurchase program and invested $171 million on acquisitions.\nNow, I'll review our segment performance, beginning with diagnostics.\nRevenue for the quarter was $2.6 billion, a decrease of 16.9% compared to last year due to organic revenue being down 17.8%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.7% and favorable foreign currency translation of 20 basis points.\nThe decrease in organic revenue was due to a 21.8% reduction from COVID testing partially offset by a 4.1% increase in the base business.\nRelative to the fourth quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for the base business revenue was 5% primarily due to organic growth.\nTotal volume decreased 8.7% compared to last year as organic volume decreased by 8.9% partially offset by acquisition volume of 0.3%.\nThe decrease in organic volume was due to a 14.6% decline in COVID testing partially offset by a 5.7% increase in the base business.\nPrice mix decreased 8.2% versus last year due to lower COVID testing of 7.2% and lower base business of 1.6% partially offset by acquisitions of 0.5% and currency of 0.2%.\nDiagnostics organic base business revenue growth was 7.2% compared to its base business last year, with 8.1% coming from volume, partially offset by a 1% decline from price mix.\nThe price mix decline was primarily due to the recovery of our Canadian business which carries a lower average requisition price.\ndiagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $776 million or 29.6% of revenue compared to $1.2 billion or 39.1% last year.\nThe decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing.\nCOVID testing margins were down compared to last year primarily due to a volume decline of approximately 50%, while the company continued to maintain capacity.\nbase business margins were higher compared to last year due to organic base business growth and LaunchPad savings partially offset by higher personnel costs.\ndiagnostics achieved its goal to deliver approximately $200 million of net savings from its three-year LaunchPad initiative.\nNow, I'll review the performance of drug development.\nRevenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, an increase of 3.9% compared to last year due to organic base business growth of 7.9% and acquisitions of 0.3%, partially offset by lower COVID testing performed through its centralized business of 4% and divestitures of 0.3%.\nRelative to the fourth quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for base business revenue was 9.9% primarily driven by organic growth.\nAdjusted operating income for the segment was $206 million or 14.2% of revenue compared to $248 million or 17.8% last year.\nThe decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to lower COVID testing.\nIn the base business, higher personnel and other inflationary costs as well as investments in oncology capabilities were partially offset by organic growth and LaunchPad savings.\nWe continue to exclude the enterprise component of drug development bonus expense which is reflected in corporate unallocated and totaled $11 million for the quarter.\nWhile margins were down in the quarter, they were up for the full year compared to 2020, and we expect margins to continue to increase in 2022.\nFor the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remained strong at $7.3 billion and 1.25, respectively.\nBacklog at the end of the quarter was $15 billion, an increase of 8.7% compared to last year.\nAnd we expect approximately $5 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months.\nNow, I'll discuss our 2022 guidance which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of December 31, 2021, for the full year.\nIn addition, the guidance includes the softness we experienced in January due to Omicron which we expect will rebound through the rest of the quarter.\nThe enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted to acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends which we will initiate in the second quarter.\nWe expect enterprise revenue to decline one and a half to six and a half percent compared to 2021.\nThis guidance range includes the expectation that the base business will grow seven and a half to 10%, while COVID testing is expected to decline 60% to 75%.\nWe expect diagnostics revenue to decline 11 and a half to 17 and a half percent compared to 2021.\nThis guidance range includes the expectation that the base business will growth three and a half to 6%.\nCOVID testing revenue is expected to decline 60% to 75%.\nAt the midpoint of our base business guidance range, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 would be 4.4% primarily driven by organic growth in both volume and price mix.\nWe expect drug development revenue to grow 7% to 9.5% compared to 2021.\nThis guidance includes the negative impact from foreign currency translation of 40 basis points.\nThis guidance range also includes the expectation that the base business will grow seven and a half to 10% compared to 2021.\nGiven the amount of capacity we have within diagnostics, we've assumed that no COVID testing will be performed in drug development central lab business in 2022.\nWe expect to benefit from broad-based growth in all three businesses, helping drive continued margin improvement in the segment.\nAt the midpoint of our base business guidance range, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 would be 11.3%.\nOur adjusted earnings per share guidance is $17.25 to $21.25 compared to 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $28.52.\nThe adjusted earnings per share guidance reflects the expectation of lower COVID testing in 2022, while the base business continues to profitably grow.\nFree cash flow is expected to be between $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion compared to $2.6 billion in 2021.\nNow, I'll discuss our longer-term outlook which reflects our current view of the business from 2022 to 2024.\nWe expect enterprise base business organic revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4% to 7% compared to 2021.\nWe also expect revenue growth from acquisitions to represent additional annual growth of 2% to 3%.\nWe expect diagnostics base business organic revenue to grow at a two and a half to four and a half percent CAGR compared to 2021.\nThis outlook is higher than historical growth driven by a continued recovery in our base business relative to 2021, broad-based growth including hospitals and health systems and the lower incremental impact of PAMA in the outlook period.\nWe expect drug development base business organic revenue to grow at a 7% to 10% CAGR compared to 2021.\nThis outlook is higher than our historical growth, and we have added capacity and inorganic investments in the last few years in our faster-growing early development and late-stage clinical businesses.\nAs we continue to emphasize profitable growth, we expect enterprise margin expansion of 30 to 50 basis points on average annually through the outlook period compared to 2021 which was approximately 14 and a half percent.\nThis margin expansion is due in part to the company's LaunchPad initiative which is expected to deliver $350 million of cost savings over the time period to help offset inflationary costs.\nAnd finally, we expect adjusted earnings per share to grow at an 11% to 14% CAGR compared to 2020 -- '19 adjusted earnings per share of $11.32.\nWe continue to use 2019 as the base year comparison for earnings growth to better reflect the earnings power of the company excluding COVID testing.\nThe adjusted earnings per share outlook reflects the expectation that both base businesses will continue to profitably grow organically.\nIn addition, we expect to benefit from capital allocation directed toward accretive acquisitions and share repurchases while keeping within our targeted gross debt leverage of two and a half to three times.\nFor additional comparison purposes, we've also included in the supplemental deck on our investor relations website a view of 2021 fourth quarter and full year results, 2022 guidance and our longer-term outlook.\nIn summary, the company had another quarter of strong performance.\nWe remain focused on performing a critical role in response to the global pandemic while also growing our base business.\nFor 2022, we expect to drive continued profitable growth in our base business, while COVID testing volumes are expected to decline through the year.\nIn addition, our longer-term outlook is expected to deliver double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth driven by top-line growth, margin improvement and capital allocation.\nOperator, we'll now take questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:You'll hear prepared comments from each of them today.\nJim will cover high-level financials and provide a strategic update, John will cover an operating overview and Devina will cover the details of the financials.\nJohn will discuss our results in areas of yield and volume, which unless stated otherwise, are more specifically references to internal revenue growth or IRG from yield or volume.\nDuring the call, Jim, John and Devina will discuss operating EBITDA, which is income from operations before depreciation and amortization.\nAny comparisons, unless otherwise stated, will be with the third quarter of 2020.\nNet income, EPS, operating EBITDA and margin, operating expenses and SG&A expense results have been adjusted to enhance comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect our fundamental business performance or results of operations.\nThese adjusted measures, in addition to free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures.\nwm.com for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures and additional information of our use of non-GAAP measures and non-GAAP projections.\nTime-sensitive information provided during today's call, which is occurring on October 26, 2021, may no longer be accurate at the time of a replay.\nOur third-quarter performance highlighted the exceptional cash generation capability of our business model as we generated nearly $1.2 billion of cash from operations.\nOur solid results put us on track to meet the higher full-year financial outlook we provided last quarter, even as we faced some of the highest inflation that we've seen in years, along with the labor and supply chain constraints.\nVirtually no segment of the economy, including government and the private sector, has been unaffected by these historically acute inflationary and supply chain challenges.\nThis burst of inflation accelerated through the third quarter, and during the quarter, we saw roughly $60 million of labor inflation and about $100 million of inflation in other operating cost categories.\nOverall, our underlying labor inflation for the third quarter was 8.7%.\nSo that's the tough news.\nThe good news is that the business continues to perform well as demonstrated by the fact that we still expect to finish the year within our previously adjusted operating EBIT raise, adjusted operating EBITDA and free cash flow guidance ranges.\nAnd we will be above our prior revenue range due to strong price execution and strengthening volumes.\nJohn, Devina and I will discuss what we're doing about these labor and inflationary pressures in the short term and the medium term.\nNot surprisingly, our disciplined price programs are the primary lever to combat cost inflation.\nOur pricing programs delivered core price of 4.6% and collection and disposal yield of 3.5% in the third quarter.\nStandout performance continues to be the residential line of business with a yield of 5%, while MSW yield improved to 3.5%.\nBut keep in mind, the price escalations on about 40% of our revenue are tied to an index, often based on a look-back over the prior year, so there's a timing lag in adjusting index pricing when costs step up as quickly as they have.\nAnd it's important to understand that a portion of the remaining 60% of our business won't get the full 7% to 10% price increases we believe we need to cover rising costs until their next price increase cycle.\nA customer who has increased 4% in May won't get the full cost recovery price increase until next May.\nThat said, we're seeing a favorable price environment across our open market businesses, evidenced by our lowest level of rollbacks in more than a decade.\nWe're very focused on directly addressing the labor challenges.\nJohn will discuss the quarterly impact and how we're working to address this immediately.\nStrategically, we're looking at this acute challenge as an opportunity to expedite the automation of certain jobs.\nWe said previously that we view the automation of certain high turnover positions as both a competitive advantage and a derisking mechanism in today's labor market where certain jobs simply don't attract the interest they previously did.\nThe most recent examples of that are the customer setup role, which we just finished fully automating and the 35-plus percent reduction in labor we've seen where we've upgraded and rebuilt our single-stream recycling plants.\nGiven the success of these rebuilds and the labor inflation challenges of late, we've accelerated the retooling of the remaining single-stream plants and expect to address 90% of single-stream volume by the 2023-2024 time frame.\nIn the quarter, we saw some of the positive impacts of those new single-stream plants in our outstanding performance in our recycling business.\nEarnings contribution and margins for recycling were at their highest level ever, driven by strong demand for recycled material and great operating performance from the new state-of-the-art MRFs.\nWe were equally pleased with results in our renewable energy business in the quarter, where robust growth continued, driven by more RINs sales and higher prices.\nWith our long-standing expertise, continued growth in sustainability solutions and unrivaled asset network, WM is uniquely situated to support our current and prospective customers in their evolving sustainability needs.\nOur customers are increasingly seeking circular solutions for their materials, which is causing growing demand for recycled content.\nOf note, our focus on unlocking more plastic from the waste stream drove a 25% increase in plastics we recycle since 2019.\nRecycling and renewable energy are two of our key growth areas, highlighted in our annual sustainability report published earlier this month.\nThe report outlines the progress WM has made against our sustainability goals and details investments we've made to advance our sustainability journey.\nIn particular, this year's report focuses on the people behind the progress WM has made in the past year and how they are doing their part to take care of our customers, neighbors and the environment and communities across North America.\nThe bottom line for the quarter is this: we generated higher-than-expected volume and revenue growth in the third quarter, which positions us well for 2022.\nAt the same time, we faced an unexpectedly acute and fast-moving challenge from the inflation, supply chain and labor shortage headwinds, and we managed our way through it well and still expect to achieve results within our 2021 guidance ranges.\nAnd this challenge presents an opportunity for us to move more decisively in those strategic areas of automation, sustainability and workforce planning to further separate ourselves in this industry.\nThey continue to deliver, driving another quarter of double-digit growth in revenue, operating EBITDA and free cash flow.\nOur team continues to execute very well despite a challenging operating environment, producing more than 7% organic revenue growth in collection and disposal business in the third quarter.\nThis growth, combined with continued integration of Advanced Disposal, drove operating EBITDA more than 14% higher.\nAs Jim mentioned, we are seeing pressure on labor and other cost categories, and we are addressing these impacts through our pricing programs, controllable cost management, efficiency improvements and workforce planning.\nAdjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 180 basis points to 62.2% in the third quarter as we experienced pressure from inflationary costs, supply chain constraints and stronger-than-expected volume growth.\nIn particular, costs related to the hiring and training of new employees impacted labor costs in the third quarter.\nWe also saw overtime hours increase as the team adjusted to meet the higher-than-expected collection volumes.\nWe anticipated a good portion of this labor pressure that is showing up in our costs as we made proactive market wage adjustments earlier in the year to get in front of labor shortages and meet growing demand.\nAt the same time, we are working to automate a number of roles where we see longer-term challenges to attract and retain employees.\nIn the residential line of business, we continue to work through the last 40% of our routes, including those from ADS that are not fully automated while continuing to be very selective in the business we are willing to take on, as evidenced by our yield and volume results in the third quarter and the last few years.\nWhile we're now incurring the costs associated with these investments, we are only in the early stages of seeing the benefits.\nThe labor market supply chain constraints have accelerated in Q3, coupled with robust volume growth in the third quarter, have also added pressure in our fleet operations.\nRepair and maintenance costs are increasing as we hire additional technicians and incur some overtime hours to address the strong volume growth we continue to see in the collection lines of business.\nSimilarly, we've had to temporarily place some of our higher-cost trucks back in service to address the volume demands.\nIn addition, our third-party subcontractors at our transfer stations are facing similar pressures and are passing those increased costs on to us.\nOverall, efficiency in the collection business in the third quarter adjusting -- improved in the collection business in the third quarter, adjusting for increased training hours.\nThe fundamentals of our business remain strong, and we are committed to recovering our cost increases through pricing and again, taking the most expensive truck off the road and reducing the most expensive hour of the day.\nNow I want to focus on several of the positives in the quarter.\nTurning to our strong revenue results, third-quarter collection and disposal volume grew by 3.8%, which outpaced our expectations.\nWe continue to see strong volume, driven by economic reopening with commercial volume up 4.6% and special waste volume up by 16.6%, and we see runway for continued solid performance in the fourth quarter.\nCustomer metrics were also strong in the quarter.\nService increases outpaced service decreases by more than twofold for the second consecutive quarter and churn was 8.7%.\nYear to date, net new business for small and medium business customers is up more than 10%.\nAnd finally, our integration of Advanced Disposal continues to go smoothly.\nWe've combined around 70% of the acquired operations into our billing and operational systems, and we remain on track to migrate virtually all the ADS customers by the end of the year.\nWe've achieved nearly $26 million in annual run rate synergies during the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $60 million.\nCombined with the $15 million of annual run rate synergies realized in the fourth quarter of 2020, we're on track to reach $100 million by the end of the year.\nAnd we continue to forecast another $50 million to be captured in 2022 and 2023 from a combination of cost and capital savings.\nAs we have seen all year, robust volume growth, strong recycling commodity prices and increased collection and disposal core price continued to deliver top-line growth ahead of expectations in the third quarter.\nAs a result, we are once again updating our revenue outlook for the year.\nTotal company revenue growth is now expected to be between 17% and 17.5%, with yield and volume in our collection and disposal business of about 6.5%.\nThis guidance also includes an expectation for continued strength in recycled commodity prices and RIN values.\nWe're confirming our most recent 2021 adjusted operating EBITDA guidance of between $5 billion and $5.1 billion, which is an increase from the prior year of about 17% at the midpoint and almost 5% higher than our initial outlook for the year.\nThird-quarter SG&A was 9.7% of revenue, a 40-basis-point improvement over 2020.\nIncluded in our results is about $16 million of increased digital investments as we advanced technology that will benefit customer engagement and lower our cost to serve over the long term.\nWe remain focused on managing our controllable spending, making sure that we allocate each dollar to initiatives that will enhance our business.\nThird-quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $1.18 billion, an increase of 15%.\nCash from operations growth continues to be driven by our robust increase in operating EBITDA, including the contributions from the ADS acquisition and lower interest costs.\nWhile there was a modest unfavorable working capital comparison in the third quarter, due in large part to the timing of cash from CNG credit and our deferral of payroll taxes in 2020, overall, improvements in working capital demonstrate the benefit of tools we are putting in place to enhance our systems and processes.\nIn the third quarter, capital spending was $464 million, bringing capital expenditures in the first nine months of the year to $1.13 billion.\nOur 2021 pace of capital spending has continued to be slower than we planned due to supply chain constraints and construction project work taking longer than planned.\nAs we discussed last quarter, we are proactively pulling forward capital investment, particularly in recycling, where we know the returns will be strong.\nInvestments in recycling technology and equipment at our MRFs are expected to be about $200 million for the year.\nWhile we continue to target full-year capital spending at the low end of our $1.78 billion to $1.88 billion guidance range, we could see 2021 coming in below targeted levels, with some of our spending pushed into 2022, primarily due to supply chain constraints.\nWe generated $773 million of free cash flow in the third quarter.\nAnd through September, our business generated free cash flow of $2.29 billion, seeing us well on our way to our full-year targeted free cash flow of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion.\nWe've returned more than $1.7 billion to our shareholders through the first nine months, paying $730 million in dividends and repurchasing $1 billion of our stock.\nWe continue to expect to repurchase up to our full authorization of $1.35 billion in 2021.\nOur leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.71 times as the strength of our business performance and the successful integration of the acquired ADS business drove the achievement of our targeted leverage ratio ahead of plan.\nAs we enter the final stretch of 2021, our teams are focused on accelerating our disciplined pricing programs, managing our controllable costs, positioning WM as an employer of choice and capturing growing volumes.\nWe know our strategy sets us up for a solid finish to 2021.\nWith that, Erica, we'd be happy to address the team's questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Last night, we released results for our second quarter of fiscal year 2021, copies of which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nIn order to provide greater transparency regarding our operating performance, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that involve adjustments to the GAAP results.\nAny non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered to be an alternative to financial measures required by GAAP.\nErica will review the business segment and corporate financial results.\nI'm very pleased with the exceptional operating results we generated this quarter as we saw continued strength across our businesses.\nFor the quarter, we generated a second consecutive record adjusted earnings per share of $1.38 and segment EBIT of $149 million.\nAdjusted earnings per share was up 79% over the second fiscal quarter of 2020 largely due to strong volumes across all regions, robust unit margins, disciplined operational execution and strong performance in our targeted growth initiatives.\nThe Cabot team demonstrated great operational flexibility in the face of continued COVID restrictions, weather related interruptions and tightness in the global shipping markets.\nThis operational adaptability was made possible by the extraordinary efforts of our commercial and supply chain teams and the strength of the Cabot manufacturing network.\nDuring the quarter, we saw strong volumes in the tire and automotive markets and continued strength in our infrastructure, packaging and consumer-driven applications.\nWe are pleased to see that automotive builds and passenger car miles driven have improved, though still generally lag pre-COVID levels.\nOn the other hand, truck miles driven are very robust, driving a large replacement tire market.\nWith both automotive and tire markets still expected to be below prior peaks on a 2021 forecast basis, we are optimistic about our growth runway in the coming years.\nIn the near term, COVID cases remain persistently high in certain regions, particularly across Europe, South America and India.\nWhile vaccines are offering promise, the economic recovery will likely remain uneven and challenge to reach its full potential until the public health crisis is fully under control.\nRaw material prices continue to rise across most value chains and our businesses were no different.\nWe effectively implemented price increases to recover these rising costs, which combined with favorable product mix to drive robust unit margins.\nLooking at our major segments, Reinforcement Materials generated record EBIT performance in the quarter of $89 million, driven by robust customer demand and strong Asia pricing.\nResults in Performance Chemicals were up sharply over the prior year with segment EBIT of $58 million compared to $31 million last year, as the business drove double-digit volume growth in both Performance Additives and Formulated Solutions businesses, and benefited from favorable product mix.\nOverall I am very pleased with the way we have navigated the pandemic, and I believe that Cabot is emerging from the COVID crisis a stronger company.\nOur global manufacturing footprint and service capabilities and leading product portfolio are increasingly valued by our customers.\nWhile the recession of 2020 required an intense focus on cost and cash preservation, we continue to sustain our assets and make important investments in sustainability and growth for the long term.\nOne of the most exciting growth investments is in the space of batteries and I would like to take a few minutes to update you on our progress here.\nWe are seeing a real inflection point in terms of demand for electric vehicles and energy storage as pressures to reduce greenhouse gases increase.\nCabot is well positioned and is supporting this transition with our leading portfolio of highly engineered, conductive carbon additives and formulation capabilities.\nOur business is demonstrating strong growth this year and we expect this will continue into the future.\nI will start with some comments about the overall market.\nLithium ion batteries are growing rapidly and expected to grow at a 25% to 30% compound annual growth rate through 2030 with the primary growth driver being electric vehicles as countries establish CO2 reduction goals and accelerate the shift away from internal combustion engines.\nFurther technology improvements in batteries are a necessary enabler of this transition, and the materials industry will play a key role in this pursuit to drive down costs and increase range.\nCabot currently serves this market by offering a range of materials and formulations for use in energy storage applications.\nThese materials can be classified into two groups, conductive carbon additives, which include conductive carbon black, carbon nanostructures and carbon nanotubes and non-carbon additives which include products in our fumed metal oxides business.\nConductive carbon additives are a small part of the battery formulation, but play a very important role.\nThese additives enable electrons to move in and out of the active phase where they're stored during charging and discharging of the battery.\nThere are two types of conductivity required to make this effective, short range conductivity and long range conductivity.\nBased on the different shapes and properties of conductive carbon additives they impart different conductivity performance.\nFor example, carbon nanotubes are more advantaged in providing the long range conductivity, while conductive carbon blacks are more advantaged in providing the short range conductivity.\nTherefore, there is no one single best additive for this application.\nHaving the capability to offer different types of conductive carbon additives and blends of such materials is important in delivering a formulated solution to the customer that addresses their specific needs.\nThere are a few drivers that distinguish Cabot in the conductive carbon additive space.\nFirst, we have an established an unmatched global footprint and application capability to support our customers, as they build manufacturing plants around the world.\nOver the past few years, through the establishment of our Asia Technology Center and the R&D capabilities acquired from the Sanshun acquisition, we have built a leading technical support team.\nThis capability coupled with a global manufacturing footprint positions us favorably in the eyes of our customers.\nSecond, through organic and inorganic investments over the past few years including the recent acquisition of Sanshun, Cabot is the only carbon additive supplier with commercially proven conductive carbon black, carbon nanotube, carbon nano structure and dispersion capabilities.\nThis variety of conductive carbon additives enables us to tailor different formulated solutions for our customers and work with them on next generation technologies.\nAnd third, Cabot has a rich legacy of innovating in demanding technical applications.\nOur experience in the CMP market for semiconductors and inkjet has offered invaluable practices and protocols that will be critical for the battery market.\nIn terms of financial performance, we believe that the battery application will become a material contributor to the Performance Chemicals segment over the next few years.\nThe current conductive carbon additives market for lithium ion batteries which includes both CNTs and conductive carbon black is approximately $400 million in material value.\nWe expect this market will grow to approximately $1 billion in value by 2025.\nOur energy materials business is off to a strong start in fiscal 2021 with forecasted revenue of approximately $80 million for the fiscal year.\nOver the past five years, revenue has grown at a CAGR of roughly 50% which includes the acquisition of our CNT business in China.\nWhile we are making significant investments to drive qualification and further extend our technical capabilities EBITDA is forecasted to be between $15 million and $20 million in fiscal year 2021.\nWe are excited about the promise of this emerging application and will continue to focus our efforts to support customers and realize the potential of energy storage.\nI will start with discussing results in the Reinforcement Materials segment.\nThe Reinforcement Materials segment delivered record operating results with EBIT of $89 million which is up 46% compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2020, primarily due to significantly higher volumes across all regions and improved unit margins driven by favorable spot pricing in the Asia region.\nGlobally, volumes were up 18% in the second quarter as compared to the same period of the prior year primarily due to 30% growth in Asia and 10% higher volumes in the Americas and Europe.\nHigher volumes are driven by key end market demand that continued to recover from COVID related impacts in fiscal 2020.\nResults also benefited from higher margins from continued strong pricing in Asia, which included a second consecutive quarter of price increases ahead of rising feedstock costs.\nLooking ahead to the second half of 2021, we expect volumes to remain strong.\nIn addition, we anticipate higher feedstock cost flow-through in Asia, while fixed costs are expected to be higher due to the timing of planned plant maintenance spending, after delayed spending in 2020 and the first half of this fiscal year.\nNow, turning to Performance Chemicals, EBIT increased by $27 million as compared to the second fiscal quarter of 2020, primarily due to strong volumes across the segment and improved product mix, driven by an increase in sales and into automotive applications.\nYear-over-year volumes increased by 10% in Performance Additives and 14% in Formulated Solutions, driven by increases across all our key product lines from higher demand levels and some level of customer inventory replenishment during the quarter.\nLooking ahead to the second half of fiscal 2021, we expect overall volumes to remain strong.\nHowever we anticipate demand into auto applications will decrease somewhat due to the semiconductor chip shortage, which will unfavorably impact product mix as compared to the first half of the year.\nIn addition, we anticipate higher fixed costs in the second half of the fiscal year due to the timing of spending.\nMoving to Purification Solutions, EBIT in the second quarter of 2021 declined by $1 million compared to the second quarter of 2020.\nThe reduced demand in mercury removal applications was partially offset by a reduction in fixed costs, resulting from the sale of our mine in Marshall, Texas and the related long term supply agreements.\nLooking ahead to the second half of fiscal 2021, we expect EBIT to improve driven by seasonally higher volumes.\nI'll now turn to corporate items.\nWe ended the quarter with a cash balance of $146 million and our liquidity position remains strong at approximately $1.3 billion.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2021, cash flows from operating activities were $65 million which included a working capital increase of $80 million.\nThe working capital increase was largely driven by growth related networking capital as accounts receivables increased with higher sales and inventory increase from purchases of higher cost raw materials.\nCapital expenditures for the second quarter were $40 million, for the full year we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $200 million.\nThis estimate includes continued EPA related compliance spend and capital related to upgrading our new China carbon black plant to produce specialty products.\nAdditional uses of cash during the quarter included $20 million for dividend.\nOur year-to-date operating tax rate was 28% and we forecast our operating tax rate will be between 27% and 29% for the fiscal year.\nWe are very pleased with the record results in the second quarter of 2021 with volumes continuing to recover from the COVID related lows we experienced in fiscal 2020 and great execution across the organization.\nWe achieved another record setting quarter in reinforcement materials and very strong results in the performance chemicals segment.\nThroughout the first half of the year, I am pleased with how well the team has been executing.\nOur manufacturing plants continue to operate effectively in the COVID environment to meet the needs of our customers.\nFurthermore, we achieved an important milestone on our sustainability journey with the completion of the air pollution control project at our Franklin Louisiana plant.\nWe continue the integration of our CNT acquisition in China and our investments in inkjet are on track, to deliver on the promise of growth in the packaging segment.\nAnd finally, we continue to renew our ways at working to drive more efficient and effective processes through the implementation of digital solutions.\nI'm proud of the Cabot team for their work to strengthen our foundation and establish our platform for sustainable growth.\nMoving to our current outlook, we continue to see robust and broad-based demand globally including in our key tire, automotive and industrial end use markets.\nOur current view is that the underlying demand will remain strong during the second half of the year.\nAgainst this demand outlook, we expect some impact from the flow-through of higher raw material costs in Asia, moderating volumes into automotive applications due to the semiconductor chip shortage and higher fixed costs as we perform some maintenance and turnarounds that are necessary to ensure we can meet customer demand in 2022.\nBased on these factors, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $4.70 to $4.95.\nOn the cash side, we anticipate our cash and liquidity will remain robust.\nNetworking capital increases, driven by a sharp recovery in demand and a steady increase in oil prices should moderate in the second half of the year.\nWe expect to see better conversion of our strong EBITDA and to operating cash flow as this happens.\nWe anticipate operating cash flow for the year will cover our cash needs for capital expenditures and dividends.\nOur debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.3 times at the end of March and we expect this will be reduced further by year end.\nThe strength of our culture and the resilience of our employees has never been more apparent than it has during these challenging times.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Our consolidated earnings for the second quarter of 2021 were $0.20 per diluted share compared to $0.26 for the second quarter of 2020.\nFor the year-to-date, consolidated earnings were $1.18 per diluted share for 2021 compared to $0.98 last year.\nNow I'll turn the discussion over to Dennis.\nI hope your summer is going well and that you're staying safe.\nOn June 30, Washington State officially lifted most of the remaining restrictions that have been in place during the pandemic.\nWe're excited to see our local economies continue to recover.\nWe're experiencing increased loads, and customer growth is steady.\nLike many other businesses, we continue to monitor the pandemic very closely and watch what's happening with variants and case count in our communities.\nWe're ready and able to successfully adjust our business as needed and also continue to provide care and compassion for those who are struggling.\nNow let's look at some highlights from our second quarter.\nWe had a challenging second quarter, which included an unprecedented heat wave that brought with it several consecutive days of triple-digit record-breaking temperatures across the region.\nOn June 29, Spokane temperature soared to 109 degrees, setting new record -- a new record high temperature and was even higher in many of our neighborhoods.\nThat same day, Avista experienced a major increase in customer usage, which resulted in the highest energy usage in our company's 132-year history.\nThe intense temperatures, combined with record high usage, strained parts of our electrical system and caused some of the equipment that runs our electric grid to overheat.\nSix of our 140 distribution substations were impacted.\nTo prevent the equipment from overloading and to avoid extensive and costly damage to our electric system, we implemented protective outages for customers served by the equipment that was most impacted by the heat.\nOver the course of the event, we were able to reduce the impact to customers through system modifications.\nWe appreciate our customers' patience for those who experienced outages.\nHigher customer loads, related to the extended heat wave, were the primary driver for an increase in net power supply cost to serve our customers, which negatively affected the Energy Recovery Mechanism, or ERM.\nOverall, we've experienced hotter and drier-than-normal weather across the Pacific Northwest, which contributed to lower-than-normal hydroelectric generation and increased power prices.\nFor these reasons, we had to rely on thermal generation and purchased power at higher prices to serve those additional loads.\nAs a result, Avis Utilities' earnings were below expectations for the second quarter.\nAEL&P's earnings met expectations in the second quarter, and they are on track to meet the full year guidance.\nIt was a strong quarter for our other businesses, which exceeded expectations due to gains on our investments and the sale of certain subsidiary assets associated with Spokane steam plant.\nWildfire resiliency continues to be a focus for Avista.\nOur region has experienced extremely dry conditions all spring and summer.\nAnd combined with high temperatures, wildfire risk is high.\nIn response to these conditions, Avista has been operating in, what we call, dry land mode since late June, and dry land mode decreases the potential for wildfires that could occur when reenergizing a power line.\nNormally, under normal conditions, these lines, located in rural and/or forested areas, are generally reenergized automatically.\nHowever, during the current dry weather conditions, Avista's line personnel physically patrol in outage area before a line is placed back into service.\nThis can require more time to restore service, but it decreases a potential fire danger.\nThis practice is in line with Avista's wildfire resiliency plan, which was released last year, building on prevention and response strategies that have been in place for many years.\nAvista has committed to a comprehensive 10-year wildfire resiliency plan that includes improved defense strategies and operating practices for a more resilient system.\nIn regards to regulatory matters, we are pleased to have reached an all-party settlement in our Idaho general rate case.\nThe new rates are fair and reasonable for our customers, the company and our shareholders and will allow Avista to continue receiving a fair return in Idaho.\nOur Washington general rate cases continue to work their way through the regulatory process.\nOur hearings have been held, and we expect a decision by the end of September.\nIn Oregon, we expect to file a rate case in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nWe are confirming our 2021 earnings guidance with a consolidated range of $1.96 to $2.16 per diluted share.\nWhile we are confirming our consolidated range, we are adjusting our 2021 segment ranges to lower Avista Utilities by $0.10 per diluted share and raise other by $0.10 per diluted share.\nFor 2022, we are lowering consolidated earnings guidance by $0.15 per diluted share to a range of $2.03 to $2.23 per diluted share.\nFor 2023, we are confirming our earnings guidance with a consolidated range of $2.42 and to $2.62 per diluted share.\nAlthough we expect to experience headwinds in 2022 from regulatory lag, we are confident that we can meet our earnings guidance for 2023 and earn our allowed return.\nLooking ahead, we'll continue focusing on our utility operations, while prudently investing in the necessary capital to maintain and update our infrastructure to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers and our communities.\nI know everybody is sitting on the edges or seat waiting for the Blackhawk's next acquisition, which is a Spokane native.\nWe got Tyler Johnson, a 2-time Stanley Cup Champion, who is a Spokane native.\nSo we're pretty excited about that.\nThere's your Hawks update.\nAs Dennis mentioned, we're confirming our 2021 earnings guidance, lowering our utility guidance for '21 and also '22 and confirming '23 consolidated guidance.\nOur guidance -- I'll spend a little time on that.\nOur guidance assume, among other things, a timely and appropriate rate relief in our jurisdictions.\nThat's very important as we need -- Dennis mentioned, we settled our Idaho case.\nWe're still awaiting approval from the commissions, which we expect before those rates go into effect September 1.\nFor 2021, we expect Avista Utilities to contribute in the range of $1.83 to $1.97 per diluted share, and the lower end of our guidance in '21 and '22 for the Avista Utilities is primarily due to increased regulatory lag.\nThat's due to increase capital expenditures primarily due to growth and higher-than-expected depreciation expense.\nBut that is, we believe, all timing, and we begin -- as we begin to plan for our next Washington general rate case to be filed early in the first quarter of '22, we expect that to be a multiyear rate plan as required under the new law.\nWe will seek to include all capital investment through the end of the rate plan period in rates in an effort to earn our allowed return by 2023.\nIn addition, we have experienced an increase, as Dennis mentioned, in actual and forecasted net power supply cost.\nAlthough the midpoint of our guidance range does not include any benefit or expense under the ERM in Washington, the increase in power supply cost has reduced the opportunity for us to be in the upper half of the guidance range.\nAnd our current expectation for the ERM is a surcharge position within the 90-10 sharing -- company sharing band, which is expected to decrease earnings by $0.08 per diluted share.\nAnd recall, last quarter, our estimate for the ERM for the year was in a benefit position, which was expected to add $0.06 per diluted share.\nIn addition, we are also absorbing more net power supply cost under the PCA in Idaho.\nFor 2021, as Dennis mentioned, we expect AEL&P to contribute $0.08 to $0.11.\nAnd we increased the range in our other businesses by $0.10, which really offsets the utility reduction, and that's largely due to a range of $0.05 to $0.08 of diluted share because of investment gains and the gain we experienced from the sale of Spokane Steam Plant.\nOur guidance generally includes only normal operating conditions and does not include unusual or nonrecurring items until the effects are known and certain.\nMoving on to earnings for the second quarter.\nAvista Utilities contributed $0.11 per diluted share compared to $0.26 in 2020.\nCompared to the prior year, our earnings decreased due to an increase in net power supply costs, as Dennis mentioned, mainly due to higher customer loads from the heat wave, and we had lower-than-normal hydroelectric generation because of the hot and dry conditions.\nOur hydroelectric generation is about 91% of -- our expectations are normal for this year.\nThe ERM in Washington also moved significantly.\nHad a pre-tax expense of $7.6 million in the second quarter of '21 compared to a pre-tax benefit of $0.4 million in 2020.\nYear-to-date, we've recognized $3.3 million of expense in '21 compared to $5.6 million in benefit in 2020.\nIn addition to the higher power supply cost, we also had higher operating expenses in the quarter, mainly due to the timing of maintenance projects, as many of those maintenance projects were delayed in 2020 because of COVID-19, whereas in 2021, we returned to our original schedules and performed that maintenance in the second quarter.\nThe higher maintenance costs were partially offset by lower bad debt expense as we are continuing to defer bad debt through our COVID-19 regulatory deferrals.\nMoving on to capital.\nAs Dennis mentioned, we're committed to be continuing to invest the necessary capital in our utility infrastructure.\nWe currently expect Avista Utilities to have increased capital expenditures up to $450 million in 2021 and $415 million in 2022 -- or $445 million in '22 and '23.\nThat's a $35 million and $40 million increase in '21, '22 and '23, $40 million in '23 as well.\nAnd this is really to support continued customer growth.\nOur customer growth's about 1.5%, which is up from 0.5% to 1% in prior expectations.\nWe expect to issue approximately $140 million of long-term debt and $90 million of common stock, including $16 million that we've already issued through June on the common stock side in 2021.\nThe increase in long-term debt and common stock is to fund the increased capital expenditures.\nSummary:

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc.\nToday, I'm joined telephonically by our Chairman, Micky Arison, as well as David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nWe are absolutely thrilled to be back doing what we do best, delivering amazing, memorable vacation experiences to our guests.\nOur team members are overjoyed to be back on board and it shows our guests are having a phenomenal time.\nOur onboard revenues for guests are off the charts, and our Net Promoter Scores have been exceptionally strong.\nI've had the pleasure of visiting a number of ships in recent weeks, both here in the U.S. and abroad.\nAnd I can tell you, the ship looks spectacular, and the crew has an amazing energy.\nThere is such an incredible spirit on board.\nOur protocols have been working well, beginning with a seamless embarkation experience and have enabled us to build occupancy levels at a significant pace as we return more ships to service.\nOur brands executed extremely well in this initial phase of our return to serve, particularly given significant restrictions on international travel, hampering our ability to offer our normal content-rich deployment options, as well as the operating requirements in certain jurisdictions that limit our normally high occupancy levels.\nOur itinerary planners came up with creative deployment alternatives, our marketing department made them accessible with little investment, our yield managers priced them appropriately to achieve occupancy targets very close to them, and coupled them with bundled packages to drive exceptionally strong revenue on board.\nAnd despite all the additional protocols, our crew delivered an amazing guest experience.\nThe combination of which enabled us to deliver cruise vacations at scale while producing significant cash from these restricted voyages.\nNow while we normally don't disclose this level of information, we try to find a way to give you a sense of why we're viewing the restart as hugely successful beyond the enthusiasm of our guests and crew and the unprecedented Net Promoter Scores.\nIt became complicated because most of our voyages, while cash flow positive, are programs that could not be compared to 2019.\nAnd in most cases, would normally be priced lower than the 2019 alternatives.\nSo for example, in the U.K., we're only able to offer senior cruises without any ports of call, and that's our version of vacation, which were not comparable in ticket prices to peak season Mediterranean or Baltic sailings offered in the summer of 2019.\nThat said, even with occupancy limitations, these cruises generated cash for our stakeholders.\nThey supported a return for our workforce, and they successfully served guests, resulting in high satisfaction levels.\nNow at Carnival Cruise Line, we were able to offer more comparable itineraries than 2019, our revenue per dims were up 20% compared to 2019 and that's inclusive of the impact of incentives from previous cancellations, and that's despite the quoting nature of the bookings.\nIn fact, Carnival Cruise Lines restarted more ships out of the United States than any of the cruise brand and still achieved occupancy above 70%, all of which combined to generate an even greater cash contribution.\nClearly, Carnival Cruise Line is a brand that continues to outperform.\nWhile the Delta variant and its corresponding effect on consumer confidence has certainly created a myriad of operating challenges for us to navigate in the near term and has led to some booking volatility in August, to-date it has not had a significant impact on our ultimate plan to return our full fleet to guest operations in the spring of 2022.\nOn our last quarterly business update, we said that we expected the environment to remain dynamic and it certainly have.\nOf course, agility has been a key strength of ours over the last 18 months, and we continue to aggressively manage to optimize given this ever-changing landscape.\nIn fact, while by design, we're not yet at 100% occupancy.\nWe have individual sailings with over 4,000 guests.\nTo-date, we have carried over 0.5 million guests this year already.\nAnd on any given day, we are now successfully carrying around 50,000 guests, and expect that number to continue to rise as we introduce more capacity and as we increase occupancy over the coming months.\nThe Delta variant has clearly impacted our protocols, which will continue to evolve based on the local environment.\nIn markets like the U.S., where case counts are higher, we've taken swift actions to reinforce our already strong protocol, such as additional testing requirements and indoor mass requirements with all U.S. sailings operating under the CDC's vaccination requirements.\nOur protocols go above and beyond the terms of the conditional sale order and are much more rigorous than comparable land-based alternative.\nAgain, our highest responsibility and therefore, our top priority is always compliance, environmental protection and the health, safety and well-being of everyone, our guests, the people in the communities we touch and serve and of course, our Carnival family, our team members shipboard and shoreside.\nThe Delta variant has also created some disruption in our supply chain, impacted the timing of opening for some destinations and created a heightened level of uncertainty that has been reflected in the broader travel sector and in our own booking trends.\nWe quickly adjusted our deployment to push out the start date on a few select voyages.\nFor some of our more exotic winter deployments, like our popular world cruises, we rebooked guests for our 2023 departures.\nEffectively, we've managed our near-term capacity to optimize the current environment, just as we indicated we would.\nThe modifications we've made to the pace of the roll of our fleet will optimize our cash position in the near term.\nLooking forward, we continue to work toward resuming full operations in the spring, in time for our important summer season where we make the lion's share of our operating profit.\nOf course, we have ample liquidity to see us through to full operation.\nAnd we continue with a prudent focus on cash management to ensure we have flexibility under a multitude of scenarios.\nThe current environment, while choppy, has improved dramatically since last summer, and it should improve even further by next summer if the current trend of vaccine rollout and advancements in therapies continues.\nFor instance, in markets like the U.K., where vaccination rates are already higher, consumer confidence remains strong, and we are seeing strong momentum.\nSo far, we've announced the resumption of guest cruise operations for 71 ships through next spring, and that's across eight of our nine brands.\nWe're evaluating the remaining shifts through next spring, with a continued focus on maximizing future cash flow while delivering a great guest experience in a way that serves the best interest of public health.\nImportantly, even at this very early stage of our rollout, our ships are generating positive cash flow.\nBased on our current rollout, we expect cash from operations for the whole company to turn positive at some point early next year.\nLooking forward, we believe we have the potential to generate higher EBITDA in 2023 compared to 2019, given despite our modest growth rate, additional capacity and our improved cost structure.\nAs further insight into booking trends, we are well positioned to build on a solid book position and intentionally constrained capacity for the remainder of 2021 and into the first half of 2022.\nWith the existing demand and limited capacity, we are focused on maintaining price.\nEven recently with heightened uncertainty from the Delta variant affecting travel decisions broadly, we continue to maintain price.\nWe have also opened bookings earlier for cruises in 2023, and we're achieving those early bookings with strong demand and good prices.\nAnd based on that success, we've begun to launch 2024 sailings even earlier.\nIn fact, these efforts contributed to the $630 million increase in guest deposits, our long-term guest deposits.\nAnd that's deposits on bookings beyond 12 months, are 3 times historical levels, driven in part by our proactive efforts to open more inventory for sale in outer years.\nNow we expect guests deposits to continue to grow through the restart as we return more ships to service and as we build occupancy levels.\nAgain, these favorable trends continue despite dramatically reduced advertising expense.\nWe continue to focus our efforts on our lower cost channels like direct marketing to our sizable past guest database of over 40 million guests, and earned media, as we build on our multiple new ship launches and restart news flow.\nOf course, and most importantly, we are delivering on our guest experience.\nWord-of-mouth remains the number-one reason people take their first cruise.\nAnd as I mentioned, our Net Promoter Scores are well above historical levels across our ships that have returned to service so far.\nDuring the quarter, we furthered our strong track record of responsibly managing the balance sheet.\nWe completed two refinancing transactions, among other efforts, resulting in a meaningful reduction in annual interest expense.\nWe have many more opportunities for refinancing ahead and are working through them at an aggressive pace.\nAlso importantly, we have continued to make advancements in our sustainability efforts.\nLast week, we published our 11th Annual Sustainability Report, Sustainable from Ship to Shore, which can be found on our sustainability website www.\nIn the report, we build on the achievement of our 2020 goal by sharing more details on our 2030 goals and our 2050 aspiration.\nThe report shares additional light on the six focus areas that will guide our long-term sustainability vision, including climate action, circular economy -- that's wage reduction, sustainable tourism, health and well-being, diversity, equity and inclusion and biodiversity and conservation.\nNow these areas align with United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.\nClimate action is a top sustainability focus area.\nWe are committed to decarbonization, and we aspire to be carbon neutral by 2050.\nAs we have previously shared, despite 25% capacity growth since that time, our absolute carbon emissions peaked in 2011 and will remain below those levels.\nWe are working toward transitioning our energy needs to alternative fuels and investing in new low-carbon technologies.\nNow because of the pause in guest cruise operations, the 2020 sustainability performance measures are not comparable to prior year data.\nThat said, there is a lot of valuable information on the progress we made in our sustainability journey despite what an incredibly challenging year.\nWe were clearly among the most impacted companies by COVID-19, and I'm very proud of all we've accomplished collectively to sustain our organization through these challenging times, including all we did for our loyal guests, all we did for our other many stakeholders, and all we did for each other within our Carnival family.\nIn many regards, I believe our collective response to the pandemic is strong testimony to the sustainability of our company.\nFor that, I again express my deepest appreciation to our Carnival team members, both shipboard and shoreside, who consistently went above and beyond.\nI'm very humbled by the dedication I've seen in these past 18 months.\nWe continue to move forward in a very positive way.\nThroughout the pause, we've been proactively managing to resume operations as an even stronger operating company.\nOur strategic decision to accelerate the exit of 19 ships left us with a more efficient and effective fleet, and has lowered our capacity growth to roughly 2.5% compounded annually from 2019 through 2025, and that's down from 4.5% pre-COVID.\nWe've opportunistically rebalanced our portfolio through the ship exits as well as a future ship transfer, any modification to our newbuild schedule to optimize our asset allocation, maximize cash generation and improve our return on invested capital.\nWhile capacity growth is constrained, we will benefit from an exciting roster of new ships spread across our brands, enabling us to capitalize on the pent-up demand and drive even more enthusiasm and excitement around our restart plan.\nAnd we will achieve a structural benefit to unit costs in 2023 as we introduce these new, larger and more efficient ships, coupled with the 19 ships leaving the fleet, which were among our least efficient, with the aggressive actions we've already taken, optimizing our portfolio and reducing capacity.\nWe are well positioned to capitalize on pent-up demand and to emerge a leaner, more efficient company, reinforcing our global industry-leading position.\nWe have secured sufficient liquidity to see us through to full operation.\nOnce we return the full operation, our cash flow will be the primary driver to return to investment-grade credit over time, creating greater shareholder value.\nI'll start today with a review of our guest cruise operations along with our third quarter monthly average cash burn rate.\nThen I'll provide an update on booking trends and finish up with some insights into our refinancing activity.\nTurning to guest cruise operations.\nIt feels so great to be talking about operations again.\nWe started the quarter with just five ships in service.\nDuring the third quarter, we successfully restarted ships across eight of our brands.\nWe ended the quarter with 35% of our fleet capacity in service.\nOur plans call for another 27 ships to restart guest cruise operations during the fourth quarter and the month of December.\nSo on New Year's Day, we anticipate celebrating with 55 ships or nearly 65% of our fleet capacity back in service.\nFor the third quarter, occupancy was 54% across the ships in service.\nOur brands executed extremely well.\nOccupancy did improve month-to-month through the quarter and in the month of August, occupancy reached 59% from 39% in June and 51% in July.\nOccupancy for our North American brands reflects our approach of vaccinated cruises, which for the time being, does limit the number of families with children under 12 that can sail with us.\nOccupancy for our European brands reflects capacity restrictions, such as social distancing requirements for our Continental European brands and a 1,000-person cap per sailing for some of the quarter in the U.K. For the full third quarter, our North American brands occupancy was 68%, while for our European brands, occupancy was 47%.\nRevenue per passenger cruise day for the third quarter 2021 increased compared to a strong 2019 despite the current constraints on itinerary offerings which did not include many of the higher-yielding destination-rich itineraries offered in 2019.\nAs Arnold indicated, our guests are having a phenomenal time and our Net Promoter Scores have been incredibly strong.\nAs always, happy guests seem to translate into improved onboard revenue.\nOur onboard and other revenue per diems were up significantly in the third quarter 2021 versus the third quarter 2019, in part due to the bundled packages as well as onboard credits utilized by guests from cruises canceled during the pause.\nWe had great growth in onboard and other per diems on both sides of the Atlantic.\nIncreases in bar, casino, shops, spa and Internet led the way on board.\nOver the past two years, we have offered and our guests have chosen more and more bundled package options.\nIn the end, we will see the benefit of these bundled packages in onboard and other revenue as we did during the third quarter 2021.\nAs a result of these bundled packages, the line between passenger ticket revenue and onboard revenue seems to be blurring.\nFor accounting purposes, we allocate the total price paid by the guests between the two categories.\nTherefore, the best way to judge our performance is by reference to our total cruise revenue metrics.\nAs we previously guided, the ships in service during the third quarter were, in fact, cash flow positive.\nThey generated nearly $90 million of ship level cash contribution.\nThis was achieved with only a two-month U.S.-based restart during the third quarter as our North American brands began guest cruise operations in early July.\nWe expect the ship level cash contribution to grow over time as more ships return to service and as we build on our occupancy percentages.\nFor those of you who are modeling our future results, I did want to point out that due to the cost of a portion of our fleet being in pause status during the first half of 2022, restart related expenses and the cost of maintaining enhanced health and safety protocols, we are projecting ship operating expenses in 2022 per available lower berth day or per ALBD, as it is more commonly called, to be higher than 2019 despite the benefit we get from the 19 smaller, less efficient ships leaving the fleet.\nRemember, that because a portion of the fleet will be in pause status during the first half, we are spreading costs over less ALBDs.\nWe do anticipate that most of these costs and expenses will end with 2022 and will not reoccur in fiscal 2023.\nNow let's look at our monthly average cash burn rate.\nFor the third quarter 2021, our cash burn rate was $510 million per month, which was better than our previous guidance and was in line with the $500 million per month for the first half of 2021.\nThe improvement versus our guidance was due to the timing of capital expenditures, which are now likely to occur in the fourth quarter and some other small working capital changes.\nWith the timing of certain capital expenditures now shifting to the fourth quarter, the company expects its monthly average cash burn rate for the fourth quarter to be higher than the monthly average rate for the first nine months of the year.\nOther good news positive factors impacting the fourth quarter are restart expenditures to support not only the 22 ships that will restart during the fourth quarter but also the additional ships that will restart in the first quarter of 2022, along with the significant increase in dry dock days during the fourth quarter, driven by the restart schedule.\nAll these expenditures have been anticipated, and given the announced restarts, many of them are now occurring in the fourth quarter.\nAlso, during the fourth quarter, we are forecasting positive cash flow from the 50 ships that will have guest cruise operations during the quarter.\nAnd ALBDs for the fourth quarter are expected to be 10.3 million, which is approximately 47% of our total fleet capacity.\nNow turning to booking trends.\nOur booking volumes for the all future cruises during the third quarter 2021 were higher than booking volumes during the first quarter.\nThat trend continued over the first couple of months of the third quarter, such that we expected the third quarter would end at higher booking levels than the second quarter, but we did manage to achieve that because of lower booking volumes in the month of August when the Delta variant impacted travel and leisure bookings generally.\nThe impact on bookings in August was mostly seen on near-term sailings.\nHowever, the impact quickly stabilized in the month of August.\nOur cumulative advanced book position for the second half of 2022 is ahead of a very strong 2019 and is at a new historical high.\nPricing on our second half 2022 book position is higher than pricing on bookings at the same time for 2019 sailings, driven in part by the bundled pricing strategy for a number of our brands, but excluding the dilutive impact of future cruise credits or more commonly known as FCCs.\nIf we were to include the dilutive impact of future cruise credits, pricing on our second half 2022 book position is now in line with pricing at the same time for 2019 sailings.\nThis improved position is a result of positive pricing trends we have seen during the third quarter.\nThis is a great achievement, given pricing on bookings for 2019 sailings is a tough comparison as that was the high watermark for historical yield.\nFinally, I will finish up with some insights into our refinancing activity.\nWe are focused on pursuing refinancing opportunities to extend maturities and reduce interest expense.\nTo-date, through our debt management efforts, we have reduced our future annual interest expense by over $250 million per year.\nAnd we have completed cumulative debt principal payment extensions of approximately $4 billion, improving our future liquidity position.\nThe $4 billion extension results from three things: first, the July refinancing of 50% of our first lien notes were $2 billion.\nSecond, the completion of the European debt holiday amendments, which deferred $1.7 billion of principal payments.\nThe deferred principal payments will instead be made over a five-year period, beginning in April 2022.\nAnd third, the extension of a $300 million bilateral loan with one of our banking partners.\nAs we look forward, given how support of the debt capital market investors and commercial banks have been, we will be pursuing additional refinancing opportunities to meaningfully reduce our interest expense and extend our maturities over time.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer.\nWhether working on-site performing essential maintenance or concierge duties, whether you're engaging remotely with prospects using our new touchless leasing process, or whether you are working from home in the many corporate roles that make Equity Residential hum, you are keeping our company rolling.\nNow turning to our business.\nThe best way I can describe it in the last seven weeks is resilient.\nIn April, we collected in our residential business about 97% of the cash that we would usually collect.\nWhile no part of our country's economy will be immune from the coming recession, we feel that our portfolio of properties, populated with residents having average annual household incomes of $164,000 and often employed in technology and other knowledge industries, will fare relatively well.\nOur operations team has also shown resiliency.\nWhen the pandemic hit in full force in mid-March, Michael Manelis and his team quickly pivoted, and over a few week period, adjusted our leasing and service operations dramatically.\nOn the leasing side, Michael and his team were able to quickly create a touchless process that made our customers comfortable to lease.\nAnd on the service side, we focused on essential maintenance tasks and cleanliness, which helped our existing residents feel safe and comfortable living with us through this pandemic.\nMichael will give you more details about all of this in a minute.\nWhen the lockdowns were initially announced, we saw our leasing activity decline significantly, but demand has since picked up, as we noted in the release.\nWe see our recent pickup in demand as a further indication that our properties and markets will remain attractive places to live for our target demographic.\nAll in all, we think our people and our properties have been resilient, with the capital R going through this crisis.\nWe have further fortified our already strong balance sheet, as Bob Garechana will describe in a moment.\nWe are also preparing in earnest for our properties to operate with fuller staffing as lockdowns across the country are relaxed.\nWe will keep in mind the safety of our employees and residents as we reengineer our business.\nEquity Residential has historically performed well in these downturns, and we would expect this to be no exception.\nWe are optimistic that we will perform well operationally given these circumstances and that we will find opportunities to add high-quality assets for our platform as the economy works its way through this recession.\nFinally, we did withdraw guidance in the release.\nWe are unable to estimate with precision the continuing impact of the pandemic and the timing and character of the reopening process on our business.\nIt makes it impossible for us to give you the high-quality estimates of where our business might go in the near-term that you're used to receiving.\nWe did provide a significant amount of information on April's preliminary results and hope that is helpful.\nSo today, I'm going to provide a quick recap of operations over the past 45 days.\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were off to a very good start for the year.\nOur occupancy was ahead of expectations, and we were well positioned for the primary leasing season.\nAnd then COVID-19 hit, causing us to adjust our operations to this new unprecedented challenge.\nLet me start by acknowledging the dedication and hard work of our employees during these unprecedented times.\nThey inspire me with their ability to quickly adjust operations while keeping an intense focus on our customers, properties, themselves and their families.\nShelter-in-place was mandated by governors in our markets in early to mid-March.\nFor us, this means that our more than 150,000 residents began staying at home 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\nIn response to shelter-in-place, we made some key changes to our operations.\nWe closed our common area amenities, we increased cleaning frequency, we quickly modified our website and our artificial intelligent E-Lead responses to pivot the entire sales process to virtual leasing.\nCapturing video content and conducting the sales process via video conversations allowed the business to continue uninterrupted.\nThis process would have normally taken us several months to accomplish.\nWe also locked the office doors to encourage social distancing but kept the business running as we implemented shift rotations of the staff to reduce the number of employees coming to the property.\nWhen we look back to March 15, we saw our traffic and applications drop 50% compared to the same period in 2019.\nThat being said, we continued to receive over 375 new applications each week through the end of March, which we see as a validation of the new leasing process.\nWith reduced traffic coming through the front door, our focus has been on keeping current residents in place.\nWe are currently offering residents the option to renew without increase.\nOverall, retention in April and May has improved as we are now renewing in the mid- to upper 60% range, which is a 300 basis point improvement from last April and an almost 800 basis point improvement from last May.\nNew York is having the strongest renewal percents of nearly 70% for March, April and May.\nDespite this good retention, our overall occupancy since March 31 has declined by 130 basis points.\nWe expect the occupancy impact to be the most pronounced in the second quarter, setting a new base from which we hope it will improve as shelter-in-place orders are lifted.\nLet me share some color on the performance in April.\nAt the beginning of April, we began to notice an improvement in demand, with both traffic and leasing activity rebounding by almost 30% and actually now trending on par with last year.\nIn fact, we had over 900 applications last week, which is a significant improvement compared to the 375 that we were averaging in late March and very encouraging for us.\nGiven the activity in the last 45 days, we would like to see that volume grow even more to help offset the lower demand that we experienced in March and to match the increased volume of applications that we usually get in May.\nWhat is clear is that our high-quality, well-located portfolio continues to attract future residents.\nWhile the pandemic is certainly a deterrent, people have life reasons that require them to move like changes in jobs or partners.\nOn Page 13, we reported the first quarter and included April monthly pricing statistic by market.\nI would remind everybody this is only one month of data, and that longer periods of time are usually required to show definitive trends.\nMark mentioned the strength and quality of our resident base.\nThis is evident by the fact that we received a very strong 97% of the cash collections in April relative to our March collections.\nThis resilience delivered 5.4% delinquency, which is quite good given these unprecedented circumstances.\nNotably, Seattle and Denver were our markets with the lowest delinquency at below 3% and Los Angeles was the laggard close to 8%.\nThe rest of our markets were centered around the average.\nWe have also taken a cut at looking at property type.\nAnd in most of our markets, our garden-style or more suburban assets have experienced higher delinquency than our mid-rise, high-rise more urban locations.\nAs we move through the continued disruptions created by COVID-19, we remain strategic in our pricing efforts.\nSitting here today, our base rents are down 4% compared to the same week last year.\nLet me give you some color on notable markets.\nOverall, our strongest market is Seattle, which has shown great resilience, with limited delinquency and the best overall revenue growth performance in the portfolio.\nNew York is a bit of a mixed story.\nOn one hand, it has the strongest retention of any market, but it has also not shown the signs of recovery that other markets have with traffic and applications.\nLong term, we expect the New York market to benefit from low new supply and technology firms expanding their presence in the city.\nWe are hoping leasing activity will improve as the hard-hit New York area gets through the worst of the pandemic.\nFinally, we started 2020 anticipating that Los Angeles would have a very challenging year given the new supply pressure.\nCOVID will definitely add to this.\nDespite recent improvements in applications, we expect this market to remain challenged with meaningful pricing pressure that will continue as supply is delivered.\nSo where do we go from here?\nWell, we're now in the early stages of preparing our properties for the new normal.\nWe expect things to shift over time.\nRight now, the new normal is going to be focused on increased deep cleaning standards at the properties; adjustments to the layout of common areas, including fitness and lounges to accommodate social distancing; balancing the capabilities of virtual leasing with the need to engage with our customers; and ultimately, staggering work shifts to ensure that we limit the number of employees on-site at any given time.\nThese are challenging times, but our business is resilient, and our teams are positioned to deliver.\nStarting with our new disclosures.\nWe've modified our disclosures to help better present our business and where it stands today.\nWe do so by providing April operational and collection statistics, by breaking out our same-store performance between residential and nonresidential, a practice that we would expect to continue as the performance from our main residential business, which makes up approximately 96% of total revenues, is likely to diverge meaningfully in the upcoming quarters for our much smaller nonresidential business.\nThis includes modifying the schedules on Pages 10 through 12 of the release.\nAnd finally, by providing an update on liquidity and balance sheet information.\nIn order to accomplish this, we've defined a number of key terms in the back of the release.\nWe hope that these definitions will provide specificity and clarity to our disclosure.\nPart of the new disclosure includes a breakout of nonresidential operations for our same-store portfolio.\nThis is a modest component of our business at 4% of total revenues and consists mostly of ground floor retail and public nonresident parking at our well-located apartment communities.\nGround floor retail makes up about 2/3 of this 4%, with public nonresident parking making up the rest.\nAs you would suspect, a good portion of the retail tenants that rent our space have been significantly impacted by shelter-in-place orders.\nThis is evidenced by the 58% April collection rate for all retail that we disclosed, which, while certainly below what we would have hoped, may be higher than many other retail landlords.\nThe drugstores, bank branches and national chains that occupy a good portion of these spaces have, for the most part, continued to pay rent, while local small business owners have struggled.\nWith nonresident parking, we've seen an approximately 30% decline in parking volume for April, given the lack of public events and increased work-from-home arrangements.\nWe suspect that this may recover as shelter-at-home orders are eventually lifted.\nFinally, a few highlights on our balance sheet.\nWe ended the first quarter with an incredibly strong net debt to normalized EBITDA of 4.9 times and nearly $1.8 billion in liquidity under our revolving credit facility.\nSubsequent to quarter end, we improved this already strong position by closing on a very attractively priced 2.6% or $195 million 10-year GSE loan and by closing on the sale of an asset in the San Francisco Bay Area.\nWith these steps, we sit here today with over 84% of our total NOI unencumbered, about $150 million in commercial paper outstanding and readily available liquidity of over $2.2 billion under our revolving credit facility, which does not mature until 2024.\nThis liquidity is more than sufficient to address our modest level of anticipated development spend, minimal debt maturities in 2020 and to address our next significant debt maturity, which isn't until December of 2021.\nOur balance sheet is in excellent condition to weather the storm and take advantage of opportunities should they present themselves.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The Company undertakes no obligation to update this information.\nWhitestone's second quarter earnings news release and supplemental operating and financial data package have been filed with the SEC, and are available on our website at www.\nwhitestonereit.com, in the Investor Relations section.\nNow over to Jim Mastandrea, our Chairman and CEO to update you on our second quarter results.\nI will focus my remarks on our performance.\nThe demand characteristic around those results, provide some insight on our operations and the strategic direction of the company, then Dave will provide financial insight into the quarter.\nIt is a pleasure to start out telling you we have a great business with great properties and we run them well.\nAs a result, we had a record second quarter 2021, and our focus remains on leasing and more leasing, which fuels our growth and supports our dividends to a core payout ratio of 41%.\nIt also validates the quality of our portfolio drive cash flow, which strengthens our balance sheet and reduces risk.\nOur second quarter leasing activity brought our total occupancy to 89.9% up 120 basis points from the first quarter, highlighting the increased demand from new businesses entering our markets, where an average between 15 to 20 new tenants represent 1% increase in occupancy.\nWe attribute this growing demand to several factors, including the location, quality and maturity of our properties, and tenants expanding their businesses and moving to second and third Whitestone locations.\nOur properties also are benefiting from population migration, and a robust recovery in the Sunbelt markets, where we target properties that are in densely populated high income neighborhoods, located in the fastest growing cities in Texas and Arizona.\nWe achieved net income per share of $0.12 up from $0.03 in the prior quarter, and up from $0.01 from the prior year.\nAnd FFO core per share increase 13% to $0.26 a share from $0.23 in the prior quarter and increased to 18% from $0.22 in the prior year.\nOur increases in per share earnings is derived from adding new essential service focus tenants to our existing base of grocery stores, restaurants, salons, pets, care centers, drugstores, banks and financial advisories, medical out care centers health and wellness and other services.\nWe grew our asset base organically, and by making off market acquisitions of properties that we believe had significant upside and would benefit from applying the principles and the processes of our business model, streamlining property management, reconfiguring and redeveloping our community centers and adding features that attracts additional visits and extends consumer time at the properties.\nThis is best evidenced by almost 18% increase in foot traffic at our 59 centers in the first half of the year.\nAs an example of projects that drive traffic to our centers.\nWe install outdoor misting systems in Arizona for customer comfort during the three months hottest months of the year, where temperatures can average 100 degrees.\nWe currently have five million square feet of space that generates 30.6 million in revenue for Q2.\nWithin each property we curate the tenant mix.\nWith more than 1400 tenants serving customers from the surrounding neighborhoods, our properties stay vibrant 18-hours a day, seven-days a week.\nOne proactive example that is driving increased visits is a rotation among our properties of coffee and cars at our Market Street property in Scottsdale, Arizona, and our Starwood property in Plano, Texas.\nThese venues display high end sports cars, and appeal to a large variety of car lovers and families.\nOn a given Saturday during each month, we accommodate upwards of 150 cars in each location, whose owners and admirers return as customers for our local tenants.\nIncreased foot traffic to our centers is one of the most important drivers of tenant sales and attracts potential new tenants to our properties.\nOur tenants occupy an average of 3,000 square feet of space and provide e-commerce resistance services.\nThey are entrepreneurial businesses, capture sales revenues, as they keep alive the American dream, our tenant profile at it is core, as entrepreneurial as a risk or financial net worth to build their businesses.\nIn the REIT industry, these tenants, however, are referred to as small businesses.\nThey comprise a large percentage of our overall tenant base, and they recovered more quickly from COVID than some larger tenants.\nThey paid their rent and proved their resilience owners and founders of local and regional businesses prioritize their companies because it supports their families, livelihood and their future, which align with our high collection levels.\nAs they recover, Whitestone reported industry-leading collections, Our model was tested and proven during COVID.\nOur culture is about personalizing our service to tenants and our property managers and associates to apply a hands-on approach.\nThis teamwork uniting a Whitestone tenant relationships gives us a competitive advantage over other retail centers in our local neighborhood markets.\nOur culture of service produced leasing spreads on a weighted-average by 6.8% on new and renewal leases in the second quarter.\nWe expect this trend to continue, as we receive annual lease increases of 2% to 3%, on new and renewal tenant leases and pass-through triple net expenses, helping us to hedge against inflation.\nAnother driver of our revenue is increasing our leaseable square footage.\nAdding space to existing properties with no added cost of land and land development is very profitable.\nWe have approximately 230 million of development and redevelopment opportunities in our portfolio that we believe will add significant value.\nOur diversified tenant base also has a notable impact on our balance sheet.\nFor Whitestone, those single tenants can impact our revenues by more than 2.9%.\nDuring the second quarter, as our earnings increase, we strengthened our balance sheet and improved our debt-to-EBITDA ratio by 1.2 turns to 8.2 turns.\nWe have remained committed to lowering our debt service leverage.\nWe also are committed to lowering our G&A as a percent of revenue.\nWe are seeing progress as our asset base expands and our revenues increase.\nIn the second quarter, G&A as a percent of revenue was 14.6%, improving from 15.7% one year-ago.\nIn July, we reactivated our acquisition program and acquired our newest property, Lakeside Market in Dallas as fluid upscale neighborhood of Plano.\nIt is shattered anchor by Texas iconic regional grocer HEB, and it is their first flagship format store in the Dallas market.\nThe purchase price of Lakeside Market was 53.2 million, and it has significant upside from leasing up the current 19% vacant square footage.\nRental rate increases and developing the additional pad sites to add leasable square footage.\nWe currently are working with other sellers on other properties in our pipeline in locations in Dallas, Austin, Houston, and Phoenix.\nPotential sellers who have owned property in our markets for many years understand that they could benefit from spreading their risk over a large pool of quality properties, achieve liquidity to stock and selling, comply converting to stock and selling and receive a tax efficient transaction with Whitestone utilize our OP unit currency.\nIn turn Whitestone benefits by expanding our asset base, lowering our cost of capital and increasing our economies of scale.\nDividends are an important component of the REIT structure.\nOur dividend is well funded, with a payout ratio in the second quarter of 41% of FFO Core.\nI would like to expand more on our dividend and our policy.\nWe have a solid record of paying 131 consecutive monthly dividends since our IPO in 2010 and in total paid our shareholders more than 300 billion in dividends during the same time.\nIn March of 2021, we increased our dividend by $0.01, or 2.4% reflecting our strong recovery.\nOur policy is to evaluate our dividend regularly and consider many factors including our profitable growth, cash flow and progress toward creating long-term shareholder value.\nIn the meantime, we use our excess cash flow to fund internal development opportunities, acquisitions and reducing debt.\nI would also like to discuss how we expect to achieve our long-term value goals and increase our valuation.\nOur primary focus of creating and driving long-term real estate value is integral in everything we do.\nAs we lease up our portfolio, bring our development land on stream, it makes your dishes acquisitions, the intrinsic embed value in our assets will begin to be reflected in our valuation.\nWhile the value we are creating is not yet fully reflected in the market, we trade at a significant discount to our true valuation.\nWe know that as we continue to grow occupancy, revenue and cash flow, it will be recognized by the investment community.\nAchieving our long-term goals is a function of our assets.\nOur portfolio of quality real estate is spread over great markets and demand for space in our centers, as they are nearly full is highly valued.\nAnd our rental income produces a solid, stable cash flow.\nOur great locations, quality of properties and strong operating performance is notable in our success and extracting value from our properties, along with our ability of seeking and closing new acquisitions from our deep pipeline of properties will continue to keep us at the forefront of our industry as we grow.\nIn summary 10-years ago, we develop and began to build a contrarians business model with entrepreneurial tenants that would be e-commerce resistant.\nWe started with a relatively small asset base of approximately 150 million and has expanded to 59 properties in eight major cities in over 1,400 tenants and approximately 1.5 billion in real estate and value today.\nWe continue to be passionate in executing our plan and are pleased to deliver our second quarter results.\nI would now like to turn things over to Dave Holeman to provide a more detailed results or financial performance.\nI appreciate the opportunity to share some great results for the second quarter.\nDuring the quarter, our best-in-class geographic concentration and strategically designed tenant mix have produced strong top-line and bottom-line growth, and our long-term focus and day-to-day execution have allowed us to make significant progress toward our long-term goals of scaling our infrastructure and improving our overall debt leverage.\nThe MSAs that we operate in, continue to see significant population migration and corporate relocations, producing jobs from other areas of the country.\nThis is best evidenced by second quarter and year-to-date year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter top-line revenue growth, year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter property net operating income growth and year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter net income and FFO core per share growth.\nThis growth is driven by our strong leasing activity, resulting in increased occupancy levels and strong positive leasing spreads.\nThe growth is driven by reduced debt levels and borrowing costs, greater scale of our G&A infrastructure and asset sales at attractive prices.\nTotal revenue for the second quarter was 30.6 million, up 5% from the first quarter and up 11% from the second quarter of 2020.\nThe revenue growth was driven by sequential 1.2% increase in occupancy, and a 0.7% improvement, compared to Q2 2020.\nWe are also benefiting from our ABR per square foot, rising 1.2% sequentially, and 1.9% from a year-ago, along with lower uncollectibility reserves.\nProperty net operating income was $22 million for the quarter, up 4% sequentially and 10% from the second quarter of 2020.\nOur Q2 same-store net operating income increased 8.4% from Q2 of 2020.\nNet income for the quarter was $0.12 per share, up from $0.03 per share in the first quarter and $0.01 per share in the prior year quarter.\nFunds from operations core was $0.26 per share in the quarter, an increase of 13% from the first quarter, and an increase of 18% from the 2020 second quarter.\nOur leasing activity in the quarter continued to build on our very strong first quarter with 35 new leases, representing 75,000 square feet of newly occupied square footage.\nOur new lease activity for the six months is 100% higher on a square foot basis than 2020, and 40% higher than 2019.\nLeasing spreads on a GAAP basis have been positive 8% over the last 12-months, and second quarter leasing spreads increased by 3.1% on new leases, and 7.9% on renewal leases signed.\nOur annualized base rent per square foot on a GAAP basis at the end of the quarter grew 1.2% to $19.95 from $19.71 in the previous quarter, and a 1.9% increase from a year-ago.\nTotal occupancy stood at 89.9%, all of our markets saw increased quarter-over-quarter occupancy, led by our Dallas market at a 3.6% increase.\nAustin and Phoenix both grew 0.8% from the first quarter, and Houston grew point 6% from the first quarter.\nOur collections were very strong for the quarter returning to normal pre-COVID levels.\nReflecting the high collection levels, our reserve for uncollectible revenue for the quarter was $143,000, or approximately 1.5% of our revenue, down from 529,000 or 1.8% of revenue in the first quarter, and 2.3 million or 7.9% of revenue in the second quarter of 2020.\nOur total tenant receivables improved 8.4% from the first quarter and 13.5% from a year-ago.\nOur interest expense was 5% lower than a year-ago, reflecting our lower debt levels.\nAt quarter end, we had 21.3 million in accrued rents and accounts receivable.\nIncluded in this amount is 16.4 million of accrued straight line rents and 1.5 million of agreed upon deferrals.\nOur agreed upon deferral balance is down 34.4% from year end, reflecting tenants honoring their payment plans.\nTurning to our balance sheet, since early last year, we have implemented various measures to strengthen our liquidity.\nOur total net debt is 601.3 million down 48 million from a year-ago, improving our debt to gross book real estate cost ratio to 52% and improvement from 56% a year-ago.\nOur debt-to-EBITDA ratio also improved 1.2 times from the first quarter to 8.2 times.\nReflecting our post quarter acquisition and our continued focus on deleveraging, we expect our debt-to-EBIT ratio to be approximately eight by year end, reflecting significant progress on our long-term debt reduction goals.\nAt quarter end, we have 160.5 million of undrawn capacity, and 55.1 million of borrowing availability under our credit facility.\nDuring the second quarter, we sold approximately three million common shares under our ATM program, resulting in 25.4 million in net proceeds to the company.\nAfter the quarter, we acquired Lakeside market in Plano, Texas for 53.2 million financing the acquisition with approximately 30 million in equity, 10 million in debt from our corporate credit facility, and 13 million from cash flow and cash on hand.\nThese results are a testament to the strength of Whitestone's strategic geographic focus and business models.\nWe are encouraged by the acquisition of Lakeside Market and look forward to continued delivery of value to all of Whitestone's stakeholders.\nWith that, we will now take questions.\nOperator, please open the lines.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:David Zalman will lead off with a review of the highlights for the recent quarter.\nHe will be followed by Asylbek Osmonov who will review some of our recent financial statistics, and Tim Timanus, who will discuss our lending activities, including asset quality.\nDuring the call, interested parties may participate live by following the instructions that will be provided by our call moderator, Jamie.\nBefore we begin, let me make the usual disclaimers.\nWe are pleased with our second quarter 2020 results and with completing the operational integration of Legacy on schedule in early June.\nThe team members from Legacy, now Prosperity, have been excellent and we could not have achieved such a smooth integration without their commitment and efforts.\nWe remain excited about the combination and look forward to continuing to build the best bank anywhere.\nFor the second quarter of 2020, we showed impressive returns on average tangible common equity of 19.98% annualized and on average assets of 1.61%.\nOur earnings were $130.9 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared with $82 million for the same period in 2019, an increase of $48.6 million or 59.1%.\nOur diluted earnings per share were $1.41 for the second quarter of 2020 compared with the $1.18 for the same period in 2019, an increase of 19.5%.\nThe second quarter 2020 earnings per share of $1.41 includes a $0.22 income tax benefit, a $0.06 charge for merger related expenses and a $0.03 charge for the writedown of fixed assets related to the merger and some CRA funds.\nIn summary, it was $0.22 in benefit to earnings and $0.09 in inductions mostly related to the merger.\nLoans at June 30, 2020 were $21.025 billion, an increase of $10.4 billion or 98.6% compared with $10.587 billion at June 30, 2019.\nOur linked quarter loans increased $1.898 billion or 9.9% from the $19.127 billion at 31, 2020, of which $1.392 billion were SBA Paycheck Protection Program, sometimes referred to as PPP loans.\nMortgage warehouse loans also increased $843 million in the second quarter 2020 compared to the first quarter.\nOur core loans, excluding held for sale and the warehouse purchase program and the PPP loans, decreased $311 million.\nHowever, a portion of this decrease resulted from loans that were intentionally removed that were identified in our due diligence of Legacy.\nWe saw strong loan growth in the first part of the second quarter but that slowed as business shut down or reduced operations in response to various government orders.\nOur deposits at June 30, 2020 were $26.153 billion, an increase of $9.265 billion or 54.9% compared with $16.888 billion at June 30, 2019.\nOur linked quarter deposits increased $2.326 billion or 9.8% from the $23.826 billion at March 31, 2020.\nHistorically, our deposits are lower in the second quarter of the year compared with the first quarter and then begin to increase in the third and fourth quarters for us.\nBut this year, second quarter deposits are higher.\nA large portion is from the PPP loans as well as reduction in customer spending and customer saving [Phonetic] right now.\nWith regard to asset quality, it's always been one of the primary focuses of our bank and always will be.\nI have always said you will like us in the good times but love us in the bad times, and this is playing out to be true again during this pandemic and oil price downturn.\nNonperforming assets totaled $77.9 million or 28 basis points of quarterly average interest earning assets at June 30, 2020.\nWe continue to provide relief to our loan customers through loan extensions and deferrals when possible.\nFor the second quarter of 2020, net charge-offs were $13 million.\nOf these charge-offs, $12.4 million were related to PCD loans with specific reserves of $28.5 million that we acquired in the merger.\nSo far, $16.1 million in specific reserves were released to the general reserve in addition to the $10 million provision for loan losses for the second quarter.\nM&A activity has subsided during this pandemic.\nAlthough there are -- there are some conversations and probably a few deals working, we believe that the M&A activity will start to pick up as businesses reopen and economic activity increases.\nSize does seem to matter now, especially with lower net interest margins, the need for increased technology and the potential for additional regulatory burden if there is a change in the administration.\nAn example is the increased volume at our customer call center, with many older customers wanting to set up online and mobile banking that have previously not been interested in doing so.\nThe Blue Chip consensus forecast estimates that fourth quarter 2020 GDP will end at a negative 5.6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019.\nHowever, they're forecasting a positive 4.8% GDP for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with the fourth quarter of 2020.\nThey are also forecasting an unemployment rate of 9.4% for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with unemployment rate of 6.9% for the fourth quarter of 2021.\nBased on these estimates, 2021 looks bright.\nWe are positive about our Company's future.\nWhile our operating environment and economy are changing frequently, we remain focused on addressing whatever comes our way and taking care of our customers and associates.\nProsperity continues to focus on building core relationships, maintaining sound asset quality and operating the bank in efficient manner while investing in ever-changing technology and product distribution channels.\nWe intend to continue to grow the Company both organically and through mergers and acquisitions.\nWe want to develop people to be the next generation of leaders, make every customer experience easy and enjoyable and operate in a safe and sound manner.\nLet me turn over our discussion to Asylbek, our Chief Financial Officer, to discuss some of the specific financial results we achieved.\nNet interest income before provision for credit losses for the three months ended June 30, 2020 was $259 million compared to $154.8 million for the same period in 2019, an increase of $104.1 million or 67.2%.\nThe increase was primarily due to the merger with LegacyTexas in November 2019 and loan discount accretion of $24.3 million in the second quarter 2020.\nThe net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was 3.69% for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 3.16% for the same period in 2019 and 3.81% for the quarter ended March 31, 2020.\nExcluding purchase accounting adjustments, the core net interest margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 was 3.33% compared to 3.14% for the same period in 2019 and 3.36% for the quarter ended March 31, 2020.\nNon-interest income was $25.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $30 million for the same period in 2019.\nThe current quarter non-interest income was affected by $3.9 million in writedown of certain assets and general impacts of COVID-19 pandemic.\nNon-interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2020 was $134.4 million compared to $80.8 million for the same period in 2019.\nThe increase was primarily due to the merger with LegacyTexas and one-time merger related expenses of $7.5 million due to the core system conversion that occurred in June.\nIn addition to this merger-related expenses, the second quarter results reflected elevated expenses related to increased mortgage activities.\nWith the core system conversion and operational integration process behind us, we do not anticipate any significant merger related expenses going forward, and we expect to start realizing the remaining cost savings beginning in the third quarter of 2020.\nWe expect this additional savings to be about $7 million to $9 million per quarter.\nThis, combined with the savings realized in the first and second quarter, will be in line with our previously stated 25% cost savings in non-interest expense.\nThe efficiency ratio was 46.56% for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 43.74% for the same period in 2019 and 42.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2020.\nExcluding merger related expenses of $7.5 million, the efficiency ratio was 43.97%

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:With me on the call today are Denise Paulonis, our new President and Chief Executive Officer and Marlo Cormier, Chief Financial Officer.\nI'm thrilled to be here with a little over a month under my belt and I'm looking forward to meeting and talking to our analysts and shareholders in the coming months.\nHaving served in the Sally Beauty board since 2018, I'm fortunate to be bringing the first hand perspective and a deep working knowledge of the business on day one.\nI see a significant opportunity to utilize my leadership skills and retail and finance background to drive the business into a new era of profitable growth, capitalizing on all the new capabilities enabled by the transformation of the business over the past four years.\nVirtually every aspect of the company's infrastructure has been retooled across technology, marketing, merchandising, supply chain, HR, finance, and talent, creating a robust platform from which we will grow.\nI'm incredibly proud of our exceptional team who took on this challenge and helped us evolve into a modern dynamic omnichannel beauty retailer that is now set up for long-term success.\nBefore talking a bit more about our future, let me share a few highlights from last year.\nIn fiscal 2021 full year net sales grew 10%, gross margins exceeded 50% and adjusted earnings per share was up over 97%.\nAdditionally, we generated strong cash flow from operations of $382 million.\nWe delivered consistent performance throughout the year and concluded fiscal 2021 with fourth quarter results ahead of expectations, reflecting strong operational execution.\nWe're particularly pleased to see ongoing momentum and consistency across the business despite the various impact of the pandemic.\nAs we embark on our new fiscal year, our mission to recruit and retain color customers remains a core component of our roadmap and continued tailwinds around self-expression through hair, product sustainability and innovation and the growing number of independent stylists continue to reinforce the strength of our color and care business.\nPutting the customer first and enhancing their experience with us is critical to our success.\nWe're continuing to prioritize the customer through personalization, inspiration, education and training.\nWe're also focused on creating the easiest shopping experience for our customers through our robust omnichannel platform and multiple fulfillment options our customers can get product, how they want it and when they want it, faster than ever before.\nAgainst that backdrop, we'll be focusing on four strategic growth pillars to drive the top line in fiscal 2022.\nLeveraging our digital platform, driving loyalty and personalization, delivering product innovation and advancing our supply chain.\nFirst, I'll talk about digital.\nAs we increasingly become the unrivaled forced for color inspiration, education and training, our goal is to create an easy, reliable omnichannel platform for our DIY enthusiasts and stylists.\nAt BSG, we completed a critical set of strategic initiatives in fiscal 2021 that positioned us to become the go-to-platform for stylists.\nWe redesigned the CosmoProf website, introduced new value-added services around ordering and rolled out focus into our delivery.\nIn addition, we'll be connecting our store network to the CosmoProf app this month to further enhance focus into our delivery.\nIn short, our BSG stylists can now access everything sold by CosmoProf on their phone and within two hours.\nBringing together all these initiatives, truly positions BSG as a compelling resource for the stylist community, providing them with the tools they need to run their businesses most efficiently and profitably.\nAt Sally, we've seen a positive customer response to our expanded fulfillment model and we're continuing to gain traction across BOPIS, ship from store and rapid two-hour delivery.\nIn our most recent quarter, Sally U.S. and Canada stores fulfilled 34% of e-commerce sales as BOPIS fulfilled the 34% of e-commerce sales, as BOPIS comprised 22% and ship from store accounted for 8%.\nRapid two-hour delivery was launched in the middle of the quarter and represented 4% of Sally U.S. and Canada E-commerce sales.\nAdditionally, the adoption of these new fulfillment options exhibits our power of scaling our new tools and capabilities to meet the strong desire our customers have for this incredible convenience.\nWe're also laser focused on improving in stocks across our store and DC network through our new JDA platform.\nSo our customers are able to access our inventory.\nHowever, they choose to shop and get most products in just two to three hours.\nAs we continue to scale and optimize a full suite of omnichannel services for both our Sally and BSG customers, we believe e-commerce can reach 15% or more of sales in the coming years.\nIn fiscal 2021, global e-commerce sales penetration was just over 7%.\nImportantly, we know that an omnichannel customer at Sally U.S. and Canada spends approximately 75% to 80% more with us annually than a brick and mortar customer.\nSo this is not just a sales channel shift, it is a tremendous opportunity for growth.\nMoving now to our second growth pillar: loyalty and personalization, which [Technical Issues] directly to our digital strategy.\nAs many of you know, the rise of personalization has changed the table stakes in retail.\nWith our rapidly growing loyalty program and a new push toward personalization, we have a significant opportunity to drive and increase customer engagement in sales.\nAt Sally U.S. and Canada, approximately 74% of our fourth quarter sales came from our loyalty program.\nAt BSG, because stylist have to register a shop with us, we have data on 100% of our customers.\nAdditionally, approximately 8% of our BSG's sales in the quarter came from our Rewards Credit Card that was launched about a year ago.\nThese are remarkable numbers and we've only scratched the surface in leveraging this asset.\nIn fiscal 2022, we'll be utilizing data science to engage our customers with inspiration, education and personalized offers at every touch point.\nAt Sally, this includes recommendations on product usage, reminders to replenish on time and incorporating DIY an educational component at key moments in their journey.\nAt BSG, this mean showcasing new product arrivals, reminding stylist to restock their backbar and notifications to replenish key styles products.\nWe believe these actions will drive higher customer lifetime value by minimizing attrition, growing spend per transaction and increasing purchase frequency.\nFiscal 2022 will also see us investing further in digital marketing and social media campaigns to drive traffic and sales.\nOur current marketing campaign YOU by Sally continues to generate a tremendous amount of attention from customers and the trade.\nCelebrating the transformative power of hair color, the campaign has received extensive coverage from Beauty editors and generated millions of views on social media.\nOur third growth pillar is product innovation.\nFiscal 2022 will be highlighted by a big infusion of innovation across Sally and BSG and we'll be driving a large part of that ourselves.\nThe pipeline of new products is robust and includes our own and third-party brands across multiple categories.\nWe will continue to emphasize and support sustainable and clean products, which are increasingly being selected and commanding a premium from customers.\nImportantly, we believe our authority in color and care provides a logical path and powerful platform for standing up new brands that go beyond our four walls.\nThe first initiative is our new exclusive brand line of vivid colors of Sally called Strawberry Leopard launched to positive response in October, this is a useful Gen Z focused brand that speaks to our ability to increasingly attract younger consumers through value of self-expression.\nConcurrently with the launch, we created an individual digital platform for Strawberry Leopard that immersed the consumers in the brand ethos, enables a direct shopping experience.\nAs the brand gains velocity, we expect to unlock potential opportunities for expansion into additional distribution channels, including math, beauty and third party e-commerce.\nThe innovation pipeline at BSG is equally exciting, starting with Olaplex's new toning shampoo that just launched in September.\nOlaplex is a great example of a high-profile brand that continues to innovate and remains a key partner to us.\nLooking ahead, we're continuing to focus on being at the forefront of innovation with new product and brand launches to excite the consumer planned for 2022 and beyond.\nTurning now to our fourth growth pillar, another critical element of our focus on putting the customer first is supercharging our supply chain to ensure that we are in stock in color and care every time.\nA great deal of the heavy lifting has been done and we're now executing the final phase of JDA implementation.\nThe system is up and running in all BSG's locations and the majority of our Sally stores.\nWe're currently rolling out JDA to our remaining locations and fully integrating with our North Texas, DC.\nOnce completed, we'll have a highly automated integrated network with the best-in-class capabilities across inventory forecasting, localized assortment, pricing and promotions and in stock.\nWe believe that our initiatives underneath four growth pillars will allow us to drive top line growth of 3% to 4% and generate strong operating cash flows this year.\nThis reflects our ability to maintain strong gross margins, while mitigating inflationary pressures through careful cost controls, pricing levers and store optimization.\nTo that end, our 90-store optimization pilot remains in progress.\nWe are continuing to gather and analyze data from the sample and I'm pleased to note that we are significantly exceeding our sales transfer targets.\nIn fiscal 2022, we expect to launch a multi-year program designed to maximize the value of our large store portfolio, while offsetting inflationary headwinds.\nBy rationalizing the fleet, we can improve productivity and profitability, while delivering a convenient omnichannel experience that benefits our customers.\nWe're entering fiscal 2022 with solid infrastructure, a well-defined roadmap for growth and favorable industry dynamics that support the significant opportunity in front of us.\nIn the coming months, I look forward to working with the team to build out additional growth opportunities that will fuel our business and create meaningful shareholder value in 2023 and beyond.\nWe're pleased to conclude the year with strong fourth quarter performance, which exceeded the expectations we provided on our last earnings call and reflect strong consumer demand coming out of the pandemic.\nTopline growth, solid gross margins and careful cost control, drove strong earnings and cash flow.\nNet sales increased 3.4% and same-store sales rose 2.1% reflecting strong consumer demand with only some minor impact from pandemic related restrictions in Europe.\nFourth quarter traffic and conversion trends remain consistent with what we've experienced throughout the pandemic.\nTraffic was down, but units per transaction, average unit retail and average ticket all increased versus prior year.\nBasically, customers are still shopping less frequently, but are buying more when they transact with us.\nGlobal e-commerce sales were $71 million, representing 7.1% of total net sales as compared to $63 million in the prior year.\nThe year-over-year increase reflects ongoing strength as we continue to scale our digital capabilities and implement our strategic initiatives around fulfillment and customer engagement.\nLooking at gross profit, we achieved fourth quarter gross margin of 50.6%, reflecting our ability to maintain solid performance above our 50% target level.\nOn a year-over-year basis, gross margin deleveraged by 50 basis points, reflecting a higher mix of BSG sales, which carried a lower margin profile in the quarter.\nMoving to operating expense, fourth quarter SG&A totaled $387 million, up 5% versus a year ago, primarily reflecting higher labor costs and planned increases in marketing spend.\nLooking at the new fiscal year, we anticipate that SG&A dollars will increase and rate will be up slightly on a year-over-year basis.\nOur expectation takes into account increased labor and freight costs, increased expense planned in our international markets related to a full reopening in 2022, as well as investments across our growth pillars that Denise discussed earlier.\nWe believe our store optimization program will serve as an important offset to wage inflation beginning in the latter part of 2022 and then more significantly in 2023.\nTurning now to earnings.\nWe delivered strong profitability in Q4.\nAdjusted operating margin came in at 11.7%, adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.5% and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased to $0.64.\nLooking at segment results.\nAt Sally Beauty, we saw strong consumer demand in the U.S. Same-store sales increased 2.3% and e-commerce sales totaled $29 million for the quarter.\nFor Sally U.S. and Canada, the color category increased 4%, while vivid colors grew 5%, representing 28% of our total color sales as comparisons normalized to prior year.\nOther categories also performed well.\nStyling tools increased by 31% and textured hair was up 16%.\nGross margin declined slightly at Sally, which reflected strong product margins, offset by higher distribution and freight costs.\nSegment operating margin increased to 18.1% compared to 18% in the prior year.\nIn the BSG segment, same-store sales increased 1.7% as salons returned to more normalized capacity levels in virtually all of our U.S. markets.\nE-commerce sales totaled $42 million for the quarter.\nThe color category grew 9%, hair care was up 5% driven by Olaplex and styling tools increased 9%.\nGross margin and profitability at BSG reflected same dynamics we saw in Q3.\nSpecifically, we're experiencing higher sales from our larger volume, full service customers coming out of the pandemic and those customers tend to be lower margin.\nSegment operating margin was down slightly versus prior year at 13.3%.\nMoving to the balance sheet and cash flow.\nWe ended fiscal 2021 in strong financial condition.\nFor the full fiscal year, we generated $308 million of free cash flow and retired approximately $420 million of debt.\nWe ended the quarter with $401 million of cash and cash equivalents and a zero balance outstanding under our asset-based revolving line of credit.\nInventories at September 30th totaled $871 million, up 7% versus a year ago as we reinvested in our inventory levels coming out of the disruptions from the pandemic.\nIn addition, we were pleased that our strong performance over the course of fiscal 2021 helped drive our net debt leverage ratio down to 1.69 times at the end of September.\nNow turning to our full year fiscal 2022 guidance.\nWe are confident about how the business is positioned heading into 2022 and we expect to achieve the following: net sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%, net store count to decrease by approximately 1% to 2% driven primarily by Sally U.S. stores as we continue to optimize our portfolio.\nGross margin expansion of 40 to 60 basis points, GAAP operating margin growth of 90 to 110 basis points, and adjusted operating margin approximately flat to 2021.\nThe business has demonstrated remarkable resilience during the past 18 plus months and our teams have done a terrific job of navigating the dynamic macro environment.\nAs the business continues to strengthen and generate strong cash flows, you can expect to see us prioritize strategic growth investments, as well as return cash to shareholders through the restart of our share buyback program.\nAs a reminder, during the fourth quarter, our Board of Directors approved an extension of our share repurchase program through September of 2025, which currently has over $700 million remaining under the authorization.\nAdditionally, we are evaluating opportunities to further optimize our capital structure, which could result in incremental interest expense savings.\nFinally, I want to call out a housekeeping item related to disclosure.\nBeginning in fiscal 2022, we will be replacing our same-store sales metric with comparable sales, which will include sales from our full-service divisions and franchise operations including any related e-commerce sales.\nIn 2022, for each quarter.\nWe will disclose both current and prior-year comparable sales under the new definition.\nNow, I'll ask the operator to open the call for Q&A.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm joined today by Tom Greco, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Shepherd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nAs always, we hope that you and your families are healthy and safe.\nTheir continued dedication to provide outstanding service to our customers allowed us to deliver another quarter of top line sales growth, adjusted margin expansion and a double-digit increase in earnings per share.\nWe've been investing in both our team and our business over multiple years to transform and better leverage Advance's assets.\nIn Q3, this helped enable us to comp the comp on top of our strongest quarterly comparable store sales growth of 2020.\nSpecifically, we delivered comp store sales growth of 3.1%, while sustaining an identical two-year stack of 13.3% compared with Q2.\nAs expected, this was led by the continued recovery of our professional business and a gradual improvement in key urban markets.\nBy putting DIY consumers and Pro customers at the center of every decision we make, we've been able to respond quickly to evolving needs.\nIn Q3, this was highlighted by an overall channel shift back to Professional and a return to stores for DIYers.\nWithin Professional, we're seeing increasing strength in certain geographies, which, like the rest of the country last year as the ongoing return to office of professional workers in large urban markets, catches up with the rest of the country.\nOur diversified digital and physical asset base has enabled us to respond rapidly to these changing channel dynamics in the current environment.\nIn addition, we also delivered significant improvements in our adjusted gross margin rate of 246 basis points, led by our category management initiatives.\nOur adjusted SG&A costs as a percentage of net sales were 209 basis points higher as we lapped a unique quarter in Q3 2020.\nAs we've discussed over the past year, our SG&A costs were much lower than normal in Q2 and Q3 of 2020.\nThis was due to an unusually high DIY sales mix and actions we took last year during the initial stages of the pandemic, which were not repeated.\nOverall, we delivered adjusted operating income margin expansion of 37 basis points to 10.4% versus Q3 2020.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.21 increased 21.6% compared with Q3 2020 and 31% compared with the same period of 2019.\nOur year-to-date adjusted earnings per share are up approximately 50% compared with 2020.\nYear-to-date, our balance sheet remains strong with a 19% increase in free cash flow to $734 million, while returning a record $953 million to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and quarterly cash dividend.\nConsistent with the front half of the year, there were several industry-related factors, coupled with operational improvements, contributing to our sales growth and margin expansion in Q3.\nThe car park continues to grow slightly.\nThe fleet is aging and perhaps most importantly vehicle miles driven continue to improve versus both 2020 and 2019.\nMore broadly, the chip shortage continues to impact availability of new vehicles and is contributing to a surge in used car sales.\nThis benefits our industry as consumers are repairing and maintaining their vehicles longer.\nAs we all know, over the last 18 months, the pandemic changed consumer behavior across our industry, which led to a surge in DIY omnichannel growth in 2020, while the Professional business declined.\nHowever, as the economy continues to reopen, with miles driven steadily increasing, our Professional business is now consistently exceeding pre-pandemic levels as discussed last quarter.\nRegional performance was led by the Southwest and West.\nCategory growth was led by brakes, motor oil and filters as miles driven reliant categories improved versus the softer 2020.\nWe also saw continued strength in DieHard batteries, which led the way on a two-year stack basis.\nEach of these categories performed well as a result of the diligent planning between our merchant and supply chain teams, enabling a strong competitive position despite global supply chain disruptions.\nAt the same time, we experienced challenges in Q3 as we strategically transitioned tens of thousands of undercar and engine management SKUs to own brand.\nImportantly, these in-stock positions are now significantly improved and we're confident these initiatives will help drive future margin expansion.\nOverall, comp sales were positive in all three periods of Q3, led by Professional.\nDIY omnichannel delivered slightly positive comp growth in Q3, while lapping high double-digit growth than the prior year.\nWithin Professional, we navigated a very challenging global supply chain environment to allow us to say yes to our customers.\nThe investments we've made in our supply chain, inventory positioning and in our dynamic assortment tool help put us in a favorable position competitively.\nWe've implemented the dynamic assortment tool in all company-owned US stores as well as over 800 independent locations.\nOur MyAdvance portal and embedded Advance Pro catalog continues to be a differentiator for us, while driving online traffic.\nOur online sales to Professional customers continues to grow as we strengthen the speed and functionality of Advance Pro.\nWe remain committed to providing our industry-leading assortment of parts for all Professional customers.\nThis will help enable us to grow first call status and increase share of wallet in a very fragmented market.\nIn addition, we expanded DieHard to our Professional customers.\nFollowing a recent independent consumer survey, DieHard stake disclaims as America's most trusted auto battery.\nDuring Q3, we announced a multi-year agreement with our national customer Bridgestone to sell DieHard batteries in more than 2,200 tire and vehicle service centers across the United States.\nWith this systemwide rollout during Q3, we replaced their previous battery provider, making us the exclusive battery supplier across all Bridgestone locations.\nIn terms of our independent business, we added 16 net new independent Carquest stores in the quarter, bringing our total to 44 net new this year.\nWe continue to grow our independent business through differentiated offerings for our Carquest partners, including our new Carquest by Advance banner program, which we announced earlier this month.\nAs we continue to build and strengthen the Advance brand and our DIY business, Carquest by Advance adds DIY relevance for our Carquest-branded independent partners, while providing incremental traffic and margin opportunities.\nWe've recently enrolled this new initiative out to our independent partners and look forward to further expansion over time for both new and existing Carquest independents.\nTransitioning to DIY omnichannel, comparable store sales were slightly positive in Q3.\nAs you'll recall, our DIY omnichannel business reported strong double-digit comp sales growth in Q3 2020.\nWe continue to enhance our offerings and execute our long-term strategy to differentiate our DIY business and increased market share.\nIn Q3, we continue to leverage our Speed Perks loyalty program as VIP membership grew by 13% and our number of ELITE members, representing the highest tier of customer spend, increased 21%.\nLast year, the launch of our Advance Same Day suite of services helped enable a huge surge in e-commerce growth.\nThis year, as DIYers return to our stores, in-store sales growth led our DIY sales growth.\nPart of this was expected due to a planned reduction in inefficient online discounts, which significantly increased gross margins.\nTurning to margin expansion.\nWe again increased our adjusted operating income margin in the quarter.\nLike Q2, this was driven by category management actions within gross margin, where our key initiatives played a role.\nFirst, we are realizing benefits from our new strategic pricing tools and capabilities.\nLike other companies, we're experiencing higher-than-expected inflation.\nHowever, our team has been able to respond rapidly in this dynamic environment as industry pricing remains rational.\nBehind strategic sourcing, vendor income was positive versus the previous year with continued strong sales growth.\nFinally, double-digit revenue growth in own brand outpaced our overall growth in the quarter as we expanded the Carquest brand into new category.\nCarquest products have a lower price per unit than comparable branded products, which reduced comp and net sales growth in the quarter as expected.\nAt the same time, the margin rate for own brands is much higher and contributed to the Q3 adjusted gross margin expansion.\nShifting to supply chain.\nWe continue to make progress on our productivity initiatives.\nIn Q3, the benefits from these initiatives were more than offset by widely documented disruptions and inflationary pressure within the global supply chain.\nAs a result, we did not leverage supply chain in the quarter.\nWe completed the rollout of cross-banner replenishment, or CBR, for the originally planned group of stores in the quarter.\nThe completion of this milestone is driving cost savings through a reduction in stem miles from our DCs to stores.\nOver the course of our implementation, our team identified additional stores that will be added over time.\nSecondly, we're continuing the implementation of our new Warehouse Management System, or WMS. This is helping to deliver further improvements in fill rate, on-hand accuracy and productivity.\nWe successfully transitioned to our new WMS in approximately 36% of our distribution center network as measured by unit volume.\nAs previously communicated, we follow WMS with a new Labor Management System, or LMS, which drive standardization and productivity.\nWe are on track to complete the WMS and LMS implementations by the end of 2023 as discussed in April.\nFurther, our consolidation efforts to integrate WORLDPAC and Autopart International, known as AI, are also on track to be completed by early next year.\nThis is enabling accelerated growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A savings.\nGross margin expansion here comes behind the expanded distribution of AI's high margin owned brand products, such as shocks and struts, to the larger WORLDPAC customer base.\nFinally, as we expand our store footprint, we're also enhancing our supply chain capabilities on the West Coast with the addition of a much larger and more modern DC in San Bernardino.\nThis facility will serve as the consolidation point for supplier shipments for the Western US and enable rapid e-commerce delivery.\nIn addition, we began to work to consolidate our DC network in the Greater Toronto area.\nTwo separate distribution centers, one Carquest and one WORLDPAC will be transitioned into a single brand-new facility that will allow us to better serve growing demand in the Ontario market.\nWe continue to execute our initiatives, both sales and profit per store along with the reduction of corporate SG&A.\nAs previewed on our Q2 call, we also faced both planned and unplanned inflationary cost pressure versus the prior year in Q3.\nSG&A headwinds include higher than planned store labor cost per hour, higher incentive compensation and increased delivery costs associated with the recovery of our Professional business.\nJeff will discuss these and other SG&A details in a few minutes.\nWe remain on track with our sales and profit per store initiative, including our average sales per store objective of $1.8 million per store by 2023.\nIn terms of new locations year-to-date, we've opened 19 stores, six new WORLDPAC branches and converted 44 net new locations to the Carquest independent family.\nThis puts our net new locations at 69, including stores, branches and independents during the first three quarters.\nSeparately, we're actively working to convert the 109 locations in California we announced in April.\nHowever, we're experiencing construction-related delays, primarily due to a much slower-than-normal permitting process.\nThis is attributable to more stringent guidelines associated with COVID-19, which were exacerbated by the surge of the Delta variant.\nWe now expect the majority of the store openings planned for 2021 to shift into 2022.\nAs a result, we're incurring start-up costs within SG&A for the balance of the year, while realizing less than planned revenue and income.\nThe good news is, we remain confident that once converted, these stores will be accretive to our growth trajectory.\nThe final area of margin expansion is reducing our corporate and other SG&A costs.\nWe began to realize some of the cost benefits related to the restructuring of our corporate functions announced earlier this year, in addition to savings from our continued focus on team member safety.\nIn Q3, we saw a 22% reduction in our total recordable injury rate compared with the prior year.\nOur lost time injury rate improved 14% compared with the same period in 2020.\nOur focus on team member safety is only one component of our ESG agenda at Advance.\nOur vision advancing a world in motion is demonstrated by the objective we outlined last April to deliver top quartile total shareholder return in the 2021 through 2023 timeframe.\nWhile delivering this goal, we're also focused on ESG.\nAs part of this commitment, we launched our first materiality assessment earlier this year to help prioritize ESG initiatives.\nDuring Q3, we completed this assessment and are working to finalize the findings.\nThe results will be incorporated in our 2021 Corporate Sustainability Report, which we expect to publish in mid-2022.\nBefore turning the call over to Jeff, I want to recognize all team members and generous customers for their contribution to our recent American Heart Association campaign.\nThis year, we introduced a new technology solution in stores that allows customers to round up at the point of sale.\nThis made it even easier for customers to participate and helped us achieve a record-setting campaign of $1.7 million.\nThe mission of this organization is important to all of us across the Advance family.\nIn Q3, our net sales increased 3.1% to $2.6 billion.\nAdjusted gross profit margin improved 246 basis points to 46.2%, primarily the result of our ongoing category management initiatives, including strategic pricing, strategic sourcing, own brand expansion and favorable product mix.\nConsistent with last quarter, these were partially offset by inflationary product and supply chain costs as well as an unfavorable channel mix.\nIn the quarter, same SKU inflation was approximately 3.6%, which was part of [Phonetic] our plan entering the year and was by far the largest headwind we had to overcome within gross profit.\nWe're working with all our supplier partners to mitigate costs where possible.\nYear-to-date, adjusted gross margin improved 184 basis points compared with the same period of 2020.\nAs expected, our Q3 SG&A expenses increased due to several factors we discussed earlier in the year.\nAs a percent of net sales, our adjusted SG&A deleveraged by 209 basis points, driven primarily by labor costs, which included a meaningful cost per hour increase as well as higher incentive compensation compared to the prior year.\nIn addition, we incurred higher delivery expenses related to serving our Professional customers and approximately $10 million in start-up costs related to the conversion of our California locations in Q3.\nYear-to-date, SG&A as a percent of net sales was relatively flat compared to the same period of 2020, increasing 9 basis points year-over-year.\nWhile we've reduced our COVID-19-related costs by $13 million year-to-date, the health and safety of our team members and customers continues to be our top priority.\nOur adjusted operating income increased to $274 million in Q3 compared to $256 million one year ago.\nOn a rate basis, our adjusted OI margin expanded by 37 basis points to 10.4%.\nFinally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 21.6% to $3.21 compared to $2.64 in Q3 of 2020.\nCompared with 2019, adjusted diluted earnings per share was up 31% in the quarter.\nOur free cash flow for the first nine months of the year was $734 million, an increase of 19% versus last year.\nThis increase was primarily driven by improvements in our operating income as well as our continued focus on working capital metrics, including our accounts payable ratio, which expanded 351 basis points versus Q3 2020.\nYear-to-date through Q3, our capital investments were $191 million.\nWe continue to focus on maintaining sufficient liquidity, while returning excess cash to shareholders.\nIn Q3, we returned approximately $228 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of 1.1 million shares at an average price of $205.65.\nYear-to-date, we've returned approximately $792 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of nearly 4.2 million shares at an average price of $189.43.\nSince restarting our share repurchase program in Q3 of 2018, we returned over $2 billion in share repurchases at an average share price of approximately $164.\nAdditionally, we paid a cash dividend of $1 per share in the quarter totaling $63 million.\nWe remain confident in our ability to generate meaningful cash from our business and expect to return excess cash to our shareholders in a balanced approach between dividends and buybacks.\nAs you saw in the yesterday's 8-K filing with the SEC, we recently closed the refinancing of our new five-year revolving credit facility.\nThe prior facility was set to mature in January 2023.\nAnd the bank markets have returned to pre-pandemic levels, we took the opportunity to secure our liquidity for another five years.\nThis included improved pricing and terms while also increasing the overall facility size to $1.2 billion.\nWe have strong relationships with our banks.\nAnd this commitment allows us to secure future financial flexibility.\nMore details of this facility can be found in our 8-K filings.\nTurning to our updated full year outlook.\nWe are increasing 2021 sales and profit guidance to reflect the positive results year-to-date and our expectations for the balance of the year.\nThrough the first four weeks of Q4, we're continuing to see sales strength in our two-year stack, remaining in line with what we delivered in the last two quarters.\nThis guidance incorporates continued top-line strength, ongoing inflationary headwinds and up to an additional $10 million in start-up costs in Q4 related to our West Coast expansion.\nAs discussed, the construction environment in California remains challenging, resulting in a reduction of our guidance from new store openings and capital expenditures.\nAs a result, we're updating our full year 2021 guidance to net sales of $10.9 billion to $10.95 billion, comparable store sales of 9.5% to 10%, adjusted operating income margin rate of 9.4% to 9.5%, a minimum of 30 new stores this year, a minimum of $275 million in capex and a minimum of $725 million in free cash flow.\nIn summary, we're very excited about our current momentum.\nWe remain focused on the execution of the long-term strategy, while delivering top quartile total shareholder return over the 2021 to 2023 time frame.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Today's remarks also include certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nSo with that said, let's turn to our fiscal 2021 third-quarter results.\nGiven the continued challenging operating environment as a result of COVID-19, we are very pleased with our overall results for the quarter and for the full 2020, 2021 North American ski season.\nResults continued to improve as the season progressed, primarily as a result of stronger destination visitation at our Colorado and Utah resorts, including improved lift ticket repurchases relative to the fiscal 2021 second-quarter results.\ndestination, mountain resorts and regional ski areas for the third quarter was only a down 3% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019.\nWhistler Blackcomb's performance continued to be negatively impacted due to the continued closure of the Canadian border to international guests, including guests from the U.S., and was further impacted by the resort closing earlier than expected on March 30, 2021, following a provincial health order issued by the government of British Columbia.\nWhistler Blackcomb's total visitation for the third quarter declined nearly 60% to the third quarter of fiscal 2019.\nWhile visitation and revenue trends improved throughout the quarter, our ancillary lines of business continue to be significantly and negatively impacted by COVID-19-related capacity constraints and limitations, particularly in food and beverage and ski school.\nWe maintained disciplined cost controls throughout the quarter and continue operating our ancillary lines of business at reduced capacity.\nAs Rob mentioned, we're very pleased with our overall results for the quarter and for the full 2020-2021 North American ski season.\nAs a reminder, in the prior year, we announced the early closure of the 2019-2020 North American ski season for our ski areas, lodging properties, and retail rental stores as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic beginning on March 15, 2020.\nThese actions had a significant adverse impact on our results of operations for the third fiscal quarter of 2020.\nAdditionally, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting limitations and restrictions on our operations continued to have an adverse impact on our results for the third fiscal quarter of 2021.\nNet income attributable to Vail Resorts was $274.6 million or $6.72 per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2021, compared to net income attributable to Vail Resorts of $152.5 million or $3.74 per diluted share in the prior year.\nResort reported EBITDA was $462.2 million in the third fiscal quarter, which compares to resort reported EBITDA of $304.4 million in the same period in the prior year.\nski season in the current year with particularly strong demand at our Colorado and Utah destination resorts.\nResort-reported EBITDA margin for the third quarter was 52%, exceeding both the prior-year period of 43.9% and fiscal 2019 third quarter of 50.2%.\nThese results reflect our rigorous approach to cost management, as well as a higher proportion of lift revenue relative to ancillary lines of business compared to prior periods.\nNow, turning to our outlook for fiscal 2021.\nNet income attributable to Vail Resorts, Inc. is expected to be between $93 million and $139 million for fiscal 2021.\nWe expect the resort-reported EBITDA for fiscal 2021 will be between $530 million and $570 million, and we expect the resort-reported EBITDA margin for fiscal 2021 will be approximately 28.9% using the midpoint of the guidance range.\nOur guidance assumes all of our operations are open and aligned with current health and safety protocols and capacity restrictions.\nCurrent demand trends continue.\nWe experienced normal weather conditions throughout the Australia's East season and North American summer season, and there is no impact from potential COVID-19-related shutdowns or lockdowns.\nThe guidance specifically assumes no impact from potential demand or operational disruptions associated with the current lockdowns in Victoria, Australia.\nWe continue to maintain significant liquidity.\nOur total cash and revolver availability as of April 30, 2021, was approximately $2 billion, with $1.3 billion of cash on hand, $419 million of U.S. revolver availability under the Vail Holdings credit agreement, and $203 million of revolver availability under the Whistler Credit Agreement.\nAs of April 30, 2021, our net debt was 2.8 times trailing 12 months total reported EBITDA.\nWe remain confident in the strong cash flow generation and stability of our business model, and we will continue to be disciplined stewards of our capital with a focus on high-return capital projects, continuous investment in our people, and strategic acquisition opportunities.\nWhile we are not reinstating the dividend this quarter, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders, and our board of directors will continue to closely monitor the economic and public health outlook on a quarterly basis to assess the appropriate time to reinstate the dividend.\nWe're very pleased with the results for our season pass sales to date with guests showing strong enthusiasm for the enhanced value proposition of our pass products, driven in part by the 20% reduction in all pass prices for the upcoming season.\npass product sales through June 1, 2021, for the upcoming 2021-2022 North American ski season increased very significantly as compared to the sales through June 2, 2020, for the 2020-2021 North American ski season due to lack of any spring sales deadlines in 2020 as a result of COVID-19, making the year-over-year comparison to the spring 2020 results not relevant for performance trends.\nCompared to sales for the 2019-2020 North American ski season through June 4, 2019, pass product sales for the 2021-2022 season to June 1, 2021, increased approximately 50% in units and 33% in sales dollars.\nPass product sales are adjusted to include Peak Resorts' pass sales in both periods and eliminate the impact of foreign currency by applying an exchange rate of $0.83 between the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar in both periods for Whistler Blackcomb.\nAs a reminder, pass product sales for the full selling season through December 6, 2020, as compared to the full selling season through December 8, 2019, increased approximately 20% in units and approximately 19% in sales dollars.\nRelative to season-to-date pass sale products -- relative to season-to-date, pass product sales for the 2019-2020 season through June 4, 2019, we saw very strong unit growth with our renewing passholders and even stronger unit growth in new passholders, which includes guests in our database, the previously purchased lift tickets or passes that did not buy a pass in the previous season and guests who are completely new to our database.\nWe saw our strongest unit growth in our destination markets, particularly in the Northeast, and also had very strong growth across our local markets.\nCompared to the period ended June 4, 2019, effective pass price decreased 10% as compared to the 20% price decrease we implemented this year.\nWe believe this highlights how our lower pricing has increased the propensity of passholders to spend a portion of the new discount to purchase higher-valued pass products.\nWe expected that the price reduction would result in higher pass renewal rates, increased trade up to higher-value passes, and drive incremental guests to our network.\nWe are encouraged that each of these trends is evident in the season-to-date pass sales results, which we believe supports our expected results for next year, as well as the expected long-term benefits of increasing guest lifetime value.\nThe pass results exceeded our original expectations to the impact of the 20% price reduction.\nHowever, we still have the majority of our pass selling season ahead of us, and it is not yet clear if these trends will continue through the fall.\nIn addition, we are very pleased that ongoing sales of the Epic Australia pass, which ends on June 15, 2021, are up approximately 43% in units through June 1, 2021, as compared to the comparable period through June 4, 2019, representing significant growth following the acquisition of Falls Creek and Hotham in April 2019.\nGiven the recent COVID-19-related lockdowns in Victoria, Australia, we will be monitoring any impacts on the Epic Australia pass sales.\nOur commitment to reinvesting in our resorts and the guest experience remains one of our highest priorities.\nAs previously announced this summer and fall, we will be completing several signature investments subject to regulatory approvals.\nIn Colorado, we are moving forward with a 250-acre lift-served terrain expansion in the signature McCoy Park area of Beaver Creek, further differentiating the resort's high-end family focused experience.\nWe also plan to add a new four-person high-speed lift at Breckenridge to serve the popular peak 7, replace the Peru lift at Keystone with a six-person high-speed chairlift and replace the Peachtree lift at Crested Butte with a new three-person fixed-grip lift.\nAt Okemo, we plan to compete a transportational investment, including upgrading the Quantum lift from a four-person to a six-person high-speed chair lift and relocating the existing four-person Quantum lift to replace the Green Ridge three-person fixed-grip chairlift.\nThese investments will greatly improve uplift capacity, further enhance the guest experience, and complete our $35 million capital plan for the season.\nWe remain highly focused on investments that will further our companywide technology enhancements to support our data-driven approach, guest experience, and corporate infrastructure.\nAs part of these efforts, we are continuing to invest in resources and technology to improve our customer service experience, including significant staffing increases in our call centers and self-service technology that will provide our guests the ability to better manage their own accounts.\nWe will also continue to invest in ongoing maintenance capital to support infrastructure across our resorts.\nAs we head into next year, we know that talent and staffing will be critical for our success, as it always is.\nAnd we have announced that we will be raising our minimum entry wages in Colorado, Utah, Washington, and California to $15 per hour while also making material increases in the entry wages of our Eastern resorts, which will be set based upon their local market dynamics.\nThis will be our largest discretionary investment in operating expense this year, which we believe will be offset by a portion of other savings we will carry from this year into next year.\nI'm deeply grateful for the commitment our teams continue to

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Earlier today, we published our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results.\nA copy of the release is available on our website at oshkoshcorp.com.\nOur presenters today include Wilson Jones, Chief Executive Officer; John Pfeifer, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Pack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nI continue to be very proud of the hard work and disciplined execution of Oshkosh team members as we continue to work through the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe've talked about it before but it bears repeating, our people-first culture has been a key driver for our strong results in the face of adversity.\nProud Oshkosh team members and their commitment to our strong culture allowed us to overcome significant headwinds this past year, including uncertain customer demand, supplier delivery interruptions, workforce availability issues and many others.\nA big shout-out to all 15,000 of our team members and our dedicated suppliers that have worked hard and stepped up during this difficult period to continue meeting our customers' needs.\nAs a reminder, our fourth quarter call is always a little different from our other quarterly calls as I'll review both the quarterly highlights and the full year results before turning it over to John and Mike.\nFor the fourth quarter, we delivered sales of nearly $1.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.30.\nMuch like I said regarding our third quarter performance, we've controlled what we can control while responding quickly to challenges outside of our control.\nThis is important as we were able to grow adjusted operating income in our defense, fire & emergency and commercial segments over the prior year while achieving consolidated adjusted decremental margins of 19%.\nIn our largest segment, access equipment, we delivered 23% adjusted decremental margins during the quarter where revenues were down nearly 40%.\nJohn will go into more specifics on the segments, but the access equipment markets in North America and Europe remain soft and the timing of recovery remains uncertain.\nWe are encouraged by utilization data that is approaching pre-pandemic levels and believe the market is stabilizing.\nWe'll be paying close attention to rental industry metrics as well as engaging in annual purchase discussions with our customers over the next few months.\nFinally, we are announcing a 10% increase to our quarterly cash dividend to $0.33 per share.\nThis is our seventh consecutive annual increase and reflects the confidence we have in our business model and the longer-term outlook.\nThere's no doubt that 2020 has been one of the most memorable years in recent history as the global pandemic has created disruptions of significant proportions, and I'm proud of the efforts and results that our people were able to deliver.\nFor example, our access equipment segment overcame a nearly $1.6 billion year-over-year sales decline to deliver an impressive 8.5% full year adjusted operating margin.\nOur fire & emergency segment delivered two consecutive quarters of record adjusted operating margin percentages to end the year.\nOur commercial segment posted a decade-plus high full year adjusted operating income margin of 7.5%.\nAnd defense successfully executed our ramp-up of the JLTV program despite a host of headwinds brought on by the global pandemic.\nAll of these represent significant accomplishments in the midst of the pandemic and demonstrate our strengths as a different integrated global industrial.\nWe ended the year on a high note with solid performance in the fourth quarter.\nDuring the year, we executed a combination of companywide temporary and permanent cost reductions.\nAnd Mike will talk about how these actions will impact our cost structure in 2021 in his section.\nI also want to call out some of the great work our teams have been doing regarding corporate responsibility with a focus on ESG.\nWe don't typically talk about ESG metrics on earnings calls, but our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage, along with our team member engagement and safety performance, are among many areas that we believe help differentiate Oshkosh from other companies.\nWe continue to earn recognition from agencies that track and evaluate company performance for these important nonfinancial measures, and we believe they further underscore our commitment to excellence, long-term value and sustainability.\nWilson mentioned the pandemic, and I'd like to provide an update since several of our facilities, including our headquarters, are located in the region of Wisconsin that is currently experiencing some of the highest rates of COVID-19 spread in the nation.\nAcross the company, we've been focused on maintaining the safety of our team members and preventing the spread of the virus, and we have a good track record in doing that.\nHowever, the recent resurgence is creating some workforce availability and supplier delivery challenges.\nIt's important -- it's as important as ever that we maintain strong safety procedures that meet or exceed CDC guidelines.\nOf course, this is challenging as many of us are experiencing pandemic fatigue.\nBut like Wilson, I'm proud of our team members and our ability to stay focused and effective.\nLet's kick off our segment discussions with access equipment.\nWe've been closely managing our access equipment business during a time of significant double-digit sales declines while still delivering strong adjusted decremental margins and impressive overall adjusted operating margins.\nIn fact, we've been able to set a new benchmark for financial performance during an industry downturn.\nWe appreciate the efforts and performance our team members have delivered during these times.\nOur positive fourth quarter results are significant, considering the low demand for access equipment, which has resulted primarily from lower equipment utilization, leading to lower capex spending by rental company customers in North America and Europe.\nSales for the quarter were down nearly 40%, and we're therefore continuing to operate our facilities on reduced schedules.\nWe've taken both temporary and permanent cost reduction actions in the business as we weather the storm.\nWe believe this is a responsible approach.\nIt's important to emphasize that we have continued to invest in the business as JLG is the innovation leader in the industry, and we remain confident in the long-term outlook for this business.\nWe look forward to future product innovation releases as a result of our continuing investment.\nWe're carefully balancing our cost reductions with the ability to ramp up when the market recovers.\nThrough the first quarter, we'll keep production lower by operating our U.S. facilities for approximately 50% of the available production weeks.\nWe will make decisions for the remainder of 2021 as conditions evolve and our customers share their plans.\nWe are keeping our workforce engaged to be able to meet demand when the market returns.\nWe are also staying in close communication with our suppliers as they are key to our ability to ramp up when the market comes back.\nWe know that fleets in North America are aging with the aerials in the 55-month average age range according to the latest data, and we believe this elevated figure bodes well for future demand.\nThe bottom line for North America is that we are confident in the recovery for the access equipment market, but the specific timing of the recovery remains uncertain.\nFor the first half of the year, we expect lower year-over-year sales.\nWe are early in our discussions with our rental company customers, and we expect to gain more clarity on the second half of the year before our next earnings call.\nFinally, just as we discussed last quarter, China's economy continues to recover, which we believe offers an opportunity for double-digit sales growth in the region for the foreseeable future.\nOur defense segment performed well in the quarter but has been dealing with workforce availability issues that I mentioned earlier as the pandemic is having a notable effect on our ability to schedule people and production.\nDespite these challenges, which we experienced more intensively late in the fourth quarter and continued to experience earlier this month, our operations teams have delivered solid results for our U.S. government customer and grew revenues in the year by more than 11%.\nOur successful ramp-up of the JLTV program throughout the year led the way and provides a strong foundation as part of our large backlog in the segment.\nOur team was happy to receive an expected order for 322 JLTVs from the Belgian Ministry of Defense in October.\nThe contract with our NATO ally valued at more than EUR115 million further demonstrates the success we are having with the world's best light protected tactical wheeled vehicle.\nWe expect to begin shipping the vehicles in 2023, and we expect to announce more international JLTV orders in 2021.\nWe competed against an incumbent competitor to win this order, and we believe it demonstrates the superior cost and performance characteristics of the JLTV product.\nI want to comment on the recently enacted Continuing Resolution, or CR.\nIt used to be rare that the government required a CR to fund spending, but over the last 10 to 12 years, CRs have become the norm.\nOur programs of record remain funded under the CR so it does not present an issue for 2021.\nFire & emergency delivered an all-time record for quarterly adjusted operating income of 16.4% in the fourth quarter.\nOur team's performance at F&E has been nothing short of phenomenal as they have navigated through supplier issues, customer travel restrictions and other operational challenges, many of which were brought on by COVID-19.\nThe simplification philosophy that F&E adopted several years ago, along with state-of-the-art product innovation, provides the framework for the team to run its business at such a high level.\nWe are exiting the year with a strong backlog, supported by a record order year of nearly $1.3 billion despite the negative impacts of COVID-19.\nAged fire truck fleets, combined with the availability of new technologies, underpin our favorable long-term outlook for the F&E market.\nThat said, tight municipal budgets may constrain demand in the near term.\nFire & emergency is ready for the challenge with a market-leading lineup of high-quality, custom and commercial fire trucks and RF units.\nAnd we continue to invest in new technologies, such as our Fotokite Situational Awareness System in alternative powertrain options that you'll hear more about in future quarters.\nOur commercial segment has continued to drive improvement throughout the year despite headwinds caused by the pandemic.\nThe team delivered strong margins and higher year-over-year adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter despite lower revenues.\nOur commercial team posted its highest full year adjusted operating income margin in more than a decade.\nThis is particularly impressive, given the market impacts from COVID when construction was halted in many areas of the country and shelter-in-place restrictions temporarily reduced demand for waste collection at businesses earlier in the year.\nMuch of our recent success stems from simplification efforts and disciplined cost management as well as the ramp-up of our new S-Series 2.0 Front Discharge Concrete Mixer, which is driving a lot of excitement and helping us win new customers.\nOn our last call, we announced restructuring plans to transfer rear discharge concrete mixer production from Minnesota to Ontario, Canada as the team simplifies the business with a focused factory approach.\nI'm pleased to report that the transition is progressing according to schedule, and we anticipate a successful completion over the next several months.\nWe believe this will put us in a prime position to drive sustained margin improvements.\nBefore I leave this segment, I want to mention our commitment to electrification as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide our customers with options as they plan their fleets.\nEarly in the fourth quarter, there were numerous announcements of plans for electric RCVs in the U.S. market by some companies.\nWe are proud to be working on electrification solutions across all of our businesses at Oshkosh.\nThis is particularly true for RCVs as we are partnering with a chassis OEM to deliver five electric RCV units to be used in Boise, Idaho in the summer of 2021.\nI'd like to close with a comment about the culture and positive mindset we see from the team at commercial.\nThey have been working very hard driving business and operational improvements, and their efforts and dedication to task are second to none and we can see it in our results.\nThis wraps it up for our business segments.\nStrong execution allowed us to deliver 19% adjusted decremental margins on a consolidated basis and 23% adjusted decremental margins at access equipment in the fourth quarter.\nConsolidated net sales for the quarter were $1.8 billion, down 18.7% from the prior year quarter.\nA 39% decrease in access equipment segment sales was the primary driver of the decrease.\nAccess equipment sales were negatively impacted by lower customer demand, primarily as a result of COVID-19.\nAs John mentioned, our customers remain cautious with equipment purchases in light of uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and associated softness in nonresidential construction activity.\nConsolidated adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $124.1 million or 7% of sales compared to $203.1 million or 9.2% of sales in the prior year quarter.\nAccess equipment segment adjusted operating income declined on lower sales and unfavorable manufacturing absorption as a result of planned shutdowns during the quarter, offset in part by the benefit of COVID-19-related temporary cost reduction actions.\nDefense segment adjusted operating income increased as a result of improved product mix and higher sales volume, partially offset by less favorable cumulative contract adjustments and higher engineering and proposal spending in the current year quarter.\nFire & emergency segment operating income increased in the current year quarter as a result of improved price cost dynamics and improved absorption, offset in part by lower sales volume.\nAnd commercial segment fourth quarter adjusted operating income increased due to lower spending in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and favorable material costs, offset in part by adverse product mix and lower sales volume.\nAdjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.30 compared to earnings per share of $2.17 in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nFourth quarter results benefited by $0.02 per share from share repurchases completed in the prior 12 months.\nFinally, we generated strong free cash flow during the quarter to drive full year free cash flow of $238 million.\nThis is a solid accomplishment during a year where we saw rapid declines in customer demand, which put pressure on working capital.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has continued to drive uncertainty in the cadence of customer demand in both our access equipment and commercial segments.\nConversely, strong backlogs in our defense and fire & emergency segments provide good visibility well into 2021.\nHowever, as John mentioned earlier, recent spikes in COVID-19 infection rates are creating workforce availability and supply chain issues, particularly in Wisconsin, where a significant portion of the production occurs for our defense and fire & emergency segments.\nThe situation is causing production and labor efficiency risks for these two segments and is also likely to impact final truck inspections by customers in the fire & emergency segment.\nTaking these factors into account, including the ongoing uncertainty of the pandemic, we're not in a position to provide quantitative expectations for 2021 at this time.\nWe are actively engaged in discussions with our key customers in the access equipment and commercial segments to understand the requirements for 2021, but we do expect softer year-over-year demand in the first half of 2021 compared to 2020.\nDemand for access equipment remains uncertain for the second half of the year, but we expect to have better clarity during the first quarter earnings call as we gain further insight into the trajectory of the pandemic and our customer requirements for 2021.\nAt access equipment, we are implementing 2-week production shutdowns per month in the United States in the first quarter of 2021 to better align production with customer requirements.\nIn the second quarter of 2020, we implemented decisive actions which reduced our 2020 pre-tax cost by approximately $120 million.\nThe reductions were evenly split between three areas: first, salary reductions and furloughs; second, incentive compensation; and third, project travel and other discretionary spending.\nAs we previously discussed, these cost reductions were largely temporary in nature, and we expect them to return to our expense run rate in 2021.\nAdditionally, we discussed permanent cost reduction actions during our last earnings call in the access equipment and commercial segments totaling $30 million to $35 million once complete.\nWe expect these actions will benefit 2021 by approximately $20 million.\nRecently, we implemented additional permanent cost reductions totaling $15 million for 2021, which reduced corporate and segment operating expenses.\nSo we expect to benefit from a total of $35 million of permanent cost reductions in 2021, growing to $45 million to $50 million by 2022.\nReturn of costs that drove the temporary cost reductions in 2020 will be a headwind to margins in 2021.\nHowever, we are continuing to manage our business in a disciplined manner and will respond to the ongoing uncertainty with our playbooks.\nOur balance sheet remains strong with available liquidity of approximately $1.4 billion, consisting of cash of approximately $600 million and availability under our revolving line of credit of approximately $800 million.\nWe expect a modest increase in capital expenditures to approximately $120 million in 2021.\nWhile we are not providing quantitative financial expectations today, we expect to provide them later in the year.\nWe just completed the year in which we delivered nearly $5 of adjusted earnings per share in the midst of a global pandemic, and we believe we are in a great position moving into 2021 with our strong balance sheet and cash position.\nOur defense and fire & emergency backlogs provide visibility well into 2021, and we took aggressive actions early during the pandemic to lower our costs.\nOur culture at Oshkosh is strong, and we have an outstanding group of leaders and team members who have effectively managed production and supply chain disruptions and kept Oshkosh on a positive path since the pandemic began.\nWe can't let up as the threat is still with us, but I'm reassured by the strength and resilience of our people and believe we will deliver solid sales and earnings performance over the long term.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:AMG entered 2021 in a position of strength, and our first-quarter results reflect the momentum that continues to build in our business.\nEconomic earnings per share of $4.28 improved 35% year over year and represented the strongest first quarter in our history, primarily driven by EBITDA growth of 23% and ongoing share repurchase activity.\nBuilding on our strong start to the year and looking ahead to the second quarter and full year of 2021, we expect the growth in our business to accelerate, given the excellent affiliate investment performance, the ongoing contributions of the strategic actions we have taken and most significantly, heightened activity and new investments.\nWith our increasing free cash flow and available capital in a favorable environment to establish new partnerships, we have a tremendous opportunity to invest in high-quality firms operating in areas of secular growth such as our recent investments in OCP Asia and Boston Common.\nThe disciplined execution of our strategy, including the simultaneous return of excess capital to our shareholders, will further compound our earnings and free cash flow generation, and we are confident in our ability to create substantial shareholder value over time.\nOver the past year, our affiliates built on their long-term performance records, once again demonstrating their ability to distinguish themselves during periods of volatility.\nExcellent investment performance during this period generated meaningful first-quarter performance fees, increased asset levels and enhanced organic growth.\nAs performance-driven improvements in organic growth trends continue across our business, we are also seeing investors rerisking portfolios as economies reopen worldwide.\nInvestors are increasing allocations to high-quality active managers, especially independent firms to help navigate market volatility, protect capital and generate superior outcomes.\nIn addition to ongoing growth and flows in private markets, specialty fixed income and wealth management, AMG is benefiting from growing demand for fundamental equities and liquid alternatives, particularly in our top-performing value-oriented affiliates and in our active ESG strategies.\nAs these trends continue, and as we add new affiliates operating at secular demand areas, we expect ongoing improvement in our organic flow profile.\nFurther supporting this improving profile, AMG-led distribution efforts are adding incremental growth and momentum to our affiliates' new business activity.\nNearly 20 years ago, we began developing AMG-led distribution resources to complement the existing sales efforts of our affiliates.\nAnd over the past two years, we strategically evolved our platform for the benefit of our affiliate partners and their clients, focusing on the largest growth opportunities while also better aligning our affiliates' in-demand products with the success of AMG distribution efforts.\nwealth distribution, consistent with our institutional distribution strategy.\nThis change provides a more competitively priced, higher quality and more differentiated set of strategies exclusively managed by AMG affiliates.\nWith this repositioning now behind us, our distribution platforms are even more strategically compelling to both existing and new affiliates as well as our clients given the increased focus, resources and alignment.\nAnd as part of our strategy, we will continue to evolve our AMG-led distribution resources to reflect the composition and needs of our affiliates and their clients over time.\nAMG's enduring business model, providing a permanent solution for independent firms, enables us to be a true strategic partner to our affiliates distinct from any institutional competitor in the market today.\nOur partnership model is simple.\nWe enhance our affiliates' ability to grow across generations, while preserving investment independence and operating autonomy.\nWe provide a uniquely broad set of partnership solutions to independent firms having expanded our solution set over the years beyond succession planning to include minority investments, growth capital and centralized distribution services on behalf of our affiliates.\nAs a result of this evolution, and given our strong competitive position, AMG's partnership approach today is even more attractive to a broader array of independent firms around the world.\nOur new investment strategy is generating both growth and return.\nNot only does our partnership approach self-select for growing firms, our discipline in structuring new investments generate meaningful returns for our shareholders across a range of business outcomes.\nOver the past two years, we have meaningfully stepped up our focus and resources devoting to identifying and executing new partnerships with independent firms.\nAdditionally, we have concentrated our prospecting efforts on independent firms operating in areas of strong secular growth and client demand, including private markets, fixed income alternatives, the Asia Pacific region, ESG and multi-asset solutions.\nWith this enhanced focus, we expect new investments to be a significant source of forward earnings growth.\nAs we continue to execute on our growing opportunity set over the course of 2021, each new affiliate will add immediately to our earnings.\nAnd the full impact of AMG's earnings power and growth profile will only fully materialize starting in 2022.\nEvidencing the momentum we are seeing in new investments, last week, we announced our second partnership this year.\nRecognized as the leader in Asian private credit, OCP Asia, has consistently generated excellent returns for its clients.\nThe cultural alignment between AMG and OCP Asia is very strong, and the key principles of OCP were attracted to our partnership approach and the opportunity to expand and extend our client reach through our global distribution capabilities.\nThis new partnership enhances and diversifies our exposure both to private markets and to Asia, where we see increasing allocation.\nWe are excited to partner with Stu, Teall, Dan and the broader team as they continue to provide differentiated investment returns and capitalize on their growth initiatives.\nFinally, as I said last quarter, the contributions from the strategic and growth investments that we have made over the past two years are not only materializing in our results today, but will also more fully manifest in the coming quarters.\nSince the beginning of 2019, we have invested in six new affiliates.\nWe've invested in the growth of our existing affiliates.\nWe have broadened our partnership solution set.\nWe've enhanced our strategic capabilities.\nWe have realigned our distribution platform.\nWe have significantly enhanced our capital position and we repurchased nearly 20% of our shares outstanding.\nWe have achieved all of this while reinvigorating AMG's entrepreneurial culture in reestablishing an ownership mindset across the organization.\nLooking ahead, we have significant momentum on our business, and we see AMG's growth accelerating.\nWith strong affiliate investment performance and improving organic growth profile and increasing opportunities to invest in excellent partner-owned firms, we are confident in our ability to execute on our substantial opportunity set and continue to create shareholder value.\nAs we discussed on our fourth-quarter call, focused execution against our strategy is producing significant growth, as was once again evidenced by our strong first quarter.\nOur earnings power and cash flow generation continue to increase, and our unique ability to deploy capital across our broad opportunity set to grow EBITDA and earnings per share is a key differentiator.\nLooking forward, the value proposition we offer independent partner-owned firms, together with an increasingly favorable environment for active managers, position AMG well to compound earnings growth over time and generate meaningful shareholder value.\nOur first-quarter results reflect the significant momentum we're seeing across our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $247 million grew 23% year over year, driven by strong affiliate investment performance and the impact of our growth investments.\nEconomic earnings per share of $4.28 grew 35% year over year further benefiting from share repurchase activity.\nNet client cash flows for the quarter improved meaningfully versus prior periods, and flows representing the vast majority of our EBITDA turned positive, excluding certain quantitative strategies.\nOngoing strength in private markets, specialty-fixed income and wealth management strategies continue to drive strong flows.\nIncreased demand for fundamental equity and liquid alternatives, particularly top-performing value and impact-oriented strategies, also contributed, as clients continue to position portfolios for a post-pandemic world.\nTurning to performance across our business and excluding certain quantitative strategies.\nIn alternatives, fundraising remains strong at Pantheon, Baring, EIG and Comvest as clients continue to steadily increase private market allocations globally, and we reported net inflows of $2.8 billion in the first quarter.\nPerformance in this category is excellent, as our affiliates have been deploying dry powder into attractive return opportunities, including across Asia private equity, global secondaries, coinvestments and credit.\nOverall, our private markets book remains a significant source of earnings growth, accounting for nearly 20% of management fee EBITDA with increasing future carried interest potential.\nWe continue to add high-quality partnerships in the sector, including our investment in OCP Asia, which I'll elaborate further on in a moment.\nWithin liquid alternatives, our affiliates are posting strong performance across relative value fixed income in light of ongoing volatility in bond markets as well as in concentrated long-only strategies.\nWe are seeing increased client interest in this category as clients look for alternative sources of yield and return.\nCapula, Garda and ValueAct continue to generate excellent investment performance, translating to strong performance fees and demonstrating the attractiveness and resiliency of these strategies.\nMoving to fundamental equities.\nWe continue to see strong performance across a range of affiliates.\nIn U.S. equities, we reported net inflows of $300 million.\nThe outperformance of value strategies following decade-long headwinds is leading to increased conversations with clients and are focused on the highest quality independent firms in the industry, benefiting affiliates like River Road and Yacktman.\nIn global equities, net outflows of $3.9 billion were driven by redemptions in regionally focused strategies.\nAffiliates continue to deliver strong investment performance across a range of strategies, including at Harding Loevner, Veritas and Artemis.\nMulti-asset and fixed income strategies continue to produce steady long-duration inflows, and we anticipate ongoing client demand trends will support future growth.\nThese strategies generated $900 million in net client cash flows during the quarter, primarily driven by ongoing demand for muni bond strategy at GW&K and stable growth across our wealth management affiliates.\nOverall, affiliate investment performance and flow trends continue on a positive trajectory as clients increasingly turn to independent active managers to deliver superior investment outcomes.\nAnd we continue to pivot our business toward areas of secular growth through investments in existing affiliates and new affiliates, which will further enhance our organic growth profile going forward.\nNow, turning to financials.\nFor the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $247 million grew 23% year over year, driven by strong affiliate investment performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA included $42 million of performance fees, reflecting outstanding performance in certain liquid alternative strategies.\nEconomic earnings per share of $4.28 grew by 35% year over year, further benefiting from share repurchase activity.\nNow moving to specific modeling items for the second quarter.\nWe expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $210 million to $220 million based on current AUM levels, reflecting our market blend, which was up 3% as of Friday.\nOur estimate includes performance fees of up to $10 million and the impact of our newest investments in OCP Asia and Boston Common.\nAs a reminder, the second and third quarters are typically lower performance fee quarters due to the timing of performance fee crystallization.\nOur share of interest expense was $27 million for the first quarter, and we expect interest expense to remain at a similar level for the second quarter.\nControlling interest depreciation was $2 million in the first quarter, and we expect the second quarter to be at a similar level.\nOur share of reported amortization and impairments was $41 million for the first quarter, and we expect it to be $35 million in the second quarter.\nOur effective GAAP and cash tax rates were 24% and 20%, respectively, for the first quarter, and we expect similar levels for the second quarter.\nIntangible-related deferred taxes were $9 million in the first quarter, and we expect an $11 million level in the second quarter.\nOther economic items were negative $15 million and included the mark-to-market impact on GP and seed capital investments.\nIn the second quarter, for modeling purposes, we expect other economic items, excluding any mark-to-market impact, on GP and seed to be $1 million.\nOur adjusted weighted average share count for the first quarter was $43.2 million, and we expect our share count to be approximately $42.4 million for the second quarter.\nFinally, turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation.\nOur balance sheet remains in an excellent position with significant access to liquidity and a flexible long-duration debt profile, and we continue to look for ways to further enhance our capital structure.\nWe are generating strong and growing free cash flow and are well-positioned to invest our capital through the disciplined execution of our strategy, including through new investment partnerships that create significant value over time.\nFirst, we are focused on investing in high-growth businesses in areas of secular demand.\nSo new investments are generally growing faster than our existing business in terms of both flows and revenues, enhancing our organic growth profile and our EBITDA growth.\nNext, new investments not only contribute immediately to our EBITDA, but we can also debt finance a portion of our purchase price and often achieve incremental tax benefits, enhancing the returns we deliver to our shareholders.\nAnd finally, as we execute on our strategy, we continue to take a disciplined approach to pricing and structure, targeting risk-adjusted returns well in excess of our cost of capital across a range of potential outcomes.\nTaken together, new investments generate immediate earnings and organic growth and are strategically important to the long-term growth and sustainability of our business.\nOur most recent investment in OCP Asia is a great example of the value of investing in new affiliates.\nWe took a minority interest in the business through a revenue share, with a structure designed to minimize earnings volatility.\nThe business is growing at double digits organically and is priced to deliver attractive returns across a range of outcomes.\nWe expect the business to contribute $0.20 of incremental economic earnings per share in 2021 and $0.33 in 2022, including $16 million of EBITDA in 2022.\nOur renewed focus on disciplined capital allocation ensures that every dollar we invest runs through a common framework so that we are making growth investments that clearly meet our risk and return criteria and then returning excess capital to our shareholders through repurchases.\nIn the first quarter, we repurchased $210 million of shares and now have repurchased nearly 20% of our shares outstanding over the past two years.\nWe are focused on continuing to reduce our share count through repurchases over time, and we remain on track to repurchase $500 million of shares this year.\nAs always, this is subject to change based on market conditions and the timing of new investments.\nWe are well-positioned to compound earnings growth over time through new investments, investment performance, flows and share repurchases.\nThe momentum in our business is accelerating and the combination of our strategy, our capital position and a favorable environment to invest for growth underscore the many reasons to be excited about AMG going forward.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I am joined today by Kroger's chairman and chief executive officer, Rodney McMullen; and Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip.\nA detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings.\n[Operator instructions] I would also like to announce that we will be hosting a business update on March 4, 2022, in Florida with an opportunity to tour our recently opened Kroger delivery customer fulfillment center.\nWe hope that you are able to join us.\nWe often say the holidays are our time to shine.\nAnd as we move through the holiday season, we feel great about our ability to deliver.\nWe are incredibly proud of our third quarter results and the underlying momentum in our business.\nWe returned to positive identical sales without fuel for the quarter.\nWe saw triple-digit digital sales growth on a two-year stack, and we've increased our full year 2021 guidance.\nOur agility and the commitment from our amazing associates is allowing us to navigate current labor and supply chain conditions and provide the freshest food at affordable prices across our seamless ecosystem.\nCustomers are demonstrating more back-to-normal behaviors, and at the same time, are eating more food at home because it's more affordable, convenient, and healthier than other options, plus you can do it as a family.\nCustomers engaged in larger celebrations with friends and family compared to last year.\nWe also saw them continuing to cook at home, leading up to and during the holiday, and select more premium products to elevate the food experience.\nThese are all reasons why we believe the food at home change is structural and not temporary.\nWith most people consuming meals at home and grocery stores continuing to capture the majority share of stomach, it is more important than ever that we provide customers with flexibility on how they choose to shop with us.\nWe have the right seamless ecosystem in place to meet our customers' evolving needs.\nAt the same time, 84% of consumers said that they will continue to shop online the same amount or more in the future.\nThese seemingly contradictory behaviors are exactly what Kroger's seamless ecosystem was designed to accommodate.\nWe know that inflation is having an impact on customers as well.\n82% of consumers polled across the country are feeling the impact of inflation, and one in four consumers are not confident in their finances right now.\nWe are leveraging our data and personalization to enable our customers to stretch their food dollars.\nWe deliver value when customers need it the most with personalized promotions, big packs, and dynamic holiday offerings.\nAnd while price continues to be top of mind, customers continue to desire the freshest food options, and we're there for them, leading with fresh.\nWe grew sales in Natural & Organics as customers continue to gravitate toward better-for-you options.\nOur fresh departments outpaced total company identical sales without fuel during the quarter as well.\nWe had a record quarter in our alternative farming offerings, which includes new approaches to growing produce, including vertical and indoor farm operations.\nThese offerings expand customers' access to produce picked at the peak of freshness.\nWe are very proud to share that Home Chef became a $1 billion brand on an annualized basis in the third quarter as mealtime shortcuts and solutions, as well as new product innovations, have clearly resonated with our customers.\nKroger is focused on delivering a customer-centric, seamless experience that requires 0 compromise no matter how customers choose to engage with us.\nWe launched three new offerings during the quarter that support the plan to double digital sales and digital profitability by 2023.\nFirst, Boost by Kroger builds on our industry-leading loyalty program to deliver additional savings and personalized offers to our members.\nWe are encouraged by the initial engagement in the program which is ahead of internal expectations.\nSecond, we launched Kroger Delivery Now in partnership with Instacart.\nThis unique convenience and immediacy offering positions us to win more trips with current customers and to bring new customers to the Kroger ecosystem by offering the largest selection of quality fresh products at affordable prices in 30 minutes.\nHere's what's so special about this offering.\nIt was profitable on day one, contributing to our goal to double digital profitability by 2023 that was announced during our 2021 investor day.\nAnd third, we announced a strategic collaboration with Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy Baby that will expand our current marketplace offering and provide Kroger shoppers easy access to essential home and baby products.\nThis exclusive offering will be available through both Kroger.com and on a small-scale physical store pilot at select stores beginning in 2022.\nWe continue to be pleased with the rollout of our customer fulfillment centers in Groveland, Florida; and Monroe, Ohio, which are exceeding internal expectations, and we are especially proud of our Net Promoter Scores, driven by our teams, delivering a world-class experience for our customers, and we're really looking forward to hosting you in Groveland early next year.\nTurning now to our supply chain.\nWe feel great about our ability to serve customer needs through the holidays and beyond.\nThis is because our teams have done such a good job, planning well ahead to maintain a full, fresh, and friendly customer experience.\nIn fact, our customers took action to prepare for today's supply chain constraints back in the spring.\nAnd a great example of leveraging learnings from operating during the pandemic, we kept the additional warehouses originally brought on to support business through COVID to ensure we were able to provide for customers throughout the holiday season as well.\nWe chose to incur significant costs in our supply chain during 2021, which has allowed us to provide our customers today and into 2022.\nWe continue to deploy a wide array of tools, including our owned and operated fleet, and we're working closely with suppliers to mitigate pain points for the customer.\nOur hybrid hiring event last month contributed to the hiring of over 64,000 new associates during the quarter.\nWe continue to invest in our associates by expanding our industry-leading benefits, including continuing education and tuition reimbursement, training and development, health and wellness, and continued investments in associate wages.\nAs we reflect on the one-year anniversary of our Framework for Action in response to racial injustice across the country and in the communities we serve, we are pleased to share our progress with you.\nOver 405,000 associates have completed diversity and inclusion training.\nWe've increased our strategic hiring partnerships with Historically Black Colleges & Universities and Hispanic-serving institutions from six to 17.\nFoundation has awarded more than $3 million in grants to support innovative organizations focused on building more equitable and inclusive communities, and we increased Kroger's diverse supplier spend by 21% to $4.1 billion last year alone and remain on track toward our long-term goal to spend $10 billion annually with diverse suppliers by 2030.\nWhile we know that there is more work to be done, we are energized and look forward to keeping our stakeholders updated on our progress.\nOne of Kroger's greatest strengths is our ability to manage our business successfully in every operating environment.\nWe remain customer-obsessed and focused on operational excellence to deliver for our customers, associates, communities and shareholders.\nOur focus on execution, combined with our disciplined approach to balancing investments in our associates and customers with strong cost management and growth in our alternative profit business, is positioning us well for the future.\nOver time, our model has proven to be resilient during different economic scenarios, and this was true again during the third quarter as we grew the top and bottom lines while navigating higher product cost inflation, a tight labor market, and supply chain constraints.\nOur identical sales without fuel in the quarter returned to positive, growing 3.1% as we delivered for our customers across our seamless ecosystem, and customers, again, signaled higher food-at-home consumption is here to stay.\nAdjusted FIFO operating profit and adjusted earnings per share both increased year over year and grew by compounded annual growth rates of 22% and 29%, respectively, versus 2019.\nThird quarter earnings per share was impacted by two unusual items that were excluded from our adjusted earnings per share result.\nFirst, we engaged in an annuity buyout and lump-sum distribution transaction related to the company's consolidated retirement benefit plan which will reduce future administrative costs.\nThis triggered a write-off of deferred losses and a nonrecurring noncash charge of $87 million on a pre-tax basis.\nThis company pension plan is currently 100% funded as a result of previous action taken to freeze the plan and protect benefits for our associates.\nThis transaction was fully funded by assets in the plan.\nThe second unusual item was Kroger recording a nonrecurring benefit of $47 million or $0.07 per diluted share, primarily due to the favorable outcome of income tax audit examinations, covering multiple years.\nThis amount is also excluded from the company's adjusted net earnings per diluted share result for the third quarter.\nI'll now provide more detail on our operating results in the quarter.\nOn a two-year stack basis, our identical sales without fuel increased 14%.\nWe also saw digital sales increased 103% on a two-year stack.\nAs we have previously shared, we do not expect digital growth to be linear, especially as we cycle last year's sales spike and customers become more comfortable shopping in store again.\nThe launch of several new digital offerings, which Rodney outlined earlier, in addition to the rollout of new customer fulfillment centers, gives us confidence in our ability to deliver against our growth targets for digital sales and profitability.\nWe look forward to sharing more detail on our digital road map at the business update in March that Rob noted earlier on the call.\nWith regard to digital profitability, we continue to make progress during the quarter and achieved our best cost to serve on record for pickup orders.\nGross margin was 21.66% of sales for the third quarter.\nThe FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 41 basis points compared to the same period last year.\nThis decrease primarily related to higher supply chain costs and continued price investments, partially offset by sourcing benefits.\nOur investment was in line with expectations and fully funded by cost savings and OG&A improvement.\nRecognizing recent inflation trends and our outlook for the rest of the year, we recorded a higher LIFO charge for the quarter of $93 million, compared to $23 million in the prior year.\nThis increase represents a $0.07 headwind to earnings per share in the quarter versus 2020.\nThe operating, general and administrative rates decreased 49 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items.\nThis improvement was achieved even with continued investments in our associates and growth in our average hourly rate and reflects the outstanding work our associates are doing to execute cost-saving initiatives in a very dynamic environment.\nWe remain on track to deliver $1 billion of cost savings during 2021.\nOur alternative profit business had a record third quarter and remains on track to deliver the high end of our expected range of $100 million to $150 million of incremental operating profit in 2021.\nWe saw increased strength in Kroger Personal Finance results during the quarter, and Kroger Precision Marketing introduced a new programmatic advertising marketplace to unleash first-party targeting and measurement capabilities, further highlighting our ability to differentiate in the advertising space.\nFuel is also an important part of our overall value proposition and a key offering to help customers stretch their dollars, especially in times when fuel prices are high.\nDuring the quarter, we saw a significant increase in the number of customers actively engaging in our fuel program.\nGallons grew in the third quarter by 5%, outpacing market growth.\nThe average retail price of fuel was $3.24 this quarter versus $2.15 in the same quarter last year.\nOur cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.42, compared to $0.37 in the same quarter in 2020.\nI'd now like to spend a couple of minutes providing some additional perspective on how we are proactively managing inflation.\nWe are currently operating in a more volatile inflationary environment.\nAnd during the third quarter, Kroger saw higher product cost inflation in most categories.\nWe are being disciplined in managing these increases.\nOur teams are doing an excellent job, working to minimize the effect on our customers and our financial model by using our data and working closely with our suppliers.\nWe are passing along higher cost to the customer where it makes sense to do so.\nIn some key areas, we are choosing not to pass through cost increases and continuing to invest in value for the customer.\nWe are investing where it matters most, using our proprietary data to be strategic in our pricing and personalization with the objective of winning long-term customer loyalty.\nWe also believe our brands is an -- is an even more important differentiator for Kroger in an inflationary environment, offering customers an unmatched combination of great value and great quality.\nTurning now to our financial strategy.\nKroger is operating from a position of strength and continues to generate strong free cash flow as evidenced by our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio hitting an all-time low of 1.68 in the third quarter.\nWhile we continue to see attractive opportunities to invest in the business, to widen our competitive moat, and drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth, our capital expenditures in 2021 are now expected to be below our original guidance range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion.\nThis is because of delays in project implementations, primarily due to COVID-19-related supply challenges.\nKroger continues to return cash to shareholders.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased $297 million of shares, and year to date, have repurchased $1 billion of shares.\nSince 2000, we have now returned more than $20 billion to shareholders via share repurchases at an average price of $16.45 per share.\nAs of the end of the third quarter, $511 million remains outstanding under the current Board authorization announced on June 17, 2021.\nWe look forward to sharing more about our plans for future deployment of excess cash to drive sustainable growth and create value for our shareholders at our business update in March.\nAs Rodney mentioned, we continue to invest meaningfully in our associates.\nIn addition to the $350 million of hourly rate investment already planned this year, we have committed to further investments in the fourth quarter, which equates to an incremental $100 million on an annualized basis.\nDuring the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in our Columbus and Mid-Atlantic divisions, covering over 4,500 associates.\nWe continue to negotiate contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Houston, Lake Charles, Freeport, Dallas meat, Little Rock, Memphis, Portland, and Denver.\nOur financial results are pressured by inefficiencies in healthcare and pension costs, which most of our competitors do not face.\nWe continue to communicate with our local and international unions, which represent many of our associates about the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.\nI'll now turn to our expectations for the remainder of 2021.\nDriven by the momentum in our third quarter results and sustained trends in food at home, we are raising our full year guidance.\nWe now expect identical sales without fuel for the full year to be between negative 0.4% and negative 0.2% and a two-year identical sales stack of between 13.7% to 13.9%.\nThere remain some uncertainties as we look ahead, and our guidance of positive ID sales excluding fuel of between 1.5% to 2.5% in the fourth quarter reflects this.\nWe expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.50.\nWe expect our adjusted FIFO operating profit to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion, reflecting a two-year compounded annual growth rate of between 17% and 18.4%.\nThe midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share range for 2021 now equates to full year results, approximately in line with our 2020 results, despite cycling the unique COVID-19-related demand spike last year.\nOur guidance fully reflects the investments in our customers and associates I shared earlier, plus increased marketing to support the exciting new digital initiatives we launched in the third quarter.\nIt also reflects the latest projection for LIFO.\nAnd because we recorded a LIFO credit in the fourth quarter last year, LIFO is now expected to be a $0.13 headwind to earnings per share in the fourth quarter.\nOverall, we are very proud of our results, which are projected to be significantly ahead of where we originally guided for the year.\nIn conclusion, Kroger is executing against its key financial and operational initiatives and continues to invest in strategic priorities that will deliver attractive and sustainable total shareholder return of 8% to 11% over time.\nWe believe our business is emerging stronger through the pandemic and through the investments we are making is well-positioned to grow beyond 2021.\nKroger's strong year-to-date results are the outcome of our customer obsession, our incredible associates who bring our vision and values to life, and our commitment to bringing fresh, affordable food to everyone.\nThe strength of our teams have never been more apparent.\nWith every new challenge, they raised to the occasion, whether by implementing solutions to minimize supply chain disruptions, delivering the freshest produce to our customers, or using our data to offer personalized promotions that surprise and delight.\nOur team is bringing our competitive moats to life.\nSummary: ",

Cottrill, our CFO.\nA copy of the release has also been included in an 8-K submitted to the SEC.\nWe had a strong second quarter of fiscal 2021, with 10% net sales growth as demand and business activity remains favorable.\nI also appreciate our customers for working with us in new and imaginative ways to serve the construction markets.\nWe generated strong performance in key growth states, including Florida, the Carolinas, Tennessee, Georgia and Utah as well as more broadly across the south and southeast regions of the United States.\nAs a whole, we benefited from our national presence and geographic exposure as well as our increased residential exposure from Infiltrator and to focused homebuilder programs at ADS.\nInfiltrator once again exceeded revenue expectations with 63% sales growth in the second quarter.\nInfiltrator continues to see double-digit growth in tanks and leach field products, with particular strength in Florida, the Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee and Alabama.\nRecall the Infiltrator results are for two months of the prior year quarter, given the timing of the acquisition, which closed July 31, 2019.\nIn the residential end market, legacy ADS sales increased 15% this quarter.\nWe see favorable dynamics in new construction, repair, remodel and on-site septic.\nOrders, backlog and sales remained strong through the period, with very limited impact from the slowdown in residential starts earlier this year.\nAs a whole, we are well positioned for growth in the residential market.\nOn the front end of the cycle, the ADS products and go-to-market strategy are positioned for the land development phase, whereas Infiltrator products come in play toward the end of the cycle when construction is nearing completion.\nAdditionally, both Infiltrator and ADS have a repair and remodel component that is strong and growing its home improvement activity and existing home sales continue to rise.\nAbout 1/3 of the Infiltrator sales are related to repair and remodel, and at ADS, the repair and remodel exposure is covered through our retail and national accounts.\nThe company's exposure to the residential market has increased to 38% of domestic sales compared to 28% at this time last year.\nSales in our nonresidential end market were up modestly, led by strong growth in HP Pipe and Storm Tech retention detaching chambers as we continue to benefit from our exposure to horizontal construction.\nWe are tracking very closely to the segments of the nonresidential market that continue to do well such as data centers and warehouses as well as geographies that are experiencing growth like the southeast and Atlantic Coast.\nImportantly, we believe ADS is well positioned to continue to grow above market due to our conversion strategy, national coverage and water management solutions package.\nAnd given what we see in the market today, we believe the second half of the year will be similar to the market conditions we experienced in the first six months.\nAgriculture sales were down just slightly this quarter as we called out to a tough comparison period.\nStill, the agricultural sales team has had a great first half of fiscal 2021, with sales up 14% year-over-year.\nIn addition, the fall selling season is off to a great start as we continue to benefit from the programs we put in place around organizational changes, new product introductions and improving execution in the agriculture market.\nInternational sales increased 3%, driven by double-digit growth in our Canadian business.\nCanada is doing well across both the construction and agriculture end markets.\nMexico, on the other hand, is not performing as well and having been more significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOverall, strong demand is causing some regional and product level constraints.\nLead time and inventory levels are stretched as we get into this part of the season.\nBased on this strong demand and our desire to more fully capitalize on opportunities in our core markets, we are stepping up our capital investments, which we now expect will total between $80 million and $90 million for this fiscal year.\nThe focus of our investments will be to improve safety, increase capacity for future growth and improve productivity.\nWe will rebuild finished goods inventory in the second half of the year by level loading production at our facilities and our traditionally slow lots, preparing both ADS and Infiltrator for good customer service and normal lead times.\nThis build will depend on our second half demand, ramping up new capital and dealing with the COVID-19-related circumstances like employee retention, absenteeism and local conditions.\nFrankly, this is consistent with the environment we've been managing since the pandemic hit.\nWe are also making investments in talent, including the recent addition of a senior leader to accelerate new product introductions, marketing and innovation.\nI'm pleased to announce Brian King joined our organization in September to lead this effort as the Executive Vice President of Product Management and Marketing.\nBrian has 25 years of successful product management experience, and we're excited to have him join our team.\nMoving to our profitability results.\nWe achieved another quarter of record adjusted EBITDA during the period.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin increased 820 basis points overall with a 640 basis point increase in the legacy ADS business.\nThis was driven by favorable material costs, leverage from the growth in Pipe and Allied Products, execution of our operational initiatives and contributions from the proactive cost mitigation steps we took earlier this year.\nInfiltrator also achieved record profitability in the quarter due to strong demand, favorable material costs, contributions from our synergy programs and continued execution of their proven business model.\nThe synergy programs are right on track to achieve the run rate targets we've previously communicated.\nAs we look ahead to the second half of the year, we are optimistic as our order book, project tracking, book-to-bill ratio and backlog all remain positive.\nWe expect the normal seasonal patterns to apply to the second half of our fiscal year as installation activity slows down in geographies with colder temperatures.\nWe also have some profitability headwinds coming up in the third and the fourth quarters, including inflationary costs from materials and labor.\nWe are working to offset these headwinds through pricing actions, operational productivity initiatives and our synergy programs.\nIn summary, we did a very good job executing this quarter.\nWe're focused on safety, managing through the COVID-19 environment, servicing our customers and driving these new levels of profitable performance.\nThough uncertainty still exists regarding the broader market environment, we are well positioned to capitalize on residential development and horizontal construction while continuing to generate above-market growth through the execution of our material conversion and water management solution strategies.\nWe remain focused on disciplined execution as we look to build off a very strong first half of our fiscal 2021.\nOn slide six, we present our second quarter fiscal 2021 financial performance.\nNet sales increased 10%, with 4% growth in our legacy ADS business plus 63% growth in our Infiltrator business.\nSales growth in the legacy ADS business was led by a 15% sales growth in the residential market, which remains robust.\nAs Scott discussed, demand in our nonresidential market remains stable, with pockets of strength in horizontal construction, data centers and warehouses.\nOverall, sales were solid throughout the quarter and this trend has continued through October.\nSales grew in Infiltrator across their portfolio, driven especially by strength in their leach field and tank product lines.\nInfiltrator continued to benefit from the underlying strength in the repair and remodel market as well as growth in single-family housing.\nThis growth was further accelerated by their material conversion strategy.\nFrom a profitability standpoint, adjusted EBITDA increased $56 million or 47% compared to the prior year.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the legacy ADS business increased $33 million or 35%, with strong performance from our sales, operations, procurement and distribution teams.\nADS is very well positioned to capitalize on the current stability in our end markets due to our market-leading position, national relationships, breadth of products and services as well as our geographic and end market diversity.\nThese attributes make us the premier partner and leader in the industry and led to the margin expansion and strong financial performance in the quarter.\nInfiltrator's adjusted EBITDA increased $21 million or 86%, benefiting from strong demand, favorable pricing, lower input costs, productivity improvements as well as our synergy programs.\nMoving to slide seven.\nOur free cash flow increased $112 million to $257 million as compared to $135 million in the first half of fiscal 2020.\nThese impressive free cash flow results were driven by the strong sales growth and profitability we achieved in the first half of fiscal 2021 as well as execution on our working capital initiatives.\nOur working capital decreased to right around 20% of sales, down from 22% at this time last year.\nFurther, our trailing 12-month pro forma leverage ratio is now 1.5 times, slightly below our target range of two to 3 times leverage.\nWe ended the quarter in a very favorable liquidity position as well, with $204 million of cash and $339 million available under our revolving credit facility, bringing our total liquidity to $543 million.\nThe favorable changes we have made to our capital structure have also resulted in no significant debt maturities until 2026.\nWhile pleased with our conversion of adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow in the first half of this year, we will need to make strategic investments in working capital and capex during the second half of this year to position us to take full advantage of expected growth as well as to make the necessary investments to support our productivity initiatives at both the legacy ADS and Infiltrator businesses.\nIn addition, we continue to assess bolt-on acquisition opportunities through our disciplined acquisition process.\nFinally, on slide eight, we introduced our guidance for fiscal 2021.\nBased on our performance to date, order activity, backlog and current market trends, we currently expect net sales to be in the range of $1,790,000,000 to $1,840,000,000, representing growth of 7% to 10% over last year; adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $495 million to $515 million, representing growth of 37% to 42% over last year, and we expect to convert our adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow at a rate of around 60% for the full year, driven by our strong results as well as the investments we just discussed.\nOperator, please open the line.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Today, we will review the first quarter results of 2021.\nWith me on the phone today are Norman Schwartz, our Chief Executive Officer; Ilan Daskal, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Andy Last, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Annette Tumolo, President of the Life Science Group; and Dara Wright, President of the Clinical Diagnostics Group.\nOur actual results may differ materially from these plans and expectations, and the impact and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown.\nWe cannot be certain that Bio-Rad's responses to the pandemic will be successful, that the demand for Bio-Rad's COVID-19-related products is sustainable or that Bio-Rad will be able to meet this demand.\nOur remarks today will also include references to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted income per share, which are financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles.\nBefore I begin the detailed first quarter discussion, I would like to ask Andy Last, our Chief Operating Officer, to provide an update on Bio-Rad's operations in light of the current pandemic-related environment that we are experiencing globally.\nAs expected, COVID continues to have an impact on our operations, but as previously communicated, we have now adapted well to this environment, and our employees around the world continue to perform to the highest standards.\nWe continue our focus on the three areas previously communicated, the ongoing safety of our employees; continuing manufacturing operations to ensure product supply and support of our customers; and making sure we continue to make progress on our core strategies.\nOverall, we continue to be very pleased with our employee safety despite the increases in COVID in some areas of the world.\nOur internal COVID transmission rates remain extremely low, and we are starting to benefit from the vaccination programs.\nIn Q1, we have maintained the work from home policies we adopted in 2020 and are continuing to monitor the pandemic closely as we assess the right timing for a more general return to the workplace.\nAs we enter Q2, we expect to continue to experience the impact of the pandemic for at least the coming quarter, but are confident in our ability to meet customer demand while progressing our core strategies and new product development objectives.\nAnd as the global economy trends toward recovery, we're also paying close attention to our supply chain as accelerated demand for raw materials has the potential to cause constraints and prolong higher-than-typical logistics costs.\nProvided there is positive global progress on controlling COVID, we anticipate operations starting to return to more normal operating practice in the second half of the year.\nNow I would like to review the results of the first quarter.\nNet sales for the first quarter of 2021 were $726.8 million, which is a 27.1% increase on a reported basis versus $571.6 million in Q1 of 2020.\nOn a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 23.4%.\nThe first quarter year-over-year revenue growth was impacted by a tough compare of about $10 million revenue carryover to Q1 of 2020 related to the December 2019 cyber-attack.\nOn a geographic basis, we experienced currency-neutral growth across all three regions.\nWe continued to see strong demand for product associated with COVID-19 testing and related research.\nGenerally, we are seeing most academic and diagnostic labs now running about 90% capacity, which is an improvement to what we saw in Q4.\nWe estimate that COVID-19-related sales were about $94 million in the quarter.\nSales of the Life Science Group in the first quarter of 2021 were $366.5 million compared to $227.2 million in Q1 of 2020, which is a 61.3% increase on a reported basis, and a 56.9% increase on a currency-neutral basis.\nThe year-over-year growth in the first quarter was driven by the continued strength of COVID-19-related qPCR products.\nIn addition, we saw strong double-digit year-over-year sales growth in Droplet Digital PCR, Western Block and antibody products.\nIn addition, Process Media, which can fluctuate on a quarterly basis, saw strong double-digit year-over-year growth in the quarter over the same quarter last year.\nExcluding Process Media sales, the underlying Life Science business grew 56.2% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q1 of 2020.\nOn a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew across all regions.\nIn addition to continued adoption of Droplet Digital PCR in BioPharma, we also saw good demand for the QX ONE in wastewater testing applications for COVID, and we expedited the introduction of COVID variant assays, which are being well received.\nKey opinion leaders continue to highlight the sensitivity advantage of Droplet Digital PCR.\nSales of the Clinical Diagnostics Group in the first quarter were $358.5 million, compared to $340.3 million in Q1 of 2020, which is a 5.4% growth on a reported basis, and a 2.2% growth on a currency-neutral basis.\nDuring the first quarter, the Diagnostics Group posted solid growth in diabetes and in quality controls.\nWe started to see a recovery of market demand for non-COVID business, with diagnostics labs returning to about 90% of pre-COVID levels.\nThe recovery of routine testing and elective surgeries is still progressing.\nOn a geographic basis, the Diagnostics group posted growth in Asia.\nThe reported gross margin for the first quarter of 2021 was 55.1% on a GAAP basis, and compares to 55.5% in Q1 of 2020.\nThe current quarter gross margin percentage declined mainly due to expenses associated with the restructuring initiative that we communicated earlier this year, offset by better product mix, lower service costs and higher manufacturing utilization.\nAmortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.6 million compared to $3.9 million in Q1 of 2020.\nSG&A expenses for Q1 of 2021 were $225.9 million or 31.1% of sales compared to $193.7 million or 33.9% in Q1 of 2020.\nThe year-over-year SG&A expenses increased mainly due to expenses associated with the restructuring initiative and higher employee-related expenses, and it was offset slightly by a $5 million cybersecurity insurance settlement related to the 2019 cyber-attack as well as lower discretionary spend.\nTotal amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.4 million versus $2 million in Q1 of 2020.\nResearch and development expense in Q1 was $73.9 million or 10.2% of sales compared to $49.3 million or 8.6% in Q1 of 2020.\nThe year-over-year R&D expenses increased due to expenses associated with the restructuring initiative and increased project spend.\nQ1 operating income was $100.9 million or 13.9% of sales compared to $74.4 million or 13% in Q1 of 2020.\nLooking below the operating line.\nThe change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $1.179 billion of income to the reported results, which is substantially related to holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG.\nDuring the quarter, interest and other income resulted in net other income of $16.9 million compared to $3.3 million of expense last year.\nQ1 of 2021 included $19 million of dividend income from Sartorius, which was declared this year in Q1.\nIn 2020, the Sartorius dividend was declared in the second quarter.\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.7% compared to 23.7% in Q1 of 2020.\nThe tax rates for both periods were driven by the large unrealized gain in equity securities.\nThe year-over-year increase in our effective tax rate was due to the restructuring initiative announced earlier this year.\nReported net income for the first quarter was $977.4 million, and diluted earnings per share were $32.38.\nThis is an increase from last year and is substantially related to changes in the valuation of the Sartorius holdings.\nMoving on to the non-GAAP results.\nLooking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income.\nIn cost of goods sold, we have excluded $4.6 million of amortization of purchased intangibles, $24 million of restructuring-related expenses and a small legal reserve benefit.\nThese exclusions moved the gross margin for the first quarter of 2021 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 59% versus 55.9% in Q1 of 2020.\nNon-GAAP SG&A in the first quarter of 2021 was 25.4% versus 33.3% in Q1 of 2020.\nIn SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded restructuring-related expenses of $34.7 million, legal-related expenses of $4.4 million, and amortization of purchased intangibles of $2.4 million.\nIn R&D, we have excluded $16.9 million of restructuring-related expenses.\nThe non-GAAP R&D expense in Q1 was consequently 7.9%.\nThe cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 13.9% on a GAAP basis to 25.8% on a non-GAAP basis.\nThis non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 of 2020 of 13.9%.\nWe have also excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increasing value of the Sartorius equity holdings of $1.179 billion, and $1.8 million of loss associated with venture investments.\nOur non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.6% versus 25.7% in Q1 of 2020.\nThe tax rate was impacted by changes in the geographic mix of earnings.\nAnd finally, non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2021 was $157.4 million, or $5.21 diluted earnings per share compared to $57.6 million and $1.91 per share in Q1 of 2020.\nMoving on to the balance sheet.\nTotal cash and short-term investments at the end of Q1 were $1.025 billion, compared to $997 million at the end of 2020.\nDuring the first quarter, we purchased 89,506 shares of our stock for a total of $50 million at an average price of approximately $559 per share.\nFor the first quarter of 2021, net cash generated from operations was $114 million, which compares to $63 million in Q1 of 2020.\nThe improvement is mainly driven by higher operating profits.\nThe adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $232 million or 31.9% of sales, and excluding the Sartorius dividend, was 29.3%.\nThe adjusted EBITDA in Q1 of 2020 was $107.4 million or 18.8% of sales, which did not include the 2020 Sartorius dividend.\nNet capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2021 were $19.5 million, and depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $32.7 million.\nMoving on to the guidance.\nWe began the year with a projection of between 4.5% and 5% non-GAAP sales growth, and a non-GAAP operating margin of between 16% and 16.5%.\nEven though we continue to be uncertain about the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, given the results of the first quarter and our current outlook, we are now guiding currency-neutral revenue growth in 2021 to be between 5.5% and 6%.\nThis includes COVID-related sales, which we estimate to be between $170 million and $180 million versus our prior estimate of about $150 million and $160 million.\nWe project most of the 2021 COVID-19-related sales to occur during the first half of the year, and we continue to assume a continued gradual return to pre-pandemic activity and a more normalized business mix.\nFull year non-GAAP gross margin is now projected between 56.5% and 57% versus our previous guidance of 56.2% and 56.5%.\nAnd full year non-GAAP operating margin to be about 17%, and full year adjusted EBITDA margin to be about 22% versus previous guidance of 21%.\nSummary: ",

unum.com.\nNet income for the third quarter of 2021 included the after-tax impairment loss on internal-use software of $9.6 million or $0.05 per diluted common share, the after-tax amortization of the cost of reinsurance of $15.5 million or $0.08 per diluted common share, the net after-tax reserve decrease related to reserve assumption updates of $143.3 million or $0.70 per diluted common share, and a net after-tax realized investment loss on the Company's investment portfolio of $100,000 or a de minimis impact on earnings per diluted common share.\nNet income in the third quarter of 2020 included after-tax costs related to an organizational design update of $18.6 million or $0.09 per diluted common share, and a net after-tax realized investment gain on the Company's investment portfolio of $3.8 million or $0.01 per diluted common share.\nExcluding these items, after-tax adjusted operating income in the third quarter of 2021 was $210.5 million or $1.03 per diluted common share compared to $245.9 million or $1.21 per diluted common share in the year ago quarter.\nWe saw top-line growth in our business lines at good returns.\nWe also recognized the continued challenge that COVID presents on our near-term results.\nIt has cast a shadow on our core returns, but we still see a great business that we believe will return to the levels of profitability that we expect.\nLet me start with the overall operations before commenting on these COVID trends.\nI would first highlight that core premium growth has been steady and tracking to the expectations we previously laid out for you.\nOn a year-over-year basis in the third quarter, Unum US generated an increase in premium income of 1.2%.\nColonial Life was slightly better than breakeven, falling three previous quarters with negative comparisons, and our International lines also generated positive premium trends.\nThis premium growth momentum is building back as sales growth reemerges, persistency remains favorable, and the external environment of employment growth and wage inflation benefits our business.\nOutside of the COVID-related impacts, we remain very encouraged with the benefits experience and operating income contributions from our other business lines.\nThe supplemental and voluntary lines, Colonial Life, our International businesses and our Closed Block segment all showed generally stable results and made substantial contributions to income this quarter.\nWe're also pleased with our overall investment results this quarter.\nIt was another quarter for strong returns from our alternative investments and also another quarter of higher than normal bond call premiums.\nThe underlying credit quality of the portfolio is excellent and the investment team remains diligent in their analysis of our credits through the changing market dynamics.\nWith this backdrop of strength, we were also highly affected by the evolving nature of the COVID pandemic.\nGiven the breadth of our customer base across the U.S., we have seen this quarter we have been impacted by the resurgence of higher infections, hospitalizations and mortality brought on by the Delta variant.\nAs we have discussed throughout the pandemic, the best way to monitor COVID's impact on our results is to follow national mortality and infection rates.\nDifferently in this quarter, we also need to focus on how the demographics of the incremental mortality relate specifically to our customer base.\nTo put it in context, in the third quarter, the U.S. experienced a significant increase in national COVID mortality counts to approximately 94,000 lives, which is almost double the 52,000 in the second quarter.\nThe dramatic increase over the course of the third quarter occurred very rapidly and consistently throughout the quarter.\nIn fact, just 90 days ago, most experts were estimating a third quarter mortality count of approximately 44,000 deaths, an estimate that has more than doubled over the course of the quarter.\nThe absolute increase in mortality has certainly been impactful to our industry and for us, most notably in our Unum US group life business, although we also saw impacts in our voluntary benefits lines.\nBeyond the higher mortality counts in aggregate, data from the CDC also shows that the third quarter working-aged individuals comprised approximately 40% of the COVID-related mortality, double that of the fourth quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 2021 before vaccinations began to widely be available.\nThis shift in demographics impacts us three-fold.\nFirst, we announced the higher impacts in the working-age population, our primary customers who are covered by our group and voluntary products.\nIn addition, these younger working-aged individuals tend to have higher benefit amounts that we saw before.\nAn additional, but smaller impact that we see is that Delta -- the Delta variant has brought on a resurgence of infections and hospitalizations, leading quickly to higher claims at our short-term disability business and pressure on our group disability benefit ratio.\nWhile COVID impacts are evident in our results this quarter, we believe as the pandemic continues to come better under control with increased vaccinations and advanced treatments, then we will see a strong reemergence of growth and profitability in our business.\nThe recovery from COVID has been delayed longer than we anticipated by the Delta variant, but we do expect to see a recovery ahead.\nIt is because of that view that we're excited to begin to deploy a portion of the Company's excess capital in a way that we believe can create value for our shareholders.\nWe start first with a capital position that remains very healthy with holding Company cash of $1.6 billion and weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. -- U.S.-based life insurance companies at approximately 380%.\nThis gives us the opportunity to begin to deploy a portion of that capital to enhance shareholder value, while also maintaining a healthy position for opportunities that could materialize in the future.\nLast week, we were pleased to announce the $250 million share repurchase authorization approved by our Board, which we intend to initiate in the fourth quarter with an execution of an accelerated share repurchase of $50 million.\nWe expect to continue the program through the end of 2022.\nIn addition to buying shares, we also plan to accelerate recognition of the premium deficiency reserve for the Long-Term Care Block by a similar amount over this same timeframe.\nWe see value in accelerating the recognition ahead of the original seven-year schedule and could see its completion as early as the end of 2024 under certain market conditions.\nEven with the additional capital we plan to allocate to share buybacks and accelerated PDR recognition, we will continue to maintain a strong capital position and flexibility.\nWhile we remain optimistic over the long-term, given the volatility of the pandemic, we will move our traditional December Analyst Meeting to the first quarter of 2022 to discuss with you our full-year outlook.\nThe area to stay focused on is our continued premium growth in our core business lines looking into 2022, as well as the impact of our capital deployment plans.\nWe expect the impact of the pandemic to subside over the course of next year, but we do expect fourth quarter of this year to be impacted similarly to the third quarter.\nWe are watching the national numbers as are all of you, and as the Delta wave subsides, we look to return to the growth and profitability we believe that we can deliver.\nNow, I'll ask Steve to cover the details of the third quarter results.\nI will also describe our adjusted operating income results by segment, excluding the impacts from our GAAP reserve assumption updates.\nThe biggest component of the actuarial reserve review was the release of $215 million before tax in the Unum US long-term disability line.\nClaim reserves should represent our best estimate of the future liability, and since the last GAAP reserve review, investments in our operations have impacted our claims management and resulted in improvements in claim recoveries over the past several years, which we now believe are sustainable.\nAs such, these reserves have been adjusted to better reflect the expected costs of claims.\nThis reserve update will have little impact on our forward expectations for earnings from this line or the expected benefit ratio.\nThe reserve review also determined that reserves should be increased in three lines within the Closed Block reporting segment.\nFor the Closed Group Pension Block, policy reserves were increased by $25.1 million before tax.\nFor the Closed Disability Block, claim reserves were increased by $6.4 million before tax.\nAnd finally for Long-Term Care, claim reserves were increased by $2.1 million before tax.\nAlthough the net of these reserve updates are excluded from adjusted operating income, they did contribute $0.70 per share to the Company's book value.\nI'll start the discussion of our operating results with the Unum US segment, where COVID significantly impacted our results this quarter, driving higher mortality and a higher average claim size in the group life business and higher short-term disability claims in the group disability business.\nFor the third quarter in the Unum US segment, adjusted operating income was $88.5 million compared to $179.3 million in the second quarter.\nWithin the Unum US segment, the group disability line reported adjusted operating income, excluding the reserve assumption updates of $39.5 million in the third quarter compared to $59.9 million in the second quarter.\nThe primary driver of the decline was an increase in the benefit ratio to 78.9% in the third quarter compared to 74.7% in the second quarter, which was primarily driven by increased claims in the short-term disability line related to the COVID Delta variant and the current external environment.\nPremium income declined slightly on a sequential quarter basis, but we were pleased to see an uptick in growth to 2.6% on a year-over-year basis.\nWhile short-term disability results were challenged this quarter, our long-term disability line performed in line with our expectations as new claim incidence showed an increase mostly driven by the flow-through of STD claims to LTD status, which was offset by continued strong claim recoveries.\nIt is likely that we will continue to see an elevated overall group disability benefit ratio as COVID and the current external environment continue to impact our STD results.\nWe do feel that COVID is a key driver of the higher benefit ratio for the group disability line and that as direct COVID impacts lessen over the first part of next year, we will see improvement in the benefit ratio.\nAdjusted operating income for Unum US group life and AD&D declined to a loss of $67.1 million in the third quarter from income of $5.2 million in the second quarter.\nThis quarter-to-quarter decline of roughly $70 million was largely driven by the changing impacts from COVID that Rick described in his comments.\nWe were impacted by the deterioration in COVID-related mortality from our reported 52,000 national deaths in the second quarter to approximately 94,000 in the third quarter along with the age demographic shifting to higher impacts on younger working-aged individuals.\nEstimated COVID-related excess mortality claims for our Group Life Block increased from approximately 800 claims in the second quarter to over 1,900 claims in the third quarter.\nAccordingly, our results reflect mortality to level that represents approximately 2% of the reported national figures compared to a 1% rate experienced through 2020 when mortality was more pronounced in the elderly population.\nWith a higher percentage of working-age individuals being impacted, we also experienced higher average benefit size, which increased from around $55,000 in the second quarter to over $60,000 this quarter.\nFinally, non-COVID-related mortality did not materially impact results in the third quarter relative to the experience of the second quarter.\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, our current expectation is for U.S. COVID-related mortality to continue to worsen to approximately 100,000 deaths.\nWith continued higher mortality among working-aged individuals, we believe that group life results will remain under pressure with the expected fourth quarter loss similar, if not potentially worse than the experience of the third quarter.\nNow looking at the Unum US supplemental and voluntary lines, adjusted operating income totaled $116.1 million in the third quarter compared to $114.2 million in the second quarter, both very good quarters that generated adjusted operating returns on equity in excess of 17%.\nLooking at the three primary business lines.\nFirst, we remain very pleased with the performance of individual disability recently issued block of business which has generated strong results throughout the pandemic.\nWe continue to see very favorable new claim incidence trends and recovery levels in this block.\nThe voluntary benefits line reported a strong level of income as well, though income was slightly lower on a quarter-to-quarter comparison.\nThe uptick in the benefit ratio in the third quarter to 46.6% from 44.2% in the second quarter was driven by increased COVID-related life insurance claims, which offset generally favorable results in the other VB product lines.\nFinally, utilization in the dental and vision line improved, leading to an improvement in the benefit ratio to 75% this quarter from 77.1% in the second quarter.\nLooking now at premium trends and drivers, total new sales for Unum US increased 7.7% in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis compared to the declines that we experienced in the first half of the year.\nFor the employee benefit lines which do include LTD, STD, group life, AD&D and stop-loss, total sales declined by 2.5% this quarter, primarily driven by lower sales in a large case market and generally flat sales in the core market, which are those -- which are those markets under 2,000 [Phonetic] lines.\nSales trends in our supplemental and voluntary lines rebounded strongly in the quarter, increasing 21.8% in total when compared to the year ago quarter.\nWe saw sharp year-over-year increases in the recently issued individual disability line up 22.9% and in the dental and vision line up 48.2%.\nVoluntary benefit sales also recovered following lower year-over-year comparisons in recent quarters, growing 13.7% in the third quarter.\nWe also saw overall favorable persistency trends for our major product lines in Unum US.\nOur group lines aggregated together showed a slight uptick to 89.4% for the first three quarters of 2021 compared to 89.1% last year.\nBoth the voluntary benefits and dental and vision lines also showed year-over-year improvements, while the individual disability line declined slightly.\nThe solid persistency numbers and improving sales trends provide a good tailwind for premium growth as we wrap up this year and move into 2022.\nNow let's move on to the Unum International segment.\nWe had very good -- we had a very good quarter with adjusted operating income for the third quarter of $27.4 million compared to $24.8 million in the second quarter, a continuation of the improving trend in income over the past several quarters.\nThe primary driver of these results is our Unum UK business, which generated adjusted operating income of GBP18.4 million in the third quarter compared to GBP16.8 million in the second quarter.\nThe reported benefit ratio for Unum UK improved to 79.2% in the third quarter from 82.5% in the second quarter.\nThe underlying benefits experience was favorable for our Group Income Protection Block, primarily due to lower new claim incidence through -- though claim recoveries continue to lag our expectations somewhat.\nThe Group Life Block experienced adverse mortality primarily from non-COVID-related claims incidence and higher average size.\nWe did not see much impact this quarter from COVID in our UK Life Block.\nBenefits experience in Unum Poland was also favorable this quarter helping generate a slight improvement in adjusted operating income.\nPremium growth for our International businesses was also favorable this quarter compared to a year ago.\nLooking at the growth on a year-over-year basis and in local currency to neutralize the benefit we saw from the higher exchange rate, Unum UK generated growth of 2.9% with strong persistency and the continued successful placement of rate increases on our in-force block.\nAdditionally, sales in Unum UK rebounded in the third quarter, increasing 40.2% over last year.\nUnum Poland also generated growth of 12.5%, a continuation of the low double-digit premium growth this business has been producing.\nNext, results for Colonial Life are in line with our expectations for the third quarter with adjusted operating income of $80.1 million compared to the record quarterly income of $95.8 million in the second quarter.\nAs with our other U.S.-based life insurance businesses, Colonial's life insurance block was negatively impacted by COVID-related mortality, which was the primary driver in pushing the benefit ratio to 55.9% in the third quarter compared to 51.7% in the second quarter.\nWe estimate that adverse COVID-related claims experienced in the life block impacted results by approximately $16 million, the worst impact we have seen from COVID throughout the pandemic and a level that is likely to persist through the fourth quarter.\nExperience in the other lines being accident, sickness and disability and cancer and critical illness remained in line with our expectation and continue to drive strong earnings for this segment.\nAdditionally, net investment income increased 25% on a sequential basis in the third quarter, largely reflecting unusually large bond call activity this quarter.\nWe do not expect the benefit from bond calls to net investment income to continue at this level in the fourth quarter.\nWe were very pleased with the improving trend we are seeing in premium growth for Colonial Life, which was flat this quarter on a year-over-year basis after showing year-over-year declines in each of the past three quarters.\nDriving this improving trend in premiums is a continuing rebound in sales activity at Colonial Life increasing 28.6% on a year-over-year basis this quarter and now showing a 21.1% increase for the first three quarters of 2021 relative to last year.\nPersistency for Colonial Life continues to show an encouraging trend at 78.9% for the first three quarters of 2021, more than a point higher than a year ago.\nIn the Closed Block segment, adjusted operating income which does include -- which excludes the reserve assumption updates and the amortization of cost of reinsurance related to the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction that did fully close earlier this year was $109.8 million in the third quarter and $111.2 million in the second quarter, both very strong results driven by favorable overall benefits experience in both the Long-Term Care line and Closed Disability Block, and strong levels of investment income to -- due to higher than expected levels of miscellaneous investment income, which I will cover in more detail in a moment.\nLooking within the Closed Block, the LTC Block continues to produce results that are quite favorable to our long-term assumptions.\nThe interest adjusted loss ratio in the third quarter was 74.8% and over the past four quarters is 71.8%, which are both well below our longer-term expectation of 85% to 90%.\nIn the third quarter, we continue to see higher mortality experience in the claimant block, where accounts were approximately 5% higher than expected which is similar to our experience in the second quarter.\nLTC submitted claims activity was higher in the third quarter, though much of the increase has not resulted in significant ongoing claim costs.\nLooking out to the end of 2021 and into 2022, we do anticipate that the interest adjusted loss ratio for LTC will likely trend closer, though slightly favorable to our long-term assumption range, as mortality and incidence trends continue to normalize from the impacts of COVID.\nFor the Closed Disability Block, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 58.2% in the third quarter compared to 69.6% in the second quarter, both very favorable results for this line.\nThe underlying experience on the retained block, which largely reflects the active life reserve cohort and certain other smaller claim blocks we retained performed very favorably relative to our expectations, primarily due to lower submitted claims again this quarter.\nSo overall, it was a very strong performance again this quarter for the Closed Block segment.\nHigher miscellaneous investment income continues to contribute to the strong adjusted operating income for the segment, driven by both higher than average bond call premiums, as well as strong performance in our alternative asset portfolio.\nLooking ahead, we estimate the quarterly adjusted operating income for this segment will over time run within a range of $45 million to $55 million, assuming more normal trends for investment income and claim results in the LTC and Closed Disability lines.\nFirst, we saw a high level of bond calls again this quarter as many companies refinanced higher coupon debt and took advantage of today's favorable credit market conditions.\nWe recorded approximately $20 million in higher investment income from bond calls this quarter relative to our historic -- our historical quarterly averages.\nThe Closed Block and Colonial Life segments were the primary beneficiaries of higher investment income this quarter.\nUnum US was in line with historic averages, but lower this quarter than what we received in the second quarter.\nWhile these calls enhance current period investment income, they are volatile from quarter-to-quarter.\nSecond, we continue to see strong performance in our alternative investment portfolio, which earned $38.2 million in the third quarter, following earnings of $51.9 million recorded in the second quarter.\nBoth quarters are well above the expected quarterly income on the portfolio of $12 million to $14 million.\nThe higher returns this quarter were generated from all three of our main sectors being credit, real estate and private equity, and reflected the strong financial markets and strong economic growth.\nIt is hard to predict quarterly returns for miscellaneous investment income, but for the fourth quarter, we believe that they will moderate to our expected quarterly returns.\nMoving now to capital, the financial of the Company continues to be in great shape, providing a significant financial flexibility.\nThe weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. insurance companies improved to approximately 380%, and holding company cash was $1.6 billion as of the end of the third quarter, both of which are well above our targeted levels.\nIn addition, leverage has trended lower with equity growth and is now 25.7%.\nAs Rick mentioned, we're very pleased to clarify our capital deployment plans for the balance of 2021 and for 2022.\nFor context, with the capital measures that I just discussed, we are in a very strong capital position with substantial financial flexibility.\nOur strategy for deployment has not changed and our priorities remain consistent, including first, funding growth in our core businesses; second, supporting our LTC Block; third, executing opportunistic acquisitions that support our long-term growth; and fourth, returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\nWe began to roll our plans out last week with the announcement of the authorization by our Board of Directors and to repurchase up to $250 million of our shares by the end of 2022.\nWe plan to begin this program with the execution of an accelerated share repurchase of $50 million in the fourth quarter.\nWe also plan to allocate capital to accelerate the recognition of the premium deficiency reserve for the LTC Block by a similar amount by the end of 2022.\nWe feel that this combination strikes a good balance of repurchasing our shares at what we believe are very attractive prices, while also fully fund in the PDR ahead of the original 2026 target to help lessen the valuation drag on our stock from the LTC exposure.\nWith this additional deployment of capital, we continue to project having a very solid capital position at the end of 2022 with holding company cash around $1 billion and an RBC ratio well above our target.\nNow shifting topics, I wanted to give you a brief update on our progress in adopting ASC 944 or Long Duration Targeted Improvements.\nAs a reminder, this accounting pronouncement applies only to GAAP basis financial statements and has no economic statutory accounting or cash flow impacts to the business.\nWe continue to feel good about our readiness to adopt the pronouncement as of January 1, 2023, and we'll be sharing some qualitative information in our Form 10-Q filing, which is later today.\nAlthough we continue to evaluate the effects of complying with this update, we do expect that the most significant impact of the transition date will be the requirement to update our liability discount rate with one that is generally equivalent to a single A interest rate.\nWe expect this will result in a material decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income and primarily be driven by the difference between the expected interest rates from our investment strategy and interest rates indicative of a single A rated portfolio.\nAs we continue to progress our work, we plan to provide updates to you in 2022 as we near adoption.\nSo let me close with an update on our expectations for the remainder of 2021.\nWith COVID-related mortality expected to increase further in the fourth quarter to approximately 100,000 nationwide deaths, we expect to see similar, if not slightly worse trends for mortality impacts on our life insurance businesses in the fourth quarter than we did experience in the third quarter.\nThe Unum US group disability benefit ratio is also likely to remain elevated due to continued high levels of STD claims.\nIn addition, we do not anticipate miscellaneous investment income to be as strong in the fourth quarter as it was in this quarter.\nThese impacts will likely pressure our fourth quarter results relative to what we experienced here in the third quarter.\nAs Rick mentioned, we plan to update you on our 2022 outlook during the first quarter of 2022 when we expect to have a more informed view of COVID mortality and infection trends.\nWe feel confident that premium growth in our core business segments in 2022 can build off of the momentum that began to reemerge this year and then we'll also see the benefits of executing our share buyback authorization.\nWith that said, future COVID trends will be a very important factor in our expected benefits experience.\nWe do continue to be pleased with the operational performance of the Company through what has been an extraordinary environment.\nWe believe we're really well positioned to benefit from today's strong business conditions and we have to remain vigilant as COVID-related mortality and infection rates continue to persist.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC.\nI'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\nAMETEK had another outstanding quarter, with better than expected sales growth, strong operating performance, and earnings above our expectations.\nWe established records for sales, EBITDA, operating income, and earnings per share in the quarter.\nDemand remained strong across our diverse set of end markets, leading to robust order growth, and a record backlog.\nWhile the global supply chain and logistics networks remain challenging, our businesses are doing a tremendous job navigating these issues and delivering results which exceeded our expectations.\nGiven our results in the third quarter and outlook for the fourth quarter, we are again increasing our sales and earnings guidance for the full year.\nThis strong overall performance reflects the exceptional work of all AMETEK colleagues, as well as the strength, flexibility, and sustainability of the AMETEK growth model.\nAMETEK's proven business model is central to our focus on creating a sustainable future for all stakeholders.\nWe are very proud of the important steps we're taking to further sustainability across AMETEK.\nAnd last week, we published our latest Corporate Sustainability Report to highlight our efforts in this area.\nThis report provides information on our sustainability initiatives, the strong progress we have made, and the commitments we are making to create a better future.\nNow let me turn to our third-quarter results.\nThird-quarter sales were a record $1.44 billion, up 28% over the same period in 2020, and above our expectations.\nOrganic sales growth was 17%, acquisitions added 11 points, and foreign currency was a modest benefit in the quarter.\nOverall orders in the third quarter were $1.55 billion, an increase of 37% over the prior-year period.\nWhile organic orders were up an impressive 30% in the quarter.\nWe ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.62 billion, which is up over $800 million from the start of the year.\nThird quarter operating income was a record $338 million, a 25% increase over the third quarter of 2020, and operating margins were 23.4%.\nExcluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core operating margins were 24.7%, up 70 basis points versus the third quarter of 2020.\nEBITDA in the third quarter was a record $415 million, up 25% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins of 28.8%.\nThis outstanding performance led to record earnings of $1.26 per diluted share.\nUp 25% over the third quarter of 2020, and above our guidance range of $1.16 to $1.18.\nWe continue to generate strong levels of cash flow, with third-quarter operating cash flow of $307 million, and free cash flow conversion of 109% of net income.\nOverall tremendous results in a challenging operating environment.\nNext, let me provide some additional details at the operating group level.\nFirst, the Electronic Instruments Group.\nSales for AIG were a record $982 million, up 31% over last year's third quarter.\nOrganic sales were up 15%, acquisitions added 16%, and foreign currency was a modest headwind.\nWhile growth remains broad-based, growth was particularly strong across our Ultra Precision Technologies, and our Power and Industrial businesses.\nAIG's third-quarter operating income was a record $245 million, up 20% versus the same quarter last year, and operating margins were 25%.\nExcluding acquisitions, AIG's core margins were excellent at 27.2% in line with prior year margins.\nThe Electromechanical Group also delivered outstanding sales growth and excellent operating performance.\nThird-quarter sales increased 21% versus the prior year to $459 million.\nOrganic sales were up 20%, and currency added one point to growth.\nGrowth remained strong across all of the MG, with our automation businesses again delivering notably strong growth in the quarter.\nEMG's operating income in the quarter was a record $115 million, up a robust 36% compared to the prior-year period.\nEMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 270 basis points to a record 25%.\nNow, switching to our acquisition strategy.\nAMETEK has had an excellent year with a record level of capital deployment, leading to the acquisition of 5 highly strategic businesses.\nAMETEK is supported, approximately $1.85 billion on acquisitions, thus far this year, reflecting the strength of AMETEK's acquisition strategy and our ability to identify and acquire highly strategic companies.\nOur proven operating capability allows us to drive meaningful improvements across our acquired companies, resulting in outstanding returns on capital.\nGenerating strong returns on capital deployed is critical to long-term sustainable growth, an important element of AMETEK strategy.\nAMETEK's strong cash flow generation continues to support our capital deployment strategy, our acquisition pipeline remains very active, our M&A team continue to work diligently, identifying attractive acquisition opportunities, and we expect to remain busy over the coming quarters.\nWe also remain focused on investing back into our businesses to support their organic growth initiatives, including in support of their new product development efforts.\nIn the third quarter, we invested over $75 million in RD&E.\nAnd for all of 2021, we now expect to invest approximately $300 million or approximately 5.5% of sales.\nThrough these investments, our businesses develop unique and highly differentiated solutions that help solve our customers' most complex challenges.\nOne such example is a new product introduction from AMETEK Gatan.\nGatan is a leading provider of direct detection technology, for Elektron microscopy [phonetic], supporting high-end research and materials and life sciences applications.\nGatan recently introduced The Stela hybrid pixel camera, the only fully integrated hybrid pixel electron detector with the Gatan microscopy [phonetic] suite.\nThis new product reinforces Gatan's leadership position, providing the highest quality TEM diffraction camera, allowing the user to perform 4D stem analysis for the rapid speed and high dynamic range.\nGatan's new camera builds on a long history of disruptive and award-winning technology.\nIn August, The Stela Cameron was awarded the 2021 [indecipherable] today Innovation Award, and called one of the ten game changing products and methods.\nI would like to congratulate the team at Gatan for the recent launch of The Stela camera, and further support of important research applications.\nNow, let me touch on the supply chain issues.\nThe global supply chain remains challenging, we see extended lead times for a broad range of materials and components with logistics issues, and labor availability adding to the complexity.\nWhile these difficulties exist, we exceeded our sales estimates for the quarter, and are navigating the challenging environment well, given our agile operating approach.\nThe supply chain issues are leading to higher inflation.\nHowever, given our differentiation, we're able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing, leading to a strong price inflation spread.\nWhile we expect these challenges will continue into 2022, we remain well positioned to navigate the issues, given the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK growth model.\nMoving to our updated outlook for the remainder of 2021.\nGiven our strong performance in the third quarter, and the continued strong orders momentum and record backlog, we have again raised our 2021 sales and earnings guidance.\nFor the full year, we now expect overall sales to be up in the low 20% range, versus our previous guide up approximately 20%.\nOrganic sales are now expected to be up low-double digits on a percentage basis over 2020, as compared to our previous guides of approximately 10%.\nDiluted earnings per share for 2021 are now expected to be in the range of $4.76 to $4.78, an increase of approximately 21% over 2020 is comparable basis, and above our prior guide of $4.62 to $4.86 per diluted share.\nFor the fourth quarter, we anticipate that overall sales will be up in the low 20% range versus last year's fourth quarter.\nFourth-quarter earnings per diluted share are expected to be between $1.28 to $1.30 of 19% to 20% over last year's fourth quarter.\nIn summary, AMETEK's third-quarter results were excellent.\nOur teams continue to execute, and our businesses are performing well.\nOur performance through a challenging environment shows the resilience and strength of the AMETEK growth model.\nThe asset-light nature of our businesses, our leading positions in attractive niche markets, and our world-class workforce will continue to drive long-term sustainable success.\nThe proven nature of the AMETEK growth model continues to drive long-term success for all of AMETEK's stakeholders.\nAs Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered excellent results in the third quarter, with continued strong sales growth, and orders growth, and outstanding operating performance.\nLet me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter.\nThird-quarter general and administrative expenses were $22.1 million dollars, up $4.8 million from the prior year, largely due to higher compensation expenses.\nAs a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.5% for the quarter, unchanged from the prior year.\nFor 2021, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up approximately $18 million, driven by higher compensation costs were approximately 1.5% of sales, also unchanged from the prior year.\nThird-quarter other income and expense was better by approximately $4 million versus last year's third quarter, driven by a $6 million or approximately $0.02 per share gain on the sale of a small product line in the quarter.\nThis gain on the sale was more than offset by a higher effective tax rate in the quarter of 19.5%, up from 17.5% in the same quarter last year.\nFor 2021, we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 19.5% and 20%, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full-year estimated rate.\nWorking capital in the quarter was 14.9% of sales, down 210 basis points from the 17%, reported in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses, and managing working capital.\nCapital expenditures in the third quarter were $26 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million for the full year.\nDepreciation and amortization expense in the third quarter was $75 million, for all of 2021 we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $295 million including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $138 million or $0.60 per diluted share.\nWe continue to generate strong levels of cash given our asset-light business model and working capital management efforts.\nIn the third quarter, operating cash flow was $307 million, and free cash flow was $281 million.\nWith free cash flow conversion, 109% of net income.\nTotal debt at quarter-end was $2.65 billion, up less than $250 million from the end of 2020, despite having deployed approximately $1.85 billion on acquisitions, thus far in 2021.\nOffsetting this debt with cash and cash equivalents of $359 million?\nIn the quarter-end, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.6 times, and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.4 times.\nWe continue to have excellent financial capacity and flexibility with approximately $2.25 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.\nTo summarize our businesses drove outstanding results in the third quarter, and throughout the first 9 months of 2021.\nOur balance sheet and tremendous cash flow generation, have positioned the company for significant growth in the coming quarters, and years.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Our consolidated earnings for the first quarter of 2021 were $0.98 per diluted share compared to $0.72 for the first quarter of 2020.\nNow, I'll turn the discussion over to Dennis.\nYet we know it could still be a while before we're able to return to the offices or settle into any type of new normal.\nIn the meantime, we'll continue to provide care and compassion for those who are struggling to make ends meet through energy assistance programs, through payment arrangements, and even COVID-19 debt relief grants.\nI am extremely proud of our employees, despite these unique times, they have adapted easily and continue to move our business forward on all fronts.\nThe quarterly results, we are sharing with you today demonstrate their drive and determination to get the job done.\nRecently, we've taken steps to move us toward a clean energy future.\nA few weeks ago, we announced our aspirational goal to reduce our carbon emissions for natural gas by setting new natural gas goal of being carbon-neutral by 2045, with a near-term goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030.\nOur strategy to achieve lower emissions includes investing in new technologies like renewable gas, RNG, which is RNG hydrogen or other renewable biofuels.\nWe're evaluating how to best integrate RNG into our gas supply portfolio and researching hydrogen as another renewable fuel.\nWe will also focus on reducing consumption through conservation and energy efficiency and improving our infrastructure.\nWe realize this is a heavy lift.\nThere are several critical pieces that will need to fall into place in the coming years.\nTechnology costs must come down, new innovations need to occur, and regulatory support will be necessary for us to achieve these goals.\nAs we identify our strategies keeping costs affordable will be a priority.\nWe're committed to executing on this goal in ways that support affordability and reliability for our customers.\nOur natural gas goal demonstrates that our vision of a clean energy future income consists both electric and natural gas resources.\nAnd then we are dedicated to reducing greenhouse gases from the energy we deliver to our customers.\nWe're also moving the dial toward achieving our clean electricity goal of providing customers with carbon-neutral electricity by the end of 2027, and carbon-free electricity by 2045.\nLast month, we entered into a contract with the Chelan County Public Utility District that will add more renewable hydropower to our electric generation portfolio.\nThe contract delivers on the strategies included in the 2021 Electric Integrated Resource Plan that we filed recently and also supports the goals of Washington State's Clean Energy Transformation Act or CETA.\nIn regards to our quarterly results, we're off to a good start in 2021, and we are on track to meet our earnings targets for the full year.\nAvista Utilities' earnings were better than expected while AEL&P's earnings met expectations for the first quarter, and our other businesses exceeded our expectations.\nThat new law will help transform the regulation of electric and natural gas companies toward multi-year rate plans and take the first steps toward performance-based rate-making.\nThe benefits we see with the passage of this important legislation is a requirement to file multi-year rate plans from two to four years in length with the foundation of the rate plan being set using methodologies the commission may use to minimize regulatory lag.\nUltimately, it will require current and future commissioners to implement the change, but we feel this is an important first step toward progressing the regulatory model in the State of Washington.\nMeanwhile, here's an update on our regulatory filings in January.\nAs you know, we filed two-year general rate cases in Idaho, one for electric, one for gas.\nAnd in 2020, we filed general rate cases in Washington again, one for electric and gas.\nWe continue to work through the regulatory process in these jurisdictions.\nIn Oregon, we expect to file a rate case in the second half of 2021.\nWe reached a significant milestone in our focus on electric transportation when the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission approved three tariffs that allow us to proceed with several programs outlined in our transportation-electrification plan.\nAmong other things, the UTC's approval allows us to establish both an optional general service and large commercial electric vehicle rates which will help us enable and accelerate fleet electrification for commercial customers such as the Spokane Transit Authority.\nOur transportation, electrification plan and newly approved tariffs will serve as a valuable model for others.\nAnd it's a great example of our industries' role in electric transportation and our clean energy future.\nOnce again, Avista is leading the way.\nLooking ahead, we remain focused on running the great utility and continue to invest prudent capital to maintain and update our infrastructure and provide reliable energy service to our customers.\nWe are confirming our 2021 through 2023 earnings guidance.\nSo last night, my Blackhawks were eliminated from the playoffs.\nSo we have five more games left, but we have no chance for postseason play this year.\nSo that's a sad day for me.\nBut on the happy note, we had a great first quarter, the Avista Utilities contributed $0.92 per diluted share compared to $0.68 last year.\nAnd compared to the prior year, our earnings benefited from higher utility margin.\nAnd we had general rate increases and customer growth.\nThe first quarter also included an accrual -- the first quarter of the prior year had some negative accruals in it related to the Washington remand case, a 2015 case, and disallowances around Colstrip in an accrual for the Colstrip community fund.\nThat all happened in 2020 that were drags on 2020 earnings.\nThe ERM in Washington with a pre-tax benefit of $4.3 million in the first quarter compared to $5.2 million in the first quarter of 2020.\nWe continue to be committed to investing the necessary capital in our utility infrastructure, and we expect Avista Utilities' capital expenditures to total about $415 million in 2021.\nWith respect to liquidity on April 5 of 2021, we repaid the outstanding balance of our one-year credit agreement that we entered into in April of 2020, and that was to remind you to make sure we had sufficient liquidity at the start of the pandemic.\nOn April 30, we had $182 million of available liquidity under our $400 million line of credit, and we expect to extend that line of credit into a multi-year deal in the second quarter.\nWe expect to issue approximately $120 million of long-term debt in 2021, and $75 million of equity.\nAs Dennis mentioned earlier, we are confirming our 2021, 2022, and 2023 earnings guidance with consolidated ranges of $1.96 to $2.16 per diluted share in '21, $2.18 to $2.38 in 2022, and $2.42 to $2.62 in 2023.\nAnd this puts us on track to earning our allowed return by 2023.\nOur guidance does assume timely and appropriate rate relief in all of our jurisdictions.\nOur '21 earnings guidance reflects again unrecovered structural cost estimated to reduce our return on equity by approximately 70 basis points.\nAnd in addition, our '21 guidance reflects a regulatory timing lag estimated to reduce our equity return by approximately 100 basis points.\nThis results in a return on equity for Avista Utilities of approximately 7.7% in 2021.\nWe are currently forecasting customer growth of about 1% annually for Avista Utilities.\nFor 2021, Avista Utilities is expected to contribute in the range of $1.93 to $2.07 per diluted share with the midpoint of our guidance range, not including any expense or benefit under the Energy Recovery Mechanism.\nOur current expectation is to be in the 75% customer, 25% Company sharing band, which is expected to add approximately $0.06 per diluted share.\nFor 2021, we expect AEL&P to contribute in the range of $0.08 to $0.11 per diluted share, and our outlook for both Avista Utilities and AEL&P assumes among other variables normal precipitation and slightly below normal about 92% for Avista Utilities hydroelectric generation for the year.\nFor 2021, we expect our other businesses to be between a loss of $0.05 to $0.02 per diluted share.\nOur guidance generally includes only normal operating conditions and does not include any unusual or non-recurring items until the effects of such items are known and measurable.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Today's call will be led by Chief Executive Officer, Doug Dietrich and Chief Financial Officer, Matt Garth.\nAnd I'll also point out the Safe Harbor disclaimer on this slide.\nStatements related to future performance by members of our team are subject to these limitations, cautionary remarks and conditions.\nWe appreciate you taking the time to join today's call and I hope you are all staying safe and healthy.\nLet me outline a brief agenda for the call.\nI'll begin by taking you through our third quarter highlights, including improving trends in our sales results, strengthened operational and financial profile, and progress made on the business development front.\nFirst, I want to comment on the 8-K we filed this week related to a ransomware attack we recently experienced which impacted access to some of our company's IT systems.\nWe have procedures and protocols in place for situations like this.\nImmediately after detecting the incident, we implemented our comprehensive cyber security response plan, including taking steps to isolate and carefully restore our network to resume normal operations as quickly as possible.\nWe've notified law enforcement and have been working with industry-leading cyber security experts to conduct a thorough investigation.\nThroughout this situation, we operated our facilities safely and met our customer commitments.\nBefore going through the third quarter review, I'd like to note that I'm very pleased with how our global team and businesses have performed in what continues to be a complex and challenging environment.\nWe remain focused on managing our company with an unwavering commitment to keeping our employees safe, operating our plants efficiently and serving our customers with value-added products.\nDedication, engagement and resilience of our employees has been nothing short of exemplary during these times.\nLet me take you through how our third quarter unfolded.\nAs we previewed in July, we anticipated that demand conditions in our end markets would improve with the second quarter having the most acute impacts from COVID-19, and that's largely how the quarter played out as we were prepared to respond to the volume recovery, which led to sequential sales growth in nearly all of our product lines.\nOverall, we had a solid quarter from an operational and commercial standpoint.\nThese results reflect our team's disciplined execution related to cost control, pricing and productivity, which resulted in higher sequential and year-over-year operating margins.\nWe also demonstrate how our strong product portfolio and end market mix has enabled us to capture opportunities with existing and new customers.\nFrom a financial perspective, total sales in the quarter were $388 million, an increase of about 9% sequentially, but still at lower levels compared to last year.\nAs we indicated on our last call, our July sales were trending upwards and demand conditions in several markets continued to strengthen throughout the rest of the quarter.\nWe generated $52 million of operating income and earnings per share were $0.92.\nIn addition, we delivered $54 million in cash from operations, continuing our solid cash generation profile.\nAfter experiencing volatile conditions in our businesses that serve industrial-related end markets through the second quarter, we saw considerable demand improvements in the third quarter, one with continued strength in our consumer-oriented product lines.\nLet me touch on some of the highlights.\nMetalcasting business continued to rebound as our foundry customers in North America ramped up production to meet the demand increase in the automotive sector.\nAt the end of the third quarter, our Metalcasting facilities were operating at about 95% of last year's levels, a noticeable improvement from the reduced levels seen earlier.\nIn addition, penetration of our pre-blended products remains on a strong growth trajectory in China as sales increased 20% over last year and this momentum should continue moving forward.\nSales in our portfolio of consumer products which includes Pet Care, Personal Care, and Edible Oil Purification remained resilient, led by an 11% year-over-year growth in Pet Care.\nWe continue to strengthen our robust private label Pet Care portfolio in North America and Europe and have expanded our presence through partnerships with several new customers.\nAnother area to highlight is our global PCC business which benefited from satellite restarts in India and North America, combined with an improved demand environment from the low levels in the second quarter.\nAs we indicated on our last call, July volumes were trending approximately 15% higher compared to June, and these dynamics continued through the third quarter.\nOf note, Paper PCC sales in China continue to deliver a solid performance with 18% growth over last year.\nIn addition, Specialty PCC sales increased sequentially as automotive and construction demand strengthened through the quarter and food and pharmaceutical applications remained at strong levels.\nOther pockets of strength came in our Talc and GCC business as demand improved for our products used in residential and commercial construction, as well as automotive applications.\nAnd in our Refractories business, we see steel utilization rates increased in the U.S. from a low of 50% in the second quarter to 65% at the end of September.\nWhile many of our businesses returned to a positive trajectory, we've had some challenges in our project-oriented businesses, such as Environmental Products, Building Materials and Energy Services, which are still experiencing volatility in order patterns and timing delays.\nEnergy Services was further impacted by several hurricanes that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico during the quarter.\nAs our volumes began to trend upward through the quarter, we were able to leverage these sales into income, resulting in overall operating and EBITDA margin improvement on both a sequential and year-over-year basis.\nWe've maintained our focus on operational efficiency, including variable cost adjustments and structural overhead savings, as well as on continued pricing increases, capturing favorable raw material costs and increasing sales of higher-value products.\nAs markets continue to recover, we are well-positioned to expand margins further on increased volumes.\nOur focus on strengthening our financial position also remains a priority with an emphasis on tightly controlling our cash generation cycle and creating more flexibility around our capital structure.\nWe delivered another quarter of strong cash flow generation, the majority of which was used to pay down debt.\nWhile navigating through the current environment, we've remain focused on advancing our growth initiatives and made further progress this quarter on several fronts.\nLet me go through some of these highlights in more detail.\nThe commissioning of two new PCC satellites scheduled for the fourth quarter continue to move ahead, currently ramping up production at our 45,000 ton facility in India, our 150,000 ton satellite in China should be operational by December.\nWe will also be resuming production in November at our previously closed satellite in Wickliffe, Kentucky to support Phoenix Paper's restart of that mill.\nDuring the quarter, we made a small acquisition of a hauling and mining company to further strengthen our vertically integrated position at our bentonite mines in Wyoming.\nThis transaction improves our cost position and enhances our flexibility with our mining and/or transportation in the region.\nIn our Refractories business, we signed two new five-year contracts to supply our refractory and metallurgical wire products in the U.S. These contracts total approximately $50 million or about $10 million of incremental revenue on an annual basis.\nOur new product development efforts are progressing well as we look to accelerate the pace of commercialization and drive new revenue opportunities.\nWe commercialized 36 value-added products so far in 2020 with contributions from each of our businesses.\n12 of these products were introduced in the third quarter.\nWe kept at a similar pace to last year, while conducting many of these product development activities virtually.\nAll in all, there are a number of positives about our performance in the quarter, especially, how we've executed as a company, while navigating through difficult conditions.\nThere are still some challenges ahead.\nWith strong momentum across many of our businesses and with an enhanced cost profile, we expect to continue to deliver improved profitability as volumes recover.\nI'll now review our third quarter results, the performance of our four segments, as well as our cash flow and liquidity positions.\nNow, let's get into the review of the third quarter results.\nThird quarter sales were $388.3 million, 9% higher sequentially and 14% below the prior year.\nGross margin, EBITDA margin and operating margin all improved sequentially and versus the prior year, driven by our continued pricing and productivity actions.\nSG&A expense was flat with the second quarter, and also contributed to the margin expansion.\nEarnings per share, excluding special items was $0.92 and we incurred special charges of $3.2 million after-tax in the third quarter or $0.09 per share.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.8% versus 19.1% in the prior year and 16% in the prior quarter.\nGoing forward, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 20%.\nNow, let's review the changes in sales and operating income in more detail.\nOn this slide, we are presenting the year-over-year comparisons of sales and operating income on the left side, and the sequential quarter comparisons on the right side.\nThird quarter sales were 13% lower than the prior year on a constant currency basis.\nSlowdown in economic activity brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic continue to impact our volumes on a year-over-year basis in the quarter.\nThe operating income bridge on the bottom left shows we were able to significantly offset the impact of lower sales versus the prior year, the favorable pricing and cost performance driven by the actions we have taken after the last year.\nThese actions resulted in higher operating margin versus the prior year despite the lower volume.\nOn a sequential basis, we saw significant improvement in demand with sales up 7% adjusting for currency and up 9% overall.\nConditions improved across most of our end markets and we maintained pricing levels across the company.\nOn our last call, we told you that sales rates in July were trending approximately 5% higher than June, and this trend accelerated through the rest of the third quarter.\nDaily sales rates in August were 6% higher than July and September was 7% higher than August.\nOperating income increased 18% sequentially on a constant currency basis, primarily due to the improvement in our end markets and continued cost control.\nOperating margin was 13.3% in the quarter versus 13.2% in the prior year, and 11.8% in the second quarter.\nNow, let's take a closer look at the operating margins and how they have improved on the next slide.\nOn this slide, we are showing year-over-year and sequential operating margin bridges for the third quarter.\nStarting with the prior year comparison, our pricing and cost actions contributed 190 basis points of improvement, which more than offset the unfavorable volume impact.\nOn a sequential basis, we leveraged additional volume into 60 basis points of margin improvement and our continued cost control contributed another 70 basis points of favorability.\nThe actions we have taken on pricing, productivity, cost control and new product development have positioned us well to leverage incremental volumes into improved margins going forward.\nAnother margin related highlight for the third quarter was that EBITDA margin improved by 70 basis points versus both the prior year and the prior quarter.\nNow, let's turn to the segment review, starting with Performance Materials.\nPerformance Materials sales increased 10% sequentially and were 8% lower than the prior year.\nMetalcasting sales grew 26% sequentially as foundry production improved in North America and demand remained strong in China.\nThe improvement in North America was primarily driven by the ramp up of automotive production.\nChina Metalcasting sales grew 11% sequentially and 20% versus the prior year on continued strong demand from our customers and continued penetration of our specially formulated blended products.\nHousehold, Personal Care and Specialty Product sales remained resilient, up 7% sequentially and flat with the prior year on continued strong demand for consumer-oriented products.\nMeanwhile, Environmental Products and Building Materials continued to experience COVID-19-related project delays, and sales remained below prior year levels.\nOperating income for the segment was $28.2 million, up 34% sequentially and up 5% versus the prior year.\nOperating margin was 14.8% of sales, up 270 basis points from the second quarter and up 180 basis points from the prior year.\nContinued pricing actions, strong cost control and expense reductions, more than offset the operating income impact of lower sales versus the prior year.\nThe chart on the bottom right shows daily sales rates by month this year compared to the prior year.\nThis segment experienced a clear rebound in demand and sales increased steadily throughout the third quarter.\nWe would normally expect a seasonal decrease in sales for this segment between the third and fourth quarters, driven by our construction and environmental end markets.\nHowever, this year, we expect to offset the typical seasonality with continued positive momentum in our other markets.\nOverall, we expect fourth quarter sales to be similar to the third quarter, despite the typical seasonal effects.\nI'd also like to note that we experienced higher mining and energy costs, while operating in colder months, and this will temporarily impact segment margins in the fourth quarter.\nNow let's move to Specialty Minerals.\nSpecialty Minerals sales were $125.1 million in the third quarter, up 14% sequentially and 13% below the prior year.\nPCC sales increased 14% sequentially as paper mill capacity came back online in the U.S. and India, following temporary COVID-19-related shutdowns.\nPaper PCC sales in China grew 11% sequentially, and 18% over the prior year on continued penetration and strong customer demand.\nSpecialty PCC sales increased 16% sequentially as automotive and construction demand improved through the quarter and consumer-oriented products remained strong.\nProcessed Minerals sales increased 13% as end market steadily improved through the quarter.\nOperating income excluding special items was $18 million, up 18% sequentially and 17% below the prior year and represented 14.4% of sales, which compared to 13.9% in the second quarter and 15.2% in the prior year.\nThe impact of lower volume versus the prior year was partially offset by continued pricing actions and cost control.\nDaily sales rates charged for this segment also shows improving conditions through the third quarter and we expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter as paper production in the U.S., Europe and India continues to ramp up.\nIn addition, we are bringing online new capacity in the next several months and most of this capacity will come online late in the fourth quarter.\nThe sequential improvement in Paper PCC will offset the typical seasonality we experience in the residential construction markets served by the other path lines [Phonetic].\nOverall, for the segment, we expect fourth quarter sales to be similar to the third quarter.\nNow let's turn to Refractories.\nRefractories segment sales were $59.3 million in the third quarter, up 6% sequentially as steel mill utilization rates gradually improved from second quarter levels in both North America and Europe.\nSegment operating income was $7.3 million, up 24% from the prior quarter and represented 12.3% of sales.\nAgain, you can see improvement in the daily sales rates through the third quarter.\nWe expect continued improvement in the fourth quarter as steel utilization rates improve and laser equipment sales pickup.\nAnd, overall, for the segment, we expect a modest sequential improvement in sales in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter.\nNow let's turn to Energy Services.\nEnergy Services segment experienced significant customer project delays in the third quarter.\nThese delays were related to COVID-19 restrictions, as well as several weather-related shutdowns in the Gulf of Mexico and what has been a very active storm season.\nAs a result, sales were $13.3 million and operating income was breakeven for the third quarter.\nThe daily sales rates chart shows the solid start to the year, followed by sales levels that have remained low relative to the prior year.\nWe continue to see a strong pipeline of activity and we expect sequential improvement for this business in the fourth quarter.\nNow, let's turn to our cash flow and liquidity highlights.\nAs Doug noted, third quarter cash from operations totaled $54 million and free cash flow was $40 million.\nWe continued our balanced approach in deploying cash flow, paying down $30 million of debt and we resumed our share repurchases acquiring $3 million of shares in the quarter.\nWe continue to repurchase shares in October and completed the expiring program with $50 million of shares under the $75 million authorization.\nAs noted earlier, the Board of Directors has approved a new one-year $75 million repurchase program.\nOur net leverage ratio is 2.1 times EBITDA and we have $682 million of liquidity including over $375 million of cash on hand.\nAnd before I hand it back over to Doug for the market outlook, I'd like to summarize my comments on what we are expecting for the fourth quarter in each of our segments.\nIn our Minerals businesses, we expect continued improvement and many of our markets to offset the typical seasonality, and we expect sales to be similar to the third quarter.\nMargins will remain strong on a year-over-year basis, though, sequentially, margins will be impacted by seasonally higher mining and energy costs.\nIn our Services business, we expect continued gradual improvement in Refractories as utilization rates improve and we expect sequential improvement in Energy Services as delayed projects resume and activity levels pick up.\nOverall, we expect MTI sales in the fourth quarter to be similar to the third quarter.\nBefore beginning the Q&A portion of the call, I wanted to take some time to provide a little more insight into the conditions across each of our businesses and where we see opportunities to drive incremental growth.\nThe improving market trends experienced across most of our businesses will likely extend through the rest of the year, while our project-oriented businesses may continue to face persistent challenges with uncertain customer order patterns.\nIn addition, as we build on the momentum from the third quarter, we're also executing on a wide range of attractive growth projects which will accrue to revenue in 2021.\nLet me now take you through what's happening by business segment, starting with Performance Materials, our largest and most diverse segment.\nOur Household and Personal Care product line will continue on its strong sales trajectory as demand for these products stays high and we leverage our expanded channels and presence with new customers.\nSpecifically, we're growing our portfolio of premium Pet Care products in both North America and Europe with the expansion of new online retail channels with larger customers, and the introduction of new products such as our 100% carbon-neutral Eco Care product in Europe, an example of how we're satisfying customer preferences, while also contributing to our sustainability efforts.\nIn addition, sales of our Edible Oil Purification products have more than doubled since last year as we grow this business through an expanded global customer base.\nIn our Metalcasting business, we expect to continue to benefit from the automotive demand rebound in North America.\nNoted earlier, we expanded our customer base in China through the continued penetration of our higher value blended products, which led to sales growth of 20% over last year.\nOur solid growth trend there will continue for the rest of the year and into 2021.\nI'll touch on Environmental Products and Building Materials together as they are both experiencing similar dynamics.\nWhile each maintains a robust and active pipeline and continues to introduce more specialized products, these businesses have been impacted by timing delays around when customers will commence larger remediation and water proofing projects.\nSwitching to the Specialty Minerals segment where I'll begin with Paper PCC.\nWith paper demand in North America and Europe gradually improving, we expect sequential volume growth in all regions in the fourth quarter.\nAsia and, China more specifically, will continue its solid growth trajectory.\nWe'll also benefit from the ramp up of our satellite in India, and our new satellite in China should be operational in December.\nOn the horizon, we have two new facilities coming online in the first half of 2021, one for a packaging application in Europe, and another for a standard PCC facility in India.\nOverall, we're bringing online 285,000 tons of new PCC capacity over the next three quarters.\nWe also maintain a very active business development pipeline across our broad portfolio of PCC technologies, including high filler, packaging and recycling.\nEach of these opportunities could add to our overall volume total next year.\nIn our Specialty PCC, GCC and Talc businesses, sales for our pharmaceutical and consumer products, including food applications will remain strong.\nDemand for our high-performance sealant and plastic products that are used for automotive applications should strengthen as build rates continue to improve in North America and Europe.\nAnd sales for products used in residential and commercial construction applications should stay steady.\nFor the Refractories segment, current steel utilization rates in North America and Europe are around 70% and 65%, respectively, and we expect these rates to gradually improve in the upcoming quarters.\nIn addition, our order book for laser measurement equipment remains strong in the fourth quarter.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we've recently signed two five-year contracts totaling $50 million to supply our broad portfolio of refractory and metallurgical wire products, which will start to accrue to revenue growth in 2021.\nFinishing up the discussion with Energy Services, where we maintain an active pipeline of offshore services, while COVID-19 and adverse weather conditions have led to some early demobilizations or postponements from our larger offshore projects, some of these projects have been rescheduled to resume in the fourth quarter.\nIn addition, we've recently been awarded new large projects in the Gulf of Mexico, which we expect to commence over the next few quarters.\nWe're focused on navigating through a highly dynamic environment and our culture of continuous improvement positions us to do so.\nOver the past six months, we've been successfully implementing virtual tools to help improve productivity, efficiency and connectivity with our employees and customers.\nAnd I've been impressed with how quickly we've adapted to the changing environment.\nThese tools have enabled us to run our business smoothly as we connect seamlessly with our operating facilities for meetings and site visits, conduct problem solving Kaizen events and collaborate and communicate efficiently with our global customer base.\nMany of these new ways that we're operating on, on a daily basis will become permanent and we'll balance them with in-person activities.\nAs we look ahead into 2021, I'm confident in the direction we're heading, the solid foundation we have in place to leverage improved market conditions and the growth projects we have in hand.\nWhile COVID-related uncertainties still persist, our end market conditions continue to show signs of improvement.\nWith the operational actions we've taken, we are well-positioned to drive improved profitability.\nIn addition, strength and flexibility of our balance sheet provides solid resources to support both organic and inorganic growth opportunities.\nWith that, let's open the call to questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:As I review this past quarter and provide insights into our current quarter's business, I want to reiterate that we will be providing comparisons to both 2020 and 2019.\nGiven the periods of quarantining and stimulus that impacted the business in waves last year, we are anchoring comparisons to 2019 to show underlying business trends.\nTo that point, I am pleased with our second quarter performance as we continue to demonstrate strong growth versus 2019, proving out our Operation North Star strategies, demonstrating progress in our core assortment and underscoring the relationships that we are building, both online and in store with our existing and newly acquired customers.\nIn the quarter, we saw strong double digit, two-year comps in Furniture, Soft Home, Hard Home and Apparel, Electronics & Other.\nConsumables also posted a positive two-year comp, while Food was down mid-single digits, reduced on square footage basis by our pantry reset last fall.\nAs a result, while down 13% to last year on a comparable basis, comparable sales for the second quarter increased 14% to 2019.\nAdditionally, we delivered diluted earnings per share of $1.09 within our guidance range, despite ongoing supply chain and distribution headwinds that were greater than expected at the beginning of the quarter and cost us at least 1 point of comp.\nWhile the Big Lots team is always busy, we were really busy over the past quarter engaging with customers leaning into our store count growth, continuing to upgrade our omnichannel offerings and removing friction from our e-commerce channel, launching a new warranty offering through Allstate, rolling out additional Lot and Queue Line stores, preparing for the launch of our two new forward distribution centers and Project Refresh at the start of the third quarter, further rolling out our BIGionaire's brand activation campaign and navigating a challenging supply chain market.\nWhile addressing these initiatives and macro forces, our teams remained unwaveringly focused on our customers' needs, continuing in our mission to help them live big and save lots.\nWe are dealing with it now and navigating the dynamic and ever-changing complexities of the supply chain.\nBut at the same time we are leaning into and investing in our future and our promising long-term growth opportunity.\nI speak for all Big Lots leadership when I convey how indebted we are to the over 30,000 Big Lots team members.\nWe remain very excited about the huge white space opportunity ahead of us, and know that investing in our customer, our people and our infrastructure will be critical to bringing that growth potential to fruition.\nFreight headwinds weighed on gross margin for the quarter, and in addition, our performance for the quarter was also impacted by labor challenges in two of our regional distribution centers.\nThis dynamic is improving as we enter Q3, and stress on our network will be further reduced by the opening of our first two forward distribution centers.\nIn addition to alleviate immediate supply chain pressures and maintain speed to market, we have set up a nimble and agile temporary DC bypass program for the fourth quarter that will increase efficiency of our DCs and capacity to our network.\nMeanwhile, we remain excited by our merchandising opportunities, and we are focused on driving customer-centric deals every day.\nWe continue to expand our ability to find close-out product in most areas of the store.\nWe are working hard to find great deals and big buys for our customers, whether we source them from closeouts, engineered closeouts or just incredible product we find add value in the market.\nWe see the potential for close-out opportunities to grow in 2022.\nAs we focus on item merchandising and key value messaging, our customer is responding well.\nFor example, our increased investment in apparel is leading to the acquisition of customers that are exploring more of the Big Lots assortment.\nAdditionally, this is a great example of increasing merchandised productivity within the box, driving incremental sales with a strong initial markup and expanding our brand recognition with quality product.\nTurning to our category performance, Food and Consumables both declined versus Q2 2020 as we lap last year's COVID impact.\nThe Consumables were positive on a two-year basis and both categories exceeded our beginning of quarter expectations.\nIn Food, we have continued to see a shift away from grocery and baking categories and into more snacks, beverage, energy drinks and on the go food.\nIn consumables, we saw a rebound in the household chemicals category as well as cosmetics, while paper sales, demand on bath tissue and paper towels continue to be a bit challenged, driven by the prior COVID related stock-ups.\nA year ago we reset Food and Consumables across the store and this is performing well.\nAs we approach lapping this reset, we continue to see opportunity to improve overall productivity and improved values with big deals, own brands and everyday low prices on brand names.\nOur Seasonal assortment, which includes patio, lawn and garden and summer categories like coles, and 4th of July themed goods was challenged for the quarter due to shipping delays and inventory availability.\nThe overall category comped down 15% to last year, but up 4% to Q2 2019.\nMoving into Q3, our inventory situation has improved, and we have seen a resurgence in sales with early strength from our Halloween and Harvest assortment.\nAlthough supply chain pressures related to Asian port and manufacturing disruption will continue to create challenges, we are much better prepared to win at the all important holiday season.\nSoft Home comps were up 14% versus 2019.\nWhile we saw softness in fashion bedding, all other categories met expectations.\nBath rugs and towels, patio rugs and floor mats were particularly strong this quarter.\nAlso noteworthy were the candle collection categories within home decor with strong double-digit growth to 2019.\nHard Home comps were up 13% to 2019, exceeding our expectations with appliances and home organization, delivering double-digit increases in 2019.\nKey classifications such as floor care, kitchen appliances, storage, dinnerware and cookware continued to trend strongly, partially offset by lower, but positive comp sales to 2019 in tabletop, food prep and home maintenance.\nCloseouts in Hard Home were up even more over 2020 with appliances, cookware, home organization all doing very well.\nToys, now rolled into our Hard Home category following our merchandising reorganization also performed quite well and ahead of expectations.\nFurniture delivered another very strong quarter, with comps down 10% to last year, but up 30% to 2019.\nThe furniture team did an outstanding job of mitigating inventory challenges, primarily as a result of chemical shortages affecting foam production, and we achieved our strategic goal of winning Memorial Day weekend with positive comps to last year and two years ago.\nUpholstery was particularly strong in Q2, delivering a flat comp to 2020 and up almost 40% to 2019, driven by high demand for sofas and sectionals.\nAnchored by the Broyhill brand, which continues to gain share, it is now over 40% of total upholstery sales.\nApparel, Electronics & Other also performed very strongly, up 15% to 2020.\nApparel delivered a 90% comp for the quarter, with casual and athletic lifestyle dressing dominating the women's business.\nAlthough tops remains strong, we saw high sell-throughs in capris and shorts as well.\nMens active tops and shorts performed well.\nCloseouts continued to build within the assortment, offering value, breadth and new classifications.\nAccessories saw nice increases with hair and jewelry.\nAdditionally, luggage was introduced as a new category in July with strong sales results that will provide additional growth as we look toward the back half of the year and into 2022.\nThe Lot continues to strengthen as delighting our customers with fun, innovative treasures just right for life's occasions while delivering nearly 2% of the Company's sales in the quarter.\nWe executed a camping theme set and a nostalgia set during the quarter, both of which resonated well with big hits from national brand camping suppliers, novelty [Phonetic] small appliances and unexpected finds such as PopCorn-themed items, a TV projector, large video game units and novelty pet styles.\nI would now like to turn to our longer-term growth strategy.\nWe remain excited about the tremendous progress we are making under Operation North Star, where our growth drivers are growing, our customer base, improving our e-commerce conversion, improving merchandise productivity and increasing our store count.\nWith regard to customer growth, we are thrilled with the continued rollout of our, Be A BIGionaire, brand campaign that we gave a glimpse of last quarter.\nThis program is grounded in extensive consumer insights around why customers love to shop us.\nShe sees us as the home of the hunt for exceptional bargains and surprising treasures.\nI'm delighted to share that this campaign is driving a 2% lift in transactions in the markets where we have rolled it out.\nNew BIGionaires visiting Big Lots for the first time are driving 60% of these incremental transactions.\nThe campaign has also increased brand awareness, consideration and purchase rates, showing that we are gaining relevance.\nOur first campaign featured Retta who successfully transferred her relatability and humor from Good Girls and Parks and Recreation into our BIGionaire campaign.\nAs we gear up for this holiday, you can expect to see additional stars hunting for bargains and treasures at their neighborhood Big Lots.\nComing soon, you'll see Eric Stonestreet, most famous for his role in the beloved comedy, Modern Family and Molly Shannon, best known for her fantastic characters on Saturday Night Live.\nBoth Eric and Molly embraced the Big Lots personality.\nWe cannot wait to share future details with you soon.\nWe're also thrilled that the campaign is resonating with the younger audience.\nIn our demographic distribution, we've seen a 600 basis point share increase in new customers with ages 25 to 39, with the distribution shifting from those 55 and older.\nSavvy shoppers of all ages are discovering Big Lots and they love that we provide everything for their home with incredible value and superior style.\nMeanwhile, our rewards membership continues to contribute productive growth to the business with active membership of 8% versus the second quarter of 2020 adding 1.8 million more new members this past quarter with rewards membership currently at 21.5 million.\nAdditionally, rewards customers in total spent 16% more than last year and 7% more per customer.\nOver 72% of our sales this past quarter were attached to our rewards membership.\nThat penetration to sales is up 400 basis points to the same quarter last year.\nFinally, we continue to see great reactivation through thoughtful win back programs to recapture lapsed rewards members and keep them coming back.\nDemand increased 10% over the second quarter of 2020 representing over 400% of growth to Q2 2019.\nWhile side business declined in the quarter versus Q2 2020, as we lap the height of the pandemic response in 2020, the declines in traffic were more than offset by increases across conversion and basket size.\nDemand for our seasonal lawn and garden assortment and for furniture continued the momentum that we saw in the first quarter.\nECom growth is supported by our investments in the channel to further improve search, purchase and fulfillment capabilities, buy online pickup in store, curbside pickup, ship from store and same-day delivery with Instacart and Pickup.\nThey've all been very successful and drove over 60% of our demand fulfillment.\nTo support holiday, we are increasing the number of stores providing ship from store fulfillment to 65.\nWe are further reducing transaction friction by introducing our third mobile wallet payment program, PayPal, in time for holiday joining our lineup of Apple and Google Pay, and we expect to introduce a new buy now, pay later offering later this quarter.\nAdditionally, we have updated the look and feel of the website to match and enhance the upbeat feeling of our brand and the BIGionaire campaign.\nTurning to merchandise productivity, momentum remained strong within our growing Broyhill businesses as the assortment drove $194 million in Q2 sales.\nThis represents a $77 million increase to Q2 2020, at which point we had just launched the brand.\nWe remained thrilled with Broyhill's trajectory and continue to see strong growth ahead for the brand with over $400 million in year sales today, up to last year's full year performance and showing continued acceleration to becoming $1 billion brand.\nIn addition, it's important to call out that Broyhill is just one aspect albeit a huge focus of our own brand strategy.\nWe are also leaning heavily into Real Living, a private brand in our furniture and home goods area of the store with a lower price point than Broyhill.\nWe are seeing early growth in this brand by consolidating our offering of unbranded goods and transitioning from other private labels currently in the store.\nWe are also introducing new products to make sure we have a complete offer in the Real Living brand.\nReal Living has ramped up quickly, generating over $400 million in sales year-to-date, and we are confident that it, too, will become a $1 billion own brand for Big Lots.\nFor Lot and Queue Line, front end strategies are now rolled out to approximately 1,225 stores.\nThese initiatives act as innovation labs with newness that plays into the rest of the stores assortment, strengthening customer engagement.\nThe Lot and Queue Line continues to drive 3% incremental combined lift to our store performance.\nAdditionally, both have become established aspects of the Big Lots shopping experience as transactions containing items from the Lot tend to be of larger value, include more items and attached to more of the balance of the assortment, while the queue lines are driving strong incremental unit impulse buying upon checkout.\nIn prior calls, we introduced you to our next generation furniture sales team test that puts dedicated furniture focused associates on the sales floor to help educate our customers about the breadth and quality of our home furnishings.\nI'm excited to announce that this test now in over 80 stores continues to perform very well, delivering around a 15% furniture sales lift.\nWe expect to roll this next-generation model to several hundred stores in 2022 delivering at least 1 point of comp to the total Company, on an annualized basis.\nFinally, with regard to store count, our growth is accelerating this year and will further accelerate in 2022 and beyond.\nBased on all the work that we have done in recent months, we are confident that there is white space to grow our store count by hundreds of stores in the coming years with two to three times the net store growth in 2022 than the net increase of around 20 stores we expect to achieve this year.\nAt the same time, we expect to continue slowing our rate of closures as a result of our store intervention program, which this year will be only around 15 stores.\nAll of these growth drivers are supported by key enabling investments.\nEarlier this year, we announced that we would be opening mid-year two forward bulk [Phonetic] and furniture distribution centers to support our growth and relieve pressure in our current regional distribution centers.\nWe are pleased to announce that our first FDC opened in early August, and our second will be receiving inventory early next week.\nAdditionally, we are pleased with the performance of our new transportation management system, which has been crucial to mitigating the pressures that we've experienced within our distribution network.\nMeanwhile, during Q2, we initiated a multi-year program, which we're calling Project Refresh to upgrade our approximately 800 stores not included in our 2017 to early 2020 Store of the Future program.\nThese stores will get new exterior signage, interior repainting and floor repair, a new vestibule experience, remodeled bathrooms and anterior wall graphics, all at a much lower cost than our prior Store of the Future conversions.\nThis will create a consistent brand experience across our stores and enhance our brand for the long run.\nThe average cost per store will be around $100,000, much lower than the prior Store of the Future program.\nAs I hope I've impressed upon you, both in this quarter's discussion and in previous calls, we have resolute belief in our Whitespace potential and in the continued growth opportunities that Operation North Star presents.\nThe underlying progress we are making is increasingly evident.\nBefore handing over to Jonathan, I want to turn back to the supply chain and distribution headwinds we've discussed, which we expect will continue to impact our business in Q3 and Q4.\nPrior to the recent global resurgence of COVID, we were seeing increased import cost driven by global increase in demand for ocean freight.\nOver the past few months, we have seen that dynamic exacerbated by the temporary shutdown of the port at Yantian, China and temporary factory and port closures elsewhere in Asia.\nVietnam, where segments of our furniture and seasonal categories are sourced is currently under COVID restrictions that impact our supplier's ability to produce at scale.\nThe Vietnamese government is targeting September 15th, as the date to ease restrictions.\nIn addition, the port of Ningbo, China experienced a terminal closure in mid-August, although has now reopened.\nThese developments highlight the fluidity of the situation and the ongoing uncertainties caused by COVID-19.\nWhile these pressures are expected to be transient, they are resulting in both cost increases due to an imbalance of container supply and demand, as well as sales impact due to delayed inflow of product, particularly from Vietnam.\nThe guidance that Jonathan will cover in a moment bakes in our current estimates of these impacts.\nIn summary, we are facing some near-term challenges, but our underlying business remains strong as evidenced by our strong two year comps in the second quarter, which have continued into Q3.\nWe are as confident as ever that our Operation North Star strategies will drive significant growth in the coming years, supported by key investments we are making.\nAs Bruce referenced, so much was accomplished this quarter as our teams remain focused on providing a great experience, great assortment and great value to our customer.\nNet sales for the second quarter were $1.457 billion, and a 11.4% decrease compared to $1.644 billion a year ago.\nThe decline was driven by a comparable sales decrease of 13.2% as we lap stimulus impacts in 2020, on the height of last year's nesting activities, partially offset by 180 basis points impact from net store openings and relocations.\nOur comp result was slightly off our negative low-double digit guidance, driven by labor challenges at two of our regional DCCs -- regional DCs, which adversely impacted store inventories.\nSales in total were up 16% to 2019's $1.252 billion with a two-year comp of 14% [Phonetic] driven by basket size.\nAs a side note, when we reference two-year comps going forward, we will be doing so on a multiplied rather than an additive basis.\nNet income for the second quarter was $37.7 million compared to $110.1 million in Q2 of 2020 and $20.6 million in 2019.\nDiluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.09 within our guidance range coming into the quarter.\nAs a reminder, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.75 last year, which excluded the gain on the sale of our four owned distribution centers.\nEPS for this year's second quarter reflected continued strong control of expenses which offset the slight miss on sales.\nIn addition, we've got approximately $0.03 of benefit from share repurchases during the quarter.\nGross margin rate for Q2 was 39.6%, down 200 basis points from last year's second quarter rate, and 20 basis points below 2019, in line with our guidance.\nOur margin rate reflects freight headwinds, partially offset by first cost benefits, pricing increases and judicious markdown deployment.\nFreight headwinds were greater than initially expected with freight costs closing close to 200 basis points of gross margin contraction year-over-year.\nTotal expenses for the quarter, including depreciation were $524 million, down from $534 million last year, and slightly lower than beginning of quarter expectations, despite the distribution and transportation cost pressures, while deleveraging versus last year expenses leveraged 120 basis points versus 2019.\nAll of the above drove us to an operating margin for the quarter of 3.7%, versus 9.1% last year and 2.6% in 2019.\nExcluding the freight headwinds, our operating margin would have been closer to 5.7%, a 300 basis point improvement to 2019.\nInterest expense for the quarter was $2.3 million, down from $2.5 million in the second quarter last year.\nIn light of our strong liquidity position and current market conditions, on June 7th, we prepaid the remaining $44.3 million principal balance under our 2019 term note secured on the Apple Valley distribution center equipment.\nIn connection with the prepayment, we incurred a $0.4 million prepayment fee and recognized $0.5 million loss on debt extinguishment in the second quarter.\nThe income tax rate in second quarter was 26.7% compared to last year's rate of 25.8%, with the increase primarily driven by the impact of the Section 162(m) executive compensation add back.\nMoving on to the balance sheet, total inventory was up 32% to $943.8 million, slightly ahead of our beginning of quarter guidance.\nThe increase was driven by the lapping of a typically low inventory levels at the close of the second quarter in 2020.\nInventories were up 8% of Q2 2019, maintaining a strong two-year turn improvement while supporting our ability to drive third quarter performance.\nDuring Q2, we opened 12 new stores and closed seven stores.\nWe ended Q2 with 1,418 stores and with total selling square footage of 32.3 million.\nCapital expenditures for the quarter were $45 million compared to $41 million last year.\nDepreciation expense in the quarter was $35.3 million, approximately $1.3 million lower than the same period last year.\nWe ended the second quarter with $293 million of cash and cash equivalents and no long-term debt.\nAs a reminder, at the end of Q2 2020, we had $899 million of cash and cash equivalents and $43 million of long-term debt.\nThe year-over-year reduction in cash levels, reflects our deployment of proceeds from the sale and leaseback of our distribution centers toward share repurchases and the payment of taxes on the gain on sale and leaseback.\nWe repurchased 2.4 million shares during the quarter for $153 million at an average cost per share of $63.57, under our previously announced $500 million authorization.\nThere is approximately $97 million remaining as of the end of the second quarter of 2021.\nFor the program to date, we have repurchased 7.3 million shares at an average cost of $55.18, including commission.\nAs announced in a separate release today, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend for the third quarter of 2021 of $0.30 per common share.\nThis dividend is payable on September 24, 2021 to shareholders of record on the close of business on September 10th, 2021.\nAs Bruce noted earlier, we are facing significant sales and margin challenges as a result of Asian manufacturing and supply chain disruption due to recent COVID issues.\nIn addition, we will incur additional expense in the back half related to actions we are taking to ensure we are competitive in hiring and retaining labor in our stores and DCs.\nOur guidance below incorporates are a best estimate to all of these impacts, although they remain fluid.\nIn the third quarter, we expect a diluted loss per share in the range of $0.10 to $0.20 compared to $0.76 of earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of 2020.\nFor the full year, we expect earnings per share in the range of $5.90 to $6.05.\nWhile this represents a decline to last year's adjusted diluted earnings per share of $7.35, it represents 60% plus growth to 2019 earnings.\nThe guidance does not incorporate any share repurchases we may complete in the third or fourth quarters.\nOn a two year basis, we expect comps to be up low double digits.\nAs Bruce referenced, our Q3 has got off to a good start, with two year comps running ahead of Q2, but we have baked in some moderation as the quarter progresses due to receipt delays.\nFor the full year, we expect a negative low-single digit comp versus 2020 which will again equate to double-digit comps on a two-year basis.\nOur full year sales outlook bakes in approximately $60 million of adverse impact in Q3 and especially Q4, related to COVID related manufacturing shutdowns in Vietnam.\nWe expect the third quarter gross margin rate to be down approximately 175 basis points to last year, driven by freight headwinds as Bruce previously discussed.\nVersus 2019, the rating -- versus 2019, the rate is expected to be down approximately 100 basis points, essentially all freight-related.\nRecent shutdowns of the port of Yantian in China resulted in a significant increase in container rates that will impact our cost of goods in Q3 and Q4.\nFor the full year, we now expect a gross margin rate impact from freight of approximately 150 basis points resulting in gross margin rate being down approximately 50 basis points versus 2019 and approximately 100 basis points versus 2020.\nWe expect freight pressures to abate as we move forward and we continue to see other areas of gross margin opportunity, including promotional and pricing optimization and shrink reduction.\nWith regards to SG&A, at our projected sales levels, we expect Q3 and the full year to deleverage versus 2020, but both to show healthy leverage versus 2019.\nIn Q3, expense dollars will be up slightly to last year, driven by incremental expense investments in labor and in our forward distribution centers.\nThe full year SG&A expense dollars will be up to 2020 driven by the full year impact of the sale and leaseback of our distribution centers, additional supply chain expenses including investments in our new forward distribution centers, other strategic investments and higher equity compensation expense.\nThese increases will be mitigated by more than $30 million of structural expense savings, which remain an ongoing area of focus and priority.\nWe continue to expect 2021 capital expenditures to be around $200 million to $210 million including around 55 store openings, of which around 20 will be relocations.\nOur capex outlook also includes the first wave of store upgrades, under our new Project Refresh program.\nOn a net basis, we expect total store count to grow by about 20 stores in 2021.\nWe expect to further accelerate store count in 2022 and beyond.\nAs Bruce said, our work has increasingly validated the opportunity to grow our store count materially in the coming years, and we are making the necessary investments to support that.\nWe continue to expect inventory to increase significantly versus 2020, reflecting very depleted levels of a year ago.\nAs Bruce referenced earlier, we are seeing strong early sales for our late fall and early holiday assortment, supported by higher inventory levels.\nWe expect ending Q3 inventory to be up around 10% versus 2019, continuing to reflect healthy turn improvement.\nWe expect a similar two-year inventory increase at the end of Q4, which will include some accelerated lawn and garden receipts, support Q1 sales and minimize the risk of further supply chain disruption.\nWe know we left sales on the table and seasonal over the past 12 months to 18 months, and we are heavily focused on recapturing those sales as we go forward.\nAs well as the impact in Q4 ending [Phonetic] inventory, these early receipts will drive around $6 million of additional supply chain expense in Q4.\nOverall, our third quarter will be a challenging one, driven by supply chain challenges, resulting sales impacts and cost increases.\nHowever, we expect our underlying business measured by our two year comp trend to remain strong, with healthy margins after adjusting for freight effects, supported by continued strong expense management.\nWe continue to work very hard to ensure we are well positioned -- as well positioned as possible for the all important holiday season.\nAnd we look forward to continuing to demonstrate strong underlying performance in 2022 and beyond.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The Company undertakes no obligation to update new information.\nWhitestone's first quarter earnings news release and supplemental operating and financial data package have been filed with the SEC and are available on our website, www.\nwhitestonereit.com, in the Investor Relations section.\nI will provide a brief overview on Whitestone and as well an update on our business, current events in the first quarter.\nFollowing my remarks, I will turn the meeting over to Dave Holeman, who will provide a financial update on how we did during first quarter then we will follow with question and answers.\nThis quarter's result benefited from the decision to locate our portfolio in some of the country's fastest growing Sunbelt markets, where we are leading in our nation's reopening.\nThis contributed to our performance on leasing, showing the resilience of our business model and corporate culture.\nOur operations team continues to provide their ability to be flexible and quickly adaptable with the support of our strong financial infrastructure.\nAt the end of Q1 this year, our operating portfolio occupancy was 89.1%, an increase of 0.5% from last quarter and down only 0.6% from a year ago.\nOur rent collections versus billings continue to put us at the top of our industry peer group.\nDuring Q1, our collections remains strong approximately 95% of our rents for the quarter and for the month of April.\nOur new lease count was 46 in the quarter, significantly higher than last quarter's count of 28 and our total lease count was 94, 12% higher than the previous quarter.\nOur blended leasing spread was 7.8%, 1 full percentage point higher than last quarter 6.8%.\nAnd our same-store net operating increase -- decrease 4.3% was flat last quarter yet among the best in the industry.\nAdditionally, in Q1 we increased our quarterly dividend by 2.4% and have paid a monthly dividend to our shareholders for 120 consecutive months.\nOur employees are back working safely at our properties and our tenant businesses are ramping up with increasing customer foot traffic as consumers continue to resume their daily lifestyle routines and visiting our properties while migration continues the flow into our markets.\nOur targeted geographic portfolios comprise of institutional qualities open air real estate with predictable cash flow.\nOur properties are adjacent to high-income communities and our tenants include grocery stores, pharmacies and restaurants.\nOur centers are made up of e-commerce resistant tenants who provide necessities and essentials.\nThey drive 18 hour traffic, 7 days a week to our properties.\nAs a result, over the past year our centers have remained open and most of our tenants remained active.\nSome of whom today are experiencing higher sales than their pre-pandemic levels.\nA reminder of shareholder that Whitestone was built during the recession of 2008 to 2010 and many of the lessons that we learned during we incorporated into the fiber of the company.\nOur company has built by acquiring properties that are located in our business friendly states, fast growing and really populated cities and high-income communities.\nBy creating an interest resistant business model, internet resistant business model that focuses on services and essential needs of consumers.\nBy creating a diverse portfolio of entrepreneurial tenants, by structuring leases with tenant owner recourse and minimal co-tenancy approval rights.\nBy providing annual rent increases of 2% to 3%, while passage through triple net expenses and by keeping our focus on training and developing our people for for continuity.\nOur swift response to COVID-19 12 months ago strengthened our balance sheet liquidity and financial flexibility to successfully navigate economic impacts of the pandemic.\nFast forward, the first quarter of 2021.\nWe're activating our strategic growth plan.\nWe are making plans for future redevelopment and development projects.\nWe have reduced our overall debt level, we have increased our divided and we are continuing to scale our infrastructure.\nOur history has been to grow our portfolio by making single off market, value ad acquisitions in four specific markets.\nAustin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston and Phoenix Scottsdale.\nWe intend to continue this strategy to assemble valuable properties in markets where tenants want to lease and consumers want to visit.\nBy growing this way, we created a substantial value add portfolio of properties.\nIn fact, we are under contract to acquire a property in one of our identified markets, our first acquisition since the pandemic began and we expect to close this summer.\nThis acquisition will add just under 200,000 square feet and would be immediately accreted to Whitestone's FFO per share and positively contribute to Whitestone's long-term goals related to debt, leverage and G&A coverage.\nIn addition, our regional management team is in place giving us operational economies as we scale up our infrastructure.\nWe look forward to providing more details as we progress in the year.\nMoving forward at Whitestone we're well positioned with the improving balance sheet, enhanced liquidity, a laser focus on driving occupancy and revenue growth and leasing, leveraging our deep knowledge of our markets, properties and opportunities along with our business model to provide and craft the tenant mix to lease, to credit entrepreneurial businesses.\nThis is how we create long-term shareholder value.\nFirst, I would like to provide a little more perspective on the strength of our markets.\nOur targeted geographic focus on top MSAs in the Sunbelt continues to produce great results.\nTexas and Arizona, continue to see significant population migration and corporate relocations producing jobs from other areas of the countries.\nThis is best evidenced by our first quarter leasing activity, occupancy levels, leasing spreads and our average base rent per leased square foot.\nOur leasing activity in the quarter was very strong with 46 new leases, representing 117,000 square feet of newly occupied spaces.\nThis level of new lease square footage was 90% higher than our average quarterly lease volume for the previous three year period.\nAnd 21% higher than the highest quarter over the past three years.\nOn a total lease value basis, this quarter was more than double our average quarterly lease volume for the previous three year period and 38% higher than the highest quarter over the past three years.\nRegarding occupancy, our operating portfolio occupancy stood at 89.1%, up 1.5% from the fourth quarter and down only 6 -- 0.6% from a year ago with our Austin market leading the way with almost 4% increase in occupancy from Q4.\nLeasing spreads on a GAAP basis have been positive 9% over the last 12 months, and first quarter leasing spreads increased 5.3% on new leases and 9.6% on renewal leases signed.\nOur annualized base rent per square foot on a GAAP basis at the end of the quarter grew 1% to $19.71, from $19.58 in the previous quarter, and basically in line with our pre-COVID ABR from a year ago.\nFunds from operations core was $0.23 per share in Q1, compared to $0.24 per share in the prior year.\nAs Jim, mentioned our collection continued to trend toward normal pre-COVID levels, with 95% of our contractual rents collected in Q1.\nRestaurants and food service, our largest tenant category, which represents 23% of our ABR and 17% of our leases square footage continued to perform very well, staying 95% in the quarter and we also saw positive movements in some of our impacted customer types, with entertainment representing only 2% of our ABR, and leased square footage paying 73% of their rents in the quarter, up from 48% in Q4.\nDuring the quarter we had minimal rent deferrals, representing 45% of our total contractual billings.\nOur same-store net operating income was down 4.3% for the quarter versus the prior year quarter, and we expect our same-store growth to resume as we move throughout the balance of the year and into 2022.\nReflecting the continued improvement in the portfolio, our reserve for uncollectible revenue was $529,000 or 1.8% of revenue, down from 4% of revenue in Q4.\nTo put this in further perspective, our first quarter reserve equates to only 9% of 2020s full year reserves.\nOur interest expense was 8% lower than a year ago, reflecting $15 million in lower average debt, and a decrease in our overall interest rate from 3.9% to 3.6%.\nOur first quarter is an encouraging start to 2021, and underscores the resilience of our forward thinking, well-crafted business model and the strength of our strategically chosen high-growth markets.\nLet me provide some further details on our collections, and related receivable balances.\nIncluded on Page 27 of our soft data is a breakdown of our tenants by type.\nAll of our credit category were above 89% collection in Q1, with the exception of entertainment, which I previously discussed.\nOur three largest categories, restaurants, grocery and financial services were at 95%, 100% and 99% respectively.\nAt quarter end, we had $23.3 million in accrued rents and accounts receivable, included in this amount is $16.9 million of accrued straight-line rents, and $1.8 million of agreed upon deferrals.\nOur agreed upon deferral balance is down 18% from year end, reflecting tenants honoring their payment plans.\nSince early last year, we've implemented various measures to strengthen our liquidity, and navigate the economic pressures caused by the pandemic.\nOur total net debt is $632 million, down $17 million from a year ago, and our liquidity representing cash and availability on our corporate credit facility, stands at $39 million at quarter end.\nWe continue to make progress on our publicly stated goal of reducing leverage.\nDuring April, we paid down an additional $10 million of our corporate credit facility.\nCurrently, we have a $140.5 million of undrawn capacity, and $25.9 million of borrowing availability under our credit facility.\nWe are in full compliance with all of our debt and expect to remain so in the future.\nAs I stated earlier, 2021 is off to a very promising start.\nThese results are a testament to the resiliency of Whitestone's business model.\nWe are encouraged by the recovery and we look forward to reengaging our growth strategy, and our continued delivery of value to all of Whitestone stakeholders.\nWith that, we will now take questions.\nOperator, please open the lines.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Revenue and adjusted EBITDA in Q2 increased 17.5% and 23%, respectively, over the prior year period, primarily as a result of continued improvement in solid waste pricing volume growth and strength in recovered commodity values.\nThese trends drove year-to-date adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 110 basis points and adjusted free cash flow of over $585 million, up 18.5% year-over-year, and given expected continuing momentum and margin expansion from these trends position us to raise our full year outlook for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted free cash flow.\n2021 also has the potential to be another outsized year of acquisition activity.\nYear-to-date, we have signed or closed 14 acquisitions with total annualized revenue of approximately $115 million, including $75 million of franchise operations in California, Nevada and Oregon expected to close later this year.\nWe continue to see record amounts of seller interest driving elevated acquisition dialogue, and as communicated throughout the year, expect closings related to most of this activity to be more weighted to the second half of the year, which will provide further upside to our increased outlook for the year and strong rollover growth into 2022.\nOn the call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income attributable to Waste Connections on both a dollar basis and per diluted share and adjusted free cash flow.\nManagement uses certain non-GAAP measures to evaluate and monitor the ongoing financial performance of our operations.\nOther companies may calculate these non-GAAP measures differently.\nIn the second quarter, solid waste price plus volume growth of 11.4% exceeded our expectations by almost 150 basis points, primarily as a result of higher-than-expected volumes as the recovery trends that began in Q1 continued throughout the quarter, with landfill tons and roll-off pulls returning to levels about in line with or above prepandemic levels.\nTotal price of 4.9%, up 70 basis points sequentially, was above our outlook on higher core pricing of 4.7%, once again reflecting the strength of pricing retention we noted in Q1, plus about 20 basis points in fuel and material surcharges.\nOur Q2 pricing ranged from 2.6% in our mostly exclusive Western region to a range of about 4.5% to 7% in our more competitive regions.\nLooking ahead, we are positioned for higher sequential pricing growth during the second half of the year as a result of incremental price increases we have already put in place to offset certain cost pressures.\nReported volume growth of 6.5% in Q2 reflected sequential improvement of approximately 1,000 basis points from Q1 and was led by those regions where markets were hardest hit during the pandemic including the Northeast U.S. and Canada.\nAll regions showed sequential improvement from Q1 and all reported positive volumes in Q2.\nVolumes range from about 4% in our Central region, where comparisons to the prior year were tougher as many markets were relatively less impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, to almost 10.5% in Canada, one of our most impacted regions where the volume recovery have been remarkably strong, arguably outpacing the reopening activity particularly when considering that many restrictions in Canada extended through Q2 of this year.\nAlso noteworthy is our Western region, where volumes led our other regions going into the pandemic and continue to be the strongest in the U.S. at about 8.5% in Q2.\nLooking at year-over-year results in the second quarter on a same-store basis, all lines of business increased by double digits Commercial collection revenue was up 16% year-over-year.\nRoll-off pulls increased by over 11% year-over-year, led by Canada, up almost 20% and back to above pre-COVID-19 levels.\nIn the U.S., pulls were up about 10%, and all regions showed year-over-year improvement, most notably in our more impacted markets, including in the Northeast.\nLandfill tons were up 17% year-over-year on MSW tons up 11%, C&D tons up 20% and special waste tons up 33%.\nAs a result, landfill tons have returned to above pre-pandemic levels in all of our regions, except the Eastern region, which was slightly below prior levels as a result of the delayed reopening activity in markets in the Northeast.\nLooking more closely at results.\nAs noted, all waste types were up double-digit percentages year-over-year.\nHowever, the outsized amount of special waste activity was particularly noteworthy as Q2 activity propelled tons back to 13% above pre-pandemic levels with all regions up year-over-year, perhaps due to a little pull forward from Q3.\nLooking at Q2 revenues from recovery commodities, that is recycled commodities, landfill gas and renewable energy credits, or RINs.\nExcluding acquisitions, collectively, they were up about 95% year-over-year resulting in a combined margin tailwind of about 130 basis points, 90 basis points of which was from recycling and 40 basis points from landfill gas and RINs.\nRecycling revenue increases were driven by both higher commodity values, including old corrugated containers or OCC, up 25%; and plastics and metals, both up over 100%.\nHigher volumes also contributed year-over-year, again, reflecting the pandemic impact.\nPrices for OCC averaged about $135 per ton in Q2 and our RIN pricing averaged about $2.72.\nAnd finally, on to E&P waste activity.\nWe reported $31.2 million of E&P waste revenue in the second quarter, up 26% sequentially from Q1, reflecting increased activity across multiple basins.\nLooking at acquisition activity.\nAs noted earlier, we've already signed or closed 14 acquisitions with annualized revenue of approximately $115 million, approaching what we would consider an average amount of activity for the full year.\nThese transactions include multiple West Coast franchise markets, which are core to our strategy and provide unique opportunities to expand our exclusive contract portfolio.\nMoreover, our pipeline still reflects record levels of seller interest driving the potential for outsized activity in 2021, primarily given tax-related considerations.\nThat said, we continue to be selective and disciplined in our approach to acquisitions as we recognize the importance of value creation for our shareholders as well as market selection and asset positioning.\nNow I'd like to pass the call to Mary Anne to review more in depth the financial highlights of the second quarter and our increased outlook for the year and to provide a detailed outlook for Q3.\nI will then wrap up before heading into Q&A.\nIn the second quarter, revenue was $1.534 billion, about $44 million above our outlook due primarily to higher-than-expected solid waste growth and recovered commodity values.\nRevenue on a reported basis was up $228 million or 17.5% year-over-year, including acquisitions completed since the year ago period which contributed about $47.6 million of revenue in the quarter or about $44.1 million net of divestitures.\nCommodity-driven impacts account for about 100 basis points of margin expansion, net of a 30 basis point impact from higher fuel on diesel rates up almost 20% year-over-year.\nEx fuel solid waste collection transfer and disposal margins expanded by 50 basis points as we more than offset a 60 basis points increase in incentive compensation costs, 50 basis points from higher medical and 50 basis points from increased discretionary expenses.\nAnd finally, acquisitions completed since the year ago period accounted for about 10 basis points of margin dilution.\nRegarding discretionary expenses, we've begun the process of returning to a more normalized operating environment, including in-person training, meetings and other activities we consider integral to sustaining our culture and expanding our bench strength ahead of future growth.\nGiven the challenging labor environment, we have also proactively implemented supplemental wage adjustments in many markets as we anticipate or combat labor constraints.\nThese purposeful wage and discretionary cost additions, along with higher incentives, medical and other costs resulting from more typical activity levels, largely replaced last year's COVID-19-related frontline support costs, the majority of which did not repeat this year.\nAs noted earlier, we've already implemented incremental price increases to address these higher costs, resulting in full year 2021 price of approximately 5%, up from 4% in our original outlook.\nWe delivered adjusted free cash flow up 18.5% year-over-year through Q2 at $585 million or 20% of revenue, putting us on track to achieve our revised adjusted free cash flow outlook of approximately $1 billion.\nI will now review our outlook for the third quarter 2021 and our updated outlook for the full year.\nBefore I do, we'd like to remind everyone once again that actual results may vary significantly based on risks and uncertainties outlined in our safe harbor statement and filings we've made with the SEC and the Securities Commissions or similar regulatory authorities in Canada.\nWe encourage investors to review these factors carefully.\nOur outlook assumes no significant change in underlying economic trends, including as a result of or related to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic or the delta variant of the coronavirus.\nIt also excludes any impact from additional acquisitions that may close during the remainder of the year and expensing of transaction-related items during the period.\nLooking first at Q3.\nRevenue in Q3 is estimated to be approximately $1.56 billion.\nWe expect solid waste price plus volume growth of about 7% in Q3 with pricing of about 5%.\nRecovered commodity values and E&P waste revenue are expected to remain in line with current levels, with RINs generally in line with Q2 levels and OCC trending slightly higher.\nAdjusted EBITDA in Q3 is estimated to be approximately $495 million or 31.7% of revenue, up 60 basis points year-over-year and up sequentially from Q2.\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter is estimated to be about 13.3% of revenue, including amortization of intangibles of about $33.8 million or a rounded $0.10 per diluted share net of taxes.\nInterest expense, net of interest income, is estimated at approximately $40 million.\nAnd finally, our effective tax rate in Q3 is estimated to be about 21.5%, subject to some variability.\nRevenue for 2021 is now estimated to be approximately $5.975 billion or $175 million above our initial outlook, with the primary drivers being an additional 150 basis points of solid waste price plus volume growth and higher recovered commodity values as compared to our initial outlook, plus $25 million from acquisitions completed year-to-date.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the full year is now estimated to be approximately $1.875 billion or about 31.4% of revenue and up about $75 million over our initial outlook.\nMoreover, full year adjusted EBITDA margin guidance is 40 basis points above our initial outlook, up 90 basis points year-over-year.\nAt 31.4%, our adjusted EBITDA margin outlook reflects continued year-over-year margin expansion in the second half of 2021 in spite of wage and inflationary pressures and tougher year-over-year comparisons.\nAdjusted free cash flow in 2021 is now expected to be approximately $1 billion or over 53% of EBITDA and up $15 million from our initial outlook despite capex up $50 million from our original outlook.\nLast week, we closed our new $2.5 billion credit facility, which increased borrowing capacity by almost $300 million, reduced borrowing spreads and enhanced flexibility for continued growth.\nOur balance sheet strength, together with this increased capacity, positions us for potential above-average acquisition activity and an increasing return of capital to shareholders.\nWe have already returned over $400 million to shareholders in 2021 through share repurchases and dividends.\nAnd we are in the process of renewing our normal course issuer bid, authorizing the repurchase of up to 5% of our outstanding shares per annum.\nWe will continue to approach share repurchases opportunistically and anticipate announcing another double-digit percentage per share increase in our cash dividend in October.\nAgain, broad-based strength continues to drive results ahead of expectations as we benefit from reopening activity in a supportive macro environment, including tailwinds from recovered commodity values.\nWe've once again demonstrated the importance of being selective about markets and intentional about driving results.\nQuality of revenue and comparative price retention across markets matter.\nWe're extremely pleased to be in a position to raise our outlook for the full year.\nWe are set up for continuing margin expansion through the second half of 2021 as proactive unbudgeted price increases offset wage and inflationary pressures.\nWe are on track for adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1 billion and adjusted EBITDA margins back above pre-COVID-19 levels.\nFinally, we expect to announce another double-digit percentage increase in our regular quarterly cash dividend in October and remain well positioned for potential significant increase in acquisition outlays to drive further growth in 2021 and beyond.\nWe appreciate your time today.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Joining me on the call today are Tim Gokey, our Chief Executive Officer; and our Chief Financial Officer, Edmund Reese.\nA summary of these risks can be found on the second and third page of the slides and a more complete description on our annual report on Form 10-K.\nWe will also be referring to several non-GAAP measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of Broadridge's underlying operating results.\nI'll begin with an overview of our key messages and an update on our third quarter results, including our performance against our strategic objectives.\nIt's an exciting time to be at Broadridge, and we have a lot to cover, so let's get started.\nI'm pleased to share that Broadridge delivered strong third quarter results.\nRecurring revenues and adjusted operating income both rose 8%.\nOur results in both ICS and GTO are being propelled by long-term trends, including increasing digitization, mutualization and the democratization of investing.\nThese trends are driving strong new business growth, record growth in the number of shareholders and higher trading volumes.\nWe're also executing well against our strategic growth plan across governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management.\nI'll highlight some of those initiatives in a few minutes.\nA combination of those strong results and continued execution against our growth plans is giving us the confidence to continue to invest in our business.\nWe've continued to fund attractive investments in our products, platforms and people, including the pending acquisition of Itiviti.\nWe're also substantially increasing our guidance for fiscal year 2021 on both the top and bottom line.\nWe now expect recurring revenue growth of 8% to 10% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% to 13%.\nWhile the new guidance reflects the impact of Itiviti, the bulk of this raise is organic, as Edmund will discuss.\nThe net result of all these points, our strong third quarter results, our continued internal and M&A investment and our outlook for fiscal 2021 is that Broadridge is executing well and is on track to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year financial objectives, including 8% to 12% adjusted earnings per share growth.\nWe remain focused on delivering long-term growth driven by secular trends and consistent investment across our governance wealth and capital markets businesses and, in turn, generate consistent, sustainable top quartile shareholder returns.\nBroadridge's ability to generate those attractive returns is driven by executing on our clear long-term growth plan.\nSo let me update you on some highlights of our recent progress on Slide five.\nI'll start with ICS.\nRecurring revenues rose 11% to $586 million driven by revenue from new sales and very strong equity record growth.\nThe biggest driver of ICS' strong growth was revenue from new sales, and I'm pleased to see the impact of recent investments on our results.\nLet me share two examples of our focus on product investment and strong execution are translating directly into increased revenue growth.\nThe first is the Shareholder Rights Directive II.\nOver the past two years, we've created a shareholder communications hub, linking millions of investors across the EU and with hundreds of wealth managers, winning almost 300 new clients along the way.\nNow as we enter proxy season, we're starting to see those efforts translate into new revenues helping to drive 80-plus percent growth in our international proxy business.\nVirtual shareholder meetings continue to be a great example of product investment translating into new revenues.\nOver the past year, we've upgraded our VSM capabilities to include the latest in virtual meeting capabilities, including state-of-the-art video and audio technology, improved Q&A functionality, one-click shareholder authentication and seamless proxy voting.\nThose upgrades have helped retain our existing clients and have driven additional growth.\nWe are now on pace to serve almost 1,900 virtual shareholder meetings this proxy season, up from 1,400 last spring.\nThe second factor driving ICS was very strong equity record growth, which was 20% for the quarter.\nIt's clear, the move to reducing trading commissions has triggered a significant expansion in the number of market participants, which contributed to the increase in equity record growth.\nThat strong growth has been broad-based across our broker clients but has been most pronounced at the online brokers.\nIt has also been broad-based across issuers with 20% growth across both widely held stocks and those with more medium-sized shareholder bases.\nWe did see large increases at a handful of names, including so-called meme stocks like GameStop.\nBut those increases only contributed one point of the overall growth.\nCommission-free trading is the latest step in a long-term trend.\nIt includes the rise of ETFs, lower trading costs across all participants and changes in investor interfaces that helps propel high single-digit equity and fund record growth over the past decade.\nBroadridge has invested to scale its capabilities to meet that rise in demand, increase the digitization of critical regulatory communications and ensure that both new and existing investors get the information they need to understand the risks and participate in the governance of their investments.\nLooking forward, we expect strong record growth to extend into the fourth quarter with our testing indicating 25% stock record growth for Q4.\nTo close off on governance.\nLet me touch briefly on regulatory.\nI want to congratulate Commissioner Gensler on his confirmation as SEC Chairman.\nAs we have with every chair and administration of both parties over the past 40 years, we look forward to assisting by investing in the next generation of technology, to help the SEC achieve its mandate to better inform and protect investors, all while reducing cost for registers and creating a fair return for our shareholders.\nLet's turn now to our capital markets franchise.\nCapital markets' recurring revenues slipped by 1% as steady international growth was offset as expected by lower license revenues.\nWe anticipate this period of flattish revenue to continue through the fourth quarter before picking up again in fiscal '22 as we onboard our very healthy backlog.\nOn the strategic front, our planned acquisition of activity represent a significant enhancement of our ability to drive value to our clients.\nFor those who may have missed our call a few weeks ago, let me remind you why we think this transaction is such an exciting step forward for our global capital markets franchise.\nAs a leading provider of order management and trade execution technology and connectivity solutions for financial institutions, Itiviti gives Broadridge a compelling opportunity to extend our capital market service offering.\nThe combination of Itiviti's front-office trading solutions, with Broadridge's leading post-trade back-office capabilities, will allow us to serve our client's entire trade life cycle from order to settlement.\nWith increasing high frequency and algorithm trading, it's increasingly important to serve clients across traditional boundaries.\nThis combination will bring critical data from the back to the front office to improve trading decisions, and it will enable our clients to simplify and improve their front-to-back technology stack and operating model.\nThe combination also strengthens our joint capabilities across equities, exchange-traded derivatives and fixed income, and it substantially extends our global reach, creating significant cross-selling opportunities and enhancing our relationships with blue chip clients.\nThe acquisition virtually doubles our business in APAC and further expands our reach in Europe.\nThat expanded footprint and scale positions us to take advantage of growing mutualization trends in both EMEA and Asia.\nItiviti adds more than $6 billion to Broadridge's total addressable market and will drive stronger growth, margins and earnings, as Edmund will discuss in his remarks.\nEarly feedback from our clients has been overwhelmingly positive, giving us added confidence that our front-to-back thesis and our near-term medium growth outlook are sound.\nAlso of note in our capital markets franchise is the continued development of our LTX fixed income trading platform.\nLTX recently completed the first-ever multi-buyer digital block trading.\nEnabling a single seller to simultaneously access the aggregated liquidity for multiple buyers is a milestone for the fixed income market, and I hope one of the many steps toward creating a more liquid corporate bond market.\nTo date, 10 dealers and over 40 asset managers have joined the LTX platform.\nAnd an additional 14 institutions are signed in the onboarding process, including one of the world's largest fixed income managers.\nLet's turn next to our wealth and investment management business, where revenues grew by 7%, driven by new client additions and higher equity trading volumes.\nA key part of our growth strategy is to expand our sales of component solutions.\nSo it's terrific to see new client onboardings across a full range of our wealth and investment management products.\nWe also continue to make progress on building our industry-leading wealth management platform, which will help clients with the digital transformation of their wealth business.\nWe're already live with our average daily balance billing solution and industry milestone.\nWe're currently in active testing of our phone office workstation with select advisors, setting the stage for a period of extensive testing of the broader platform before going live.\nOur sales and marketing efforts with several new clients to this platform are advancing well.\nClients see that using the Broadridge wealth platform to drive digitization by seamlessly connecting the back office functions we already provide, with additional select front and middle office capabilities, will drive a stronger top and bottom line by bringing new capabilities to advisors and clients while digitizing financial advisor, branch and back office interactions.\nAnother important part of our wealth strategy is developing a robust partner network to ensure that we can integrate cutting-edge capabilities from innovative partners.\nRecent partnerships include Fligoo for predictive analytics and Anchor Bank for securities-based lending; and, a wealth management fintech accelerator.\nThese partnerships and others represent ongoing steps in building a network that will enable our clients to rapidly adopt new technologies.\nWhen I spoke to you at the close of our fiscal third quarter a year ago, the economic outlook was deeply uncertain and from the New York area and much of the world was locked down.\nMy remarks at that time were focused on the steps we were taking to keep our associates safe and meet the needs of our clients in an unprecedented time.\nToday, after 12 long months, there remains significant challenges and thinking, in particular, of our more than 3,000 associates in India and of their families and friends.\nBut the global outlook is unquestionably brighter, with increasing economic growth marching, hand-in-hand with rising vaccination rates.\nThe pandemic has also accelerated many long-term trends, including digitization, mutualization and next-generation resiliency.\nAnd the lower cost and friction for investing is bringing in millions of new investors.\nThese changes are clearly having a significant impact across wealth management, governance and capital markets.\nThey're causing financial services leaders to rapidly adopt next-generation technologies.\nAnd Broadridge is building the suite of capabilities that will help them navigate and win this period of change.\nWe do so from a position of strength.\nWe started the fiscal year last July expecting 2% to 6% recurring revenue growth and 4% to 10% adjusted earnings per share growth.\nOur focus then was on driving enough expense savings to assure that we could continue to fund critical growth investments.\nFast forward nine months, and we are poised to deliver 8% to 10% recurring revenue growth, driven by a combination of strong new sales and healthy financial markets.\nAfter achieving our expense targets, we're now investing heavily in new product capabilities, enhancing our global post-trade platform and building next-generation capabilities across digital communications, wealth management and fixed income trading, among other investments.\nWe're also adding talent and investing in our people to make Broadridge the best place for the most talented associates in our industry.\nLast but not least, we're on the brink of closing our $2.5 billion acquisition of Itiviti, expanding our capital markets franchise and further strengthening our global footprint.\nAnd yet even after those investments and the near-term dilution from Itiviti, we're positioned to deliver 11% to 13% adjusted earnings per share growth.\nBroadridge is at its front foot and leaning into the opportunities we see ahead.\nIt has been a remarkable year.\nLooking further ahead, we're on track to achieve the higher end of our 3-year growth objectives, driving strong recurring revenue and double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.\nWe see long-term trends continuing to drive demand for our services.\nAnd our investments are creating new avenues for growth long beyond our current 2-year objectives.\nThe future of Broadridge is brighter than ever.\nWe've asked a lot of our team over the past 12 months, and they're delivering.\nThey stayed focused on clients, and through them are helping to build better financial lives for millions.\nAs you can see from the Q3 financial summary on Slide seven, Broadridge delivered another strong quarter.\nRecurring revenue grew 8% to $900 million.\nAdjusted operating income also grew 8% to $284 million.\nMargins declined 60 basis points to 20.4% as we successfully made the investments that we discussed last quarter in our technology platforms, in our products, our people.\nOur operating income was partially offset by a higher tax rate in Q3 '21 as we grew over discrete tax benefits in Q3 '20.\nSo our adjusted earnings per share grew to $1.76 in the quarter, up 5% over Q3 '20.\nNow let's turn the slide and get into the details of the quarter, starting with recurring revenue growth.\nAs I said, recurring revenue grew 8% in the quarter, powered by 7% organic growth, and comfortably within our historic mid- to high single-digit growth performance.\ndemonstrating the strength of our sustainable recurring revenue growth model.\nAs a result of that strong organic growth and an increase in our outlook for the fourth quarter, we're raising our guidance for recurring revenue growth to 8% to 10% for the full year, up from our prior guidance of growth at the higher end of 3% to 6%.\nNow let's look at this quarter's recurring revenue growth by business on Slide nine.\nI'll start with our ICS segment, where revenues grew by 11% to $586 million.\nRegulatory revenues rose 20% to $290 million driven by the 20% equity record growth, higher mutual fund and ETF communications volumes and net new sales, including from our Shareholder Rights Directive II solution that Tim highlighted earlier.\nWe expect strong regulatory revenue growth to continue in the fourth quarter with, our current testing indicating 25% equity record growth.\nAfter a strong 12 months, we now have significant penetration of our VSM solution across the S&P 500, and we expect issuer revenue growth to ease going forward as we start to lap the increase of VSM activity that began in Q4 '20.\nFund solutions revenue was flat as double-digit growth in data and analytics was offset by lower interest income from custodied accounts in our funds processing business.\nCustomer communications revenues were also flat with double-digit growth in our high-margin digital products, offset by lower print volumes due in part to the pandemic-depressed activity levels.\nWe expect growth in both our data-driven solutions and customer communications business to pick up in the fourth quarter as these headwinds ease.\nWealth and investment management revenues rose 7%, driven by the onboarding of new component sales and higher retail trading.\nCapital markets revenues fell 1% of strong growth from international sales, was offset by $6 million in lower license revenues, which declined as expected.\nAs we said last quarter, this flat revenue growth will continue in the Q4 '21 before picking up in fiscal year '22.\nLet's turn to Page 10, where we show more detail on volume trends.\nBroadridge's recurring revenue growth benefits from underlying volume growth trends, including stock record growth.\nOver the past decade, record growth across equity, mutual funds and ETF has grown 6% to 8%.\nRecently, equity record growth has accelerated to 11% in Q4 '20 and continued to increase through the year to 20% in Q3 '21, surpassing the estimates from our January testing.\nAs I said, we expect these growth trends to continue and reach 25% in Q4 '21.\nMutual fund and ETF record growth picked up as well to 7%, more in line with our historical growth rates.\nWe are modeling a return to more moderate mid-single-digit growth across both equity, mutual fund ETF records for fiscal year '22, with stronger growth in the seasonally smaller first half and more moderate growth in the second half.\nTouching briefly on trade volumes, which you'll see on the bottom of this slide.\nThis is the fifth consecutive quarter of aggregate double-digit volume growth.\nThis growth reflects the increase in volatility in retail investor engagement over the past year, which continued to be quite strong well into the third quarter.\nMore recently, trading volatility subsided during the second half of March, and we expect tougher trading volume comps in Q4.\nLet's move to Slide 11 for a closer look at the drivers of our recurring revenue.\nOrganic growth at a very healthy 7% continues to be the largest component of our recurring revenue growth, and new sales remains the biggest driver with strong growth contribution from both ICS and GTO.\nWe also continued our long track record of revenue retention above 97%.\nInternal growth contributed another three points as growth in ICS regulatory volumes more than offset the decline in GTO license revenue.\nWe've now fully lapped all of our fiscal year 2020 acquisitions.\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect Itiviti to add three points to fourth quarter recurring revenue growth.\nTotal revenue growth this quarter was stronger than usual, reaching 11%, with distribution revenue contributing three points due to the increased mailings that correspond with the high record growth and the increased event-driven activity this quarter.\nMoving forward, we continue to expect the low to no-margin distribution revenue to decline over time as we focus on increasing higher-margin digital revenue across our governance business.\nEvent-driven communications remain an integral part of our client offering.\nEvent-driven revenues have climbed over the past four quarters to be more in line with our historical norms of about $50 million a quarter and reached $74 million in the third quarter, well above last year's unusually low $39 million.\nBroadridge benefited from an increase in mutual fund proxy activity as well as a rebound in proxy contest volumes and capital markets transactions.\nWe expect fiscal '21 event-driven revenue to be more in line with the average that we've seen over the past seven years.\nFor modeling purposes, we're assuming $50 million to $60 million of event-driven revenues in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to Slide 13.\nAdjusted operating income grew by 8%.\nOur adjusted operating income margin declined by 60 basis points, reflecting the continued investments that we're making in our technology platforms and product capabilities that we highlighted on our last quarterly call.\nThese investments, which support our long-term growth, have a short-term impact on margin expansion, but we remain on track to deliver approximately 50 basis points of margin expansion for the full year, right in line with our fiscal year '21 guidance and 3-year growth objectives.\nThis formula, forgoing near-term margin expansion and consistently investing in our technology platforms and products to drive long-term sustainable recurring revenue growth, will continue to be an important part of how we manage our business.\nAs a Chief Financial Officer focused on long-term growth, it's encouraging to see us making these types of investments across all of our product lines, giving us momentum toward future growth.\nOur $124 million closed sales year-to-date are in line with our performance over the same period last year.\nWe continue to see strong demand for our ICS solutions, including regulatory and issuer communications and data solutions.\nWe remain on track to achieve our full year guidance of $190 million to $235 million for closed sales, which implies a fourth quarter range of $66 million to $111 million.\nHistorically, the closed sales performance in the last quarter of the year has been impacted by the timing of larger deals.\nA handful of larger signings could propel us to the top end of our guidance range, and conversely, delays could put us at the lower end.\nAnd I'll also note that we continue to feel good about our recurring revenue backlog, which was 12% of our fiscal '20 recurring revenues as of Q4 '20 and gives us great visibility into our top line growth.\nMoving to capital allocation on the following slide.\nWe generated $136 million of free cash flow year-to-date, up $54 million over the first nine months of fiscal year '20 driven by higher earnings and strong working capital management.\nDuring the first nine months of the fiscal year, we invested $205 million in building out our industry platforms and another $71 million in capex and software spending.\nOur M&A investment through the first nine months of the year was 0, but that will change with our announced $2.5 billion acquisition of Itiviti, which I'll touch on in a moment.\nEven after completing the Itiviti acquisition, Broadridge will remain committed to a balanced capital allocation policy, which prioritizes internal investment, growing our dividend, M&A and returning excess capital to shareholders.\nImportantly, we are also committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating, which means we'll prioritize debt paydown over share repurchases and expect to limit ourselves to smaller tuck-in M&A opportunities over the next several quarters.\nGiven our strong free cash flow, we believe that we can comfortably achieve our new 2.5 times leverage target by the end of fiscal year '23.\nTurning to capital returns on the right-hand side of the slide, our dividend has grown and remains in line with our historical 45% payout ratio.\nOn Slide 16, we are on track to close the Itiviti acquisition in the coming weeks.\nSo let me take a moment to give you some additional clarity about the expected impact that Itiviti will have on our financial performance.\nI'll start with fiscal year '21.\nWe expect Itiviti to add $25 billion to $30 billion or one point to our full year recurring revenue growth, which equates to three points to our fourth quarter growth.\nAnd the acquisition is expected to be modestly dilutive to our adjusted earnings per share growth.\nIn fiscal year '22, we expect Itiviti to add approximately $250 million or about eight points to our recurring revenue growth.\nAnd we expect the acquisition to be accretive by approximately two to three points or roughly $0.10 to $0.15 to adjusted earnings per share growth.\nPlease note that Itiviti's results in both fiscal year '21 and fiscal year '22 will be negatively impacted by the accounting treatment of acquired revenue, which will reduce revenue recognition by approximately $30 million in total with 2/3 of that impact in fiscal '22.\nThis revenue haircut is incorporated in the numbers that I just shared with you.\nFinally, I want to reiterate the commentary that I gave you when we announced the deal, about the impact on our 3-year growth objectives.\nWe expect Itiviti to add 2.5 to three points to our 3-year recurring revenue growth CAGR and, after interest, more than two points to our 3-year adjusted earnings per share CAGR.\nNow turning to guidance on Slide 17.\nWe are raising our outlook for fiscal '21 recurring revenue growth to 8% to 10% from the higher end of 3% to 6%, and that includes one point of growth from Itiviti.\nWe are raising our guidance for total revenue growth to 8% to 10% from the higher end of 1% to 4%.\nWe continue to expect our adjusted operating income margin to expand to approximately 18%, up from 17.5% in fiscal year '20 as we balance near-term returns with continued investments to sustain long-term growth.\nWe expect adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% to 13%, up from the higher end of 6% to 10%, and that includes a 1-point drag from Itiviti.\nFinally, as I noted earlier, we continue to expect closed sales in the range of $190 million to $235 million.\nThe Broadridge Financial model is working.\nWe are on track to deliver strong 8% to 10% recurring revenue growth.\nThat growth is fueling our ability to both invest and expand margins.\nAt the same time, our strong free cash flow business model enables us to pursue balanced capital allocation, commit to a rising dividend, fund investments in our platform and products and step up and make a significant M&A investment to grow our capital markets franchise.\nThe end result is that we're on track to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year financial objectives of 7% to 9% recurring revenue growth and 8% to 12% adjusted earnings per share growth.\nIt's a great example of how we manage our business to drive sustainable revenue growth, steady and consistent adjusted earnings per share growth and historically top quartile TSR.\nSummary:

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm pleased to report that we started the year strong, delivering another solid quarter.\nBoth segments got off to a good start.\nAs a company, we achieved $222 million in revenues and excellent bottom line performance, with GAAP earnings per share of $0.85 or $0.87 per share on an adjusted basis.\nOur cash flow generation was particularly good for first quarter.\nAnd we continue to pay down debt and have a healthy balance sheet, which enables investment in future growth.\nI'm particularly proud of how our employees continue to perform through the pandemic.\nEven while following our COVID-19 protocols and safety procedures, our operating teams are driving process improvements with Lean Kaizen.\nOur R&D teams are working on the next generation of materials and products, and we continue to do a great job for our customers in delivery, quality and service.\nOur Machine Clothing segment had its strongest quarterly top line performance since 2015, with revenues up nearly $12 million year-over-year and good order activity in Q1, which bodes well for this year.\nIn fact, other than the secular decline in publication grades, Machine Clothing end market demand in packaging, tissue, pulp and engineered fabrics were all positive in Q1.\nIn addition to a solid backlog, our engineering teams are hard at work developing new technology belts for our customers, which is critical to our success and value proposition.\nWe have seen some instances of isolated supply constraints impacting raw material pricing and delivery timing in this segment, and we continue to actively manage our supply chain, securing the materials we need to support our customers' demand.\nIn summary, our Machine Clothing segment continues to perform well.\nserving customers around the world as the recognized global leader supplying these critical consumable components to the paper industry.\nThis success is the result of a disciplined execution of our long-term strategy.\nIn Aerospace, as we reported last quarter, our Engineered Composites segment will be grinding through a year of destocking of excess inventory in the channels for LEAP, Boeing 787 and F-35 products.\nThat said, Engineered Composites is on track with their plan and ready for the upturn as commercial air transport improves, inventory in the channels is consumed and our production is back in sync with aircraft OEM production.\nWe're on good platforms that we expect will recover, and we continue to do this as a time to further improve our operations.\nWe're ready and looking forward to the upturn.\nWe're working closely with Safran to coordinate our operations as the LEAP engine production ramps up, supporting the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX.\nWith domestic air travel recovering first and fueling demand for narrow-body aircraft, A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX are in the sweet spot of the air transport recovery.\nIn Engineered Composites, looking beyond our current portfolio of programs, our opportunity pipeline is as full as it's ever been.\nWe're developing a breadth of capability to be the next-generation supplier of advanced composite materials.\nThis ranges from our proprietary 3D woven composites currently used on LEAP engine fan blades and hand cases to automated fiber placement composite wing skins for Lockheed Martin's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to complex components on the Sikorsky CH-53K helicopter.\nWe continue to develop applications for the Wing of Tomorrow program with Airbus Industries, and we're investing more this year in R&D projects with new customers and new platforms using advanced materials such as our 3D woven composites on a range of exciting applications, including unmanned hypersonic and electric aircraft.\nThe sum of these efforts furthers our goal to diversify and grow our customer base and broaden our material science capabilities.\nAs I mentioned, we have a strong balance sheet and good free cash flow generation.\nThese allow us to sustain our investment in the technology and customer programs that expand and broaden our competitive positioning in both segments.\nOur first priority for capital allocation is to invest in organic growth programs across both business segments and then to seek acquisitions that fit our long-term strategy.\nOur reputation for reliability, service and technical excellence is well established in the Machine Clothing segment, and our brand is growing in aerospace as a reliable supplier and engineered materials partner, and we're optimistic about the long-term opportunities in both segments.\nI will first talk about the results for the quarter and then comment on the outlook for our business for the balance of the year.\nFor the first quarter, total company net sales were $222.4 million, a decrease of 5.7% compared to the $235.8 million delivered in the same quarter last year.\nAdjusting for currency translation effects, net sales declined by 8.2% year-over-year in the quarter.\nIn Machine Clothing, also adjusting for currency translation effects, net sales were up 4.9% year-over-year, resulting in the highest Q1 revenue for the segment since 2015, as Bill had mentioned.\nThe increase was driven by growth in all major products -- all major grades of product other than publication grades.\nThe revenue from publication declined by 10% in the quarter and represented only 16% of MC's revenue this quarter.\nCurrency-neutral revenue in both packaging and tissue grades reflected a high single-digit growth rate in the quarter, driven by the high orders we had seen in the fourth quarter of last year.\nEngineered Composites net sales, again, after adjusting for currency translation effects, declined by $26.2 million, primarily caused by significant reductions in LEAP and Boeing 787 program revenue, partially offset by growth on the F-35 and CH-53K platforms.\nDuring the quarter, the ASC LEAP program generated a little under $27 million in revenue, a slight improvement over the roughly $24 million delivered in Q4 of 2020, but down significantly from roughly $39 million delivered in Q1 of last year.\nFirst quarter gross profit for the company was $88.5 million, a reduction of 1% from the comparable period last year.\nThe overall gross margin increased by 190 basis points from 37.9% to 39.8% of net sales.\nWithin the MC segment, gross margin declined from 53.2% to 51.5% of net sales, principally due to higher fixed costs and lower absorption.\nWithin AEC, the gross margin declined from 17% to 16.4% of net sales, driven primarily by the impact of changes in the estimated profitability of long-term contracts.\nLast year, during the first quarter, we recognized a net favorable change in the estimated profitability of long-term contracts of close to $1 million.\nWhile this year, the net change in the estimated profitability of long-term contracts for the first quarter was insignificant.\nFirst quarter selling, technical, general and research expenses declined from $49.2 million in the prior year quarter to $46.7 million in the current quarter and were roughly flat as a percentage of net sales at about 21%.\nThe reduction in the amount of expense reflects the absence of severance costs recognized in the prior year, the impact of additional accounts receivable reserves we recorded in Q1 of 2020 when the pandemic began and lower travel expenses, partially offset by lower foreign exchange gains.\nAs expected and consistent with our full year plans, R&D expenditures in both segments increased this quarter.\nTotal operating income for the company was $41.8 million, up from $39.6 million in the prior year quarter.\nMachine Clothing operating income increased by $3.2 million driven by higher gross profit, partially offset by higher STG&R expense, and AEC operating income fell by $4.7 million, caused by lower gross profit.\nOther income and expense in the quarter netted to an expense of $600,000 compared to an expense of $15.6 million in the same period last year.\nLast year's results included a significant charge related to a foreign currency revaluation loss.\nThe income tax rate for this quarter was 26.7%, compared to the unusually high 62.1% rate we recorded last year.\nThe primary driver of the reduction in the tax rate was the nondeductibility of last year's foreign currency revaluation loss.\nApart from that, in this quarter, favorable income tax adjustments reduced income tax expense by $1.3 million compared to an increase of $5.1 million from similar adjustments in the same quarter last year.\nNet income attributable to the company for the quarter was $27.6 million, an increase of $18.5 million from $9.1 million last year.\nThe increase was primarily driven by the absence this year of last year's foreign currency revaluation loss and by higher operating income.\nEarnings per share was $0.85 in this quarter, compared to $0.28 last year.\nAfter adjusting for the impact of foreign currency revaluation gains and losses, restructuring expenses, expenses associated with the CirComp acquisition and integration and severance costs in the prior year period, adjusted earnings per share was $0.87 this quarter compared to $0.78 last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 2.6% to $60.7 million for the most recent quarter compared to the same period last year.\nMachine Clothing adjusted EBITDA was $54.9 million or 37.1% of net sales this year, up from $49.2 million or 36% of net sales in the prior year quarter.\nAEC adjusted EBITDA was $16.7 million or 22.6% of net sales, down from last year's $22.1 million or 22.3% of net sales.\nTurning to our debt position.\nTotal debt, which consists of amounts reported on our balance sheet as long-term debt or current maturities of long-term debt, declined from $398 million at the end of Q4 2020 to $384 million at the end of Q1 2021.\nAnd cash declined by just over $3 million during the quarter, resulting in a reduction in net debt of over $10 million.\nThe first quarter is typically our lowest quarter for cash flow generation due to working capital seasonality and the incentive compensation payments made during the quarter.\nThis year, we performed better than we would typically expect and delivered free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, of $21.1 million, compared to a use of over $19 million in the same quarter last year, driven primarily by improvements in AEC working capital.\nWe were pleased with the cash flow performance of the AEC segment this quarter, which swung from a significant use in the same quarter last year to significant cash generation this year.\nCapital expenditures in Q1 of each year were approximately $13 million.\nOur absolute net leverage ratio is now 0.65, providing us with a very strong balance sheet, allowing us to take advantage of organic and acquired growth opportunities.\nAs we look forward to the balance of 2021, the outlook for the Machine Clothing segment remained strong.\nCompared to the same quarter last year, MC orders were down 2%.\nHowever, as you may recall, near the end of Q1 in 2020, orders spiked from customers who are concerned about the availability of supply in light of the emerging pandemic.\nFurther, from a backlog perspective, we are in a stronger position entering Q1 in 2021 than we were in 2020.\nSo overall, we are feeling good about our previously issued guidance of revenue for the segment of between $570 million and $590 million.\nFrom a margin perspective in Machine Clothing, we delivered another strong quarter, with adjusted EBITDA margins north of 37%.\nI should note that some of the headwinds we projected this year, most notably a return to normal levels of travel and the absence of the foreign exchange benefits we enjoyed during the middle last year, have yet to impact our comparative results.\nThat said, we are pleased with our performance for the quarter.\nWhile we are maintaining our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the segment of $195 million to $205 million, we are currently trending toward the upper portion of that range.\nTurning to Engineered Composites.\nWe are seeing the expected impact of the 787 frames channel destocking in our top line results.\nDuring the quarter, we generated less than $1 million of revenue from the 787 frames program compared to over $12 million in the same quarter last year.\nI already noted that the ASC LEAP program was also down by about $12 million during the quarter.\nThese two programs account for almost all of the year-over-year decline in AEC revenue that we saw during the quarter.\nAs a result of these declines, the share of AEC revenue derived from defense programs grew to over 48% during the quarter.\nThat said, we will still see the previously disclosed revenue impact from F-35 channel destocking in the second and third quarters.\nSo I would expect the defense program share of AEC revenues to dip somewhat over the next couple of quarters.\nThis will also make the second and third quarters quite challenging for the segment overall.\nThe year is shaping up in line with expectations for the segment, and we are maintaining our guidance range of $275 million to $295 million for segment revenues.\nFrom a profitability perspective, our performance to date is broadly in line with our expectations, and we are maintaining our AEC adjusted EBITDA guidance of $55 million to $65 million.\nWe are also maintaining all of our previously issued guidance ranges for company-level performance, with the exception of guidance for GAAP earnings per share, which has been updated to reflect non-GAAP adjustments recorded in Q1.\nCurrent guidance is as follows: revenue of between $850 million and $890 million; effective income tax rate of 28% to 30%; depreciation amortization of between $70 million and $75 million; capital expenditures in the range of $50 million to $60 million, GAAP earnings per share of between $2.38 and $2.78, down slightly from prior guidance of $2.40 and $2.80; adjusted earnings per share of between $2.40 and $2.80; and adjusted EBITDA of between $195 million and $220 million.\nOverall, we are very pleased with how the year is progressing and hope to see a continued progression to normalcy in the balance of the year.\nOver to you, Greg.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Core in this case means designated financial metrics excluding the impact of the recent S::can and ATI acquisitions.\nWe believe this reference point is important for year-over-year comparability.\nIn summary, I'm pleased with our results for the quarter, delivering sales and earnings per share growth, margin expansion, and robust cash flow.\nMost exciting we experienced record order rates for our smart water solutions across both lines of business as the underlying growth drivers for our digital solutions are embraced by customers.\nThe well-publicized and widespread electronic supply shortages limited our conversion of these record orders into sales in the quarter.\nTempering core sales growth but resulting in a record-high order backlog heading into the second quarter, which bodes well for the balance of the year.\nOur recent acquisitions delivered strong top-line results with net profitability muted as expected as a result of purchase accounting items.\nOverall, our acquisition integration activities are progressing as expected.\nI'll talk about the current environment and our outlook later in the call.\nAs you can see on Slide 4, total sales for the first quarter were $117.8 million compared to $108.5 million in the same period last year, an increase of 9%.\nIn utility water, overall, sales increased 12% reflecting the addition of the s::can and ATi acquisitions, which contributed approximately $10 million of sales in the quarter.\nExcluding acquisitions, core revenues in the utility water product line were essentially flat year-over-year despite record orders due to the Internet and electronic supply component shortages and logistics challenges that limited manufacturing output.\nScarce capacity of electronics is a pervasive market issue impacting many industries and is not isolated to Badger Meter.\nWe did experience growth in overall meter sales and BEACON software as a service revenue and we benefited from strategic value-based pricing actions.\nAs Ken noted, we ended the quarter with strong order momentum and a record backlog, which gives us confidence in our sales outlook moving forward.\nAs expected the flow instrumentation sales rate of change improved sequentially from down 10% last quarter to down 3% year-over-year, with the majority of end markets served experiencing recovering demand trends.\nWe expect to return to overall growth moving forward as a result of improving demand conditions and easier comparisons.\nWe are pleased with the operating profit improvement delivering a 30 basis point increase in margins to 15.1% from 14.8% in the prior year.\nGross margin for the quarter was 41.9%, up a healthy 200 basis points year-over-year.\nThe core business delivered higher gross margins due to positive sales mix, namely higher SaaS revenues along with favorable pricing, which continued to offset the impact of higher brass costs in the quarter.\nMargins also benefited from favorable acquisition mix.\nYou may recall from last quarter we described the water quality acquisitions of s::can and ATi as having higher than line average gross margins combined with higher SEA as a percent of sales and therefore with a net EBITDA range for the combined businesses in the mid-teens.\nThe positive acquisition mix benefit to gross margins was muted by the amortization of inventory fair value step-up in the quarter, but that's mostly behind us moving forward.\nCopper prices continued their upward trajectory after our last earnings call in late January when they were averaging approximately $3.60 a pound to now near $4.20 a pound.\nThis obviously increases the potential cost headwind for the year that we had estimated at $4 million to $5 million to closer to $7 million to $8 million on a year-over-year basis if it were to stay in that $4.20 range.\nWe have executed well in implementing appropriate pricing mechanisms to offset this inflation as evidenced by our first quarter results and will continue to remain nimble and actively addressing inflation.\nTurning to SEA expenses, the first quarter spend of $31.6 million increased $4.3 million from the prior year.\nThis includes a full quarter of SEA spending for both s:can and ATi along with the higher level of acquired intangible asset amortization.\nBeyond the impact of acquisitions, higher personnel costs were more than offset by lower travel trade show and other ongoing pandemic impacted expenses, the decrease of which we will anniversary starting next quarter.\nThe income tax provision in the first quarter of 2021 was 22.2%, slightly lower than the prior years' 25.6% rate.\nIn summary, earnings per share was $0.47 in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 15% from the prior year's earnings per share of $0.41.\nWorking capital as a percent of sales was 24.3% down from 25.5% at calendar year-end despite the addition of ATi, largely due to working capital initiatives in the quarter.\nOur free cash flow of $28.8 million was consistent with the prior year.\nIn early January we deployed $44 million net of cash acquired for ATi and currently have cash on the balance sheet of approximately $51 million.\nAlong with the untapped revolver, we have significant financial flexibility to execute our growth strategies.\nTurning to Slide 5.\nWe don't provide guidance but believe it is important to bring awareness to the increased level of unevenness we're likely going to see in our top line as this year unfolds.\nI want to spend just a minute highlighting comparative sales data to provide a clear picture of the varied influences on the quarterly sales growth trend lines and discuss the optimism we have for our results for the remainder of the year and beyond.\nThis chart depicts the quarterly sales growth rate of our core business in 2020 and into the first quarter of 2021.\nAs you can see by the various call-out boxes, we had some specific dynamics in 2020 with COVID and now in the first quarter of 2021 that we need to be mindful of as we look at the rest of the year comparisons.\nNamely, we will have an easier comp for our upcoming Q2 versus the 2020 COVID lockdowns combined with a portion of the record backlog converting to sales given the anticipation for some modest improvement in electronic supply.\nAs we move into Q3, we'll have a difficult comparison based on the post-COVID lockdown order rate and manufacturing recovery last year.\nThe bottom line to all of this is that we continue to have strong momentum and robust bid activity, order rates and backlog consistent with our long-term outlook for mid-single-digit growth.\nFrom a top line standpoint, the acquisitions are performing in line with their historic growth patterns and our integration teams are working to begin putting the steps and processes in place to realize future growth synergies.\nTurning to our outlook.\nThe underlying market drivers for smart water solutions remain intact and in fact, as we've discussed, COVID has spotlighted the benefits of AMi for common utility challenges such as remote work efficiencies and regular and automated consumer engagement tools.\nWater quality and security concerns also are driving accelerating interest in our real-time digital solutions.\nWe saw evidence of that during the recent climate events in Texas and other Southern U.S. States which experienced the debilitating deep freeze with a number of customers describe the real-life benefits of having our cellular AMi solution deployed which remained in service due to the criticality and cellular networks.\nThese utilities were able to obtain real-time mission critical data which help identify potential main breaks, pipe freezes and bursts keeping safe water supply available for their end consumers.\nNow surprisingly, one of the most common outlook questions we get from investors relates to the potential impact of the recent infrastructure proposal from the Biden administration, specifically the portion of the plan that calls for $56 billion of spending to upgrade and modernize America's drinking water, wastewater and stormwater systems and additional $10 billion in part to invest in rural small water systems.\nAs we have repeatedly stated, the underlying secular trends driving demand for our digital water solutions are already evident and growing.\nStimulus investments could perhaps accelerate or add to those underlying drivers, but are not necessary for us to realize our long-term growth plans.\nIn fact, as we stated over the past couple of quarters, it's the widespread availability of vaccinations that are most relevant to near-term demand patterns.\nIt's too early to tell if a potential pause in spending might occur as utilities weight and digest the implications of the stimulus proposals.\nOur view is that if a pause would occur it would simply be a matter of timing and not a change to the long-term structural growth of our business.\nWe will as always focus on the elements of our business within our control.\nOur teams have done an outstanding job managing value-based pricing initiatives, which have mitigated the significant increase in brass costs, our sourcing and supply chain teams have their hands full actively managing the varied ramifications of the wide-ranging and Universal Electronics shortages along with certain logistics bottlenecks, including those at West Coast ports.\nWhile these circumstances are not unique to Badger Meter, I am confident that we will be able to adequately support customers despite these many challenges.\nWe will continue to manage working capital and drive cash flow in order to support our investments in both organic and acquisition-driven growth.\nOur focus remains on enhancing the product and software offering serving water-related markets and applications globally.\nFinally, I want to provide an update on our ESG activities notably establishing our first greenhouse gas intensity reduction target.\nThis represents an important step on our ESG journey as we work to mitigate the impact we have on the environment and continue to be good stewards of the resources we use in our operations.\nThe 15% intensity reduction goal by 2030 was developed through a strategic initiative to capture baseline greenhouse gas data globally and identify opportunities to reduce energy and consumption and other Level 1 and 2 emissions.\nWe will set annual smart goals to monitor progress and we'll report externally on our efforts in our biennial sustainability report.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We appreciate your time today.\nThis is how we measure and manage these divisions internally and from now on, it's how we will report them externally.\nThe combined amount of divisional intersegment revenues with Protiviti is also separately disclosed.\nWe are very pleased that third quarter and early October results reflect consistent weekly and monthly sequential gains across our divisions.\nProtiviti had another outstanding quarter reporting its 12th consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue gains, leveraging a strong pipeline of diversified service offerings, including particularly robust growth with the blended solutions with our staffing operations.\nWe're also pleased with the quarter-on-quarter growth in our staffing divisions, led by our permanent placement and OfficeTeam divisions.\n2020 continues to be an unprecedented year.\nI'm extremely proud of the resourcefulness and commitment exhibited by all of our employees as we maintain high levels of service to our clients and candidates.\nCompanywide revenues were $1.19 billion in the third quarter of 2020, down 23% from last year's third quarter on a reported basis and down 24% on an as-adjusted basis.\nNet income per share in the third quarter was $0.67 compared to $1.01 in the third quarter a year ago.\nCash flow from operations during the quarter was $139 million and capital expenditures were $7 million.\nIn September, we distributed a $0.34 per share cash dividend to our shareholders of record, for a total cash outlay of $38 million.\nWe also acquired approximately 450,000 shares during the quarter for $24 million.\nWe have 1 million shares available for repurchase under our Board-approved stock repurchase plan.\nReturn on invested capital for the company was 25.8% in the third quarter.\nLet's start with revenues.\nAs Keith noted, global revenues were $1.190 billion in the third quarter.\nThis is a decrease of 23% from the third quarter one year ago on a reported basis and a decrease of 24% on an as-adjusted basis.\nAlso on an as-adjusted basis, third quarter staffing revenues were down 31% year-over-year.\nU.S. Staffing revenues were $666 million, down 32% from the prior year.\nNon-U.S. Staffing revenues were $203 million, down 29% year-over-year on an as-adjusted basis.\nWe have 326 staffing locations worldwide, including 88 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.\nIn the third quarter, there were 64.3 billing days compared to 64.1 billing days in the third quarter one year ago.\nThe current fourth quarter has 61.7 billing days equivalent to the fourth quarter of one year ago.\nCurrency exchange rate movements during the third quarter had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $4 million.\nThis increased our year-over-year reported staffing revenue growth rate by 0.3 percentage points.\nNow, let's take a closer look at the results for Protiviti.\nGlobal revenues in the third quarter were $321 million.\n$260 million of that is from business within the United States, and $61 million is from operations outside the United States.\nOn an as-adjusted basis, global third quarter Protiviti revenues were up 6% versus the year-ago period, with U.S. Protiviti revenues up 10%.\nNon-U.S. revenues were down 8% on an as-adjusted basis.\nExchange rates had the effect of increasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $2 million and increasing its year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.7 percentage points.\nProtiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 28 countries.\nUnder these plans, employees direct the investments of their account balances, and the company makes cash deposits into an investment trust consistent with these directions.\nAs realized and unrealized investment gains and losses occur, the company's deferred compensation obligation to employees changes accordingly.\nHowever, the value of the related investment trust assets also changes by an equal and offsetting amount, leaving no net cost to the company.\nGoing forward, changes in the company's deferred compensation obligations noted above will continue to be included in SG&A or, in the case of Protiviti, direct cost.\nHowever, the offsetting changes in the investment trust assets will be presented separately, below SG&A and outside of operating income.\nThis does not change the reported level of pre-tax or after-tax income or cash flows provided -- previously provided.\nGoing forward, we will replace the discussion of consolidated operating income with the non-GAAP measure of combined segment income.\nThis will be calculated as consolidated income before income taxes adjusted for interest income and amortization of intangible assets.\nTurning now to gross margin.\nIn our temporary and consultant staffing operations, third quarter gross margin was 37.5% of applicable revenues compared to 37.9% of applicable revenues in the third quarter one year ago.\nThe year-over-year decline in gross margin percentage is primarily due to lower conversion revenues.\nOur permanent placement revenues in the third quarter were 10% of consolidated staffing revenues versus 10.7% of consolidated staffing revenues in the same quarter one year ago.\nWhen combined with temporary and consultant gross margin, overall staffing gross margin decreased 80 basis points compared to the year-ago third period to 43.8%.\nFor Protiviti, gross margin was $87 million in the third quarter or 27.1% of Protiviti revenues.\nThis includes $3.4 million or 1.1% of Protiviti revenues of deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment accounts.\nOne year ago, gross margin for Protiviti was $88 million or 29.4% of Protiviti revenues, including $200,000 of deferred compensation expense related to investment trust activities.\nCompanywide SG&A costs were 32.8% of global revenues in the third quarter compared to 31.2% in the same quarter one year ago.\nDeferred compensation expenses related to increases in underlying trust investments had the impact of increasing SG&A as a percentage of revenue by 1.9% in the current third quarter and 0.1% in the same quarter one year ago.\nStaffing SG&A costs were 40.2% of staffing revenues in the third quarter versus 34.8% in third quarter of 2019.\nIncluded in staffing SG&A costs was deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying trust investment assets of 2.6% and 0.1% respectively.\nThe increase in staffing SG&A as a percentage of revenues is primarily the result of continued negative leverage resulting from the decline in revenues.\nThird quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were 13% of Protiviti revenues compared to 16.2% of revenues in the year-ago period.\nOperating income for the quarter was $77 million.\nThis includes $26 million of deferred compensation expense related to increases in the underlying investment trust assets.\nCombined segment income was therefore $103 million in the third quarter.\nCombined segment margin was 8.6%.\nThird quarter segment income from our staffing divisions was $54 million, with a segment margin of 6.2%.\nSegment income for Protiviti in the third quarter was $49 million with a segment margin of 15.2%.\nOur third quarter tax rate was 26% compared to 28% a year ago.\nThe lower third quarter tax rate is primarily due to annual adjustments made to reconcile our tax accounts to prior year's tax returns as actually filed.\nOur nine-month year-over-year tax rate of 28% is in line with what we expect for the full year.\nMoving on to accounts receivable, at the end of the third quarter, accounts receivable were $690 million and implied days sales outstanding or DSO was 52.3 days.\nBefore we move to fourth quarter guidance, let's review some of the monthly revenue trends we saw in the third quarter and so far in October, all adjusted for currency and billing days.\nOur temporary and consultant staffing divisions exited the third quarter with September revenues down 29.3% versus the prior year compared to a 30.7% decrease for the full quarter.\nRevenues in the first two weeks of October were down 27% compared to the same period one year ago.\nPermanent placement revenues in September were down 30.1% versus September of 2019.\nThis compares to a 35.7% decrease for the full quarter.\nFor the first three weeks in October, permanent placement revenues were down 31% compared to the same period in 2019.\nWe provide this information so that you have insight into some of the trends we saw during the third quarter and into October.\nBut, as you know, these are very brief time periods.\nWe caution against reading too much into them.\nWith that in mind, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance.\nRevenues of $1.155 billion to $1.255 billion; income per share $0.55 to $0.75.\nThe midpoint of our guidance implies a year-over-year revenue decline of 22% on an as-adjusted basis inclusive of Protiviti.\nThe major financial assumptions underlying the midpoint of these estimates are as follows.\nRevenue growth on a year on year basis, staffing down 27% to 30%; Protiviti up 5% to 7%; overall down 21% to 23%.\nOn the gross margin percentages, Temporary and Consultant Staffing 37% to 38%; Protiviti 27% to 29%; overall 39% to 40%.\nSG&A as percentage of revenues, excluding deferred compensation investment impacts, staffing 36% to 38%; Protiviti 14% to 16%; overall 30% to 32%.\nSegment income, Staffing 6% to 8%; Protiviti 12% to 15%; overall 8% to 10%.\nWe expect our tax rate to be between 27% and 29% and shares to be 113 million.\nWe limit our guidance to one quarter.\nAs is evidenced in the growth of our newly reported inter-segment revenues.\nThe partnership between Protiviti and our staffing operations continues to be an accelerating source of growth for our enterprise.\nWe have also seen particular strength in our services to the public sector and financial services clients.\nIn addition, we've experienced increased demand for services and solutions in cloud technology, online security, data privacy and digital transformation as enterprise client companies have continued to strategically invest in these areas.\nThe significant reductions we made to our cost structure in the second quarter have also benefited the third quarter and will continue to benefit future quarters.\nRemote and hybrid working models will continue long after the pandemic ceases to require them.\nAccess to talent is no longer limited to time zones or geographies.\nWith our global network of talent and world-class technology tools, we can provide the right match for clients and candidates regardless of location.\nWhile uncertainty remains in the overall economic environment as the pandemic continues, there is much to be optimistic about.\nAs the fourth quarter progresses, the nature, timing and amount of any additional fiscal stimulus should be known.\nMedical solutions to the COVID-19 virus move ever closer to reality, and the NFIB continues to report improving trends in the small business community.\nA recent study showed that more than half of small businesses are hiring or trying to hire, with the vast majority reporting few or no qualified applicants.\nWe continue to believe in our positioning for future growth with the unique strengths of our brands, people, technology and professional business model.\nPlease ask just one question and a single follow-up, as needed.\nIf there's time, we'll come back to you.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:blackhillscorp.com, under the Investor Relations heading.\nLeading our quarterly earnings discussion today are Linn Evans, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rich Kinzley, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nAlthough we believe that our expectations and beliefs are based on reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ materially.\nI'll begin on Slide 4, which lists our key achievements during the first quarter.\nOur top priority of Black Hills Corporation is safety, which works hand-in-hand with reliability in our predominantly cold weather service territories.\nI'm proud of our team's exceptional and resilient performance.\nThe Black Hills team along with our electric and natural gas systems and our generating fleet performed very well through the historic decrees of the Winter Storm Uri.\nWe successfully served extraordinary demand, keeping our customers safe through life threatening cold conditions across our service territory.\nOur balanced mix of power generation resources, including reliable and dispatchable generation capacity allowed us to completely avoid rolling blackouts experienced in other areas of the country, even while our South Dakota electric utility served a new winter peak load.\nOf course, our success in serving our customers during Winter Storm Uri didn't happen by chance, rather it was a result of our relentless focus on our customers and ongoing investments for our safe, reliable and resilient infrastructure.\nWinter Storm Uri demonstrated how critical energy is to our daily lives.\nThe storm highlighted the need for safe, reliable natural gas utilities and reliable generation capacity when our customers experienced temperatures as low as 27 degrees below zero, setting numerous all-time record lows across our communities.\nAs an example, Lincoln, Nebraska reported 11 straight days of temperatures below zero in February with lows of the minus 20s.\nRecognizing essential value of natural gas during these weather events, we're pleased that four of our six gas states: Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and Wyoming, recently passed legislation that protects our customers freedom to choose a type of energy is right for them.\nLast week we announced, we joined the ONE Future Coalition of gas utility companies who are voluntarily reducing emissions.\nThis is an addition to our previously announced participation in the EPA's Methane Challenge as we enhance our commitment to modernize and make our pipelines more resilient.\nContinuing on Slide 4.\nWe remain encouraged by the ongoing steady growth in new customer connections driven by population migration into our service territories.\nOur team also showcased our agility and the strength of our financing strategy during the first quarter.\nGiven the unprecedented and unforeseeable market pricing for natural gas in February, we immediately supplemented our liquidity with additional short-term financing by securing an $800 million term loan on favorable terms.\nThis term loan and other ongoing cash conservation initiatives ensures our ability to continue funding our strong capital investment program.\nSlide 5 sets out our financial outlook.\nHowever, absent these storm cost, our financial results were otherwise strong.\nDuring the February storm, we immediately implemented expense and cash management initiatives and we're executing on other opportunities to mitigate the impact of the storm.\nRich will cover the details in his financial update.\nGiven these ongoing initiatives and the opportunities we see for the remainder of this year, our 2021 earnings guidance remains unchanged.\nWe also reaffirmed our 2022 earnings guidance and we remain confident in our long-term growth targets, including 5% to 7% earnings growth for 2023 through 2025 and at least 5% annual dividend growth.\nSlide 6 illustrates our disciplined growth plan with upside potential.\nWe plan on capital investments in more than $3 billion through 2025 and we expect to identify and develop incremental projects.\nWe're also developing other growth opportunities including less capital intensive projects such as data center load additions and other innovative customer solutions, including renewables and other technologies.\nI noted already that we're seeing accelerated population migration into our service territories and we're gaining confidence this trend will continue.\nThe last item on this slide is a focus on cost discipline and continuous improvement.\nThese are long-term initiatives for leaner more efficient processes and the use of new technologies to be better every day.\nMoving to Slide 7.\nWe've made progress on our regulatory initiatives.\nOur team is finalizing three rate review applications to be filed in the second quarter.\nWe plan to file a new rate review for Colorado Gas, and we recently completed a hearing before the commission regarding our ongoing safety and integrity investment rider.\nIn Kansas, we're filing our first rate review in seven years, which renews our five year system safety and integrity investment rider.\nAnd in Iowa, we plan to file our first rate review in more than a decade, including a request for a new system safety and integrity investment rider.\nIn addition to our normal regulatory activity, we're engaged with regulators regarding recovery for costs associated with Storm Uri.\nMoving to Slide 8.\nFor our electric utilities, resource planning is a key focus, as we determine how best to reliably and cost effectively serve growing customer demand and achieve our greenhouse gas emission goals.\nWe're targeting early July to submit our integrated resource plan for our jointly operated South Dakota and Wyoming electric systems.\nWe're modeling various scenarios to meet our growing customer demand.\nInitial modeling which is always subject to change, indicates a need to add renewable, dispatchable natural gas generation, battery storage, additional transmission and upgraded pipeline capacity.\nThese scenarios consider customer impacts in achieving our greenhouse gas emission goals.\nWe are also modeling a scenario that considers the Biden Administration's economywide greenhouse gas emission goals and what that would cost customers.\nI'm excited about this process as we look to provide greater clarity into these future opportunities in the upcoming months.\nAnd finally on Slide 9, we're well positioned as an integrated utility with a strong long-term growth outlook.\nWe're executing our customer-focused strategy and are confident in our future.\nSlide 11 summarizes earnings per share for the first quarter.\nWe delivered earnings per share of $1.54 compared to $1.59 as adjusted in Q1 2020.\nImpacts from Winter Storm Uri overshadowed what were otherwise solid financial results.\nThe net storm impacts were $0.15 per share, which more than offset weather favorability and the benefit of new rates.\nWe estimate weather benefited earnings by $0.07 per share compared to normal.\nFor the quarter, heating degree days were 4% higher than normal at our electric utilities and 3% higher than normal at our gas utilities, attributable primarily to extreme cold in February, offsetting warmer than normal weather in January and March.\nCompared to Q1 2020, the weather impact was favorable by $0.11 per share, given a warmer than normal first quarter heating season last year.\nSlide 12 details how we are addressing Winter Storm Uri impacts.\nIn the first quarter, we incurred approximately $571 million of incremental cost to serve our customers.\nThis includes $559 million of deferred utility fuel costs we booked as a regulatory asset.\nWe've had constructive dialog with regulators in a filed or expect to file our remaining storm-related regulatory recovery requests in the second quarter.\nWe've already filed requests for our gas utilities in Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska and Wyoming and for South Dakota Electric.\nRecovery plans vary by state with proposed recovery in some states within one year while other states may take up to five years or longer.\nIn the first quarter, we booked storm-related net expenses of $12.55 million pre-tax or $0.15 per share after tax.\nThe largest contributor was $8.2 million of non-recoverable incremental gas purchase costs at Black Hills Energy Services, which serves 52,000 of our regulated utility customers in Nebraska and Wyoming through the Choice Gas program.\nThis program allows customers the option to choose their gas provider and is supported by a hedging and procurement plan based on demand history and forecasts.\nServing our Choice Gas customers is a small, low risk and profitable piece of our business.\nHowever, it was subjected to the unprecedented market pricing and elevated demand caused by storm Uri.\nFor our electric businesses, the impact to our wholesale power margin sharing of $3.2 million was partially offset by $1.7 million of power generation benefits.\nWe also incurred $2.1 million of fuel costs that are outside of our regulatory cost recovery mechanisms, primarily in Montana, where we serve two industrial customers pursuant to contracts.\nThis small piece of our utilities is typically very low risk but was subjected to the same unprecedented market pricing and elevated demand.\nIn February, we immediately implemented strategies to mitigate the $0.15 earnings per share impact from Uri over the remainder of the year through cost management, ongoing wholesale power marketing opportunities and identified regulatory proceedings.\nSlide 13 illustrates the drivers of change in net income year-over-year for the first quarter.\nAll amounts listed are after-tax.\nThe main drivers compared to last year were gross margin improvements at our gas utilities offset by Storm Uri impacts.\nNatural gas margin increases were driven by weather favorability and new base rates and rider recovery on investments for customers.\nElectric utility margins were lower than the prior year, primarily due to tax reform benefits that we passed on to our Colorado Electric customers.\nWe credited over $9 million of tax reform benefits, which lowered revenue and had an offsetting income tax benefit, resulting in minimal overall impact to first quarter results.\nThe additional quarter-over-quarter tax benefits in the far right were related primarily to additional production tax credits related to the Corriedale Wind Project that went into service in late 2020.\nO&M was impacted by higher employee costs and outside services.\nOutside services increased over the prior year because of higher Director fees tied to our stock price performance, which was much stronger in Q1 this year compared to last year.\nThe change in other income expense over the prior year was driven by market impacts on a non-qualified deferred compensation expense.\nAdditional first quarter detail on segment earnings can be found in the Appendix.\nSlide 14 shows our financial position through the lens of capital structure, credit ratings and financial flexibility.\nWe have a manageable debt maturity profile and are committed to maintaining our solid investment grade credit ratings.\nAt the end of April, we had approximately $530 million of available liquidity on our revolving credit facility.\nIn February, we entered into an $800 million, nine-month term loan to bolster our liquidity in light of the increased fuel costs related to Storm Uri.\nWe repaid $200 million of that term loan at quarter-end and are developing the appropriate refinancing strategy for the remaining $600 million as we finalized Storm Uri recovery mechanisms.\nI expect we will issue debt with a three to five year term in the second or third quarter to match the recovery period of the bulk of the dollars from the deferred Storm Uri fuel cost.\nNew debt and deferred recovery of fuel cost temporarily increased our debt to total capitalization ratio to 62% at the end of March.\nAs we recover storm costs, repay debt and execute on our equity program, we expect to reduce the debt to total capitalization ratio and continue to target a debt to total cap ratio in the mid 50s.\nOur equity issuance expectations are unchanged.\nWe expect to issue $100 million to $120 million in 2021 and $60 million to $80 million in 2022 through our at-the-market equity offering program.\nWe will continue to evaluate financing needs as we finalize our storm cost recovery proposals.\nMoving to our dividend on Slide 15.\nIn 2020, we proudly marked 50 consecutive years of annual dividend increases, one of the longest track records in our industry.\nSince 2016 we have increased our dividend at an average annual rate of 6.6%.\nLooking forward, we anticipate increasing our dividend by more than 5% annually through 2025 while maintaining our 50% to 60% payout target.\nWe are uniquely positioned as an integrated utility in constructive jurisdictions with a complementary business mix across stable and growing territories.\nWe continue to be well positioned both operationally and financially to be ready to serve all our stakeholders.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.\nParticipants in today's call include our President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Strah; Vice Chairperson and Executive Director, John Somerhalder and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Taylor.\nWe also have several other executives available to join us for the Q&A session.\nOperating earnings were $0.59 per share, which is above the top end of our earnings guidance.\nThese strong operational results reflect a customer-focused investment strategy in our regulated distribution and transmission businesses, solid financial discipline and the continued shift in higher weather-adjusted demand from our residential customers.\nWe're pleased with our performance as well as the substantial progress we've made to transform FirstEnergy and position our company for the future.\nWe have taken critical steps to build a best-in-class compliance program while identifying and driving initiatives to deliver long-term value to all stakeholders.\nOur leadership team is committed to modeling the behaviors and the humility necessary to restore trust with our stakeholders.\nWe look forward to continuing this work and achieving the milestones that will mark our progress.\nI'll start our call today with an update on the DOJ and other investigations related to House Bill 6 and John Somerhalder will join us for a brief discussion on board activity and the progress of our compliance program.\nYesterday, we announced that we've entered into an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Ohio to resolve the DOJ investigation into FirstEnergy.\nThis deferred prosecution agreement was filed in federal court.\nUnder the three-year deferred prosecution agreement, we agreed to pay $230 million, which will be funded with cash on hand.\nHalf of these funds is designated for the U.S. Treasury and the other half is being directed to the benefit of utility customers by the Ohio Development Service Agency.\nNo portion of the filing will be recovered from customers.\nWe also agreed to the government's single charge of honest services wire fraud, which will be eventually dismissed, provided we abide by all the terms of the agreement.\nIn accordance with the agreement, we will provide regular reports to the government regarding our compliance program, as well as internal controls and policies and continued efforts to build on the comprehensive compliance initiatives we've rolled out this year.\nThe conduct that took place at our company was wrong and unacceptable.\nOur Board, the management team and the entire FirstEnergy organization have done extensive work and are committed to make the necessary changes to move on from this.\nOur progress on these efforts, along with the DPA, demonstrate that we are making meaningful headway in navigating through this period and we are positioned to move forward as a stronger integrity bound organization.\nWe will continue to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigations, audits and related matters as we work to resolve these issues and rebuild trust with our employees, customers, regulators and investors.\nWe are intently focused on fostering a strong culture of compliance and ethics and assuring that we have robust processes in place designed to ensure that nothing like this happens again.\nIn May, we held our first compliance town hall with employees to discuss what compliance, ethics and integrity mean at FirstEnergy and the importance of building a culture of trust where everyone is comfortable with speaking up when something doesn't feel right.\nIn the weeks following the town hall, our management team has responded to employee questions and concerns and we are committed to continuing this conversation and engagement.\nNext week, we plan to hold another town hall meeting with employees where we will introduce our updated mission statement, reinforcing the role of uncompromising integrity as the cornerstone of FirstEnergy's identity and business strategies.\nWe will also refresh our core values to better reflect the importance of integrity together with safety, diversity, equity and inclusion, performance excellence and stewardship.\nThese values will be embedded in our practices and processes and become ingrained in the way we work.\nAdditionally, we updated our code of business conduct, which John Somerhalder will speak to in a moment.\nWe also continue to strengthen our leadership team with two more new hires, Michael Montaque joined us earlier this month as Vice President, Internal Audit and yesterday we announced that Soubhagya Parija has been named Vice President and Chief Risk Officer effective August 16.\nThese two experienced professionals represent another important step as we strengthen our key internal functions and I'm confident that they will help us develop best-in-class audit and enterprise risk programs.\nNow, John Somerhalder will join us to provide an update on board matters and other facets of our compliance program.\nThen I'll be back to discuss FE Forward and review some regulatory updates.\nOur progress with the DOJ builds on the substantial steps we have taken to enhance our Board, strengthened our leadership team, ensured we have a best-in-class compliance program and significantly modify our approach to political engagement as we work to regain the trust of our stakeholders.\nI'll start with a review of recent Board changes.\nAs you know, Jesse Lynn and Andrew Teno joined the Board from Icahn Capital in March, but they do not currently have voting rights pending regulatory approval.\nI'm pleased to note that FERC approved our request for voting rights last week.\nThe process in Maryland continues as we have communicated FERC's recent action to the Commission.\nMelvin Williams was elected to the Board at our Annual Meeting in May and last month we added two more independent directors, Lisa Winston Hicks and Paul Kaleta.\nJesse, Melvin, Lisa and Paul comprise our Special Litigation Committee.\nThis committee has full and binding authority to determine the company's action with respect to the pending shareholder derivative litigation.\nI'll also note that with the formation of the Special Litigation Committee, the Board has dissolved Independent Review Committee.\nAs previously discussed, the company's internal investigation has now been transitioned from a proactive to a response mode and in light of the significant review, investigation and related actions accomplished by the independent review committee, the Board has also dissolved that committee.\nBut many proactive actions taken by the Board and management over the past year have improved our governance and put us in a strong position to remediate the material weakness associated with our tone at the top by the time we file our four quarter results.\nOver the last several quarters, we've talked a lot about the work we're doing to elevate our ethics and compliance program and reinforce our values and expectations with all employees.\nWe continue to make timely progress in this area and our new, more centralized compliance organization is taking shape under Antonio Fernandez, who joined the company in April as our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer.\nYesterday, we published our updated internal Code of Business Conduct, The Power of Integrity, which will be supported by ongoing education around behaviors and the importance of reporting ethical violations and we have continued to strengthen our policies, processes and internal controls including those around 501(c)(4)s, other corporate engagement and advocacy and business disbursements.\nWhile the transformation of our culture and our steps to restore trust with all stakeholders will be long-term endeavors, this team has started building a stronger company built around a foundation of ethics, honesty and accountability.\nThe comprehensive assessment and recalibration of our ethics and compliance program has been running on a parallel path to FE Forward.\nOur transformational effort to enhance value for all stakeholders by investing in modern and distinctive experiences that will improve the way we do business, we have improved our programmatic efforts to mature our ethics and compliance program into the FE Forward work.\nIn this way, we can leverage FE Forward's rigor to implement changes quickly and efficiently, embed ethics and compliance into our operational culture and ensure we sustain a comprehensive transformation well into the future.\nFE forward has entered its third phase, which is a full-scale effort to execute our implementation plans.\nThe program is expected to deliver value and resilience including cumulative free cash flow improvements of approximately $800 million from 2021 through 2023 and an annual run rate capex efficiencies of about $300 million in 2024 and beyond.\nAt the same time, we expect the program to build on our strong operations and business fundamentals as we reinvest a portion of our efficiencies into strategic opportunities to better serve our customers and support a smarter and cleaner electric grid.\nTo ensure our organizational structure supports these improvement over the long term, we realigned our business units last month around five pillars: Finance and Strategy, Human Resources and Corporate Services, Legal, Operations and Customer Experience.\nThis new structure reflects a best-in-class model and supports operational excellence, clarity in decision making and accountability and less complexity.\nAs part of this new organizational structure, we've created a customer experience function that will truly understand our customers' evolving expectations, so we can develop solutions and drive benefits to customers.\nWe've also created a new position, Vice President transformation to shepherd the FE Forward initiatives across our company, while also developing customer focused emerging technology opportunities.\nThe development of executable plans, a best-in-class compliance program and critical organizational changes will position the company to move forward in a positive sustainable direction.\nI'll just take a moment now and review recent regulatory matters starting in Ohio.\nFirst, in July, the PUCO approved our filing to return approximately $27 million to our Ohio utility customers, representing all revenues that were previously collected through the decoupling mechanism plus interest.\nOur Ohio utilities have filed supplemental testimony in the quadrennial review of our ESP IV.\nWe are committed to working with a broad range of parties in Ohio to resolve the range of issues that are still pending here.\nWe held our first full-scale collaborative meeting on March 31 and have since received further feedback from participants.\nWe are preparing for another collaborative meeting in the next few weeks.\nWe are also working through regulatory audits in Ohio, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the FERC.\nFinally, in April, the New Jersey BPU approved JCP&L's three year $203 million energy efficiency and conservation plan, which includes a return on certain costs, as well as the ability to recover lost distribution revenues.\nAs per our financial results, we're pleased with our strong performance in the first half of the year.\nWe are reaffirming our 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share and we expect to be at the top half of that range.\nWe are also introducing third quarter guidance of $0.70 to $0.80 per share.\nWe remain focused on executing our plans, maintaining our costs and building on this positive momentum.\nWe are making substantial progress to transform FirstEnergy live up to our values and deliver long-term value to all of our stakeholders.\nYesterday, we announced GAAP earnings of $0.11 per share for the second quarter of 2021 and operating earnings of $0.59 per share.\nAs Steve mentioned, this exceeded the top end of our guidance range.\nSpecial items in the second quarter of 2021 include investigation and other related costs, which include the impact from the deferred prosecution agreement, as well as regulatory charges and state tax legislative changes.\nIn our distribution business, 2021 second quarter results as compared to 2020 reflect growth from our capital investment programs, rate increases and lower expenses, primarily related to the absence of pandemic related expenses we incurred in the second quarter of last year, partially offset by the absence of Ohio decoupling and lost distribution revenues in the second quarter of 2020, which we stopped collecting earlier this year.\nTotal distribution deliveries increased on both an actual and weather-adjusted basis compared to the second quarter of 2020 when many of the pandemic related restrictions were in full effect.\nHowever, the mix of customer usage resulted in a flat year-over-year earnings impact.\nSecond quarter 2021 weather-adjusted residential sales were 6% lower than the same period last year when many of our customers were under strict stay at home orders.\nHowever, as we look at trends, weather-adjusted residential usage over the past few quarters has been on average about 4% higher than pre-pandemic levels and in fact, the second quarter of this year was close to 8% higher than weather-adjusted usage we saw in the second quarter of 2019.\nWe think more permanent work from home initiatives could impact our longer-term load forecast and we will be watching closely to see if the structural shift in our residential customer class continues.\nWeather-adjusted deliveries to commercial customers increased 8% and industrial load increased 11% as compared to the second quarter of 2020.\nDespite the increase in commercial activity this spring, weather-adjusted demand in this customer class continues to lag pre-pandemic levels by an average of about 6%.\nLooking at the industrial class, we are encouraged by the steady recovery in demand over the past year.\nIn fact, this quarter, industrial load was only slightly down compared to the second quarter of 2019.\nWe continue to see higher load from the shale gas industry, but that was offset by lower load in other industrial sectors such as steel, auto and mining, which have not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels.\nIn our Regulated Transmission segment, higher net financing costs in the second quarter of 2021, primarily related to our revolving credit facility borrowings were more than offset by the impact of higher transmission investment at MAIT and ATSI related to our Energizing the Future program.\nOur transmission investments drove year-over-year rate base growth of 7%.\nAnd in our Corporate segment results reflect the absence of discrete tax benefits recognized in the second quarter of 2020, as well as higher interest expense.\nFor the first half of 2021, operating earnings were $1.28 per share compared to $1.23 per share in the first half of 2020.\nThis increase was the result of continued investments in our transmission and distribution systems, weather-related sales and lower expenses and consistent with our second quarter results, the positive drivers for the first half of this year more than offset the absence of $0.13 of decoupling and lost distribution revenues that were recognized in the first half of 2020 that are no longer in place this year.\nAdditionally, our continued focus on financial discipline together with strong financial results helped drive a $196 million increase in adjusted cash from operations versus our internal plan and a $264 million increase above the first six months of last year, building on the improvements we noted on our first quarter earnings call.\nAs per capital markets activity, we continue making good progress on this year's debt financing plan with five of our six debt transactions complete, all with pricing similar to investment grade companies.\nIn May, we issued a $150 million in senior notes at Toledo Edison and MAIT with pricing at 2.65% and 2.55% respectively.\nAnd in June, we issued $500 million in senior notes at JCP&L that priced at 2.75%.\nIn addition, we made progress on our commitment to reduce short-term debt during the second quarter by repaying $950 million under our revolving credit facilities bringing our borrowings down to $500 million as of June 30.\nAnd earlier this week, we repaid the remaining $500 million under these facilities.\nWhile we did obtain a waiver for our credit facilities related to the DPA, this repayment was voluntary and not required by the bank group.\nWe plan to operate on a normal course going forward and we utilize the revolving credit facilities on an as needed basis as we have done historically.\nAs you know, we have two revolving credit facilities, one for FE Corp, which is shared with our utility companies and one for FET both expiring in December of 2022.\nOver the next few months, we plan to work with our bank group to evaluate and refinance these bank facilities with the goal of completing this initiative before the end of the year.\nAnd finally, we continue to consider alternatives to our equity needs.\nWe continue to think through options that include a minority sale of distribution and/or transmission assets, which would raise substantial proceeds and eliminate all of our expected non-SIP equity needs, ensure the execution of our balance sheet improvement plans and provide funding for strategic capex in customer-focused emerging technologies that support the transition to a cleaner electric grid.\nBased on our current timeframe, we expect to provide you with an update in the fourth quarter.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These beliefs are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties.\nMany of which may be beyond our control, including those detailed in our periodic SEC filings.\nPlease note that the company's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements.\nThere will be an opportunity for Q&A at the end of the call.\nI'm proud of our performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nOur team delivered sales growth of 17%, expanded our operating profit margin by 160 basis points, and increased diluted earnings per share by 57%, despite global supply chain challenges and unpredictable market conditions.\nOur performance demonstrates that by prioritizing customers, we are driving sales growth and turning that into operating income, while continuing to invest in the long-term growth and transformation of the company.\nI want to start today's call by taking a deep dive on the current market conditions.\nAs you are aware, this is a dynamic market with a fair share of paradoxes.\nDemand across our end markets remain strong.\nAt the same time, the availability and cost of key inputs remain challenging.\nIn short, it's the best of times and the most challenging of times.\nBusiness is strong both in ABL and in spaces.\nWithin ABL, demand is strong across all of our channels to market, except retail, which we expect to improve this calendar year.\nIn this dynamic pricing environment, we have been prudent and successful passing on price increases, while at the same time, providing as much consistency as we can to our customers so that they can plan and execute their projects effectively.\nAt the same time, input costs and availability remain unpredictable, and we expect this to continue.\nObviously, everyone is dealing with this.\nOur strategy for managing through this has been consistent: prioritize satisfying customer demand and ensuring the health and well-being of our associates.\nSo now let me spend a minute on what we mean by satisfying our customer demand.\nFirst, we have chosen to honor pricing on all of our placed orders.\nAs I've said before, it is important to me that we are known in the industry for doing what we say.\nThere is a gap in time between when we receive orders and when we fulfill them in normal times, and that is even greater now.\nTherefore, we believe that this position will serve us well in the long term with specific customers and with the industry.\nFrom there, we are also doing everything that we can to fulfill these orders as quickly as we can.\nWhile we don't disclose backlog, what I will say is that it is meaningfully higher than during normal periods.\nThis is the result of higher demand, coupled with changing component availability and the general supply chain and transportation challenges.\nAgain, these are not unique to Acuity.\nTo combat these, we have prioritized three key activities.\nFirst, we have focused and invested in our strategic relationships with manufacturers and suppliers to procure as much of the available component supply as possible.\nWe benefit from being the largest and most consistent in the industry.\nSecond, we have empowered our teams to source components in the spot market, and we have prioritized speed and access over cost.\nThis allows us to maintain higher levels of production at the expense of some higher cost.\nThird, our product, engineering and manufacturing teams have been continuously redesigning and reengineering existing products based on what components are available.\nTo give you an idea of the magnitude of that effort, our Distech engineers spent over half their time in the last quarter dedicated to this type of redesign.\nOur ABL team made the same commitment in addition to changes and improvements in our manufacturing processes to ensure consistent production.\nThese efforts also extend beyond our company into our broader ecosystem.\nWe have been working with suppliers to help them find necessary components and make engineering changes in the products that they supply to us.\nThe overall effort has been herculean, and our teams continue to remain flexible and to adapt to an ever changing environment.\nThe changes that we have implemented over the last two years have enhanced our ability to see across our business, work across our stakeholders and improve our service levels.\nSo where are we on our transformation?\nOne of the points that I stress to our team is that transformation is a process, not a destination.\nIn challenging times, sometimes, the first reaction is to revert to what you know.\nIn our case, we are using these times to redouble our transformation efforts.\nLet me start with the ABL business.\nTrevor and his team are focused on maintaining high product vitality, continuing to elevate industry service levels and continuing to use technology to differentiate us.\nDuring the first quarter, we launched several interesting products to drive our portfolio expansion, products like the STACK PACK and STACK Switch products.\nThese are the next generation of center-element LED lay-in lights for commercial indoor spaces.\nThe STACK has a lower profile and more efficient packaging that saves on transportation costs.\nIt also has an adjustable lumen output that can be reconfigured at any time through the STACK Switch.\nThis means that there is no time wasted on a job site if there need to be changes to the configuration.\nIn controls, we introduced the CLAIRITY link.\nThis is part of our nLight lighting controls platform that offers remote connectivity capability.\nThe remote capabilities reduce the need for in-person visits, offering quick troubleshooting resolutions and a reduction in maintenance cost.\nThis product fundamentally changes the way we service projects and is an important step forward for our customers.\nNow moving to the Intelligent Spaces Group.\nThe mission of ISG is to use technology to solve problems in spaces in order to make them smarter, safer, and greener.\nWe do this in two ways.\nWe collect data through hardware, for example, the Distech controller; and then analyze and take action on the data through software applications powered by Atrius.\nOur ISG group had an eventful quarter.\nAs I mentioned, even though the engineering team at Distech spend over half their time focused on redesigning Distech products for the available components.\nWe continued to roll out several important products and product enhancements.\nThe Distech ECLYPSE APEX was introduced in the first quarter and is the most advanced version of our controller for HVAC and building automation.\nThe APEX introduced artificial intelligence to the edge and increases compute capacity in buildings, which helps customers manage energy usage more effectively.\nWe also further expanded the availability of our Atrius Building Insights service by enabling it for additional languages and local privacy requirements.\nAtrius Building Insights is now available in the U.K., Ireland, France, Germany, Spain, and Norway.\nWe are currently and expect to continue to be operating in unpredictable times.\nInput prices and availability can sometimes feel like a game of whack-a-mole, and we are dealing with omicron, which materialized only a few months ago.\nAs we face these challenges and new challenges we will maintain our focus on satisfying customer demand in ensuring the health and well-being of our associates.\nI remain optimistic about 2022 and our ability to effectively manage in this environment.\nWe have a great team who are executing today while also remaining focused on the long-term growth and transformation of the company.\nAnd then I'll be back for the Q&A and for some closing remarks.\nI continue to be impressed by our team's dedication to our transformational priorities while we continue to navigate the day-to-day performance of the business.\nWe delivered a strong first quarter performance.\nNet sales were $926 million, an increase of 17% compared to the prior year.\nThis performance was driven by our improved service levels, a continued recovery in the end markets of both of our business segments, and the benefits of recent price increases.\nGross profit was $386 million, an increase of $53 million or 16% over the prior year.\nThis improvement was driven by revenue growth and by offsetting the significant increase in material and freight costs through price increases and product and productivity improvements.\nGross profit as a percentage of sales was 41.7%, a decrease of 30 basis points from 42% in the prior year, a significant achievement given the cost environment.\nReported operating profit margin was 12.4% of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, an increase of 160 basis points over the prior year.\nAdjusted operating profit margin was 14.4% of net sales, an increase of 120 basis points over the prior year.\nThe majority of this was the result of improved operating leverage as we continued to balance cost management and growth investments.\nThe effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was 19.6%.\nIn the same period of 2021, the rate was 24.7%.\nThe decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to favorable discrete items recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 related to excess tax benefits on share-based payments.\nWe expect our tax rate for the full year of 2022 to normalize to around 23% absent these discrete items.\nFinally, we saw a significant improvement in diluted earnings per share for the quarter of fiscal -- for the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nDiluted earnings per share of $2.46 increased $0.89 or 57% over the prior year.\nAnd adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.85 increased $0.82 or 40% over the prior year.\nOur share repurchase program favorably impacted adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.07 and the tax impact was approximately $0.16.\nMoving on to our segments.\nDuring the quarter, our Lighting and Lighting Control segment saw sales increase 17% to $884 million versus the prior year.\nThis was driven by improvements within our independent sales network, which grew 14%, and the direct sales network, which grew about 12%.\nThese increases were a direct result of our strong go-to-market efforts and an improved demand environment as well as the favorable impact of price increases.\nOur corporate accounts channel saw an increase in sales of approximately 62% compared to the prior year, as large accounts began previously deferred maintenance and renovations.\nThe performance in this channel is dependent upon our customers' renovation cycles and can be uneven quarter to quarter.\nSales in the retail channel declined approximately 16% in the current quarter.\nABL operating profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 30% to $128 million versus the prior year, with operating margin improving 160 basis points to 12.4%.\nAdjusted operating profit of $138 million improved 28% versus the prior year, with adjusted operating margin improving 140 basis points to 15.6%.\nNow moving on to the results for our Intelligent Spaces Group.\nFor the first quarter of 2022, sales in spaces increased approximately 14% to $46 million versus the prior year, reflecting continued demand primarily across our building and HVAC controls.\nSpaces' operating profit in the first quarter of 2022 increased approximately $2 million to $2 million versus the prior year.\nAdjusted operating profit of $6 million increased approximately $2 million versus the prior year as a result of the strong sales growth.\nNow turning to cash flow.\nWe continue to generate solid cash flows.\nThe net cash from operating activities for the first three months of fiscal 2022 was $84 million.\nThis was a decrease of $40 million or 32% compared to the prior year and reflects an increased investment in inventory to drive growth.\nAdditionally, cash flow was impacted by the timing of income tax payments and the prior-year deferral of withholding taxes as a result of the CARES Act.\nWe invested $9 million or 1% of net sales in capital expenditures during the first three months of fiscal 2022.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to execute on our capital allocation strategy and repurchased approximately 300,000 shares of common stock for around $53 million at an average price of $176 per share.\nWe have approximately 3.5 million shares remaining under our current board authorization.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain the same.\nWe will continue to prioritize investments for growth in our current businesses, to invest in acquisitions, to maintain our dividend, and to allocate capital to share repurchases when there is an opportunity to create permanent value for our shareholders.\nI would now like to spend a few minutes addressing current topics of note.\nFirst, on the pricing environment.\nAs Neil said, we are managing price aggressively while at the same time balancing the relationships with our customers.\nWe announced another price increase this week effective for orders placed in February.\nWe will continue to be deliberate in our strategic approach to pricing.\nNext, I would like to update you on the OSRAM integration.\nWe have made significant progress in our integration of OSRAM.\nWe bought the OSRAM North American DS business to ensure control over the technology, to expand our OEM channel and for the benefit it brings through the integration into our supply chain.\nThe addition of OSRAM contributed over 300 basis points to our sales growth in this quarter.\nThere was also a relatively small dilutive impact to gross profit margin, but OSRAM was an overall positive contribution to operating profit.\nThe acquisition is delivering on our expectations and we are very excited that the OSRAM team is now part of Acuity.\nWe have included EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA in our tables of reconciliation to enable easier comparisons and to improve the consistency around reported adjustments.\nAs we continue to navigate 2022, we will continue to prioritize our customers to drive sales growth and operating income.\nWe will also continue to allocate capital in a way that drives long-term growth and that creates permanent value for our shareholders.\nSummary: ",

provided slides that summarize many of the points we will discuss during the call.\nThese slides can also be found on our Investor Relations website.\nLet me start by saying how delighted I am that Ana is joining the team as our Chief Financial Officer.\nAna held several executive positions at GE Capital; most recently been President and CEO of GE Capital's Global Legacy Solutions and prior to that, the Chief Operating Officer and CFO of that business.\nAna brings with her strong financial and operational experience and will fit into the PB culture very well.\nNo one could have predicted how the world changed in 2020, but I'm very proud of how our team was prepared and managed through the challenges.\nTheir efforts and hard work show in the progress we made in our business throughout the year.\nIf I had to choose one word to sum up our employees in 2020, it will be determined.\nThat is exactly what our team personifies.\nThe fourth quarter was a remarkable ending to an extraordinary year.\nRevenue at constant currency grew 23%.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the highest modern-day organic growth rate on record for Pitney Bowes.\nAnd our shipping-related revenues comprised 54% of our total revenue.\nFor the quarter, Global Ecommerce grew 60%, with profit improving from prior year and prior quarters, resulting in positive EBITDA.\nPresort turned in flat revenue performance, which is a significant improvement from prior quarters and better than the market.\nAnd SendTech turned in strong performance, growing both revenue and profit over prior year.\nThis was powered by strong equipment sales, double-digit growth in our SaaS-based shipping offerings and a solid performance in our services business.\nSendTech is a business that many considered a melting ice cube.\nHowever, the investments we have made in our digital channel and products, while also expanding our shipping offerings, have given new life to this business.\nIn all, these accomplishments would have been hard to imagine a few short years ago.\nBut this is what a determined and focused team can do.\nLooking at the year from a broader lens, when the pandemic hit, we had two objectives.\nFirst, we needed to focus on the health and well-being of our employees and ensuring the company remains strong financially during this unpredictable time.\nSecondly, we wanted to come out of this terrible moment a stronger company.\nIt is often true that moments of economic dislocation create opportunities, and our team was determined to leverage the investments we have made over the last several years to capture those opportunities.\nWe pivoted to change our work protocols and practices.\nWe provided our employees the necessary PPE to be safe, as they did their essential work.\nWe also took the important actions to fortify our balance sheet by refinancing our debt, and we made prudent decisions to ensure we had a solid liquidity position.\nIt was apparent early on that the company's financial position was solid and we turned to coming out of this pandemic stronger, which we are well on our way of achieving.\nFrom an annual perspective, Global Ecommerce turned in $1.6 billion in revenue, growing at a record rate of just over 40%.\nThis business won new customers and achieved scale much earlier than we had planned.\nSimultaneously, we accelerated our planned network build out by several years.\nThis certainly wasn't always smooth sailing, but the business is in a much better place than it was 12 months ago.\nWhile e-commerce's astonishing growth understandably gets a lot of attention, the transformation of our SendTech business tells an equally remarkable story.\nImportantly, the business performed well relative to the mail market.\nBut even more enduring, business has moved to a natural adjacency in shipping.\nThis is a new large growth area, which, along with the ongoing transformation of our financial services business and a meaningful contribution from our Global Services group, leverages our core strengths.\nEpitomizing the transformation of SendTech is the growth of shipping revenue, which is now a meaningful offset to our decline in mail business.\nAlso notable, U.S. shipments of our low-end and middle-market devices grew 13% for the year.\nThese multipurpose devices provide new value to clients as compared to our previous generation single-purpose mailing machines.\nI'm also particularly pleased with our cash performance in the fourth quarter in the year.\nThe increase in our cash is a result of disciplined execution and a great team effort.\nIt's a fairly remarkable accomplishment to meaningfully increase operating cash flow in the middle of a pandemic and one of the most significant economic associations since the depression.\nAll that being said, transformations are always messy and never a straight line, and transformations in the middle of a pandemic are particularly complicated.\nThe unprecedented increase in demand in the e-commerce market created cost inflation, particularly in labor and transportation costs in the fourth quarter, which had a deleterious impact on our profit in e-commerce.\nThis quarter tested capacity throughout [Technical Issues].\nAdmittedly, it was a challenge.\nIn order to optimize our service, we more than doubled our labor and set up three new facilities to help meet the demand.\nWhile these facilities, along with the newer flagship sites we opened late last year, works through typical growing pain, they have also become a critical part of our overall network, handling over one-quarter of our total domestic parcels in 2020.\nIn addition, our use and reliance of third-party transportation this peak, both in cost and service, was challenged, which was in line with the broader industry trends.\nTo mitigate this, we proactively upgraded packages at a cost to try to maintain service.\nGoing forward, we see opportunity to balance our use of third-party transportation and our own PB fleet assets, which performed above expectations this peak.\nWe will continue to invest to become more efficient across each of these areas.\nAs I've said in the past, it's now within our four walls to manage the cost structure and generate efficiencies.\nI'm often asked about the anatomy of transformations and I think it's worth repeating.\nTransformations have a certain arc to them; quick wins, sustained investments, revenue growth and then profitable revenue growth.\nThe most highly correlated factors for successful transformations are revenue growth and employee engagement.\nWe have achieved revenue growth the last several years, and our employee engagement in the middle of pandemic reached new highs.\nWhile there continues to be tremendous uncertainty in our economy and how the pandemic will play out, we are poised to enter the last stage of successful transformations, profitable revenue growth.\nI am proud of what the team has accomplished.\nBut we all recognize there is more work to do.\nI'm excited about this next chapter of our transformation.\nWe are on the precipice of accomplishing what very few companies have ever done.\nLet me start by providing an overview of our full-year results, followed by the details of our fourth quarter.\nFor the full year, revenue was $3.6 billion, which was growth of 11% over prior year and is our fourth consecutive year of constant currency revenue growth.\nGlobal Ecommerce grew 41%, Presort Services declined less than 2% and SendTech declined 7%.\nAdjusted earnings per share was $0.30 and GAAP earnings per share was a loss of $1.06.\nAs a reminder, GAAP earnings per share includes a non-cash goodwill impairment charge that we recorded in the first quarter.\nGAAP cash from operations was $298 million and free cash flow was $279 million.\nFree cash flow increased $91 million over prior year.\nThrough the year, there were a few noteworthy items that principally benefited free cash flow.\nFirst, our focus on collections resulted in a strong improvement in our DSO.\nWe also saw a higher level of Presort and PB Bank customer deposits, in part due to initiatives to support our clients.\nSecond, finance receivables declined at a greater rate, largely in the second quarter as a result of the lower placements of our SendTech equipment due to the pandemic.\nYou can see the trend starting to improve as our SendTech business built momentum through the second half of 2020 as businesses began to reopen.\nEarly on when the pandemic surfaced, we made the prudent decision to reprioritize investments and reduce spending, given the level of uncertainty in the market at that time.\nThere were other puts and takes through the year as we typically experience, but these areas are the key drivers to understanding the strong free cash flow we generated for the year.\nLooking at our balance sheet and capital allocation, we ended the year with $940 million in cash and short-term investments.\nFor the year, we used free cash flow to return $34 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends.\nOur capital expenditures totaled $105 million and reflect investments made throughout the year in new and existing facilities, our technology and our products.\nAs part of our ongoing transformation, we also made $20 million in restructuring payments.\nWithin our Pitney Bowes Bank, customer deposits grew to $617 million and Wheeler Financial funded $16 million in new deals for the year.\nFrom a debt perspective, we ended the year with $102.6 billion in total debt, which is a reduction of $175 million from prior year.\nIn terms of our net debt, when you take our cash and short-term investments and finance receivables into consideration, our implied net debt position on an operating company basis was about $550 million at year-end.\nTurning to the details of the fourth quarter.\nWe delivered $1 billion in revenue, which represents growth of 23%.\nGlobal Ecommerce grew 60%, and both Presort and SendTech were flat to prior year.\nFor the quarter, adjusted earnings per share was $0.13 and GAAP earnings per share was $0.11.\nEPS for the quarter reflects a $0.03 tax benefit, primarily related to deferred tax balances in certain international tax jurisdictions.\nGAAP cash from operations was $111 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $97 million.\nFree cash flow grew $16 million over prior year, predominantly driven by the timing of working capital.\nDuring the quarter, we used free cash flow to reduce debt $31 million, invest $24 million in capital expenditures and pay $9 million in dividends.\nTurning to the P&L, starting with revenue performance as compared to prior year.\nBusiness services grew 43% and equipment sales grew 15%.\nWe had declines in support services of 4% and rentals of 8%, while financing and supplies both declined approximately 10%.\nGross profit was $311 million and gross margin was 30%.\nThis is a decline of about nine points from prior year, which largely reflects the shifting mix of our portfolio and higher cost of service, driven by the influx of parcel demand in Global Ecommerce.\nSG&A was $242 million or just under 24% of revenue, which is a six-point improvement from prior year.\nWithin SG&A, unallocated corporate expenses were $54 million, which were $2.5 million higher than prior year.\nIt is important to note that full-year unallocated corporate expenses were $200 million, which were $11 million lower than prior year, primarily due to lower employee-related expenses.\nR&D expense was $9.5 million or about 1% of revenue, which was about half-point improvement from prior year.\nEBIT was $62 million and EBIT margin was 6%.\nCompared to prior year, EBIT declined $3 million and EBIT margin declined about 2%, largely driven by the lower gross profit.\nInterest expense, including financing interest expense, was $38 million, which was relatively flat to prior year.\nThe provision for taxes on adjusted earnings was less than $1 million and our tax rate for the quarter was 1%, bringing our annual tax rate to 13%.\nAverage diluted weighted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter were about $177 million.\nLet me now discuss the performance of each of our business segments this quarter.\nWithin Global Ecommerce, revenue was $518 million, which was growth of 60% over prior year and the first time we achieved over $500 million in quarterly revenue.\nCompared to prior year, volumes grew by 50% or more across each of our lines of business.\nDomestic parcel volumes grew 76% to just under 65 million parcels.\nDigital volumes grew 50%, and cross-border volumes grew 76%.\nLooking at EBIT, we recorded a loss of $15 million.\nThis was an improvement of $3 million from prior year and $5 million from prior quarter.\nEBIT margin also improved three points from prior year and two points from prior quarter.\nEBITDA was $3 million, which was an improvement from prior year and prior quarters.\nRevenue growth over prior year benefited from the significant demand.\nThis was offset by higher cost, driven partly by the market dynamics, which we are seeing a significant higher transportation spot market and higher labor costs.\nThe increase in peak demand also put pressure on our productivity.\nWe will continue to invest across our network to drive efficiencies, reduce costs and improve service for our clients, which will come in part from automation across our network.\nWe are addressing our labor structure, shifting more from temporary labor to permanent, which will yield a more productive workforce.\nWe are also looking at our transportation network and opportunities where it makes sense for us to become less reliant on the spot market, along with becoming more efficient at capturing deeper postal discounts.\nAdditionally, similar to the market, we will capture a surcharge in 2021, along with our annual general rate increase.\nWithin Presort Services, revenue was $135 million, which is flat to prior year.\nOverall average daily volumes declined 2%.\nFirst Class Mail volumes declined 3%, while Marketing Mail volumes grew 2%.\nMarketing Mail Flats and Bound Printed Matter volumes grew 26%.\nAs we have discussed in the past, this is still a relatively small part of the portfolio, but representing new revenue and profit stream for us.\nEBIT was $13 million and EBIT margin was 10%.\nEBITDA was $21 million and EBITDA margin was 16%.\nEBIT and EBITDA margins were relatively in line with prior quarters and declined from prior year, largely due to higher medical claims and increased labor costs as well as COVID-related direct costs for the health and safety of our facility workers.\nTurning to our SendTech segment.\nRevenue was $376 million, which was flat to prior year, excluding the impact of currency, and represents growth of 1% on a reported basis.\nMarc talked about the investments we have made in our SendTech business around our digital capabilities, including our channel and products.\nWe are bringing new value to our clients through our multi-purpose devices and we are leveraging our digital channel to attract new clients to our offerings.\nIn the fourth quarter, SendTech's shipping-related revenues grew nearly 30% to $35 million and our SaaS-based SendPro online offering grew its paid subscriptions by over 70%.\nShipping is a high-margin stream that contributes about 10% to SendTech's overall revenue today, with great opportunity for future growth still in front of us.\nThe impact of shipping is also resonating in our financing portfolio, as those clients through their shipping volumes by 65% over prior year.\nEquipment sales grew 15% over prior year, driven by strong placements of our SendPro C and MailStation multipurpose products.\nOur value proposition continues to resonate with our clients.\nOur SendPro MailStation is a replacement option for lower-volume mailers and ideal for remote setups or branch offices of larger organizations.\nSince launching in April, we have shipped approximately 20,000 MailStation units.\nThe growth in equipment sales is a significant improvement from prior quarters, particularly against the decline of 32% we saw in the second quarter, at the height of the COVID lock-downs.\nSupplies declined 10%, which is an improvement from prior quarters on increased usage and demand.\nIn the U.S., 70% of our supplies transactions were conducted online in the fourth quarter, which is up nine points from the same period last year.\nSupport services declined 4%, which is also an improvement from recent quarters.\nWhen combined, rentals and financing revenues declined 9% in the quarter.\nWe turned in strong EBIT performance of $118 million, which represents growth of $5 million over prior year.\nEBIT margin was 31%, which improved one point over prior year and is within the range projected in our long-term model.\nEBITDA was $126 million and EBITDA margin was 34%, both improving over prior year.\nThe quality of our financing portfolio remains healthy, and delinquency rates are trending down from the initial small uptick that we saw earlier in the year as a result of the pandemic.\nWe continually monitor our delinquency rates and take a very disciplined approach to managing our credit risk.\nLet me close with an update on 2021.\nGiven the ongoing uncertainty in the market around the pandemic and uncertain macroeconomic conditions, we will speak more broadly to our 2021 outlook.\nWe expect annual revenue to grow over prior year in the low-to-mid single digit range, making 2021 the fifth consecutive year of constant currency growth.\nWe also expect adjusted earnings per share to grow over prior year.\nWithin our segments, we expect Global Ecommerce revenue to grow in the low double-digit range and we also expect this business to demonstrate significant profit improvement.\nWe expect the momentum we saw in the second half of 2020 for SendTech, particularly around our shipping capabilities and new multipurpose devices, to continue through 2021 and help partially offset the decline in recurring related revenues.\nWe also expect the improvement in volume trends we saw in Presort in the second half of 2020 to continue through 2021.\nThere are also a few headwinds to be aware of on a year-to-year basis that will partly offset the overall business unit improvements.\nIn 2020, we recorded RIV insurance proceeds.\nIn 2021, we expect higher employee-related cost as it relates to variable compensation.\nAdditionally, we expect our annual tax rate on adjusted earnings to be in the 23% to 27% range, which is higher than where we ended 2020.\nWe expect lower free cash flow in 2021, primarily due to the specific items I discussed earlier in my comments that benefited 2020 and are not expected to continue at the same level in 2021.\nLooking at the timing through the year.\nOur portfolio continues to shift to markets that are growing, particularly around shipping.\nAs a result, the fourth quarter will continue to be our largest quarter for the year.\nSpecifically in the first quarter, we expect revenue to grow over prior year in the high single-digit to low double-digit range and earnings per share to be relatively in line with prior year.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:In addition, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including core funds from operations or core FFO, adjusted funds from operations or AFFO, and net debt to recurring EBITDA.\nI'm very pleased to report that we continued our strong start to the year, achieving record investment volume of more than $750 million during the first six months of 2021.\nRobust and high quality investment activity further increased our investment grade, concentration and raised our ground lease exposure to a record of nearly 13%.\nOur investment activities during the quarter were supported by more than $1 billion of strategic capital markets transactions that fortified our best-in-class balance sheet and positioned our company for continued growth in the quarters ahead.\nDuring the second quarter, we invested approximately $366 million in 59 high-quality retail net lease properties across our three external growth platforms.\n54 of these properties were originated through our acquisition platform representing acquisition volume of more than $345 million.\nThe 54 properties acquired during the second quarter are leased to 32 tenants operating in 18 distinct retail sectors including best-in-class operators in the off-price, home improvement, auto parts, general merchandise, dollar store, convenience store, craft and novelties, grocery and tire and auto service sectors.\nThe acquired properties had a weighted average cap rate of 6.2% and a weighted average lease term of 11.8 years.\nThrough the first six months of this year, we've invested a record $756 million into 146 retail net lease properties spanning 35 states in 24 retail sectors.\nApproximately $732 million of our investment activity originated from our acquisition platform.\nRoughly 75% of the annualized base rents acquired in the first half of the year comes from leading investment grade retailers, while almost one-third of annualized base rent is derived from ground leased assets.\nThese metrics demonstrate our continued focus on best in class opportunities with leading omnichannel retailers, while still achieving record results.\nGiven our record acquisition activity date and visibility into our pipeline, we are increasing our full-year 2021 acquisition guidance to $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion.\nDuring this past quarter, we executed on several unique and notable transactions, including a new small format target on the University of Georgia's campus in Athens.\nWe are extremely pleased to expand our relationship with target, as well as add another unique street retail asset to our growing portfolio.\nWe continue to invest in market dominant grocers during the quarter.\nMost significant with a five-store sale leaseback transaction with Kroger for approximately $68 million.\nThe stores are located in Texas, Michigan, Ohio, and Mississippi and each location is subject to a new 15 year net lease.\nWith this transaction Kroger moved into our top 10 tenants at 3.2% of annualized base rents.\nKroger's of course is a leader in the grocery space.\nTheir fortified balance sheet, strategic omnichannel initiatives, and significant investment in e-commerce fulfillment are emblematic of our investment strategy.\nAdditionally, we closed on the purchase of a ShopRite, which is owned and operated by Wakefern in New Rochelle, New York.\nShopRite is a tremendous operator in the real estate located at a strategic interchange of I-95 is yet another example of the diligent bottoms for analysis that we conduct on every asset that we acquired.\nFinally, as you may recall we acquired our first Wegmans Ground Lease in Chapel Hill, North Carolina during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nWe've built upon that momentum in this quarter with the acquisition of our second property ground leased to Wegmans.\nThe store located in Parsippany, New Jersey is over 100,000 square feet and was constructed at Wegmans expense.\nThrough the first six months of the year we've acquired 45 ground leases for a total investment of over $240 million.\nThe second quarter contribution to this total was 14 ground leases representing an investment volume of more than $113 million.\nAdditional notable ground lease acquisitions during the quarter included our first capital grow in Whippany, New Jersey.\nA Walmart Supercenter and Lowe's and Hooks at New Hampshire, our first Cabela's in Albuquerque, New Mexico, as well as three additional Wawa assets increasing our Wawa portfolio to 25 properties including their flagship store in Downtown Philadelphia.\nAs mentioned at quarter end, our overall ground lease exposure stood at a company record of 12.7% of annualized base rents and includes a very unique assets leased to the best retailers in the country.\nInclusive of our second quarter acquisition activity, the ground lease portfolio now derives nearly 90% of rents from investment grade tenants and has a weighted average lease term of 12.5 years.\nThe majority of the portfolio includes rent escalators that result in average annual growth of close to 1% while the average per square foot rent is only $9 and $0.65.\nThis growing portfolio continues to be a source of tremendous risk adjusted returns when reviewing the lease term, credit, underlying real estate attributes and of course the free building and improvements of a tenant wherever to vacate.\nWe look forward to continue to leverage our industry relationships and strong track record of execution to identify potential additions to this expanding and diversified sub portfolio.\nAs of June 30, our portfolio's total investment grade exposure was nearly 68%, representing a significant year-over-year increase of approximately 670 basis points.\nOn a two-year stacked basis, our investment grade exposure has improved by more than 1,300 basis points.\nThe continued growth of our ground lease portfolio and the investment grade exposure demonstrates our disciplined focus on building the highest quality retail portfolio in the country.\nMoving on to our Development and Partner Capital Solutions platforms, we continue to uncover compelling opportunities with our retail partners.\nWe had six development in PCS projects either completed or under construction during the first half of the year that represent total capital committed of more than $36 million.\nThree projects were completed during the second quarter, including a grocery outlet in Port Angeles, Washington, a Gerber Collision in Buford, Georgia, and a Floor & Decor in Naples, Florida.\nI'm pleased to announce we also commenced construction during the quarter of our second development with Gerber Collision in Pooler, Georgia.\nGerber will be subjected to a new 15 year net lease upon completion and we anticipate rent will commence in the first quarter of 2022.\nWe continue to work with Gerber Collision on additional opportunities that we anticipate announcing later this year and into next year.\nConstruction continued during the quarter on our first development with 7-Eleven in Saginaw, Michigan.\nWe anticipate delivery will take place in the first quarter of next year at which time 7-Eleven will be subject to a new 15 year net lease.\nWe remain focused on leveraging our full capabilities to grow our relationships with these leading omnichannel retailers.\nI look forward to providing an update on our continued progress in the coming quarters.\nWhile we continue to strengthen our best-in-class retail portfolio through record investment activity we're also quite active on the disposition front during the quarter.\nWe continue to reducing Walgreens exposure and as well as franchise restaurants as we sold seven properties for gross proceeds of approximately $28 million with a weighted average cap rate of 6.7%.\nIn total, we disposed of 10 properties through the first six months of the year for gross proceeds of more than $36 million with a weighted average cap rate of approximately 6.7%.\nGiven our disposition activities during the first half of the year, we are raising the bottom end of our disposition guidance to $50 million for the year, while the high-end remains at approximately $75 million.\nOur asset management team has also been proactively and diligently addressing upcoming lease maturities.\nTheir efforts to reduce the remaining 2021 maturity to just three leases representing 20 basis points of annualized base rents.\nDuring the second quarter, we executed new leases, extensions or options on approximately 209,000 square feet of gross leasable area.\nMost notably, we are extremely pleased to have executed a new 15 year net lease with Gardner White to backfill our only former Loves Furniture store in Canton, Michigan.\nAs you may recall, this was the Art Van flagship we developed prior to the company's acquisition by TH Lee.\nWe delivered the space to Gardner White in June and rent commenced in July, allowing us to recover close to 100% of prior rents with just over one month of downtime.\nI would note this is the second time we have released this asset on effectively full recovery since the Art Van bankruptcy.\nGardner White is Michigan-based family owned and operated, has been one of the preeminent furniture retailers in the state for more than a century.\nThe Company is led by Rachel Tronstein, one of the brightest minds in the retail furniture industry and a former high school classmate of mine.\nWe are extremely pleased to have Rachel and her team as partners in this flagship asset.\nI'm also pleased to announce the addition of Burlington to Central Michigan Commons in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, one of the only two remaining legacy shopping centers that we chose to retain during the transformation of our portfolio.\nTo date we have redeveloped the former Kmart Space for Hobby Lobby and Alta and added Texas Roadhouse on an outline via ground lease.\nThese transactions are emblematic of our ability to unlock embedded value within the portfolio and support our decision to hold on to this very well located legacy shopping center across from Central Michigan University's main campus.\nDuring the first six months of the year we executed new leases, extensions or options and approximately 275,000 square feet of gross leasable area and as of June 30, our expanding retail portfolio consisted of 1,262 properties across 46 states, including 134 ground leases and remains nearly 100% occupied at 99.5%.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Simon and then we can open it up for any questions.\nStarting with earnings core funds from operations for the second quarter was $0.89 per share, representing a record 17.3% year-over-year increase.\nAdjusted funds from operations per share for the quarter was $0.88, an increase of 15.9% year-over-year.\nAs a reminder, treasury stock is included within our diluted share count prior to settlement if and when ADCs stock trades above the deal price of our outstanding forward equity offerings.\nThe aggregate dilutive impact related to these offerings was less than half a penny in the second quarter.\nPer FactSet, current analyst estimates for full year AFFO per share range from $3.40 per share to $3.53 per share, which implies year-over-year growth of 6% to 10%.\nAs mentioned on last quarter's call, we continue to view this level of growth as achievable and expect to end the year toward the higher end of this range given current visibility into our investment pipeline and the broader operating environment.\nBuilding upon our 6% of AFFO per share growth in 2020-this implies two year stack growth in the mid-teens.\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $6.2 million in the second quarter.\nG&A expense was 7.6% of total revenue or 7.1% excluding the noncash amortization of above and below-market lease intangibles.\nEven as we continue to invest in people and systems to facilitate our growing business, we anticipate the G&A as a percentage of total revenue will be in the lower 7% area for full year 2021 excluding the impact of lease intangible amortization on total revenues.\nAs mentioned last quarter, G&A expense for our acquisitions team fluctuates based on acquisition volume for the year and our current anticipation for G&A expense reflects acquisition volume within our new guidance range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion.\nTotal income tax expense for the second quarter was approximately $485,000 for 2021.\nWe continue to anticipate total income tax expense to be approximately $2.5 million.\nMoving onto our capital markets activities for the quarter, in May we completed a $650 million dual tranche public bond offering, comprised of $350 million of 2% senior unsecured notes due in 2028 and $300 million of 2.6% senior unsecured notes due in 2033.\nIn connection with the offering, we terminated related swap agreements of $300 million that hedged for 2033 Notes receiving approximately $17 million upon termination.\nConsidering the effect of the terminated swap agreements, the blended all-in rates for the 2028 Notes and 2033 Notes are 2.11% and 2.13% respectively.\nWe used the portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay all $240 million of our unsecured term loans, the termination costs related to early pay down of our unsecured term loans total approximately $15 million.\nGiven the one-time nature of the termination costs, these amounts have been added back to our core FFO and AFFO measures.\nThe offering in combination with the prepayment of all of our unsecured term loans extended our weighted average debt maturity to approximately nine years and reduced our effective weighted average interest rate to approximately 3.2%.\nIn June, we also completed a follow-on public offering of 4.6 million shares of common stock.\nUpon closing, we received net proceeds of approximately $327 million.\nDuring the second quarter, we entered into forward sale agreements in connection with our ATM program to sell an aggregate of roughly 1.2 million shares of common stock for anticipated net proceeds of approximately $81 million.\nIn May, we settled roughly 164,000 shares and received net proceeds of approximately $10 million.\nAt quarter-end we had approximately 3.9 million shares remaining to be settled under existing forward sale agreements which are anticipated to raise net proceeds of approximately $259 million upon settlement.\nInclusive of the anticipated net proceeds from our outstanding forward offerings cash on hand and availability under our credit facility, we had nearly $950 million in available liquidity at quarter-end.\nThe balance sheet continues to be a huge strength for us.\nAs of June 30, our pro forma net debt to recurring EBITDA was approximately 3.6 times, including our outstanding forward equity offerings.\nExcluding the impact of unsettled forward equity, our net debt to recurring EBITDA was approximately 4.5 times.\nTotal debt to enterprise value of quarter-end was approximately 25% while fixed charge coverage remained at a record five times.\nDuring the second quarter, we declared monthly cash dividends of $0.217 per share for April, May and June.\nThe monthly dividend reflected an annualized dividend amount of $2.60 per share representing an 8.5% increase over the annualized dividend amount of $2.40 cents per share for the second quarter of last year.\nOur payout ratios for the second quarter were a conservative 73% of Core FFO per share and 74% of AFFO per share respectively.\nSubsequent to quarter-end, we declared a monthly cash dividend of $0.217 per share for July.\nThe monthly dividend reflects an annualized dividend amount of $2.60 per share or an 8.5% increase over the annualized dividend amount of $2.40 per share from the third quarter of 2020.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Following our remarks, we will open the call for analyst questions.\nPlease limit yourself to one question with one follow up.\nWe describe these risks and uncertainties in our risk factors and other disclosures in our Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nOur statements will also include non-GAAP financial metrics.\nI hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.\nWe performed exceptionally well in the second quarter, and demand for our products was strong.\nThis resulted in our fourth consecutive quarter of double digit sales growth and sixth consecutive quarter of both margin expansion and double digit earnings-per-share growth.\nI'm extremely proud of our entire team as we successfully navigated numerous supply chain challenges to enable this growth.\nFor the quarter, sales increased 24%.\nExcluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency, sales increased 18%.\nOperating profit increased 27% and margins expanded 60 basis points to 20.1%, principally due to strong volume leverage.\nEarnings per share increased an outstanding 34%.\nOur overall performance demonstrates the strength of our portfolio of lower ticket, repair and remodel products that are diversified across geographies and channels, serving both the consumer and the professional.\nTurning to our plumbing segment, sales increased 48%, excluding currency, led by exceptional growth from our North American and international faucet and shower businesses and our spa business.\nInternational plumbing grew 50% in the quarter, excluding currency, as Hansgrohe sales rebounded sharply in nearly all of its markets.\nStrong operational execution and new products such as Hansgrohe's Rainfinity shower systems led to share gains in many of these markets.\nNew product introductions will continue as we launched the award-winning AXOR One collection in the second half of the year.\nThis collection was designed by Barber Osgerby, an award-winning internationally acclaimed London-based industrial design studio.\nThis continues Hansgrohe's legacy of combining leading contemporary design with innovative functionality.\nNorth American plumbing posted strong growth of 47%, excluding currency, in the second quarter, led by approximately 75% growth at Watkins Wellness and robust double digit growth at Delta.\nDelta faucet delivered another record quarter with growth across all channels, and particularly strength in the professionally oriented trade channel.\nWe continue to invest in new products in North American plumbing as well.\nAnd two days ago, we introduced a Frank Lloyd Wright collection by Brizo that furthers the brand's commitment to distinctive design and innovative products.\nLastly, in plumbing, at the beginning of July, we acquired Steamist, another bolt-on acquisition for Delta.\nSteamist is a leading manufacturer of residential steam bath products that will complement our strong trade and e-commerce product offering and is consistent with our bolt-on acquisition strategy.\nIn our decorative architectural segment, sales declined 5% against the healthy 8% comp for the second quarter of 2020.\nWhile bath and cabinet hardware, lighting and propane grew in the quarter, demand moderated for DIY paint.\nMaterial availability and other supply chain issues also impacted our overall coatings business, as nearly all of our resin suppliers were operating under a force majeure declaration during the second quarter.\nBecause of these issues, sell-through on our coatings products was better than sell-in and inventories in the channel were reduced during the quarter.\nDue to lower than expected second quarter sales and our expectation that material availability issues will persist but slowly improve, we are lowering our DIY sales expectation from flat to down low-single digits for the full year.\nHowever, with the acceleration we saw in our propane business in the quarter, we are incrementally more optimistic and are raising our expectations to low-double digit growth from high-single digit for the full year for our propane business.\nFor the decorative segment overall, we now expect growth to be in the range of 2% to 5% for the full year.\nWith respect to innovation in the decorative segment, we continue to invest in new products and are excited to launch a new high end line of paint in the third quarter at the Home Depot called Behr Dynasty for both DIY and pro painters.\nDynasty is our most durable, stain-resistant, scuff resistant, one-coat hide paint ever.\nIt's low VOC, Greenguard and LEED certified, fast drying and has an anti-microbial mildew-resistant paint finish.\nThis is yet another example of how our innovation teams continue to focus on the voice of the customer to deliver leading innovation and value for both the consumer and the professional.\nMoving on to capital allocation.\nWe continued our aggressive share buyback during the quarter by repurchasing 6.6 million shares for $447 million.\nAs part of the accelerated share repurchase agreement that we executed during the quarter, we will additionally receive approximately 900,000 shares in July to complete that agreement, bringing our total shares repurchased year-to-date to 13.1 million shares for $750 million.\nThis is approximately 5% of our outstanding share account at the beginning of the year.\nUnderscoring our strong financial position and confidence in the future, we now anticipate deploying another $250 million in the second half of the year for share repurchases and acquisitions for a full year total of approximately $1 billion.\nFinally, like I did last quarter, let me give you an update on what we are experiencing with inflation and supply chain tightness.\nWe continue to see escalating inflation across most of our cost basket, including freight, resins, TiO2 and packaging.\nInbound freight container costs nearly tripled during the quarter.\nWe now expect our all-in cost inflation to be in the high-single digit range for the full year for both our plumbing and decorative segments, with low-double digit inflation in the second half of the year.\nInflation in coatings will likely be in the mid-teens later in the fourth quarter.\nTo mitigate this inflation, we have secured price increases across both segments, and are taking further pricing action across our business to address these continued cost escalations.\nWe're also working with our suppliers, customers and internal teams to implement further productivity measures to help offset these costs.\nDespite the increased inflation, we still expect to achieve price/cost neutrality by year-end.\nWhile cost inflation has clearly been an issue, material availability has also impacted our business.\nOur teams have done a tremendous job of qualifying new suppliers, developing material substitutions, and shifting production to adapt to this dynamic environment and to serve our customers.\nHowever, these raw material constraints have limited our ability to build inventory of many of our products and the channels that we serve.\nWe anticipate material availability to slowly improve in the second half of the year, and we expect to replenish inventory to the appropriate levels over time.\nThe demand for our products remains strong.\nAnd with an improved outlook for plumbing based on the continued strength of both our North American and international operations, we are increasing our full year expectations of earnings per share to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.75 per share, up from our previous expectations of $3.50 to $3.70.\nAs Dave mentioned, my comments today will focus on adjusted performance, excluding the impact of rationalization and other one-time items.\nTurning to Slide 7.\nWe delivered another exceptional quarter as we capitalized on strong consumer demand, resulting in continued growth and increased backlogs.\nAs a result, sales increased 24% with currency and net acquisitions, each contributing 3% to growth.\nIn local currency, North American sales increased 15% or 12%, excluding acquisitions.\nStrong volume growth in North American faucets, showers and spas led this outstanding performance.\nIn local currency, international sales increased a robust 50% or 49%, excluding acquisitions and divestitures.\nGross margin was 36.3% in the quarter, up 50 basis points as we leverage the strong volume growth.\nOur SG&A as a percentage of sales improved 10 basis points to 16.2% due to our operating leverage.\nDuring the quarter, certain expenses such as headcount, marketing, and travel and entertainment increased as planned.\nWe expect SG&A as a percent of sales to increase in the third and fourth quarters, as these costs normalize.\nWe delivered strong second quarter operating profit of $438 million, up $94 million or 27% from last year, with operating margins expanding 60 basis points to 20.1%.\nOur earnings per share was $1.14 in the quarter, a 34% increase compared to the second quarter of 2020, due to volume leverage, lower interest expense and lower share count.\nTurning to Slide 8.\nPlumbing growth accelerated in the quarter with sales up 53%.\nCurrency contributed 5% to this growth and acquisitions, net of divestitures, contributed another 4%.\nNorth American sales increased 47% in local currency or 41%, excluding acquisitions.\nDelta led this outstanding performance, delivering another quarter of robust double digit growth.\nWith a strong brand recognition and market leadership, Delta continues to drive strong consumer demand across all its product categories and channels.\nWatkins Wellness also significantly contributed to growth in the quarter with both demand and our backlog remained strong.\nInternational plumbing sales increased 50% in local currency or 49%, excluding acquisitions and divestitures.\nHansgrohe delivered robust growth as demand continues to improve across Europe and numerous other countries.\nHansgrohe's key markets of Germany, China, UK and France, all grew strong double digits in the quarter.\nSegment operating margins expanded 230 basis points to 20.6% in the quarter, with operating profit of $274 million, up $115 million or 72%.\nThe strong performance was driven by incremental volume, favorable mix and cost productivity initiatives, partially offset by an unfavorable price/cost relationship and higher spend on items such as travel and entertainment, marketing and growth initiatives.\nDuring the quarter, we also completed the divestiture of HUPPE, a small shower enclosure business based in Germany.\nHUPPE sales were approximately EUR70 million in 2020.\nThis transaction closed on May 31, and net proceeds were not material.\nGiven our second quarter results and current demand trends, we now expect plumbing segment's sales growth for 2021 to be in the 22% to 24% range, up from our previous guidance of 15% to 18%.\nFinally, due to our improved sales outlook, we are increasing our full year margin expectations to approximately 18.5%, up from our previous guide of approximately 18%.\nTurning to Slide 9.\nDecorative architectural declined 5% for the second quarter and was 6%, excluding the benefit from acquisitions.\nDIY paint business declined double digits in the quarter against the healthy high-teens comp due to moderating demand and raw material supply tightness as resin plants affected by storms in the Texas Gulf Coast region in the first quarter continued to face production challenges.\nWe expect these raw material headwinds to persist in the third quarter and now anticipate our DIY paint business to be down low-single digits for the full year.\nTo help mitigate these challenges, we are working with our existing suppliers and qualifying new sources for materials to meet the demand of our customers which remains strong.\nOur PRO paint business delivered strong double digits growth in the quarter, as consumers are increasingly willing to allow professional paint contractors in their homes.\nWe expect demand in this channel to remain strong and now anticipate low-double digit growth for the PRO paint business for the full year, up from our previous expectation of high-single digits as PRO paint contractors' order books continue to grow.\nOur builders' hardware and lighting businesses each delivered growth in the quarter, as they continue to capitalize on increased consumer demand.\nSegment operating margins were 22.1% and operating profit in the quarter was $188 million due to lower volume, partially offset by cost productivity initiatives.\nFor full year 2021, we now expect decorative architectural segment's sales growth will be in the range of 2% to 5%, down from 4% to 9% due to lower than expected second quarter sales and persistent raw material constraints.\nWe continue to expect segment operating margins of approximately 19% as productivity initiatives in pricing help offset higher input costs.\nTurning to Side 10.\nOur balance sheet is strong with net debt to EBITDA at 1.3x.\nWe ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of balance sheet liquidity, which includes full availability of our $1 billion revolver.\nWorking capital as a percent of sales, including our recent acquisitions, was 16.9%, an improvement of 120 basis points over prior year.\nAs we discussed last quarter, we terminated and annuitized our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans in the second quarter and had an approximate $100 million final cash contribution to the plans to complete this activity.\nThis removes approximately $140 million of pension liabilities from our balance sheet, and it will benefit our free cash flow by approximately $50 million through reduced cash contributions, starting in 2022.\nAlso, we received approximately $166 million from the redemption of our preferred stock related to the recent sale of our former cabinet business.\nFinally, as Keith mentioned earlier, as of today, we repurchased 13.1 million shares in 2021 for $750 million.\nWe expect to deploy an additional $250 million for share repurchases or acquisitions for the remainder of this year.\nCollectively, these actions demonstrate our confidence in our business and our commitment and ability to further strengthen our balance sheet, while aggressively returning capital to our shareholders.\nTurning to our full year guidance, we have summarized our updated expectations for 2021 on Slide 11.\nBased on our second quarter performance and continued robust demand, we now anticipate overall sales growth of 14% to 16%, up from 10% to 14% with operating margins of approximately 17.5%, up from 17%.\nLastly, as Keith mentioned earlier, our updated 2021 earnings per share estimate range of $3.65 to $3.75 represents 19% earnings per share growth at the midpoint of the range.\nThis assumes the 252 million average diluted share count for the full year.\nAdditional modeling assumptions for 2021 can be found on Slide 14 in earnings deck.\nWe had an outstanding second quarter driven by our strong brands, our innovation pipelines and most of all, our people, as demonstrated by outstanding execution by our supply chain teams.\nOur strong performance demonstrates the strength of Masco's balanced and diversified business.\nMasco is a broad portfolio of lower ticket, repair and remodel-oriented home improvement products.\nOur products are broadly distributed across geographies and channels for both consumers and professionals.\nAdditionally, our markets remain strong, and we expect home remodeling expenditures to drive growth in 2022.\nThe fundamentals of our repair and remodel business are strong, with year-over-year home price appreciation of over 15% in May and existing home sales up over 23%.\nBoth metrics have a strong correlation with our sales on a lag basis.\nAnd the consumer is strong, with nearly $2 trillion in savings and an increased desire to invest in their homes.\nLastly, we continue to invest in our business and are well positioned for long-term growth.\nWe are bringing new, innovative products to market, fueling our growth and expanding our leading market share.\nAnd with our leading margins and strong free cash flow, we will continue to deploy capital to reinvesting in our business, acquiring complementary bolt-on companies and returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases all to drive long-term shareholder value.\nWith that, I'll now open up the call to questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Overall, the third quarter reflected a continuation of our strategy of investing in our North American assets to further reposition the company with lower cost, sustainable free cash flow and solid returns over longer mine lives.\nAs you can see, it was a quarter with several significant developments and decisions.\nResults were in line with our internal forecast and we're set up to deliver a strong finish to the year and achieve our original production guidance.\nMick will go through the operations in more detail shortly, but I'll quickly touch on a few main points.\nWharf led the pack and achieved its second highest operating cash flow and free cash flow since we acquired the operations 6.5 years ago.\nPalmarejo and Kensington were largely on plan and are on track to deliver strong fourth quarters and Rochester's results reflect steady progress despite devoting 38.5 days, or about 45% of the quarter, to crushing and hauling over-liner material to the new Stage VI leach pad before winter.\nIt's worth pointing out that Rochester's year-to-date results reflect 2.5 months of essentially no stacking on the legacy Stage IV pad as they prioritize activities to support the POA 11 expansion.\nOn the exploration front, results continue to validate our ongoing commitment to these higher levels of investment.\nWe invested $20 million in exploration during the quarter alone.\nThis commitment to drilling has led to double-digit reserve and resource growth over the past few years and we look forward to hopefully delivering further growth again at the end of this year.\nWe anticipate investing $70 million in exploration in 2021, which is nearly 40% higher than the record we set last year and is one of the largest programs in our sector.\nWe remain on track to achieve our full year drill footage targets, yet investing slightly less than originally anticipated, which reflects efficiencies we are realizing from these larger programs.\nWe will plan to provide another exploration update before the end of the year that will focus on exciting new results at our assets in Nevada, both at Rochester and from the Crown district in Southern Nevada where there continues to be a lot of activity.\nSwitching over to our expansion projects, I want to walk through some updates starting with the Rochester POA 11 expansion.\nThis project remains our top priority and is a transformative well-funded source of production and cash flow growth for the company.\nThings are moving right along.\nOverall progress stood at 42% complete at the end of the third quarter.\nIn addition to completing the crushing of over-liner for the new Stage VI leach pad, the team also kicked off foundation work for the Merrill Crowe plant and the crusher corridor during the quarter.\nAs we mentioned on our last conference call, we're experiencing the impact of inflation on remaining unawarded work, like most companies are reporting.\nOverall, we're fortunate to have had the vast majority of our contracts locked in prior to the current spike in costs and supply and labor disruptions.\nWe're trying to mitigate some of these impacts by rescoping and rebidding unawarded contracts, but we currently estimate that we're likely to see a 10% to 15% overall increase to the POA 11 construction costs.\nWe have kicked off detailed engineering and we'll be evaluating the merits of implementing this process improvement over the coming months.\nAssuming we elect to pursue this opportunity, it could potentially extend the timetable for completion and commissioning of the crusher by three to six months.\nIn the meantime, we plan to install pre-screens on the existing crusher during the first half of next year to give us some full scale run time and experience that we can potentially incorporate into the new crusher configuration.\nNow switching over to Silvertip.\nGiven the current inflationary environment and pandemic-driven supply and labor disruptions, it's not an ideal time to be kicking off a new capital project on an accelerated timetable despite multi-year high zinc and lead prices.\nFortunately, Silvertip expansion and restart is still in the early innings, which gives us a lot of flexibility.\nDespite the uncertain macro-environment, which contributed to higher-than-expected capital estimates for an accelerated expansion in restart, one thing we are certain of is the quality and prospectivity of the Silvertip deposit.\nThe exploration results, along with the knowledge and new discoveries the team is generating, have led us in the direction of evaluating a larger Silvertip expansion and restart on a potentially slower timetable.\nTo take advantage of such a high-grade and significant resource, a 1,750 ton per day processing facility isn't likely large enough to maximize Silvertip's value.\nWe're going to take some additional time to evaluate what a larger design and footprint could represent in terms of economics and overall flexibility.\nThis approach will give us time to continue drilling and hopefully keep growing the resource, allow for the dust to settle on many of these current macroeconomic factors and allow us to focus on delivering POA 11 while not straining the balance sheet.\nFinishing out the highlights.\nWe're pleased to announce that we entered into an agreement with Avino Silver & Gold to sell them the La Preciosa project in Durango, Mexico.\nThis transaction offers some real potential synergies to unlock value from that asset with their nearby Avino mine.\nStrategically, the transaction checks a lot of boxes for us with respect to further enhancing our geopolitical risk profile, our metals mix and the timing of our development pipeline.\nWe can deploy some of the fixed cash consideration into the Rochester expansion and into our highly prospective exploration programs.\nThe transaction provides a lot of upside to the asset through the equity ownership we will have, along with contingent payments and two royalties we will retain.\nShifting gears, I want to quickly bring your attention to a set of slides starting on Slide 17 that highlight the great culture and diversity efforts we have at Coeur.\nTo be a high performing organization, a company's culture, strategy and capabilities need to be aligned, something that I believe we've achieved over the past few years.\nTo that end, I want to recognize our Head of Human Resources, Emilie Schouten, for her efforts on DE&I and for recently winning the industry's Rising Star Award from S&P Global Platts.\nWe continue to integrate our ESG efforts into our strategy and overall decision making.\nBefore having Mick provide an overview of our operations, I'd like Hans to follow-up on my Silvertip comment by providing a brief overview of the Silvertip exploration results and why we are so positive about its potential.\nWe bought Silvertip in late 2017 with the recognition that the asset has excellent growth potential.\nWe now have almost 3.5 kilometer of potential growth defined based on step-out drill holes or more than triple what we knew in 2017, as highlighted on Slide 8.\nThis year, we are completing the largest exploration program in the history of the project.\nImpressively, Silvertip accounts for roughly 25% of our $70 million overall budget at Coeur.\nThe site team led by Ross Easterbrook has done an outstanding job managing the 1,000-meter drill program.\nDrilling from underground has given us the ability to conduct exploration year-round and test different parts of the ore body from different angles, which has been a crucial part of the Silvertip growth story.\nUnderground drilling in early 2021 has led to the discovery of the Southern Silver Zone vertical feeder structures and thick manto ore zones and, more recently, vertical feeder structures under the Discovery South Zone.\nThese structures represent significant resource tonnage potential and demonstrate excellent upside.\nWe now have two rigs active underground with plans to add a third rig early next year.\nWe also expect to continue with three surface rigs testing resource growth to the south in the 1.5-kilometer gap between Southern Silver and Tour Ridge zones.\nWith the larger drill budget this year, we expect to continue significant growth at Silvertip, which will give our development team confidence to right-size the future operation to fit the potentially increased scale of the ore body.\nThe team reported last week they've cut the best hole ever with 11 mineralized manto horizons.\nThe hole is located under Silvertip Mountain about 500 meters or 1,500 feet south of the Southern Silver and Camp Creek zones in an area with no resource shapes at this time.\nThis new step-out hole is the significant indicator of the growth potential we expect for 2022 and beyond.\nI'll now pass the call over to Mick.\nBefore diving into operational results, I want to recognize the team for continuing to prioritize health and safety and driving continuous improvement in this area.\nFlipping to Slide 24, I'm proud to report that we recently received the NIOSH Mine Safety and Health Technology Innovation Award for our cross-functional COVID-19 response efforts.\nI'm truly honored to be part of such a great team that is relentless in its efforts to work together and look after the well-being of our people.\nNow turning to Slide 5 to cover the operations and starting off with Palmarejo.\nThe team did an excellent job maintaining higher throughput levels and maximizing recoveries to offset some of the lower grades that we've been experiencing with our resequenced mine plant.\nWe've also continued advancing development while focusing on increasing rehabilitation rates across the mine, which helps ensure that we've appropriately prioritized the health and safety of our workforce.\nQuarterly operating costs remain within guidance helping to counterbalance lower realized prices and generate $15 million of free cash flow.\nWe expect a strong finish to the year at Palmarejo and we're excited to see how much production growth we can achieve here in this fourth quarter.\nSwitching over to Rochester.\nWe crushed just under 1.3 million tons of over-liner for the new Stage VI leach pad during the quarter, completing the necessary requirements for POA 11.\nIt's important to note, when we are generating over-liner, we were not crushing materials stacked on the legacy Stage IV leach pad, which had a knock-on effect for production during the third quarter.\nDespite the near-term production impact, all-time energy and resources used to finish crushing overlay now was an important step toward completing this highly anticipated expansion project.\nNow turning to Kensington.\nProduction was slightly higher during the quarter as better agreed [Phonetic] help to offset lower mill throughput caused by stope sequencing and drill parts availability.\nThe good news is that we anticipate more high grade Jualin material over the coming months and have already received the necessary spare parts for stope drills, leaving us very well positioned for strong production growth in the fourth quarter.\nThe Kensington team did an excellent job balancing multiple priorities and maintaining solid cost controls throughout the quarter, which helped generate nearly $15 million of free cash flow.\nFinishing with Wharf, I want to start by acknowledging the tremendous achievement.\nOn October 3, the team at Wharf celebrated one year without a recordable safety incident, truly an amazing accomplishment.\nFrom a results standpoint, Wharf put together yet another great quarter, which marks back to back periods of strong performance.\nGold production was up 17% and cash flow figures was the second highest since Coeur's acquisition back in 2015.\nWith that, I'll pass the call over to Tom.\nFirst, I wanted to add a bit of color on the non-cash adjustments that impacted our third quarter earnings.\nWe wrote off $26 million of Mexican VAT refunds, to which we strongly believe we are entitled, but like many other multinational companies doing business in Mexico, we have experienced significant challenges from SAT in the Mexican courts in obtaining these payments.\nWe also had a mark-to-market adjustment on our equity investments, primarily related to Victoria Gold.\nHowever, the carrying value of the investment remains above our original cost.\nTurning over to Slide 4, I'll quickly run through our quarterly consolidated financial results.\nRevenue of $208 million was driven by relatively stable metal sales and a lower average realized silver price versus the second quarter.\nOperating cash flow totaled $22 million, which was lower than last quarter but also negatively impacted by changes in working capital.\nRemoving working capital, operating cash flow improved by more than 10% quarter-over-quarter.\nLike most companies, we've seen cost pressures related to consumables and labor across all of our operations.\nWith stronger expected Q4 production, we anticipate operating cash flow levels to continue climbing as we finish out the year.\nTurning over to Slide 12 and looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $330 million of liquidity, including $85 million of cash and $245 million of availability under our revolving credit facility.\nAlso, it's worth highlighting that these numbers do not include the $140 million of equity investments on our balance sheet.\nWe did draw down modestly on the revolver.\nWe ended the period with a net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.4 times.\nWe will continue adhering to our disciplined capital allocation framework and remain focused on our goal of keeping net leverage below 2 times and maintaining liquidity of at least $100 million throughout the entire Rochester construction period.\nHowever, we expect the revised timeline for Silvertip, along with the current robust metals price environment, will leave us well positioned to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet.\nI'll now pass the call back to Mitch.\nBefore moving to the Q&A, I want to quickly highlight Slide 13 that outlines our near-term priorities as we approach the end of the year.\nWith production guidance reaffirmed and a strong expected fourth quarter underway, we're feeling confident about our 2021 results and in our ability to carry this momentum into next year.\nWe'll continue pursuing a higher standard and execute at a high level to deliver consistent results and industry-leading organic growth from our balanced portfolio of North American-based precious metals assets.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm Rebecca Gardy, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nA transcript of this earnings conference call will be available within 24 hours at investor.\nTurning to slide 3.\nThese statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk.\nOn Slide 4, you will see our agenda.\nWith us on the call today are Mark Clouse, Campbell's President and CEO; and our Chief Financial Officer, Mick Beekhuizen.\nMark will share his thoughts on our overall first quarter performance and in-market performance by division.\nMick will discuss the financial results of the quarter in more detail and review our guidance for the second quarter.\nWe will close the call with an analyst Q&A.\nI know I am grateful this year for the entire Campbell organization, especially our colleagues in the manufacturing plants and our distribution teams who have been producing and shipping to meet the higher demand the pandemic has brought, while prioritizing the safety of our people and following our heightened in-plant protocols.\nOur strong top-line growth combined with gross margin expansion and value capture synergies, despite the impact of ongoing COVID-19 related costs, led to better than expected adjusted EBIT growth, up 18%, and a 31% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $1.02 per share.\nIt also was a strong executional quarter where we were able to strengthen supply levels to allow our retailers to improve inventory going into the crucial soup and holiday season.\nIn addition, we announced that our Board approved a 6% increase in our quarterly dividend, reflecting the Company's strong earnings performance, cash flows and increasing confidence in our long-term growth prospects as well as our continued commitment to shareholder returns.\nOrganic sales in the first quarter increased 8%, led by 12% organic sales growth in Meals & Beverages reflecting our continued investment in our brands to attract and retain new households as retailers also rebuilt inventory levels.\nTurning to our Snacks Division, we drove solid growth, with organic sales up 4% reflecting sales increases across the majority of our nine power brands.\nOur portfolio of unique and differentiated snacks remained in high demand as in-home consumption rapidly expanded.\nWe did make some selective strategic decisions to shift promotions from the first quarter to the balance of the year to help ease supply constraints, particularly in the Meals & Beverages division.\nWhile these decisions did generate mixed share results as expected, we exited the first quarter in a much better position on retailer inventories and are seeing accelerating in-market performance as programming is ramping up into our key holiday season.\nWe expect that pressure of elevated demand on supply will continue in the near term, but we are building supply chain capacity and capabilities to help us better navigate this pressure and maximize availability while protecting and growing share.\nFor the sixth consecutive quarter, our total Company in-market dollar performance grew in measured channels, increasing 7%, with growth across almost the entire portfolio.\nContinuing the momentum from the back half of fiscal 2020, October was the ninth consecutive month in which we grew household penetration versus prior year.\nIn our first quarter, we attracted millions of new households with the most notable increase coming from younger consumers.\nWe also continued to see elevated repeat rates with over 70% of households gained since the beginning of the pandemic purchasing our products again.\nAs we have said on previous calls, we consider this to be an enduring change in behavior and given strengthening consumer trends like quick-scratch cooking and at-home eating and snacking, we remain confident that we will retain a meaningful number of these households beyond the pandemic.\nWithin the Meals & Beverages division, soup net sales increased 21% with growth in all segments.\nThis reflects retailer inventory recovery, in-market gains, and moderated promotional activity.\nWe grew our household penetration in overall soup by 1.3 points.\nIn addition to gaining new buyers, we are retaining these new buyers as reflected by higher repeat rates.\nAnd, among millennials, we grew share for total US soup by nearly 1 point, including significant growth of 2.7 points on condensed and over 1 point on ready-to-serve, demonstrating the sustained relevance of our core businesses with younger consumers.\nOur condensed soups were the highlight of the quarter with double-digit net sales growth, gains in share led by cooking SKUs, and 4 million new households purchasing this quarter versus prior year.\nWe continued to bring new ideas and recipes to consumers who are cooking more frequently at home.\nAs these first-time cooks gain more confidence, we believe they will likely continue to use these skills to prepare more meals at home, well beyond the pandemic.\nOur recipe solutions continue to resonate with consumers as we saw a 20% increase in overall recipe-related page views in the first quarter compared to the prior year.\nWithin ready-to-serve, we saw solid consumption growth, but supply pressure and our decision to moderate promotions as previously mentioned, resulted in some short-term share loss.\nHowever, as supply has improved, we are seeing improved trends, supported by our Chunky NFL sponsorship activation, our Slow Kettle Crunch innovation, and our Well Yes!\nWe expect all these factors to have a very positive impact in the second quarter.\nOur Pacific Foods growth engine performed well as we continued to build scale with nearly 22% dollar consumption growth in soup and broth in the quarter.\nPacific soup and broth grew share for the fourth consecutive quarter, including strong gains with millennials.\nPacific has also increased points of distribution and grew household penetration as we launched our first ever national advertising campaign.\nOverall, we continue to feel great about the progress we've made against our Win in Soup strategy, as evidenced by our success expanding into millions of new households, attracting younger consumers and growing all of our core brands.\nTurning now to the performance of our Snacks power brands, which grew dollar consumption by 6% in the quarter.\nThe most notable being Late July, which grew consumption sales by 26% and share by nearly 2 points.\nWe continued to run the brand's first national ad campaign throughout the quarter.\nLate July is a great example of how our power brands are helping consumers make the most of their snacking moments.\nWe take a mainstream segment like tortilla chips and offer a product with higher quality including organic product credentials, highly relevant innovation and world-class marketing to better engage consumers, allowing them to trade up into a better snacking experience.\nWe have successfully applied this model to other brands as well, such as Kettle Brand chips and Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps, which also had double-digit dollar consumption growth in the quarter.\nWe also made significant progress on Goldfish in the quarter with both supply and service levels improving.\nWe have also redirected marketing aimed toward snacking options at home and restored promotional spending toward the end of the quarter.\nThis is resulting in improved consumption and share in the most recent periods.\nWe feel very good about our Snacks performance and the steady growth it delivers supported by a very healthy base business.\nIn addition, we continue to remain on-plan to deliver the value capture synergies that we initially outlined as part of our acquisition of Snyder's-Lance.\nOur investment in capacity expansion in both Goldfish and our chips, demonstrates our conviction in the long-term growth potential of our brands.\nWe are still working through some supply constraints, including a challenge in cookies where the combination of demand and labor impacted by COVID-19 has had some negative impact on supply.\nDespite these isolated challenges, we feel very confident in our ability to meet the long-term demand driven by the expected sustained growth of consumer snacking behavior.\nGiven the rapid growth of the e-commerce channel across foods, I want to touch on our enterprise performance in the quarter.\nOur e-commerce in-market dollar consumption results were once again impressive, growing 85% over prior year.\nConsumers' use of e-commerce, and particularly click-and-collect for groceries, has increased by a considerable amount these past several months and we believe this trend will continue.\nAccordingly, we are investing to strengthen our capabilities and in our support of key partnerships to serve the millions of consumers who are shopping online.\nGiven our overall financial results and the actions we have taken to start the year, we are well-positioned across our entire portfolio heading into Q2 and the key soup and holiday season.\nAs Mark just shared, we had a strong start to fiscal 2021 with another quarter of strong sales growth, driven by elevated consumer demand, gross margin expansion, despite the COVID-19 cost headwinds, and robust adjusted EBIT and adjusted earnings per share growth ahead of expectations.\nI'll now review our first quarter results in more detail and provide guidance for the second quarter.\nFor the first quarter, reported net sales increased 7% to $2.3 billion.\nOrganic net sales increased 8% in the quarter, which excludes the impact of the sale of the European chips business.\nAdjusted EBIT increased 18% to $463 million, as higher sales volumes, improved adjusted gross margin performance and lower selling expenses were partially offset by increased marketing and slightly higher adjusted administrative expenses.\nAdjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 31%, or $0.24, to $1.02 per share, reflecting an increase in adjusted EBIT as well as a lower net interest expense.\nBreaking down our net sales performance for the quarter, organic net sales increased 8% from the prior year.\nThis performance was driven by a 6 point gain in volume across the majority of our retail brands, offset partially by declines in foodservice.\nLower levels of promotional spending in both segments drove a 2 point gain.\nThe divestiture of the European chips business negatively impacted net sales in the quarter by a point, and the impact from currency translation in the quarter was neutral.\nAll-in, our reported net sales were up 7% from the prior year.\nOur adjusted gross margin increased by 100 basis points in the quarter to 34.8%.\nFavorable product mix, which drove a 30 basis point improvement in our adjusted gross margin, was largely driven by the increased contribution from our soup products within our Meals & Beverages segment.\nSeparately, we are estimating a 60 basis point gross margin improvement from better operating leverage within our supply chain network as we significantly increased our overall production, primarily within Meals & Beverages.\nNet pricing drove a 120 basis point improvement, due to lower levels of promotional spending in the quarter.\nInflation and other factors had a negative impact of 270 basis points driven by cost inflation, as overall input prices on a rate basis increased approximately 2%, as well as other operational costs and continued COVID-19 related costs.\nThis was partially offset by our ongoing supply chain productivity program, which contributed a 150 basis point improvement, and includes, among others, initiatives within procurement and logistics optimization.\nOur cost savings program, which is incremental to our ongoing supply chain productivity program, added 10 basis points to our gross margin expansion.\nMoving on to other operating items.\nMarketing and selling expenses increased 1% in the quarter to $208 million.\nThis increase was driven primarily by our planned increased investment in advertising and consumer promotion expenses, which is up 17% versus a year ago.\nThese investments primarily reflect higher levels of support behind soup, to continue to drive usage, inspire meal solutions, build brand awareness among younger households, and support innovation.\nThese investments were partially offset by the benefits of our cost savings initiatives, lower marketing overhead, and lower selling expenses.\nAdjusted administrative expenses increased $11 million or 9% to $137 million, driven by higher benefit costs and general administrative costs, including incremental consulting charges related to supply chain optimization, as well as inflation, partially offset by the benefits from our cost savings initiatives.\nMoving to the next slide, we have continued to successfully deliver against our multi-year enterprise cost savings initiatives.\nThis quarter, we achieved $15 million in incremental year-over-year savings, inclusive of Snyder's-Lance synergies.\nTo-date, that brings our savings for the overall program to $740 million.\nWe expect an additional $60 million to $70million in the balance of fiscal 2021 and we remain on-track to deliver our cumulative savings target of $850 million by the end of fiscal 2022.\nTo help tie this all together, we are providing an adjusted EBIT bridge to highlight the key drivers of performance this quarter.\nAs discussed, adjusted EBIT grew by 18%.\nThis was largely driven by the increase in demand for our products with sales gains contributing $53 million of EBIT growth.\nThe overall adjusted gross margin expansion of 100 basis points contributed $23 million of EBIT growth, which more than offset higher marketing and selling expenses of $2 million reflecting our investments in A&C, partially offset by lower selling expenses.\nThe remaining impact of all other items, consisting of adjusted administrative expenses, R&D and adjusted other income in aggregate was nominal.\nOur adjusted EBIT margin increased year-over-year by 180 basis points to 19.8%.\nThe following chart breaks down our adjusted earnings per share growth between our operating performance and below the line items.\nAdjusted earnings per share increased $0.24 from $0.78 in the prior-year quarter to $1.02 per share.\nAdjusted EBIT had a positive $0.18 impact on adjusted EPS.\nNet interest expense declined year-over-year by $25 million, delivering a $0.06 positive impact to adjusted EPS, as we have used proceeds from completed divestitures and our strong cash flow to reduce debt.\nThe impact from the adjusted tax rate was nominal, completing the bridge to $1.02 per share.\nIn Meals & Beverages, organic net sales increased 12% to $1.3 billion, reflecting double-digit increases across most of our US retail products, including gains in US soups, inclusive of Pacific Foods soups and broth, Prego pasta sauces, V8 beverages, Campbell's pasta, and Pace Mexican sauces, as well as gains in Canada, partially offset by declines in foodservice.\nVolume was favorable in US retail and Canada, driven by increased demand of food purchases for at-home consumption, offset partially by the negative impact on foodservice as a result of shifts in consumer behavior and continued COVID-19 related restrictions.\nNet sales of US soup, including Pacific, increased 21% compared to the prior year due to retailers rebuilding inventory for the upcoming soup season, in-market gains in condensed soups and broth and moderating promotional spending.\nOperating earnings for Meals & Beverages increased 18% to $333 million.\nThe increase was primarily driven by sales volume growth and improved gross margin, offset partially by increased marketing investment.\nThe gross margin performance was impacted by the lower levels of promotional spending and favorable mix, as productivity improvements and improved operating leverage were offset by other operational costs, cost inflation and COVID-19 related costs.\nWithin Snacks, organic sales increased 4% driven primarily by lower levels of promotional spending as well as healthy velocity on the majority of the base business.\nWe saw volume gains in fresh bakery products, Late July snacks, Pop Secret popcorn, Pepperidge Farm cookies, Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps, as well as Kettle Brand potato chips, which partially offset declines in Lance sandwich crackers.\nSales of Goldfish crackers were relatively flat in the quarter, as increased demand for family size products were offset by reduced away-from-home consumption.\nOperating earnings for Snacks increased 11% driven by lower selling expenses, lower marketing overhead, and sales volume gains, partly offset by higher administrative expenses.\nGross margin performance was consistent with prior year as lower levels of promotional spending were offset by higher net supply chain costs as productivity improvements, cost savings initiatives and improved operating leverage were more than offset by cost inflation and COVID-19 related costs.\nI'll now turn to our cash flow and liquidity.\nCash flow from operations was $180 million, comparable to the prior year as changes in working capital were basically offset by higher cash earnings and lower other cash payments.\nCash from investing activities decreased by $341 million, driven by lapping the net proceeds from our divested businesses in the prior year.\nThe cash outlay for capital expenditures was $74 million, $24 million lower than the prior year driven by discontinued operations, and in line with our previously communicated full-year expectation.\nCash outflows for financing activities were $245 million compared to $453 million a year ago.\nThe reduced cash outflow reflects lower debt repayments.\nDividends paid in the amount of $108 million were comparable to the prior year, reflecting our current quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share.\nWe ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $722 million.\nI'll now turn to guidance.\nAs I've reviewed, the Company's strong first quarter fiscal 2021 results were impacted by increased demand stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe impact of the continuing pandemic on the Company's fiscal 2021 results is uncertain and makes it difficult to provide a full year outlook at this time.\nBased on our expectation of a continued elevated demand landscape and increased investment in our brands, we are providing the following guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 21.\nWe expect year-over-year growth in net sales of 5% to 7% as growth more closely aligns with consumption reflecting better inventory, strong programming and improving share positions.\nWe expect adjusted EBIT growth to be in line with year-over-year sales growth for the quarter as we invest to win the season and keep fueling the retention of new households behind key consumer trends.\nWe expect the combination of healthy EBIT growth and the benefit of significantly reduced interest expense year-over-year to result in adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% to 15%, or $0.81 to $0.83 per share.\nWhile it remains very difficult to provide anymore direction for the balance of the year, as time has progressed our outlook does continue to strengthen.\nIn closing, our first-quarter results were a strong start to the year.\nI am proud of the continued strong execution by our teams throughout the organization.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2021 results with you today.\nJoining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our Chief Executive Officer; Keith Demmings, our President; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer.\nYesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the third quarter 2021.\nThe release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com.\nWe'll start today's call with remarks from Alan, Keith and Richard before moving into a Q&A session.\nDuring today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance.\nOur third quarter results were strong, driven by double-digit operating earnings growth in Global Lifestyle.\nThe strength of our Global Automotive and Connected Living offerings continue to validate our long-term strategy of focusing on our higher growth fee-based and capital-light businesses.\nWe continue to make progress in building a more sustainable company for all stakeholders.\nDuring the quarter, a few key highlights included.\nFor the first time, Assurant was awarded a Bronze accreditation by EcoVadis, one of the largest sustainability ratings companies, ranking Assurant among the top 50% of all 75,000 participating companies.\nIn addition, this quarter we provided additional transparency to track our progress on our journey to build a more diverse and inclusive Assurant, with the recent disclosure of our EEO-1,which provides gender, race and ethnicity data by job category for our U.S.-based employees.\nWe believe a diverse and inclusive workforce will best foster innovation, a key ingredient to sustaining our outperformance longer-term.\nLooking at our financial performance year-to-date, net operating income per share excluding reportable catastrophes was $8.75, up 12% compared to the first nine months of last year.\nNet operating income and adjusted EBITDA also excluding cats, both increased by 10% to $528 million and $862 million, respectively.\nThese results support our full year outlook of 10% to 14% growth in net operating income per share excluding reportable catastrophes, marking our fifth consecutive year of strong profitable growth.\nGiven year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we would expect to end the year closer to the top half of this range.\nWe've also now completed our three-year $1.35 billion capital return objective from our 2019 Investor Day, a quarter ahead of schedule.\nFollowing the close on the sale of Global Preneed in August, we've also made meaningful progress in returning an additional $900 million to shareholders.\nOur 2021 earnings per share outlook is driven by at least high single-digit net operating income growth, excluding cats, as well as share repurchases.\nTurning to our business performance.\nIn Global Lifestyle, we are on track to grow adjusted EBITDA by double digits in 2021 from $637 million in 2020, driven by Global Automotive and Connected Living.\nWe have benefited from the stable recurring revenue stream of our installed base of mobile subscribers and our success in launching additional offerings and capabilities for mobile carrier, cable operator, OEM and retail clients globally.\nAdditionally, our mobile trade-in upgrade business and expanded service delivery options are increasingly important to our profitability and also on providing a differentiated and superior customer experience.\nWithin Global Automotive, we benefited from increased scale, growing the number of vehicles we protect by 20%, over 52 million since The Warranty Group acquisition in 2018.\nWe believe Auto will continue to be one of our key growth businesses in the future.\nIn Global Housing, we continue to be on track for another year of better than market returns, with an annualized operating ROE of nearly 15% for the first nine months of this year.\nThis includes $113 million of catastrophe losses, which further demonstrates the superior returns of this differentiated business.\nOur counter-cyclical lender placed insurance business remains an integral part of the mortgage industry framework in the U.S. Within lender placed, as we renew existing clients and add new partners, we will continue to enhance the experience through the ongoing rollout of our single source processing platform.\nOur Multifamily Housing business now supports over 2.5 million renters across the U.S. and has more than doubled earnings since 2015 through our strong partnerships with our affinity and property management company clients.\nOur investments in digital capabilities, such as our cover 360 property management solution continues to drive more value for our partners and an enhanced customer experience.\nOverall, we believe our portfolio of high growth, fee based capital-light offerings and high return Specialty P&C businesses sets us apart as a long-term outperformer and sustained value creator for our shareholders.\nMost of all, I'm humbled by our 15,000 employees, who through their dedication to serve our clients and our 300 million customers worldwide have successfully transformed Assurant.\nTogether, we have significantly strengthened our Fortune 300 company that should continue to deliver above-market growth and superior cash flow.\nWith our President, Keith Demmings, succeeding me as CEO in January, I'm confident Assurant will accelerate our strategy and continue to differentiate our superior customer experience will further deepen in client relationships.\nI've been fortunate to have had a front-row seat and a role in supporting Alan's vision and the transformation of Assurant.\nImportantly, he has continued to evolve the purpose of our company to drive value for all stakeholders, customers, employees, communities and shareholders.\nThe impact he has had on our people and the overall culture of our company has been exemplary.\nAnd I appreciate Alan personal mentorship and partnership and wish him the very best in his retirement.\nAs we build on Assurant's momentum over the long-term, I believe our talent and innovation will be critical factors to achieving success and growth, especially as we focus more on the convergence around the connected consumer.\nFrom a talent perspective, Assurant has developed a deep and diverse bench of internal leaders.\nA few weeks ago, I announced our refreshed Management Committee effective in January, including two new leadership appointments illustrating our strong bench.\nFirst, Keith Meier, our current President of International will succeed Gene Mergelmeyer as Chief Operating Officer, as Jim will be retiring at year-end.\nGene's significant contributions to Assurant over the last 30 plus years, including as COO over his last five years have been instrumental in creating market-leading positions, producing profitable growth and transforming the organization.\nIn succeeding Gene, Keith Meier brings nearly 25 years of experience at Assurant to the COO role.\nSince 2016 as President of Assurant International, he has driven growth across our global markets, most recently with strong success in Asia Pacific.\nIn this new role, Keith will be focused on advancing Assurant's business strategy and market leadership positions as well as identifying additional opportunities to deliver a superior customer experience.\nSecond, Martin Jenns, will become President of Global Automotive.\nWith over 30 years of experience, he currently leads the transformation and growth strategy for Auto and has been instrumental in our introduction of innovative new products like EB-1, our electric vehicle warranty protection.\nIn addition to emerging opportunities and innovation, Martin will be focused on driving growth and improving the customer experience, including working with our partners to deliver best-in-class dealer training.\nThese two new appointments along with recent appointments of Biju Nair as President of Connected Living and Manny Becerra as our Chief Innovation Officer, as well as the other management committee members represent a strong team to help lead us into the future.\nIn addition to talent, innovation is an important strength of the organization.\n, not only the development of new digital products and offerings for our clients, but also through new path to grow and scale Assurant's businesses.\nWithin Connected Living, innovation was a significant theme this quarter through ongoing enhancements of our mobile service delivery options.\nAs part of the recently finalized multi-year contract extension with T-Mobile, we're expanding the services Assurant provides to continuously improve the customer experience for millions of T-Mobile customers.\nAs of November 1st, Assurant is partnering with T-Mobile to begin the nationwide rollout of in-store device repair services to approximately 500 stores, provided by Assurant's industry certified repair experts.\nIn addition, we have also transitioned all of the legacy Sprint protection subscribers to the new T-Mobile Device protection offering.\nAs a result, this significantly adds to our mobile device count, now at roughly 63 million as of November 1st.\nOverall, the expansion of our service delivery options is critical to sustaining our competitive advantage.\nWe also recently signed a multi-year renewal with Spectrum Mobile, continuing to provide a comprehensive and Pocket Geek mobile [Technical Issues] on-device diagnostic tool.\nWith the renewal, we will also be expanding the offering to include Pocket Geek privacy, which enables consumers to better protect and manage their personal information online through various features.\nThis is another example of how we're able to grow by adding services and capabilities to existing clients.\nIn addition, the mobile business continues to see strong attachment rates given the increased reliance on mobile devices as well as rising device prices.\nOur fee-driven trade-in and upgrade business, including the previous acquisitions of Hyla and Alegre have performed extraordinarily well already this year as we enter the early innings of the 5G upgrade cycle.\nIn fact, almost a year after the transaction of Hyla closed, I'm happy to report the acquisition has performed better than expected, ahead of the low-teens forward EBITDA the acquisition was valued on.\nWith the growing availability and popularity of 5G-enabled smartphones, we expect to see our 30 plus trade-in and upgrade programs continue to grow.\nOur progress is demonstrated through our ability to manage large scale programs with superior technology.\nThis is further supported by increasing our attach rates for trade-in programs as our clients promotional efforts encourage consumers to upgrade.\nOverall, we have processed nearly 18 million devices so far this year, reducing e-waste and increasing digital access with high quality, affordable phones.\nThrough the scale and capabilities of our trade-in and upgrade programs, we benefit from an additional source of profits and improved client economics and customer retention.\nThis quarter, we are pleased to announce that we have signed a multi-year contract extension with AT&T to manage their device trade-in program.\nThis includes providing analytics as well as device collection and processing for all of their sales channels, including retail, B2B, dealer and direct to consumer.\nAT&T was the key client added with the Hyla acquisition and we look forward to continuing to do business with them, specifically as we help support the growing adoption of 5-G-enabled devices.\nIn Global Automotive, policies increased by $4 million or 8% year-over-year and production is well above pre-pandemic levels as we continue to take advantage of our scale and talent.\nSo far this year, the business has also the benefited from strong used car growth which tends to earn faster than new car sales.\nThis along with the fact that earnings from the business are recognized over a multi-year period provides good visibility into future performance of the business.\nAs we drive innovation within Auto, we continued the global rollout of EV-1, an electric vehicle and hybrid protection product to North America.\nEV-1 has now been rolled out in seven countries.\nWhile the electric vehicle market is still in its infancy, our EV-1 product will allow Assurant an opportunity to better evaluate customer demand and leverage our learnings to position us well for the expected increase in electric vehicle adoption in the future.\nOur Multifamily Housing business grew policies by 7% year-over-year from growth in our affinity partners as well as our PMC relationships, where we continue the rollout of our innovative cover 360 product.\nIn addition, we have seen other digital investments create opportunities for future growth.\nOur newly designed digital sales portal, which makes it faster and easier for residents to sign up for a policy is driving significantly higher product attachment rates.\nOur new portal has seen an increase in conversion rates versus our legacy website since it was first introduced last year.\nIn summary, our ability to strengthen insurance talent and innovation, supported by critical investments has and should continue to drive momentum for the future.\nAs Alan noted, we are pleased with our third quarter performance as our results reflect strong growth across Global Lifestyle and solid earnings in Global Housing.\nFor the quarter, we reported net operating income per share excluding reportable catastrophes of $2.73, up 5% from the prior year period.\nExcluding cats, net operating income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, each increased 4% to $162 million and $262 million, respectively.\nNow let's move to segment results, starting with Global Lifestyle.\nThis segment reported net operating income of $124 million in the third quarter, continued earnings expansion within Connected Livings mobile business.\nIn Global Automotive, earnings increased $8 million or 21% from continued global growth in our U.S. national dealer and third-party administrator channels, including contributions from our AFAS and international OEM channels.\nBetter loss experience in select ancillary products and higher investment income also supported earnings growth in the quarter.\nConnected Living earnings increased by $6 million or 9% year-over-year.\nThe increase was primarily driven by continued mobile subscriber growth in North America and better performance in Asia Pacific, as well as higher trading volumes, led by contributions from our Hyla acquisition and carrier promotions.\nThis quarter, Global Automotive and Connected Living results also included a modest one-time tax benefit that improved earnings.\nFor the quarter, Lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA increased 17% to $177 million.\nThis reflects the segments increased amortization resulting from higher deal related intangibles from more recent transactions in mobile in Global Automotive.\nIT depreciation expense also increased, stemming from higher investments.\nAs we look at revenues, Lifestyle revenues increased by $158 million or 9%.\nThis was driven mainly by continued growth in Connected Living and Global Automotive.\nWithin Connected Living, revenue increased 10% boosted by mobile fee income that was driven by strong trade-in volumes, including contributions from Hyla.\nTrade-in volumes were supported by new phone introductions and carrier promotions from the introduction of new 5G devices.\nHigher revenue from growth in domestic mobile subscribers was offset by declines in run-off mobile programs.\nMobile subscribers were up slightly year-over-year and flat year-to-date as mid-single digit subscriber growth in North America was offset by declines in other geographies mostly due to three factors.\nFirst, the 750,000 subscribers related to a run-off of European banking program previously mentioned, which is not expected to be a significant impact in our profitability.\nSecond, subscriber growth for existing programs moderating in Asia Pacific.\nAnd third, a slower than expected recovery from the pandemic in Latin America.\nIn Global Automotive, revenue increased 8%, reflecting strong prior period sales of vehicle service contracts.\nIndustry auto sales remained elevated in the third quarter and we benefited from this trend as reflected in the year-over-year growth of our net written premium by 12%.\nWe have though seen this trend begin to normalize beginning into the fourth quarter.\nFor the full year, Lifestyle revenues are expected to increase modestly compared to last years $7.3 billion, mainly driven by Global Auto and Connected Living growth.\nFor all of 2021, we still expect Global Lifestyle's net operating income to grow in the high single digits compared to 2020.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the segment is expected to grow double digits year-over-year, which continues to grow at a faster pace in segment net operating income.\nAs previously reported, we began our investment in the [Technical Issues] capability this quarter.\nHowever, due to the timing of the rollout, most of our associated start-up costs will occur in the third quarter.\nThese costs primarily relate to technician hiring and parts sourcing.\nWe do expect these costs to meaningfully impact Connected Livings profitability as we end the year.\nIn addition, we expect our effective tax rate to return to a more normal level, approximately 23%.\nLooking ahead to 2022, we expect earnings expansion to continue, but more likely at more moderated levels as we continue to invest for growth including additional implementation start-up costs for in-store service and repair.\nMoving to Global Housing, net operating income excluding catastrophe losses was $81 million for the third quarter, including the $78 million of pre-announced catastrophe losses mainly from Hurricane Ida, net operating income totaled $3 million.\nExcluding catastrophe losses, earnings decreased $19 million due to anticipated higher non-cat losses, which returned to levels more in line with historical averages.\nAs a reminder, favorable non-CAT losses in 2020 were not representative of historical trends and third quarter 2020 marked the lowest point of last year, mainly driven by loss experience within lender placed and specialty products.\nThe year-over-year earnings decline was nearly all driven by unfavorable non-cat loss experience from several factors.\nThe largest driver which contributed close to half of the increase was from the expected normalization of the non-cat loss ratio.\nThe balance of the decline was split relatively evenly between increased reserves related to our Specialty P&C offerings, primarily in our on-demand sharing economy business as well as higher claims severity.\nClaims severity included moderate impacts from inflationary factors such as higher labor and material costs.\nWhile there is always a lag.\nIf this trend continues, we would expect higher loss cost to be offset by increased rates over time.\nIn Multifamily Housing, underlying growth was offset by increased investments to further strengthen our customer experience, including our digital first capability.\nGlobal Housing revenue decreased slightly year-over-year from lower Specialty P&C revenues as well as a cat reinstatement premium resulting from Hurricane Ida and lower REO volumes in lender placed.\nThis was partially offset by higher average insured values and premium rates in lender placed and growth in Multifamily Housing.\nWe continue to expect Global Housing's net operating income excluding cats to be flat for the full year compared to 2020.\nFor the fourth quarter and into 2022, we would expect non-cat losses to continue to be above 2020, but in line with year-to-date 2021 experience, which is consistent with long-term trends.\nWe also continue to monitor the REO foreclosure moratoriums and any additional extensions that may be announced.\nAt Corporate, the net operating loss was $21 million, an improvement of $4 million compared to the third quarter of 2020.\nThis was driven by two items.\nFirst, lower employee-related expenses and third-party fee.\nAnd second, expense savings associated with reducing our real estate footprint.\nIn the fourth quarter, we do anticipate a higher loss due to the timing of spend.\nFor the full year 2021, we now expect the Corporate net operating loss to be approximately $80 million, driven by favorable year-to-date results mainly from the one-time tax and real estate joint venture benefits in the second quarter.\nThis compares to our previous estimate of $85 million.\nAs we look forward to 2022, we would expect our net operating loss in Corporate to be closer to $90 million, more in line with historical trends.\nTurning to the holding company liquidity, including the net proceeds from the sale of Preneed in August, we ended the third quarter with over $1.3 billion, well above our current minimum target level.\nIn the third quarter, dividends from operating segments totaled $127 million.\nIn addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, we also had outflows from three main items, $323 million of share repurchases, $39 million in common stock dividends and $11 million mainly related to Assurant ventures investment.\nIn addition to completing our 2019 Investor Day objective of returning $1.35 billion to shareholders from 2019 through 2021, we have also completed roughly one-quarter of our objective to return $900 million in Global Preneed sale proceeds through share repurchases.\nFor the year overall, we continue to expect dividends to approximate segment earnings subject to the growth of the businesses, rating agency and regulatory capital requirements and investment portfolio performance.\nI also want to provide a quick update on the Assurant Ventures, our venture capital arm.\nIn the third quarter, three investments in our portfolio went public via SPACs.\nWe are pleased with the results as the three investment exceeded a 7 times multiple on investment capital under their respective SPAC transaction terms.\nThese transactions combined with strong performance in the broader ventures portfolio led to a $75 million after-tax gain flowing through net income in the quarter.\nIn addition to strong returns, these investments also provide key insights into emerging technologies and capabilities within our Connected Consumer businesses.\nIn addition to positioning Assurant for long-term success and growth, he has created an environment of inclusion in community, truly representative of our core values, common sense and common decency.\nAlan, I wish you all the very best in retirement, well deserved.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'd like to take a few minutes to make some high-level comments about our business and how we performed last year.\nWe came into 2020 with great momentum and this continued into the first quarter, delivering 5.6% organic growth, then COVID-19 hit the US economy and things changed dramatically.\nWhile there was significant uncertainty, we knew we had a great team and resilient responses and innovative with a focus on providing solutions to our customers.\nIn addition, we were able to move -- we were able to quickly transition over 10,000 teammates to a no working environment in less than a week.\nSo they could pivot and effectively serve our customers.\nAs you may remember, we didn't grow as quickly in the second quarter due to the impact of the pandemic on our new business and the recording of revenue adjustments for general liability policies, but we still expanded our margins.\nAnd in the third quarter, we delivered outstanding results with strong organic growth and margin expansion.\nThe results of the fourth quarter were similar to the third quarter as we finished the year strong and with good momentum going into '21.\nBased on what we were seeing, if you ask me, if it was likely that we would deliver full-year results with good organic growth and meaningful margin expansion, I would have said it was possible but unlikely that if you would ask me that in, let's say, April.\nWe are very pleased with our results for 2020.\nWe were able to deliver these results through the hard work of our teammates and their dedication to our customers.\n2020 was a testament to our laser focus on delivering innovative risk solutions.\nWe also thought the M&A landscape would cool off for several quarters until there was some sort of economic stability.\nThe slowdown only occurred for about one quarter and the industrywide activity is now rebounded a pre-COVID-19 levels.\nEven with the uncertainty this year, we're very pleased that completed 25 acquisitions and $197 million of acquired annual revenue.\nI'd like to highlight two strategic acquisitions, CoverHound that we completed in the fourth quarter, and O'Leary Insurances that we announced in the fourth quarter and closed on the 14th of January.\nRegarding CoverHound, this acquisition will help us in many ways.\nFirst, it will help us further our investment in technology, drive our innovation agenda and improve our carrier connectivity.\nSecond, it enables us to more effectively and efficiently provide quotes and bond coverage for our National Programs segment.\nThird, it enables us to better serve smaller customers within our retail segment.\nUltimately, these items are focused on enhancing the customer buying experience by delivering curated quotes that best meet the needs of our customers.\nWe believe these new capabilities are unique in the marketplace.\nWe started 2020 with the acquisition Special Risk in British Columbia and finished the year with our acquisition of O'Leary Insurances in Ireland.\nO'Leary was the largest independently owned retail brokers serving the Irish marketplace.\nThis acquisition strengthens our European operations, which we look forward to further developing in the years ahead.\nOur new teammates and capability to deliver many opportunities over the coming years.\nWe're extremely proud of our results in 2020 in the delivery of total shareholder returns in excess of 20%.\nAnd Steve Boyd will become our President of Wholesale.\nSteve's background in National Programs as an operator and in technology brings critical skills to the leadership team in Wholesale as we continue to grow this important business through innovative solutions.\nI'm excited that Tony and Steve will be working together to further drive this growth in the future.\nNow, let's transition to the results of the quarter and the full-year.\nI'm on Slide number 3.\nWe delivered strong results again this quarter, total revenue of $642 million, growing 10.9% in total and 4.7% organically.\nAgain into more detail in a few minutes about the performance of our segments.\nOur EBITDAC margin was 27.1%, which is up 10 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2019.\nPlease remember that the fourth quarter of '19 included a gain on sale of business that benefited the prior year margin by approximately 100 basis points.\nOur net income per share for the fourth quarter was $0.34, increasing 25% on an as-reported basis.\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables, our net income per share was $0.32, an increase of 14.3% over the prior year.\nOur team did an outstanding job of continuing to profitably grow our revenue, as well as manage our expenses in response to the dynamics associated with COVID-19.\nDuring the quarter, we completed another nine acquisitions with annual revenues of approximately $80 million.\nFor the year, we grew total revenues of 9.2% and delivered organic revenue growth of 3.8%.\nThis is an outstanding performance given the economic headwinds experienced for most of the year.\nWe improved our EBITDAC margin for -- by 110 basis points to 31.1%, compared to 2019 as we leverage the growth in organic revenue and managed our expenses in response to the pandemic.\nOur net income per share for the full-year of '20 increased 20.7% to $1.69 from $1.40 in 2019.\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the change in acquisition earn-outs, net income per share increased 19.3%.\nLastly, we had another strong year of M&A activity, as I said earlier, closing 25 acquisitions with approximately $197 million of annual revenue, adding many excellent businesses and teammates.\nNow, on Slide 5.\nIn prior calls, we talked about factors that would impact the economic recovery, which included the elections, the approval of the vaccine and the timing of the rollout, as well as how much additional stimulus will be approved.\nThe timing of the vaccine rollout and the approval of additional stimulus will have the largest impact upon the recovery of the economy will influence business leaders confidence about rehiring and investing in their businesses.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we continue to see companies doing well and other struggling mightily.\nWe've seen improving new business and our retention remains good.\nHowever, we continue to believe it will be choppy -- a choppy recovery through at least the end of 2021 and maybe into early 2022.\nFrom a rate standpoint, the fourth quarter was very similar to the third quarter, most standard rates were up 3% to 7% with E&S rates up 10% to 25% as compared to the prior year.\nAs we've talked about before, the main driver of rate increases continues to be loss experience.\nCommercial auto rates remain up 10% or more and workers' compensation rates are not declining as fast as they were in previous quarters, but they are still negative.\nThere has been a lot of talk over the past few quarters that workers' compensation rates are turning positive.\nHowever, we're still not seeing it across the board yet.\nFor an E&S perspective, coastal property, both wind and quake are up 15% to 25%.\nProfessional liability is generally up 10% to 25%, depending on the coverage in the industry.\nWe continue to see outliers to be wanted to coverage.\nPersonal lines in California, Florida and the Gulf Coast states remain under intense pressure as carriers are seeking to reduce their exposure due to fires and tropical activity during 2020.\nWe expect the reduction in personal lines capacity continue throughout '21.\nPlacing coverage for many lines, certain industries or customers with significant losses continues to be challenging.\nThis includes excess or umbrella coverage, where a carrier or carriers will seek a combination of lower limit and higher premium rates.\nWe don't expect this trend to materially change in '21.\nNow, on Slide number 6.\nLet's discuss the performance of our four segments.\nOur Retail segment, organic revenue growth grew by 1.5% for the fourth quarter.\nAs we mentioned in our third quarter earnings call, we had about a 100 basis points of timing items that benefited the growth in the third quarter and negatively impacted the growth in the fourth quarter.\nOur fourth quarter performance was driven by new business, better customer retention and premium rate increases, but was impacted by lower exposure units resulting from the pandemic.\nWe view the performance for the fourth quarter as good, considering we delivered 7% organic growth in the fourth quarter of last year and taking into consideration the timing headwind mentioned earlier.\nOrganic revenue growth for the full-year was 2.4%, which we consider a good performance in light of the tough economic environment.\nOur National Programs segment grew 14.1% organically, delivering another stellar quarter.\nOur growth was driven by strong new business, retention and rate increases.\nSome of the top performing programs were our lender place, commercial and residential earthquake, wind and personal property, just to name a few.\nFor the full-year, our National Programs segment grew organically, an impressive 12.3%.\nOur Wholesale Brokerage segment grew 5.8% organically for the quarter.\nWe realized strong new business and continued rate increases for most lines of coverage.\nBrokerage was the fastest-growing again this quarter, while we continue to experience headwinds in our binding authority and personal lines businesses due to the economy and carrier appetite we mentioned previously.\nFor the full-year, our Wholesale Brokerage segment grew 5.5% organically, delivering another good year.\nThe organic revenue for our Services segment decreased 50 basis points for the fourth quarter, representing good improvement from the last few quarters.\nThe main drivers depressing growth continue to be lower claims volume for our Social Security and Medicare Set-aside advocacy businesses.\nThe decline was substantially offset by revenue generated by processing claims for weather-related events that occurred in the third and fourth quarters.\nFor the full-year, organic revenue decreased by 10.9%, driven by lower claims for our Social Security Advocacy business, certain terminated customer contracts and the impact of the pandemic.\nWhile not back in positive territory, we believe the fourth quarter was a turning point, and we anticipate delivering modest organic growth for 2021.\nI'm moving on to Slide number 7.\nLike previous quarters, I'm going to discuss our GAAP results, certain non-GAAP financial highlights, as well as our adjusted results, excluding the impact of the change in acquisition earn-out payables.\nFor the fourth quarter, we delivered total revenue growth of 61 -- $63.1 million, or 10.9% and organic revenue growth of 4.7%.\nOur EBITDAC increased by 11.3%, growing slightly faster than revenues as we are able to leverage our expense base and further manage our expenses in response to COVID-19.\nThese both offset the headwinds associated with the gain on disposal recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation.\nOur income before income taxes increased by 28.3%, outpacing EBITDAC growth.\nThis is primarily driven by the $15 million year-over-year decrease in the change of estimated acquisition earn-out payables.\nOn the next slide, we'll discuss our results excluding this adjustment.\nOur net income increased by $20.8 million or 27.2% and our diluted net income per share increased by 25.9% to $0.34.\nOur effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 25.7%, substantially in line with the 25% we realized in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nOur weighted average number of shares increased slightly compared to the prior year and our dividends per share increased to $0.093 or 9.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.\nOver on to Slide number 8.\nThis slide presents our results after removing the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables for both years.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables was a credit of $9.5 million as compared to a $5.5 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nThe credit was primarily driven by the reduction in estimated earn-out payables for an acquisition within the National Programs segment.\nExcluding the change in acquisition earn-outs in the fourth quarter of both years, our income before income tax grew $13.9 million or 12.9%.\nOur net income on an adjusted basis increased by $9.7 million or 12% and our adjusted diluted net income per share was $0.32, an increase of 14.3%.\nOverall, it was a great quarter.\nWe're moving over to Slide number 9.\nThis slide presents the key components of our revenue performance.\nFor the quarter, our total commissions and fees increased by 10.9% and our contingent commissions and GSCs was slightly down for the quarter.\nOur organic revenues was exclude the net impact of M&A activity, increased by 4.7% for the fourth quarter.\nOver to Slide number 10.\nOur Retail segment delivered total revenue growth of 7.2%, driven by acquisition activity and organic revenue growth of 1.5%.\nThe timing discussed above negatively impacted organic revenue by 100 basis points for the quarter.\nEBITDAC grew 5.3% due to leveraging organic revenue and cost savings achieved in response to the pandemic.\nThis growth was slower than the growth in total revenues, primarily due to a prior year gain on disposal that represented a negative year-over-year impact of approximately 150 basis points.\nOur income before income tax margin increased 130 basis points and grew faster than EBITDAC, due primarily to the change in estimated acquisition earn-outs.\nMoving on to Slide number 11.\nOur National Programs segment increased total revenues by $25.3 million or 18.9% and organic revenue by 14.1%.\nThe increase in total revenue was driven by recent acquisitions and strong organic growth across many programs.\nDue to that growth of 19% was in line with total revenue growth.\nThe leveraging of strong organic revenue in the management of variable cost was offset by higher intercompany IT charges and lower contingent commissions.\nIncome before income taxes increased by $20.3 million or 54% growing faster than EBITDAC due to decreased acquisition earn-out payables that was partially offset by higher intercompany interest expense.\nOver to Slide number 12.\nOur Wholesale Brokerage segment delivered total revenue growth of 19.2% and organic revenue growth of 5.8%.\nTotal revenues grew faster than organic revenue due to recent acquisitions with contingent commissions substantially flat year-over-year.\nEBITDAC grew by 17.1% with a margin decline of 40 basis points as compared to the prior year, while we delivered good organic growth and reduced variable expenses in response to COVID-19.\nThese were more than offset due to changes in foreign exchange rates and to a lesser extent higher intercompany IT charges.\nOur income before income taxes, grew by 6.2%, which was lower than total revenue growth, primarily due to higher intercompany interest expense.\nOver to Slide number 13.\nTotal revenues and organic revenues for the Services segment both declined by about 50 basis points, driven by the items Powell mentioned earlier.\nFor the quarter, EBITDAC increased by 9.7% due to increased weather-related claims and was partially offset by higher intercompany IT expenses.\nIncome before income taxes decreased 23.6% due to a credit of $2.5 million in the quarters in the fourth quarter of 2019 for the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables that did not recur or occurred in 2020.\nOver to Slide number 14.\nThis slide presents our GAAP results for the full-year of 2020 and 2019.\nFor 2020, we delivered revenues of $2.6 billion, growing 9.2% and earnings per share of $1.69, growing 20.7%.\nOur EBITDAC increased by 13.5% and our EBITDAC margin grew by 110 basis points.\nFor the year, our share count increased slightly as compared to the prior year and our dividends paid during 2020 as compared to 2019 increased by 7.1%.\nOver to Slide number 15.\nThis slide presents our results excluding the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables for both years.\nFor the full-year of 2020, on an adjusted basis, our income before income taxes grew 18.1%, which outpaced EBITDAC growth due to lower interest expense and our adjusted net income per share grew by 19.3%.\nIn addition to the strong income performance metrics, we also had another strong year for cash conversion due to the strength of our operating model and diversity of our businesses.\nWe delivered $721.6 million of cash flow from operations, representing a continued strong conversion rate of 27.6% as a percentage of revenue.\nWe also finished the year in a strong liquidity position, with $817 million of cash and cash equivalents, as well as $800 million of accessible capital on our revolver.\nWith this capital and the cash we will generate in 2021, we are in a good position to fund continued investment in our Company.\nWe got a few other comments regarding outlook for 2021.\nDuring the third quarter, we were asked the question about our potential margins for 2021 in relation to the COVID-19 savings we had in 2020.\nNow, with the year completed and a bit more visibility in 2021, we expect EBITDAC margins could be flat to up slightly considering our variable cost will more than likely increase as we're able to travel and see customers face-to-face.\nAs we've done in the past, our leaders will be focused on growing profitability.\nRegarding contingents, we are anticipating them to be relatively flat or maybe down slightly in 2021.\nAs it pertains to taxes, we expect our effective tax rate for 2021 to be in the range of 23% to 24%.\nThis does not take into consideration any potential changes in the federal tax rates that are being discussed by the new administration.\nFor interest expense, we're anticipating a $7 million to $9 million increase as compared to 2020 driven by the new bonds we issued in September of 2020.\nFrom a capital perspective, we are expecting our capex to decrease in 2021 to approximately $40 million to $45 million as we have substantially completed the development of our new Daytona Beach campus.\nIn my opening comments, I mentioned there are still a few items that need to be resolved over the coming quarters.\nWe will watch closely the successful rollout of the vaccine and additional stimulus to help those in need.\nBoth of these items will influence the pace of economic recovery over the coming quarters.\nFrom a rate perspective, we expect increases for the first six months of '21 to be similar to those seen in '20.\nUltimately, the rating -- the rate of increases will be driven by losses sustained in 2020 from the record setting number of tropical storms in the millions of acres that were burned.\nThe question remains for how much longer and at what pace the rates need to achieve the targeted returns.\nWe think the market is getting near an inflection point over the coming year for certain lines and will drive some rate moderation.\nThe acquisition pace seems to be active as ever and competition between private equity and long-term strategics remains.\nWe continue to believe the aggressive pricing for deals by PE will not abate any time soon.\nHowever, we're well positioned with our low leverage and the capital on our balance sheet, as well as access to additional capital to fund our M&A activity.\nOur pipeline remains good and we will keep our disciplined approach to M&A as it's proven to be very successful.\nBut as you know, we don't count anything until it's closed.\nFinally, technology innovation continue to be at the forefront regarding creation of new products and enhancing the experience of our customers.\nWe will continue to digitize our data, automate and prioritize technology investments around the following: optimizing and enhancing our data and analytics program; expanding our digital delivery capabilities around products and services; and engaging in initiatives designed to drive greater efficiency and velocity through our underlying processes.\nAs we deliver on these goals, we will see new opportunities for growth that will serve our customers even better.\nWe had a great 2020 on many fronts and have good momentum heading into '21.\nI am extremely proud of how our team has served our customers through extremely challenging times.\nWe have a great team and a highly diversified business, both that performed very well in the past and we expect they will in the future.\nUltimately, our financial performance is only possible through the combined efforts of our nearly 11,000 teammates and our commitment to serve our customers.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These statements are subject to change due to new information or future events.\nFor the first time in our history, Assured Guaranty's adjusted book value has surpassed $100 per share and both shareholders' equity per share and adjusted operating shareholders' equity per share were also new records.\nWe achieved this milestone while producing our best direct new business insurance production for second quarter since the acquisition of AGM in July of 2009.\nOur financial guaranty, guaranty PVP of $96 million was 71% higher than in last year's second quarter.\nOur success reflects the tremendous work we did over several years to prepare for the unexpected.\nOur people were extremely effective, operating 100% remotely in unprecedented economic and market conditions.\nWe had the technology, processes, and training in place to help us excel during this pandemic and we did excel, proving again not only the competence and dedication of our employees, but also the resilience of our business model and the benefits of our value proposition.\nWith the virus creating market and economic uncertainty, bond yields had increased by the beginning of the quarter and credit spreads widened.\nInvestors turned more of their attention to credit quality for which our financial guaranty insurance is a solution and also to ratings durability, trading value stability and market liquidity, to all of which our product tends to add value.\nThe result has manifested in heightened demand for bond insurance.\nAs a result, we saw the best second quarter and first half direct U.S. public finance production in more than a decade, driving direct PVP of $60 million and $89 million, respectively.\nAnd I can tell you that with our July municipal insured par volume exceeding $2 billion, the surge in demand for our guaranty has not let up.\nAt the industry level, more than $9.1 billion of U.S. public finance primary market par was sold with bond insurance in the second quarter, the most for any quarter since mid-2009 and industry insurance penetration reached 8.7% of total new issue par sold, the highest quarterly level since 2009.\nSix months industry insured volume is 43% higher than in the first six months of 2019.\nIn this strengthened municipal bond insurance market, Assured Guaranty was selected to ensure 63% of the insured new issue par sold in the second quarter.\nCompared with the second quarter of last year, Assured Guaranty's primary market production was up 58% to $5.8 billion in insured par sold and up 22% to 318 new issue in transaction count.\nHe heightened par volume was partly driven by large transactions, but we continue to be the insurer of choice.\nWe insured large tax exempt and taxable deals across a variety of sectors and underlying rating categories, including, for example, A healthcare issues and AA general obligations.\nWe guaranteed 11 transactions of over $100 million in insured par during the quarter, the largest of which was a $385 million school district transaction with the dormitory authority of the state of New York, rated double AA3 by Moody's and AA minus by Fitch.\nThe high value that investors place in our guaranty was visible among credits with underlying S&P or Moody's ratings in the AA category, where we insured more than $1 billion of primary market par in the second quarter.\nWe are also seeing heightened demand for our secondary market insurance.\nDuring the second quarter, we insured $533 million of secondary market par compared with $233 million for the first quarter of the year and $327 million for the second quarter of 2019.\nIn aggregate for the primary and secondary markets, Assured Guaranty provided insurance on $6.3 billion of municipal bonds, 58% more than in last year's second quarter.\nAlthough by quarter end, municipal yields have trended close to historic lows seen in March, credit spreads generally remain wider than the pre-pandemic levels and that is one reason along with very strong issuance volume for the successful performance we are seeing.\nWe also had a great second quarter in our international infrastructure business, where we generated $28 million of direct PVP, over 3 times last year's second quarter PVP and the second highest quarterly direct PVP in the sector, since before the Great Recession.\nNotable transactions included our third solar bond wrap in Spain, the modification of terms of existing investment grade insured transaction to provide additional flexibility to the issuer and a secondary market guarantee to a European financial institution for a public sector credit.\nThe impact of COVID-19 has been mix for the international business.\nOn one hand, fewer transactions are coming to especially in transport and social infrastructure.\nAnd some transactions in our pipeline have been delayed though nine have been canceled.\nOn the other hand, credit spreads widen materially have not fully return to the previous tighter levels, which increases the value of our guarantees.\nAlso, we continue to see an increased variety of incoming new transaction inquiries, some of which are a direct result of COVID related investor concerns.\nOur global structured finance business also performed well in the second quarter contributing $8 million of PVP from a variety of transactions, including an insurance securitization and two whole business securitizations.\nThe pandemic has slowed both asset backed issuance and the progress in some of our transactions and development, but it has also widened credit spreads and created new opportunities.\nWe are seeing an increased number of investors led opportunities relating to portfolios of corporate credit exposure.\nOn our last call, I explained in detail our insured portfolio is in good shape to weather this economic disruption.\nWe have continued our due diligence and reached out to almost all the obligors we identified in the vulnerable section to learn how they plan to manage their resources.\nBased on our research and the additional information provided by obligors, we continue to expect no material pandemic related liquidity claims.\nTo-date, we have not been asked by any financial guarantee claims that we attribute to COVID-19 pandemic.\nFor below investment grade insured obligations, which we have identified is already under stress, we have updated assumptions to take into account the added stress of the pandemic.\nWe continue to believe that for the remainder of the portfolio, the 96% of par exposure that is investment grade, there should be no material losses caused by the pandemic.\nIn any case, as I said before, we have proven the resilience of our business model.\nFor example from 2008 through second quarter 2020, we paid $11 billion in gross claims, $5 billion in net and returned more than $4.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nYet our claim paying resources were virtually the same at the end of the period compared with the beginning.\nMeanwhile, we have dramatically reduced our par -- total par exposure and cut our insured leverage by more than half, measured by a variety of ratios.\nWe are in better shape today than before the Great Recession.\nI hope you will take a look at two -- at the two reports S&P published since the pandemic began.\nI mentioned one on our last call, S&P's April 3rd report on the bond insurance industry.\nThe second was S&P's annual review of Assured Guaranty that came out on July 16th.\nThe common theme of these reports was that, notwithstanding the current macroeconomic environment.\nS&P assess the risk profile to be low for both the bond insurers as an industry and for Assured Guaranty, a very positive conclusion.\nS&P affirmed the ratings of all of our business units -- of all of our insurance units at AA with a stable outlook in June.\nIn the annual review that followed S&P reiterated how our strong capital position, exceptional liquidity and proven business model support our financial strength rating.\nAdditionally, S&P recognized the increased demand for Assured Guaranty's products since the spread of COVID-19.\nWriting that investors flight to quality and wider credit spreads should continue to provide us with primary and secondary market underwriting opportunities.\nIn U.S. public finance it attribute the strong secondary market demand we've experienced to institutional investors finding the economics of bond insurance appealing as a tool for risk mitigation.\nIn the same report S&P said it ran a COVID-19 sensitivity stress test and even under the increased loss assumptions in that scenario our capital adequacy assessment would still be excellent, S&P also described our financial risk profile is very strong and wrote that during periods of economic stress, our insured exposures outperforms relative to the market segments in which we underwrite, due to our underwriting and risk management guideline.\nS&P does not published a figure for our excess capital under their AAA depression stress model.\nWe estimate that we have $2.6 billion of capital in excess of S&P's AAA requirement as of year-end 2019.\nAnd this incorporates the impact of our capital management program, the acquisition of BlueMountain, our elimination of an excess of loss credit facility and the continued payment of Puerto Rico debt service claims.\nAnother report I was reading was issued by Kroll Bond Rating Agency on July 30th.\nThey provided a detailed discussion of the recent increased activity in demand for bond insurance.\nIn the report, KBRA also makes a positive observation that it believes the pandemic should remain largely a liquidity event for bond insurers, with the exception of Puerto Rico.\nOn the subject of Puerto Rico, we continue to pursue a consensual resolution of the situation, while defending our rights in the Title III bankruptcies.\nCOVID-19 and the pending gubernatorial election may be slowing progress somewhat.\nIn recent news, PREPA hired a private U.S. Canadian consortium to operate its electricity transmission and distribution system.\nThis appears on the face to be a step in the right direction, but the essential step to restore and improve the power system is to complete the restructuring support agreement that all appropriate parties have agreed to.\nWe agree with the Oversight Board that quote as long as PREPA remains in Title III, the utility will not have an effective access to capital markets to fund the critical grid modernization and improvement plans.\nTitle III Court refused the lift to stay on our ability to assert our property rights with respect to Highways and Transportation Authority Revenue bonds.\nWe will appeal this ruling.\nAt least two members of the Oversight Board announced their immediate resignations -- imminent resignation and all members are subject to replacement or renomination.\nWe hope congressional leadership and the President choose Board members more familiar with municipal government and finance.\nLastly, supply chain management has become a significant issue on Capitol Hill, creating an opportunity for legislation that could allow the country to take full advantage of Puerto Rico's long history and well-established capabilities in the production of pharmaceuticals, medical supply to medical devices.\nThis would have solved the current public health crisis and improve the nation's security and preparedness for the future.\nWhile at the same time revive a key portion of the island's manufacturing base and provide impetus to its economic recovery.\nComing from the financial guaranty business to asset management, Assured Investment Management benefited from a strong rally in the credit markets during the second quarter and profitably monetize CLO debt tranches.\nWith CLO, issuance gaining steam, we acquired newly issued investment grade CLOs and in June Assured Management and Investment Management priced its first CLO issuance since the market dislocation.\nFor the current market environment as delay the realization of this business lines potential for the short-term, we remain confident in its diversification strategy.\nYesterday we announced an important change within the leadership of our Asset Management business.\nAndrew Feldstein, Chief Investment Officer and Head of the Asset management has decided to leave the company.\nDavid Buzen, BlueMountain's Deputy Chief Investment Officer will assume Andrew's responsibility as CEO and CIO of BlueMountain and Head of Asset Management and CIO at Assured Guaranty.\nAndrew will continue to serve on the boards of BlueMountain funds and to support a smooth transition.\nHe'll remain with the company as Senior Advisor to David through the end of October 2020.\nWe are confident in the long-term prospects of our Asset Management business under the leadership David Buzen and the talented senior management team.\nI want to emphasize that this leadership transition reflects no change in Assured Guaranty's strategy with respect to Assured Investment Management.\nWe continue to support the growth of the business and have allocated $1 billion of our investment portfolio to investment it manages, with the goal of generating even greater value for our investors and policyholder.\nI look forward to seeing our Asset Management business, making a significant contribution to the value of Assured Guaranty and I am certain Dave is the right person to lead this effort.\nHe was lead executive in our acquisition of BlueMountain and has been involved in every aspect of our Asset Management strategy and operations.\nHe is a consummate financial professional, who has served in top executive roles at a number of financial companies.\nAs we worked with David for a long time has over 30 years of experience includes senior positions at ACE Financial Solutions, which required Capital Re when David was its CFO and which is a company we now know as Assured Guaranty Corp.\nWe are in the middle of a unique year, in which a previously unknown disease has effective means of people, caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and disrupted economies worldwide.\nCongress, the administration and the Fed have taken action to provide money to people in need, inject monetary liquidity of businesses survive and support Capital market.\nState and local governments are tackling the challenges of providing essential services, administering social programs and meeting financial obligations and made sharp reductions in revenues.\nThey deserve additional direct federal assistance to provide -- to prevent large scale lay-offs of government employees and a potential cascade of economic hardships.\nWe've been impressed by the determination of our insured issuers, public officials to maintain essential services, while recognizing imperative to meet debt obligations to preserve their access to the capital market.\nAs a company, Assured Guaranty is better positioned than most to thrive in this environment.\nBy definition, our main product is designed to confident investors when the future is uncertain.\nCredit conscious investors have driven increased demand for our guaranty, giving issuers a way to reduce the cost of financing when they most need to do so.\nWe have abundant capital liquidity, supporting a 96% investment grade insured portfolio, consisting of transactions carefully selected to perform better under economic stress than others in their respective sectors.\nWith our ability as a guarantor to work with issuers facing short-term liquidity problems, or requesting reasonable amendments or waivers, we can help them in very serious financial trouble and we have now clearly demonstrated that we can be highly productive, while prioritizing the safety of our employees and clients.\nI'm very pleased with our results and progress on our strategic initiative this quarter.\nDespite the continued market turmoil, our business model proved resilient, we made significant progress in all three areas of our strategic focus.\nIn our Insurance segment, we had strong new business development, which is replenishing our unearned premium reserve and offsetting the scheduled amortization of the existing book of business.\nIn the Asset Management segment, we launched a new liquid asset strategy and restarted CLO issuance toward the end of the second quarter.\nIn terms of capital management, we are ahead of our plan, relative to the number of shares repurchased, which helped us to propel our adjusted book value per share to over $100, a record high.\nTurning to second quarter 2020, adjusted operating income was strong coming in at $190 million or $1.36 per share.\nThis consists of $154 million of income from our Insurance segment, a $9 million loss from our Asset Management segment and a $26 million loss from our Corporate division, which is where we reflect our holding company interest and other corporate expenses.\nStarting with the Insurance segment, adjusted operating income was $154 million compared to $161 million in the second quarter of 2019.\nNet earned premiums and credit derivative revenues in the second quarter 2020 were $125 million compared with $127 million in the second quarter of 2019.\nStructured finance net earned premiums and credit-driven revenues decreased to total of $13 million, due to the decline in this portfolio.\nOn the other hand, public finance net earned premiums increased in the second quarter 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019, due to higher accelerations as well as a modest increase in scheduled net earned premiums, which is a result of increased premium writings in the last few quarters.\nIn total, accelerations due to refundings and terminations were $32 million in the second quarter 2020 compared with $29 million in the second quarter of 2019.\nAlso contributing to our increasing unearned premiums reserve was the reassumption of a previously ceded book of business from our largest reinsurer.\nThis reassumption resulted in the $30 million -- $38 million commutation gain.\nNet investment income for the Insurance segment was $82 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared with $110 million in the second quarter of 2019.\nThe decrease was primarily due to a large non-recurring benefit in 2019 from the favorable settlement of a troubled insurance transaction, that decreased the size of the loss mitigation portfolio.\nProceeds from the settlement were reinvested in lower yielding assets.\nThe average balance of the externally managed portfolio also declined, in part, because of a shift into alternative investments, including Assured Investment Management funds, which recorded at fair value in a separate line item, as opposed to net investment income.\nSecond quarter 2020 Insurance segment adjusted operating income also includes a $21 million after-tax mark-to-market gain on our investments in Assured Investment Management funds.\nThese investments are mark-to-market each reporting period with changes in the fair value recorded as a component of adjusted operating income in the line item equity and earnings of investees.\nThe fair value gains on the investments in Assured Investment Management funds in the second quarter of 2020 were driven by the overall market rebound.\nAs of June 30, 2020, the insurance companies had authorization to invest up to $500 million in funds managed by Assured Investment Management, of which $354 million have been invested as of June 30, 2020.\nGoing forward, we expect adjusted operating income will be subject to more volatility than in the past, as we shift investments from fixed income securities.\nOur long-term view of the enhanced return from the Assured Investment Management funds remains positive.\nLoss expense in the Insurance segment was $39 million in the second quarter of 2020 and was primarily related to economic loss development on certain Puerto Rico exposures.\nIn the second quarter of 2019, we recorded a benefit of $50 million primarily related to higher projected recoveries for previously charged up loans for second lien U.S. RMBS.\nAn increase in excess spread, improved performance and loss mitigation efforts offset in part by economic loss development on certain Puerto Rico exposures.\nThe net economic development in the second quarter 2020 was $34 million, which primarily consisted of loss development of $30 million in the U.S. public finance sector, primarily attributable to Puerto Rico exposures.\nNet economic loss development in U.S. RMBS of $1 million mainly consisted of increased delinquencies, offset by higher projected excess spread across both third and second lien transactions.\nIn the Asset Management segment, adjusted operating income was a loss of $9 million.\nWe had previously announced our strategy to transition the investment focus and business model of our Assured Investment Management platform core strategies, including the orderly wind down of certain hedge funds and legacy opportunity funds.\nPrior to the current market disruptions, we had made good progress on the winding down of legacy funds, with outflows of $541 million in the second quarter.\nWe expect the restructuring to continue throughout 2020, but depending on the duration and market impact of the pandemic, the execution of our strategy may take longer than originally anticipated.\nToward the end of the second quarter 2020, we launched a new liquid asset strategy, with initial funds focused on investments in municipal securities.\nIn addition, in second quarter of 2020, AGM, AGC and MAC entered into investment management agreement, with Assured Investment Management to manage a portfolio of their general account municipal obligations and CLOs.\nAs of June 30, 2020, the insurance subsidiaries have together allocated $250 million to the municipal obligation strategies and $100 million to CLO strategies, with authorization to allocate an additional $200 million to CLO strategies.\nWe believe the effect of the pandemic on market conditions and increased volatility may present attractive opportunities for the alternative asset management industry that Assured Investment Management may be able to capitalize on.\nAnd so our long-term outlook for the asset management platform remains positive.\nIn our Corporate division, the holding companies currently have cash and investment available for liquidity needs in capital management activities of approximately $70 million, of which $80 million resides in AGL.\nAdjusted operating loss for the Corporate division was a loss of $26 million in both second quarter 2020 and second quarter 2019.\nThis mainly consists of interest expense on the U.S. holding companies, public long-term debt and intercompany to the insurance companies, which were primarily used to fund the BlueMountain acquisition.\nIt also includes Board of Directors and other corporate expenses.\nOn a consolidated basis, the effective tax rate may fluctuate from period to period, based on the proportion of income in different tax jurisdictions.\nIn second quarter 2020, the effective tax rate was 14.2%, compared with 21% in the second quarter of 2019.\nTurning to our capital management strategy, in the second quarter of 2020, we repurchased 6 million shares for $164 million, for an average price of $27.49 per share.\nSince the end of the quarter, we have purchased an additional 800,000 shares for $90 million, bringing our year-to-date repurchases as of today to over 10 million shares.\nSince January 2013, our successful capital management program has returned $3.5 billion to shareholders, resulting in a 60% reduction in total shares outstanding.\nAs always future share repurchases are contingent on available free cash, our capital position and market conditions.\nThe cumulative effect of these repurchases was a benefit of approximately $23.56 per share in adjusted operating shareholders' equity and approximately $42.76 in adjusted book value per share, which helped drive these important metrics to new record highs of $71.34 in adjusted operating shareholders' equity per share and $104.63 of adjusted book value per share, which both represent record high.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:With me on the call are Dr. Jeffrey Graves, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Jagtar Narula, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Andrew Johnson, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer.\nActual results may differ materially.\nAt this time last year, we were seeing only the very beginning of what we all hoped would be a sustained recovery from the worst of the COVID pandemic.\nAt the same time, here at 3D Systems, we were in the midst of executing our four phased transformation journey.\nWe reorganized our company into two segments, Healthcare and Industrial Solutions.\nWe have restructured our organization to gain efficiencies.\nAnd we had announced the first of our divestitures of non-core assets.\nAs we speak to you today, a year later, these first three phases are complete.\nWe are now a company that's singularly focused on additive manufacturing with a lean nimble operating structure, global reach and breadth of metal, polymer and biological technologies that's unparalleled in the industry.\nThese attributes brought together through an intense focus on our customers' most demanding applications has proven to be a powerful driver of value creation as reflected clearly in our organic growth rates, our profitability and our operating cash performance, all of which we will recap for you in a few moments.\nWhile we're pleased with this performance, even more exciting is that we're now in the fourth and final stage of our transformation, namely, investing for growth.\nSince last quarter, we completed the last of our divestitures, retiring our debt and stockpiling over $500 million of cash on the balance sheet.\nWe subsequently announced two acquisitions that embody our strategic focus on growth, which is to invest in businesses that drive the adoption of additive manufacturing, solve customers' most complex application needs and generate high margin recurring revenue streams that are critical to sustain value creation.\nThe first of these acquisitions was Oqton, a unique software company that's emerged as a recognized leader in the creation of a new breed of intelligent, cloud-based manufacturing operating system.\nThe driver for this acquisition is very simple; customers across our Industrial and Healthcare segments are now anxious to accelerate their adoption of additive manufacturing in full scale production environments.\nBut in doing so, they're facing significant challenges and how to incorporate these technologies into their existing enterprise systems.\nTo-date, they relied heavily on spreadsheets and highly skilled engineers to run production applications.\nThis is obviously too slow, too inefficient and too expensive to scale as production volumes ramp up.\nWhile we and others have made strides in optimizing and to some extent automating the performance of single printer or even a collection of like-kind printers working in parallel, our customers' challenges extend well beyond this.\nWhat they need is a manufacturing system that can easily and intelligently incorporate a mixed fleet of printers, often from a variety of manufacturers, and in addition, one that will incorporate all of the surrounding digital production systems on the shop floor such as post-print thermal and mechanical processing, robotic motion systems and automated inspection systems.\nOqton not only provides this linkage, it goes a step further in applying cloud-based AI to optimize the entire workflow then links this workflow to the customers' existing enterprise software such as those provided by Salesforce, Oracle, Microsoft or SAP.\nThe end result is that Oqton not only links, optimizes and tracks the customers' unique operational workflow at an individual component level from raw material to finished in respected parts, but it also builds in future flexibility to substitute new printing, finishing and automation technologies that will undoubtedly be introduced in the years ahead.\nThese attributes which are unique to the Oqton platform will remove a significant barrier to the large-scale adoption of additive manufacturing and production environments.\nAnd for that reason, we've opened the system to the entire industry, which we hope will accelerate market growth for everyone.\nIn addition, for the first time in our history, we will now make available our full complement of market-leading metal and polymer printing software platforms to all others in the industry, which we hope will accelerate the introduction of new printing technologies to customers around the world.\nImportantly, as with all software platforms, the span in entire industry, we are committed to Oqton continuing to operate in this model of independence with a supreme commitment to customer data protection and confidentiality.\nI'm happy to tell you that we closed the Oqton acquisition on November 1, and the reception by our customers and partners alike has been very positive.\nBefore I move to our most recent and incredibly exciting acquisition, let me step back and explain how we look at our company holistically, which I believe is much different than others in this industry.\nIn the decade since 3D printing was invented, we and our competitors have routinely defined ourselves as hardware and material developers, with our products sold broadly to customers around the world.\nWhile this is natural when any industry is young and when the product is mainly consumed in small quantities by labs or prototype facilities, as the industry now matures and production environments are targeted, successful companies will need to adapt their entire operating model to reflect their deepening integration with specific markets and customers.\nIf you don't, you will remain simply a vendor and not a true partner to your customers, which will ultimately be reflected in your organic growth rate and profit margins.\nSo with this in mind, at 3D Systems, beginning a year ago, we changed the way we defined ourselves by reorganizing our entire company around key markets, and within those markets, key vertical segments that we believe will drive the most value from their adoption of additive manufacturing.\nWe began with the creation of two business segments, Healthcare and Industrial Solutions.\nUsing a strong application focus, these two businesses each integrate our printer, material and software technologies in unique combinations to solve the customers' product need.\nOnce complete, our customers can then ask us to scale the process for them to a certain production level.\nAnd then with increasing demand, they can elect to have us enable a manufacturer of their choosing to continue scaling to high volumes.\nThis transfer of the workflow involves providing printing systems, materials and software along with the process definition.\nIt results in a seamless transfer of capability to the chosen manufacturer whether it's the OEM themselves or a contract manufacturer of their choosing.\nSo fast forwarding to this year, with the acquisition of Oqton, we expanded our software capabilities into what we call broadly digital manufacturing software, which as we described earlier, enables a rapid and efficient adoption of additive manufacturing in high volume production environments.\nThis operating model has been very well received by our customer base and we expect it to fuel exciting organic growth in the years ahead.\nMost recently, we've added a strong biotech organizational focus and invested significantly to bring our emerging biological technologies to laboratory and human applications, details of which we'll cover in a few moments.\nSo in short, these are our five core market segments that you'll hear us talk about moving forward.\nWhile each of the five will adapt to the needs of their customers, each will also leverage our core technologies of hardware, software and materials in the unique manner needed to fulfill their customer application needs.\nLet me illustrate this approach using our Healthcare business as an example.\nIn the mid-1990s, 3D Systems pioneered Medical Modeling, which is the printing of highly detailed anatomical models from digital images.\nThese models have proven instrumental in support of complex surgical procedures.\nIn a highly publicized application of our modeling technology, which was beautifully documented by CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, we created a number of medical models to assist in the separation of conjoined twins, Jadon and Anias McDonald who were born with the extremely rare craniopagus condition, in which twins are joined at the head, sharing not only the skull and vasculature, but portions of the brain itself.\nThe modeling used for the surgical planning was vital to the success of Dr. James Goodrich and his team that they had in separating the twins, both of which are alive and living independently today many years later.\nTo date, our medical modeling technology has supported dozens of similarly complex operations around the world, along with hundreds of others, and it continues to expand each year.\nBuilding upon this foundation and investing in point-of-care infrastructure that accompany this growth, we deepened our surgical support over the next decade.\nAnd by 2005, we were working with surgeons to design and manufacture customized patient-specific surgical guides and instruments using 3D printing.\nAs this portion of the business in turn grew, we expanded our scope once again, this time to include actual patient-specific implants, which offered an even larger market opportunity.\nFast forwarding today, we offer the broadest range of FDA-cleared capabilities for modeling surgical planning and patient-specific medical implants, which inspires our customers to continue expanding their partnership with us year-after-year.\nWhile we're very proud of our progress by now redefining ourselves as a healthcare business in this example and leveraging both our critical infrastructure and channel partner relationships, we can broaden our scope more aggressively to now include other parts of the human skeleton structure, and importantly, to advance these applications in parallel instead of in series as we have in the past.\nThis provides us the opportunity to bring benefits to a much larger patient population and at a much higher rate than ever before.\nThis is the power of redefining ourselves as a healthcare business and not simply a provider of printing technology to healthcare customers in the market.\nOf note, our Healthcare business grew over 28% in our most recent quarter and over 44% on an organic basis, which is where we disregard the businesses that we have divested.\nThis remarkable growth rate is a testament to our increasing momentum in this exciting market.\nSo building upon this discussion of our Healthcare business, I would like to end my commentary for today on the remarkable emerging market of bioprinting in our announcement last week of our acquisition of Volumetric Biotechnologies.\nThis company, under the inspired leadership of Dr. Jordan Miller, brings specific expertise and biomaterials and regenerative medicine that combine synthetic chemistry, 3D printing, microfabrication and molecular imaging to direct culture human cells to form more organized complex organizations of living vessels and tissues.\n3D Systems has been a pioneer in our industry by focusing resources on regenerative medicine since 2017.\nAnd we began a joint development program with United Therapeutics Corporation to develop the capability to print scaffolds for human lungs using a process we call printer profusion.\nOnce developed, this bioprinting technology can be applied to other major organs in the human body as well as a wide range of other human and laboratory applications.\nWe've made significant strides in this unique technology.\nAnd as a result, we recently announced an expansion of our development program with United Therapeutics, an expansion that includes increased funding and an extension to two additional organs.\nThis program expansion reflects the progress that our joint team has made in this groundbreaking endeavor.\nBy acquiring Volumetric, we're adding critical skill sets to our 3D Systems' team, which we feel are a perfect complement to ours, bringing strong biological expertise and cellular engineering skills along with highly creative bioprinting systems to our development group.\nAs I realize this is an entirely new area for many that have followed our company for some time, let me quickly recap our regenerative medicine strategy and the market opportunities that we're addressing through our unique bioprinting technology.\nThe first opportunity is the printing of human organs, beginning with the lung and expanding from there to two additional organs.\nWe're pursuing this as a joint program with our partner United Therapeutics.\nThe ambitious goals that we've set for this program are driving quantum advances in our technology and laying the foundation for the rest of our regenerative medicine efforts.\nIn our second regenerative medicine market opportunity, we're taking the core unique disruptive technologies developed for the bioprinting of human organs and applying it to other parts of the human body.\nThere are tremendous number of these applications ranging from the printing of human skin for burn victims to soft tissue for breast reconstruction and repair to critical blood vessel and bone replacements and many, many more.\nWe're now forming partnerships focused on each application area where we can combine our bioprinting expertise with the appropriate application experts to provide unique and highly impactful solutions for people in need.\nWe refer to this second market vertical within regenerative medicine as human non-organ bioprinting.\nOur last but certainly not least market opportunity is to extend our bioprinting technologies into research labs, providing advanced printing systems and unique biological materials to those that study the basic science of regenerative medicine and in the pharmaceutical laboratories where the ability to print high precision, three dimensional vascularize cell structures can be used for the development of new, more effective drug therapies.\nOur acquisition of Volumetric and their unique capabilities in combination with our own will allow us to expand the pace of our efforts in all three of our regenerative medicine markets.\nIt amazes me to think of these revolutionary applications enabled by our 3D printing technologies; applications that we are uniquely positioned to deliver with our extensive history in advanced 3D printing technologies, our material expertise, our application development expertise, our deep understanding of FDA and other regulatory processes and now our biological and cellular engineering capabilities.\nWe believe that in the years to come, bioprinting will take its place as a very significant business for our company, bringing critical relief to patients in need of life-saving procedures and great value to our company's employees and our shareholders alike.\nMoving from our strategic growth investments to our most recent quarterly performance, I'm very pleased to say that we've continued to execute well on our core business.\nWith continuing strong demand, our operational challenges have largely centered around global supply chain and logistics issues, which are unfortunately continuing to plague most companies around the world.\nOur solid execution in the face of these challenges in the third quarter resulted in strong double-digit growth with revenues increasing by 15% before adjusting for divestitures.\nWhen these adjustments are made, which is a much better reflection of our core business performance, revenues were up over 36% versus 2020 and up over 20% versus our pre-pandemic 2019 third quarter, a benchmark we consider very important.\nLooking at our major business segments, our Industrial Solutions segment is continuing its rebound, seeing strong performance particularly in jewelry, automotive and transportation and general manufacturing.\nIn Healthcare, we see continuing strong demand for personalized health services as well as solid performance in dental.\nAs Jagtar will discuss shortly, in addition to the strong revenue performance, our EBITDA climbed by over 125%.\nWe generated positive cash from operations for the fourth consecutive quarter, the first time this has happened in four years.\nWith our cash generation in addition with the proceeds from divestitures, we built a sizable cash balance by the end of Q3.\nA portion of these funds will be used to fund the strategic growth initiatives I mentioned earlier, but we will still have be left with a significant amount of liquidity to pursue additional opportunities.\nAs I'm sure is clear to everyone, I am very excited not only about what we've accomplished this last year, but even more so about the future as our focus on growth in this final stage of our transformation has only just begun.\nFor the third quarter, we reported revenue of $156.1 million, an increase of 14.6% compared to the third quarter of 2020.\nOur organic revenue growth, which excludes divestitures completed in 2020 and 2021, was 35.9% in Q3 2021 versus Q3 2020.\nSince the third quarter of 2020 was beginning of the economic reopening from the COVID-related shutdowns, we think it is valuable to compare our results to Q3 2019, which was untainted by the pandemic.\nAgain, excluding divested businesses, we are comparing on an apples-to-apples basis.\nOur revenue in the third quarter 2021 was 21.2% higher than pre-pandemic Q3 2019.\nAs we have discussed previously, with the completion of our Simbionix and on-demand manufacturing divestitures in Q3 2021, we have completed our planned divestitures and are now focused on the performance, growth and investment of our core additive manufacturing business.\nI would like to note that our -- at post-divestitures, we continue to generate nearly two-thirds of our revenue from our recurring revenue streams.\nThese high margin lines of business highlight the strength and diversity of our core business, our ability to weather various economic cycles and around which we will continue to make strategic investments.\nWe reported GAAP net income of $2.34 per share in the third quarter of 2021 compared to a GAAP loss of $0.61 in the third quarter of 2020.\nThe year-over-year improvement was driven by gains on divested businesses as well as the goodwill impairment charge we took in the third quarter of 2020.\nFor our non-GAAP results, we reported non-GAAP income of $0.08 per share in the third quarter of 2021 compared to a non-GAAP loss of $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2020.\nThe year-over-year improvement reflects higher revenue with lower non-GAAP operating expense as a result of the cost actions we took last year.\nNow I will discuss revenue by market.\nHealthcare grew 28.3% year-over-year and decreased 7.8% compared to the last quarter.\nThe decrease was primarily a result of the divestiture of the Simbionix medical simulation business during the quarter.\nAdjusted for divestitures, Healthcare revenue increased 44.5% year-over-year as a result of strong demand for dental applications in both printers and materials.\nIn fact, the last four quarters have seen the highest level ever of dental material sales as compared to any prior four quarter period.\nOur Industrial segment generated revenue growth of 4% to $79.7 million compared to the same period last year and was flat to last quarter, reflecting the divestiture of the on-demand manufacturing parts business during the quarter.\nAdjusted for divestitures, Industrial revenue increased 28.1% year-over-year and 2.1% over the last quarter.\nThe increase was driven by higher demand in both printers and materials in a variety of sub-segments, most notably, jewelry, automotive and transportation and general manufacturing.\nNow we turn to gross margin.\nWe reported gross profit margin of 41.2% in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 43.1% in the third quarter of 2020.\nNon-GAAP gross profit margin was 41.5% compared to 43.2% in the same period last year.\nGross profit margin decreased primarily as a result of businesses divested in 2020 and 2021.\nIf we exclude the impact of those divestitures, gross profit -- gross margins increased 80 basis points in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the same period last year, driven by 2020 cost actions and the higher revenue, which resulted in better capacity utilization.\nAs evidenced by our strong performance this year, demand continues to be strong for both our -- for our products in both business segments.\nThe biggest challenge we've faced isn't unique to 3D Systems.\nWe are all aware of the supply chain issues that are affecting everyone, from multinational corporations to small businesses to individuals on Main Street.\nIn fact, our Q3 revenue, while strong, was impacted by supply limitations of certain products.\nConsistent with last quarter, we continue to see a tightening of cost and availability for certain components that go into our product.\nOur team is doing a heroic job as it manages through these challenges.\nSupply chain and not end customer demand remains the key headwind in our business and is our strong focus as we finish out the year.\nWe have taken steps to mitigate the economic impact, such as adding alternative sources for key components where possible.\nWe have seen some cost impacts from the supply chain constraints, especially in increased freight charges and have instituted a temporary surcharge for our customers on certain types of purchases effective in the fourth quarter.\nYear-to-date, our non-GAAP gross profit margin was 42.6% and we expect full year gross profit margins to be between 41% and 43%.\nOperating expenses for the quarter were $81.5 million on a GAAP basis, a decrease of 35.4% compared to the third quarter of 2020.\nThis year-over-year decrease reflects a goodwill impairment booked in Q3 2020.\nOur non-GAAP operating expenses in the third quarter were $54.1 million, a decrease -- an 8% decrease from the third quarter of the prior year.\nCompared to the second quarter of 2021, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 2%, primarily driven by lower R&D spend.\nAdjusted EBITDA, defined as non-GAAP operating profit plus depreciation, was $16.3 million or 10.5% of revenue compared to $7.2 million or 5.3% of revenue in the third quarter 2020.\nOur disciplined approach to growth, cost management and focus on our core business is resulting in continued strong adjusted EBITDA.\nTurning to the cash flow statement and balance sheet.\nWe are pleased to show $502.8 million of cash on the balance sheet, an increase of $418.4 million since the beginning of the year.\nThe increase was primarily driven by proceeds from the divestitures of the on-demand parts business and our medical simulation business, but supported in no small part by our extremely strong cash generation from operations.\nDuring the quarter, we generated $20.7 million of cash from operations, marking the fourth straight quarter of positive cash from operations.\nThis is the first time in four years the company has achieved four straight quarters of positive operating cash flow and reflects a strong transformation of our business.\nNow that we have demonstrated consistent profitability and cash generation and post-divestiture $0.5 billion of cash on hand, we are in a prime position to continue growing the company by taking a disciplined approach to invest organic and inorganic solutions that will solve customers' complex needs, drive adoption of additive manufacturing and generate high margin recurring revenue streams.\nWe have previously announced some of those growth opportunities, namely our acquisitions of Oqton, which closed November 1 and Volumetric Biotechnologies, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter.\nThe cash considerations for these will total approximately $130 million, leaving roughly $370 million of cash.\nThese acquisitions will position the company for strong growth and are core to our strategies in both high margin software to enable the adoption of additive manufacturing as well as adoption of advanced 3D printing technologies in the field of regenerative medicine where we believe we will be a leader in the market.\nAs I conclude my remarks, I want to reflect on the past year.\nI joined the company at the beginning of the third quarter of 2020.\nAt that time, the company was just beginning its transformation.\nWe had just announced results for the second quarter of 2020 that included negative operating cash flow of $21 million for the first half of that year, cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet of only $64 million and $22 million of debt.\nNow fast forward to this year and the transformation we've been through.\nWe have generated over $60 million of operating cash this year for the third quarter and ended the quarter with over $500 million of cash and cash equivalents with no debt.\nWe are 100% focused on additive manufacturing and growing strongly in our core markets.\nWe are able to make smart and strategic investments to support our core business and are rapidly advancing our key technologies into new segments such as regenerative medicine.\nI continue to believe that we are uniquely positioned in our industry with a strong balance sheet growth, cash generation and a suite of technologies that continue to be in demand by our customers.\nFinally, we wanted to provide an update at our Investor Day event.\nYou may recall that we had scheduled an event for September 9 in the Denver, Colorado area.\nOut of the abundance of caution for the safety of our investors, analysts and employees, we postponed the planned Investor Day as COVID infection rates increased this past summer due to the Delta variant.\nWe are now seeing the hopeful signs of progress, with once again declining infection rate, rollout of booster shots and a newly announced pill that seems to offer promise of dramatically cutting the hospitalization rates from this infection.\nAs a result, we are in the early stages of planning an updated Investor Day with an aim for the first half of 2022.\nWe will provide an update as soon as possible and look forward to sharing our long-term growth strategy in more detail with the investment community.\nWell, Jagtar and I have covered the remarkable progress that we've made over the last year.\nWe've created value for our investors, our customers and our employees by remaking the business.\nOur growth and profitability distinguishes us in the industry and has made us a key partner for a growing number of organizations that are considering additive manufacturing.\nAt the same time, our transformation has also made us a more exceptional place to work to drive the future of additive manufacturing, and as a result, more talented individuals are becoming a part of the new 3D Systems each day.\nHowever, as much as we've accomplished this last year, it's more about the future.\nWe will continue to be a valuable solutions partner with customers and deeply integrate with them as they adopt our solutions and technologies.\nWe will also invest in our business and drive our solutions capabilities in the five key areas I spoke about earlier.\nI'm truly excited about the depth and breadth of technology we bring to our markets and application expertise.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm Rubun Dey, Head of Investor Relations, and with me to talk about our business and financial results are Horacio Rozanski, our President and CEO; and Lloyd Howell, Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer.\nDuring today's call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics, which we believe provide useful information for investors.\nWe include an explanation of adjustments and other reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our fourth quarter fiscal year 2021 slides.\nWe are now on Slide 5.\nThe past year was unlike any other in this Company's 107-year history.\nBut before diving into our latest results on our outlook for the current year, I want to highlight that the fiscal year end on March 31 also marked the close of the three-year period covered in our investment thesis.\nWhen we first shared our thesis in June of 2018, we committed to 50% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share over three years.\nWe said that growth would be driven by our unique position in the market and the combination of industry-leading organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, and robust capital deployment.\nWith our fiscal year 2021 results are now final, Booz Allen has significantly exceeded our three-year financial objectives.\nADEPS nearly doubled over the period to $3.90 in fiscal year 2021.\nAverage annual revenue growth was above the midpoint of the 6% to 9% range we originally provided.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin was above 10% in each of the three years and we deployed $1.3 billion in capital.\nThe majority of which was achieved through increased dividends and a robust share repurchase program.\nDuring the three-year period, we navigated through significant budget uncertainty, including the longest government shutdown we've ever experienced, a turbulent presidential transition period and a once-in-a-century pandemic.\nAnd throughout, we continued to invest in our people, especially when we set aside $100 million in response to the pandemic to support our employees and help the most vulnerable in our communities.\nAll the while we also continued to invest in our key technologies and develop elements of our option value portfolio.\nSo the story of the last three years is certainly of our outstanding financial performance.\nBut more importantly, as we look to the future, it is the basis for our optimistic outlook on the business.\nOver the last decade, we further differentiated Booz Allen's brand and market position to the point that today federal and commercial clients rely on us for advanced technology solutions that deliver both speed and mission scale.\nAnd our unique combination of consulting expertise, mission knowledge, innovation and technology serves as a strategic accelerator for both our firm and our clients.\nI've said many times, Booz Allen learns and evolves continuously.\nOur next strategy and long-term financial outlook, which we plan to share with you in the fall will build on Vision 2020's growth and transformation.\nWe are very comfortable with our direction of travel as we anticipate the opportunities of the next decade.\nThe most recent example of our confidence in our strategic direction is our agreement to acquire Liberty IT Solutions, LLC.\nAs we discussed when we announced it on May 4, this acquisition is directly on strategy.\nLiberty is an exceptional company with highly skilled talent, trusted client relationships, closeness to mission, a solid growth trajectory and digital transformation capabilities that augment Booz Allen's extensive set of offerings.\nThe transaction is expected to close in this quarter, subject to customary closing conditions.\nAnd we look forward to officially welcoming the Liberty team to the Booz Allen family.\nLloyd and I are proud of the team's performance in an unprecedented year on all metrics we have met or exceeded the updated guidance we provided at the end of January.\nFor the full-year, organic revenue growth was strong albeit slower than recent years due to the pandemic and some delays in funding and awards after the election.\nWe also delivered excellent bottom line results.\nFull-year earnings profit margins and cash flow are all ahead of expectations.\nAnd as the market began to stabilize post-transition, our team did a great job in capturing opportunities, driving a record book-to-bill in the fourth quarter and year-end backlog of $24 billion.\nUnderlying demand for our services and solutions remains robust, with our defense and civil businesses delivering excellent organic growth in fiscal year 2021, while the intelligence and global commercial continue to reshape their portfolios.\nLloyd will go into greater depth about market dynamics in a few minutes.\nNext, I am pleased to report that the Department of Justice has closed the criminal investigation that we first disclosed in June 2017.\nThe civil DOJ and SEC investigations remain pending, and we continue to cooperate with the government to bring those matters to an appropriate resolution.\nLet's shift now to how we are thinking about the business in the year ahead.\nAs we opened fiscal year 2022, we are very focused on a set of near- and mid-term priorities.\nFirst and foremost, to fully benefit from our strong backlog and demand pipeline, we need to accelerate our recruiting efforts.\nSecond, we must capitalize on the reshape portfolios in intelligence and commercial to drive growth in both businesses.\nThird, we will carefully manage the transition to a post-COVID environment by investing in our people and the advanced capabilities we need for the future.\nFourth, having launched our next-generation financial system on April 1, we are making strong progress and we'll keep focused on a seamless implementation.\nAnd fifth, upon close of the Liberty acquisition, we will work closely together on a smooth and successful integration.\nAs we look further out, we are also focused on positioning for growth beyond the current fiscal year.\nOur overriding goal is to accelerate into the next wave of changes in our markets.\nFor monetizing the option value portfolio, to investing in new areas like Low Code, 5G, AI, or quantum, to finalizing our strategic review.\nBooz Allen is committed to being a leader in ensuring our clients can scale new technologies into their missions faster than ever.\nTurning now specifically to our fiscal year 2022 outlook.\nLloyd will walk you through the guidance in a few minutes.\nBut I will note that the growth pattern will be different from recent years.\nThis is due to a number of factors from productivity and PTO trends, to the Liberty acquisition, and the timing of headcount gains.\nWe expect these factors together to produce a revenue profile with low-single-digit growth in the first half, followed by significant acceleration in the second half.\nWe plan to the full-year and as our guidance indicates, we expect another year of significant revenue growth in FY'22.\nContinued excellence in operational performance is also expected to produce strong EBITDA growth, continued cash generation and strategic capital deployment.\nSo to sum up, I am excited and optimistic about the coming year and beyond.\nOur clients have clear priorities and the ability to marshal resources toward them.\nWe have an exceptional team, an exceptional team tested and successful through good times and challenging ones.\nOur balance sheet is strong.\nOur unwavering commitment to people over the past year has bolstered our already strong brand in the market for talent.\nAnd all of us are committed to and focused on serving clients with excellence and living our purpose and our values.\nSo, while we may still see some choppiness and we have work to do on hiring in the coming months, I have tremendous confidence in our team's ability to deliver growth in the near- and the long-term.\nLet me start by echoing Horacio's comments on the close-out of our investment thesis.\nLast quarter marked the end of a three-year period with ADEPS growth of 96%, an increase that was primarily driven by strong organic revenue growth and sustained margin expansion.\nThis performance resulted from investments related to Vision 2020 and our early positioning in core areas of rising demand for our clients.\nBooz Allen has proven its ability to outperform competitors even in some of the toughest macro environments.\nMoving forward, we will keep a sharp focus on positioning Booz Allen for long-term success, building on the excellent performance of the last three years.\nAs we look back over the past year, we are proud of the resilience and dedication shown by our people in close collaboration with our clients.\nTheir excellent work resulted in another strong year of operational and financial performance.\nAs we begin fiscal year 2022 and anticipate moving toward a post-pandemic operating rhythm, we expect some choppiness, but we have clear operational focus areas.\nOur confidence in our continued success is grounded in our record of consistent performance and the strong foundation we have built to deliver on near- and long-term objectives.\nLet's turn to our fiscal year 2021 results.\nAt the top line, revenue increased 5.3% for the full-year to $7.9 billion.\nRevenue, excluding billable expenses, grew 7.1% to $5.5 billion.\nThis organic top line growth largely reflects strong execution on sustained demand for our services, helped by higher than normal staff utilization in the first half of the year.\nAs a reminder, in January, we adjusted our revenue guidance to a range of 4.8% to 6%, due to three factors: first, programmatic shifts in the presidential transition period; second, a snap back to more typical PTO usage; and third, lower expectations for billable expenses as a percentage of revenue, which landed in the low-end of our 29% to 31% range.\nThese factors played out in the fourth quarter as expected.\nLet me step through the market performance.\nRevenue growth for the full-year was led by our defense and civil businesses, which grew 9% and 8%, respectively.\nIn defense, growth slowed in the second half of the year due to the factors I noted earlier.\nHowever, underlying long-term demand for our services and solutions remained strong, as evidenced by recent business wins and continued tactical sales execution.\nGrowth in our civil business also slowed in the second half of the year.\nThis was largely related to a pause on a large cyber program due to funding availability, which occurred in the third quarter and continued into the fourth quarter.\nGiven the importance and criticality of this program for the client, we believe work will ramp up again in the coming quarters.\nRevenue from our intelligence business declined 3% for the full-year.\nOur focused effort to reshape that portfolio continues and we are pleased with the results so far.\nWe expect to see our intelligence business return to growth in this fiscal year as we ramp up recent contract wins.\nFurthermore, the pandemic-related headwind we faced in fiscal year 2021 and inability to bill for fee will continue to abate as more and more of our employees return to work at client facilities.\nLastly, revenue in global commercial, which accounted for approximately 3% of our total revenue in fiscal year 2021, declined 22% year-over-year.\nThe drop was primarily driven by our decision to exit from parts of our Middle East business due to market dynamics and geopolitical trends and to focus strategically on our US-based cyber business.\nWe are pleased with our excellent book-to-bill performance for the quarter and the full-year.\nBook to bill of 1.38 times was a fourth quarter record, resulting in a full-year book to bill of 1.42 times.\nTotal backlog grew 16%, yielding our largest-ever fiscal year-end backlog of $24 billion.\nFunded backlog grew 3% to $3.5 billion.\nUnfunded backlog grew 35% to $6.1 billion and priced options grew 13% to $14.4 billion.\nThroughout the year the team did a great job sustaining our historical win rates for recompete and new work, even as we navigated the pandemic and a presidential transition period.\nAs we've noted previously, we continue to augment our traditional foundation of diversified smaller awards by pursuing larger and more complex bids that, by their very nature, caused quarter-to-quarter volatility in book-to-bill.\nOur record backlog speaks to ongoing robust demand for our services, the quality of our people and our closeness to clients missions.\nPivoting to headcount, as of March 31, we had 27,727 employees, up by 554 year-over-year, or 2%.\nExcluding the impacts of our contract divestiture in the third quarter, headcount would have been up 2.4%.\nAs Horacio emphasized, we are focused on accelerating headcount growth to meet strong demand signals and execute our backlog.\nMoving to the bottom line.\nAdjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2021 was $840 million, up 11.4% from the previous year.\nThis increase was driven primarily by our top line growth, strong cost management and lower-than-expected billable expense mix and what was truly an anomalous year.\nAs a result, our adjusted EBITDA margin for the full-year was 10.7%.\nFull-year net income, diluted earnings per share and ADEPS also grew significantly.\nNet income increased 26% year-over-year to $109 million.\nAdjusted net income was $542 million, up 21% from the previous year.\nDiluted earnings per share increased 28% to $4.37 from $3.41 the year prior.\nAnd adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 23% to $3.90 from $3.18 the year prior.\nThese increases were primarily driven by strong operating performance, a lower effective tax rate and a lower share count in fiscal year 2021 due to our share repurchase program.\nRegarding our effective tax rate, during the fourth quarter, we recognized a tax benefit under the CARES Act that allowed tax loss carrybacks to prior tax years.\nAs a result, we recognized approximately $77 million in remeasurement tax benefit this quarter, which we excluded from adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share.\nTurning to cash, we put a plan in place three years ago to improve cash generation.\nWe are extremely proud of our team's performance this year, which we see as the culmination of this multi-year effort.\nWe generated $719 million in operating cash during fiscal year 2021, representing 30% growth over the previous year.\nThat put us above the top end of our forecasted range and we ended the year with $991 million of cash on hand.\nStrong cash performance was largely driven by collections growth in excess of revenue growth, higher cash taxes on the year were offset by relatively light disbursements related to operating in the COVID-19 environment.\nCapital expenditures for the year totaled $87 million, in line with our expectations as we continue to invest in infrastructure and technology to support virtual work.\nApril was a key month for us as we went live with our new NextGen Financial System.\nOur year-end reporting close went smoothly and we have not encountered any material issues to date.\nAs can be expected, we experienced a few minor issues, which were addressed promptly.\nWe have already been reaping the benefits in the form of increased data access and improved productivity.\nWe expect this to translate into cost savings over time, which will be reinvested to help drive future growth.\nI will touch on this topic again in our outlook for fiscal year 2022.\nIn fiscal year 2021, we continued to execute on a prudent capital allocation strategy designed to deliver both near- and long-term shareholder value.\nWe returned approximately $181 million to shareholders through quarterly dividends, which included a 19% year-over-year dividend increase in the fourth quarter.\nThis was the eighth consecutive fiscal year of double-digit growth in our quarterly dividend.\nWe also repurchased 4.1 million shares for $318 million during the fiscal year, with 2.3 million shares repurchased for $185 million in the fourth quarter.\nIn combination with our third quarter investment in Tracepoint, we deployed a total of $571 million in capital in fiscal year 2021.\nGoing forward, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, reinvesting in our business, securing our quarterly dividend, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases.\nToday, we are also announcing that our Board has approved a regular dividend of $0.37 per share payable on June 30 to stockholders of record on June 15.\nDividends remain an important component of our strategy to create value for shareholders.\nLastly, I want to briefly touch on our recently announced acquisition of Liberty IT Solutions.\nThis transaction, upon close, will be our largest acquisition to date and will be immediately accretive to revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margin, and adjusted diluted earnings per share.\nFor us, this transaction represents exactly what we look for in acquisitions, cultural, strategic and financial fit.\nAs we look ahead, we are focused on three objectives: first, a smooth and successful integration; second, continued hiring to help scale up Liberty's recent wins; and third, maintaining excellence in contract delivery.\nAs Horacio noted, we're excited about the acquisition and the long-term value it will create for our shareholders and the people of both Booz Allen and Liberty.\nWe look forward to sharing updates in the months to come.\nTurning to guidance, please move to Slide 9.\nFiscal year 2021 was certainly a year of unprecedented challenges for our people and clients.\nThis resulted in several puts and takes to our fiscal year 2021 financial results, which influence year-over-year comparisons as we move into fiscal year 2022.\nMost of these factors are temporary in nature.\nHowever, we expect them to constrain top line growth for the next couple of quarters before an acceleration into the back half of the fiscal year.\nLet me step through these factors.\nFirst, there is a natural ramp up that needs to occur in both execution of work on recently won contracts and on recruiting and hiring.\nAs Horacio noted, we're focused on both of those priorities.\nThey take time to ramp up, which creates a momentum build toward the back half of the year.\nSecond, we saw unusually high productivity in the first half of fiscal year 2021, driving up revenue growth then slowing growth in the second half as staff utilization and PTO trends normalized.\nThis dynamic will create challenging comps in the first half of fiscal year 2022.\nThird, we expect PTO trends to have an ongoing impact for the next few months.\nAlthough we executed a successful one-time PTO buyback program in the fourth quarter, we know that many of our employees still have elevated balances due to the pandemic.\nWith vaccinations increasing and some are on the way, we expect and have been encouraging our people to take well-deserved time off.\nLastly, our implementation of the new financial system will result in minor timing differences in the costing of labor.\nWe do not expect this dynamic to materially impact our full-year results.\nHowever, we do forecast approximately 50 basis points of revenue growth headwinds in each of our second and third quarters, recovered through a roughly 100 basis point tailwind in the fourth quarter.\nPutting it all together, we expect organic top line growth in the low-single-digit range in the first half of fiscal year 2022 with a significant ramp into the third and fourth quarters.\nFrom an EBITDA perspective, a return to more normal indirect spending patterns and billable expense mix post-pandemic will drive some volatility in our quarterly margin profile.\nNow, let me take you through our fiscal year 2022 guidance.\nWe expect total revenue to grow between 7% and 10%, which is inclusive of a partial year contribution from our announced Liberty acquisition, assuming a first quarter 2022 close.\nThe variance between the top and bottom end of our revenue growth outlook will largely depend on the successful execution and timing of our hiring and onboarding.\nWe expected adjusted EBITDA margin to remain in the mid-10% range.\nWe expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4.10 and $4.30.\nThis range reflects strong organic growth, incremental D&A expense related to our new financial system, a higher effective tax rate and $0.20 to $0.24 of anticipated accretion from our acquisition of Liberty IT.\nWe expect operating cash flow to be between $800 million and $850 million, largely driven by our operational performance, lower cash tax payments and contributions from Liberty IT.\nAnd finally, we expect capex to be between $80 million and $100 million as we continue to invest in infrastructure and technology.\nWe have once again demonstrated our ability to effectively manage the business, invest in our people and deliver strong returns to our shareholders.\nWe did all of this while weathering a tough macro environment, which gives us confidence in our strategy and positioning to succeed through any market condition.\nOperator, please open the lines.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:There have been countless attempts to summarize all that was 2020 and I won't add to those efforts here.\nSuffice it to say, 2020 was a year we are all glad to put behind us.\nHowever, it was not one we should hurry to forget.\nFor all the challenges 2020 brought, it ought to be defined instead by our response to those challenges and our determination in taking the steps needed to accomplish our objectives.\nThe organizational and strategic changes we have made, beginning in 2019 and throughout 2020, we've had a meaningful impact on our operations, and-or having a positive effect on our performance.\nYou'll hear some of the details of those improvements momentarily.\nAnd one obvious impact of those efforts has been to our top line.\nOur topline contracted in 2020 as we took a hard look at some of the businesses we'd written in recent years.\nHowever, this does not mean we don't intend to grow.\nWe do intend to grow.\nWe just want to make sure we're doing it profitably.\nThe recent dip in our top line is a result of that strategy.\nThough the loss environment is challenging at this stage of the cycle, we're not hunkering down to weather the storm, rather we are taking a moment to consult the map before moving through it.\nFor the fourth quarter, we reported non-GAAP operating income of $3.3 million or $0.06 per share.\nThis reflects higher equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries and the meaningful quarter-over-quarter improvement in our underwriting results.\nWhile we have more to do before we say we're satisfied with our results, this quarter served as evidence that the changes we've made over the past year and a half are having a strong beneficial impact to our operating performance.\nFor the full year, we reported a non-GAAP operating loss of $27.7 million, attributable to the pre-tax net underwriting loss of $45.7 million, associated with the tail policy issued to a large national healthcare account and a pre-tax $10 million IBNR reserve related to the pandemic, both of which were recorded in the second quarter.\nFor the fourth quarter, our consolidated net loss ratio was 74.9%, a significant quarter over quarter decrease primarily due to the effects of the large national healthcare account in the year ago quarter.\nBut most importantly, also reflected our reunderwriting and rate strengthening efforts over the last 12 months.\nFor the year, the net loss ratio was 83.4%, a 5.6 percentage point decrease primarily due to favorable reserve development and a reduction to the current accident year net loss ratio, driven by improvements made in our Specialty P&C segment.\nHowever, this improvement was largely masked by the second quarter tail policy and pandemic IBNR reserve.\nOur consolidated underwriting expense ratios for the quarter and for the year of 30.9% and 30% respectively were relatively unaffected by our contracting topline revenue from our reunderwriting efforts, which demonstrates that the strategic initiatives to improve our underlying expense structure have taken hold.\nFor the year, the expense ratio, also reflected one-time expenses related to restructuring, as well as transaction related costs associated with our planned acquisition of NORCAL, partially offset by reduced travel related expenses due to the pandemic.\nFrom an investment perspective, our consolidated net investment result increased quarter-over-quarter to $26.3 million, driven by $10.1 million of income from our unconsolidated subsidiaries.\nWe invest in various LPs and LLCs and the results of those investments are typically reported to us on a 1/4 lag, accordingly, the earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries in the current quarter represent the recovery in value of our LPs and LLCs in the third quarter.\nConsolidated net investment income was $16.1 million in the quarter, down from the year ago period primarily due to a decrease in our allocation to equities and lower yields from our short-term investments and corporate debt securities, given the actions taken by the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates in response to COVID-19.\nNet investment income was also lower for the year due to these same factors.\nThe Specialty Property & Casualty segment continues to execute a comprehensive business strategy to address our operating and underwriting results.\nAlthough we recorded an underwriting loss in the quarter and year, we continue to be encouraged with the improvement in both the expense and net loss ratios, exclusive of the underwriting loss associated with the large national healthcare account in both 2019 and 2020.\nAs a result of the aggressive restructuring reunderwriting and expense reductions executed throughout 2019 and 2020, we are confident that we have established a strong foundation for the future and positive momentum.\nAs expected, gross premiums written contracted in the quarter and full-year, reflecting our reunderwriting and rate strengthening efforts in the competitive environment across our operating territories.\nHowever, our gross premiums written were relatively consistent year-over-year in our Medical Technology Liability business.\nIn addition, gross premiums written in the quarter reflected renewal timing differences of $4.6 million dollars in our Specialty business, and the non-renewal of a $2.8 million dollar policy in our Standard Physicians business.\nWe will continue to focus on underwriting discipline and achievement of our long-term profit objectives, managing the segment's topline is necessary to improve our bottom line.\nPremium retention improved to percent quarter-over-quarter, driven largely by improvement in our specialty business.\nRetention for the full year was 79% and reflects the reunderwriting in specialty and rate strengthening efforts and standard positions over the past 12 months.\nPremium retention results in our Small Business Unit and Medical Technology Liability business were relatively consistent with historical trends.\nIn addition to higher premium retention in the quarter, we achieved renewal price increases of 8% in the segment, driven by price increases in both our Standard Physician and Specialty business of 10%.\nFor the full year, we achieved renewal price increases of 9% attributable to increases in the Specialty and Standard Physicians business of 15% and 11% respectively.\nIn addition to the pricing increases in specialty, we also significantly strengthened rate adequacy through our improvement of product structure terms and conditions.\nNew business writings were $5.3 million in the quarter compared to 4.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by our Medical Technology Liability business.\nYear-end new business writings were $23 million, compared to $43 million in 2019 which reflects careful risk selection, disciplined underwriting evaluation, and the impact of slower submission activity due to market disruptions from the pandemic.\nThe current accident year net loss ratio decreased 6.3 percentage points year-over-year, exclusive of the impact of the large national healthcare account in 2019 and 2020 and posting of the COVID IBNR reserve in the second quarter.\nThis decrease primarily reflects the improvement from our reunderwriting efforts that began in the third quarter of 2019.\nBoth in the quarter and full year, we continued to observe a significant reduction in our claims frequency as compared to the same periods of 2019, some of which is likely associated with the pandemic.\nWe have remained cautious in recognizing these favorable frequency trends in our current accident year loss pick due to the long tail nature of our lines of business and the uncertainty brought on by COVID-19.\nJust a brief update on COVID-19 business impact during the year.\nWe established a pre-tax $10 million IBNR reserve in the second quarter related to reported incidents.\nAs of year-end 2020, we have not seen the emergence of additional suits from the incidents reported.\nFive suits have been filed as of year-end 2020.\nTherefore, after careful review of the pandemic related claim activity, no additional IBNR reserves been booked since the second quarter.\nThere have been minimal changes in premium deferrals or discounts since the third quarter.\nDespite the challenges of the current loss environment, we recognized net favorable development of $6.8 million and $27.5 million in the fourth quarter and full year respectively.\nThis result is a significant improvement from the comparable periods of 2019.\nThe Specialty Property & Casualty segment reported expense ratios of 23.8% and 23% in the fourth quarter and full year respectively.\nIncremental improvements of 1.4 and 1.1 percentage points as compared to the same periods of 2019.\nThis result was achieved despite lower net earned premiums and $4 million of one-time charges during the year related to restructuring.\nAs a result of organizational structure enhancements, office consolidations and reductions in staff, we achieved expense savings of approximately $12 million in 2020.\nThe current reinsurance market continues to firm as a result of social inflation and severity claim trends, via successful October renewal of our reinsurance treaty and mitigated potential significant cost increases by increasing our retention from $1 million to $2 million for -- [Technical Issues] liability and Medical Technology Liability businesses.\nI'll conclude with a brief update on the NORCAL transaction.\nAs disclosed in our release, last week the California Department of Insurance completed its review of NORCAL conversion documents.\nAnd NORCAL will now begin soliciting policyholders to vote on the plan to convert from a mutual company to a stock company.\nAs part of their process, policyholders will have the option to take their ownership share of the company in the form of NORCAL stock which ProAssurance will offer to buy through our tender offer.\nWe expect materials to be mailed to eligible policyholders by the end of February.\nThis is an important step toward closing the transaction, which remains subject to a number of prerequisites as detailed in our prior disclosures.\nAssuming all of these prerequisites are met, we now expect to close the transaction in the second quarter of 2021.\nWe remain excited about the combination of the companies and the strategic value presented by this transaction and are excited to work with NORCAL toward the next phase of this process.\nWe look forward to continued progress on our business plan in 2021.\nCongratulations to you and your team for getting us this far in the process.\nNow, I'd like to pivot to the results from the Workers' Compensation Insurance and Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segments.\nKevin, what can you tell us about the quarter and year?\nThe Workers' Compensation Insurance segment produced income of $6 million and a combined ratio of 97.8% for 2020, including income of $2.1 million and a combined ratio of 96.3% for the fourth quarter.\nDuring the quarter and full year, the segment booked $47 million and $247 million of gross premiums written respectively, representing decreases of 13.6% and 11.4% compared to the same periods in 2019.\nRenewal pricing in 2020 decreased 4% for both the quarter and full-year, reflecting the continued competitive pressures in our underwriting territories despite COVID-19 and the associated economic conditions.\nPremium renewal retention was 82% for the 2020 quarter and 84% for the year, both improvements compared to 76% and 83% for the same periods in 2019.\nAs we continue to see stronger premium retention and lower new business during the pandemic.\nNew business writings decreased quarter over quarter to point $4.4 million dollars in 2020, compared to $5.5 million in 2019.\nAnd for the full year were $27.4 million in 2020 compared to $30.8 million in 2019.\nAudit premium for the fourth quarter of 2020 resulted in additional premium to the company of approximately $700,000 compared to $2.2 million for 2019, and for the year, was additional premium of $700,000 compared to $5.7 million in 2019.\nThe decreases in audit premium reflects the economic impact of COVID-19 on policyholder payrolls.\nWe continue to expect downward pressure in future quarters on premium resulting from changes in payroll estimates.\nThe calendar year net loss ratio increased in both the fourth quarter and for the year, reflecting the continuation of soft market conditions and workers' compensation and resulting renewal rate decreases, and additionally, the reduction in audit premium and lower net favorable reserve development, partially offset by favorable 2020 accident year claim results.\nThe 2020 accident year loss ratio was 69% for the year, compared to 68.4% in 2019.\nNet favorable loss reserve development for the quarter was $2 million in 2020 compared to $4.4 million dollars in 2019, and for the full year was $7 million versus $7.8 million in 2019.\nWe continue to reserve for all claims as if injured workers were receiving medical treatment as they would have prior to the pandemic.\nReported claim frequency for non-COVID claims decreased 35% during the pandemic, with only $2.2 million of gross undeveloped incurred losses at the end of 2020 from the currently reported 1,375 COVID claims.\nFurther, through the end of January 2021, we closed 87% of the 2020 reported COVID claims received to date, indicative of the shorter tailed nature of workers' compensation insurance compared to healthcare professional liability.\nHowever, management remains cautious in it's evaluation of the 2020 accident year loss ratio considering the many uncertainties surrounding the pandemic.\nOur claims professionals' continue to function effectively while working remotely, closing 61% of 2019 and prior claims during 2020, consistent with historical claim closing rates.\nMany legislative enactment or proposals to broaden coverage for workers' compensation claims, expired at December 31.\nHowever, new legislative sessions that commenced in January may revive efforts in this regard.\nTurning to expenses, the underwriting expense ratio in the quarter was 32.7% compared to 29.8% in 2019 reflecting the decrease in net premiums earned.\nThe underwriting expense ratio decreased 2.5 percentage points from the third quarter of 2020 due to our restructuring efforts discussed on our November earnings call, and to a lesser extent, the associated one-time expense of $900,000 included in the third quarter.\nFor the 2020 year, the expense ratio was 32.9% compared to 30.4% in 2019.\nTurning now to the Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment, we reported income of $1.6 million for the quarter and$4.4 million dollars for all of 2020.\nPremium trends in the SPC Reinsurance segment were largely consistent with those in the Workers' Compensation Insurance segment.\nWe renewed all of the alternative market programs that were available for renewal during the current quarter and for the year and wrote one new program in 2020.\nThe SPC resegment recorded favorable development of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $2.3 million in 2019, and for the full year was $16.6 million dollars versus $10.1 million in 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 1,090 reported COVID claims for this segment with $1 million of gross undeveloped incurred losses.\nTurning to our Lloyd's Syndicates segment now, I would like to ask Ned to take us through the results from the Syndicates and some of the developments in the quarter.\nAs expected, we saw a natural catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter related to hurricanes Laura and Sally and the wind storms that swept through the Midwest in August.\nOur participation in the results of Syndicate 1729 and 6131 let us to record a loss of just under $1 million in the quarter.\nThe fourth quarter loss, combined with our reduce participation in Syndicate 1729 for the 2020 underwriting year, contributed to overall lower income of approximately $2.1 million for the year.\nLosses on these storms and other natural catastrophes in the last three months of 2020 lead us to expect the segment loss in our first quarter of approximately $2.5 million.\nRegarding the developments Ken mentioned, It's been a year of change for us at Lloyd's and the fourth quarter proved to be no exception.\nFor the 2021 underwriting year, we have further reduced our participation in Syndicate 1729 from 29% to 5%.\nAdditionally, we reduced our participation in Syndicate 6131 from 100% to 50% for the 2021 underwriting year.\nDue to the quarter lag, these changes will be reflected in our results beginning in the second quarter of 2021.\nOur decision to further reduce our participation in the syndicates is driven by our desire to support and grow our core insurance operations, and to reduce volatility in our underlying performance.\nDuncan Dale, and his team at Dale Underwriting Partners have been and will continue to be valued partners to ProAssurance.\nAnd it is a testament to the quality of their work that the syndicates were able to secure participating capital to replace our own without difficulty.\nBefore we open the call to questions, I'll note that the meaningful improvements we've made in the past 12 months go a long way toward our goals of operational excellence and sustainable profitability.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We certainly appreciate your joining us today to discuss Graham's first quarter fiscal 2022 financial results.\nIf you do not have the releases or the slides, you can find them on the Company's website at www.\nHe's on the call today with us and will be making some formal remarks.\nAlso joining us are Jeff Glajch, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dan Thoren, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who has been named effective with Jim's retirement, our new Chief Executive Officer.\nJim will start with his overview and then cover the brief results of the quarter.\nJeff will then review details of the financial results and then we'll have Dan close out with his remarks.\nThese risks and uncertainties and other factors are provided in the release and in the slide, as well as with other documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThese documents can be found on our website or at sec.gov.\nI'd like to point out that during today's call, we may also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures which we believe are useful in evaluating our performance.\nWe have provided reconciliations of comparable GAAP with non-GAAP measures in the tables accompanying today's release.\nI will begin my remarks at Slide 3 and provide a brief review of the financial results, before discussing my planned retirement.\nRevenue in the quarter was $20.2 million, $16.7 million was organic and $3.5 million was due to the acquisition of Barber-Nichols that closed June 1.\nDefense revenue was 35% of total revenue in the quarter.\nWe do expect that defense revenue will approach 50% of total quarterly revenue with Barber-Nichols fully in future quarters.\nThis acquisition and the shift in revenue mix is a major transformation for Graham and measurably advanced our diversification strategy.\nOn an organic basis, revenue was similar year-over-year.\nHowever, it was for different reasons.\nYou might recall that our first quarter last year operated at nominally 50% capacity due to COVID-19, thus impacting revenue and profitability due to under-absorption.\nIn the most recent quarter, our workforce utilization was at capacity.\nHowever, mix was very different.\nOrders from our crude oil refining and chemical/petrochemical markets were very low during the third and fourth quarters last fiscal year where non-Navy orders totaled $17.5 million for both quarters.\nConsequently, greater production resources were pulled into Navy backlog, which are lower margin due to first article work and also due to contract structure for a large order in backlog.\nThose headwinds work out of backlog across the next few quarters and largely behind us as we exit this current fiscal year.\nOrganic revenue and profitability are expected to improve across the fiscal year.\nOrders in the first quarter were $20.9 million and were principally organic.\nBarber-Nichols orders were $200,000 for the month of June.\nSomewhat encouragingly, there were strong orders from our crude oil refining market in the quarter that totaled $11.5 million.\nWe did have a significant win in the quarter for a domestic refinery revamping their facility to improve crude oil feedstock processing flexibility.\nThat particular win was gratifying for me.\nI still remember losing the original order to a domestic competitor in the mid-1990s.\nAnd now, 25 years later, we won back the installation and replaced the original supplier with our own vacuum systems.\nConsolidated backlog at June 30 was $236 million, of which 80% is for defense.\nImportantly, as we work through the more challenging margin backlog, that impacts the current fiscal year.\nMargin potential for our defense backlog improves measurably.\nBarber-Nichols acquisition provides additional market diversity to our profile as it also adds backlog for new markets including space and advanced energy industries.\nWhile we put considerable cash toward acquiring Barber-Nichols to strengthen and diversify revenue along with earnings, our balance sheet remains strong and our opportunity to drive our return on assets improves.\nAs announced earlier today and as Debbie had mentioned, I'm very pleased to confirm that I will retire effective August 31 at the end of this month and Dan Thoren will succeed me as President and CEO of the corporation.\nHe also will join our Board of Directors at that time.\nIt has been a tremendous honor and great privilege for me to serve Graham shareholders and the corporation as its Principal Executive Officer since 2006.\nI believe I am departing on a high note as this is an incredibly exciting time for the Company, considering first the strength of our organic defense strategy having advanced to preferred supplier status for many of the products the Company provides to the US Navy, and in some cases, we are now bidding on a sole-source basis.\nThe credit goes to Alan Smith and his team for executing well our defense strategy.\nSecondly, the progress we have had innovating execution to become successful in price-focused international crude oil refining and petrochemical markets.\nThe sales team has proven we can take market share, and also the operations team has shown we're able to realize or beat target margins.\nThirdly, the investments we've made in IT tools, systems and resources to leverage our installed base and the expected benefit that will provide.\nI believe crude oil refining and chemical/petrochemical customers will invest in existing facilities, with greater throughput before investing in new capacity.\nI feel we are ahead of competitors regarding commitment to the installed base.\nLastly, the transformational acquisition of Barber-Nichols creates a new strong growth platform for both organic and M&A expansion.\nI've had the opportunity to work with Dan through the acquisition process for over nearly three years and most recently, the last two months as he onboarded with the Graham team.\nI believe that Dan is well equipped to lead Graham and has a terrific and broad vision for the next phase of growth for the Company.\nI'm thrilled this acquisition has proved to be as transforming as we had envisioned.\nAnd part of that transformation is building out the bench strength of our leadership team.\nUltimately, over the last couple of months, it became more clear to me that this has provided for my succession plan as well.\nI'm thrilled that the Board saw the same potential in Dan that I had seen.\nAs a Graham shareholder, I'm looking forward to benefiting from the value of Dan's strategic direction.\nYou have my full support, not only through this transition, but well into the future.\nI have enjoyed our many conversations all these years and have very much appreciated your ongoing support.\nIf you can move to Slide 4.\nAs Jim mentioned, we had a very rough first quarter.\nAs I discuss that first quarter, I would like you to keep in mind that our full year guidance is unchanged.\nTherefore, we expect to see improvements as the year goes on and we expect sequential quarterly improvement across each quarter for the rest of fiscal 2022.\nSales in the quarter improved by $3.5 million, which was due to the one month that we owned Barber-Nichols.\nThe comparable quarter last year was early on during the COVID pandemic.\nAnd as Jim mentioned, we ran the Company at half capacity during that quarter.\nHowever, in that quarter, we did have a $5 million project which was recognized on a completed contract basis and because of COVID had shifted from fiscal 2020 into Q1 of 2021.\nGross profit and earnings per share were dramatically affected by a very poor mix of projects and some timing and some cost items.\nNamely, we had some liquidated damages due to COVID in the quarter and some timing of expenses which were pulled into Q1.\nWe also had a small amount of acquisition expenses, about $169,000 pre-tax, and the first month of purchase price accounting related costs for Barber-Nichols.\nTo clarify the latter, the purchase accounting amortization costs were $225,000 before taxes in June.\nBefore we move on, I want to mention that we expect approximately $2.7 million pre-tax and $2.15 million after-tax related to acquisition purchase accounting.\n90% of this is amortization costs, with the rest being a step-up in depreciation and inventory.\nWe will be filing an 8-K later this week with much more detail on the purchase accounting and pro forma income statements.\nWe expect the amount of amortization will be similar in fiscal 2023 as fiscal 2022 since we will have 12 rather than 10 months of amortization in fiscal 2023.\nIt will decrease in future years and level off at approximately $1.1 million pre-tax.\nOn to slide 5.\nWith the acquisition of Barber-Nichols, we have moved from a very inefficient to a much more efficient balance sheet.\nWe have added $20 million of low-cost term debt as part of the acquisition and we have access to a much larger revolving line of credit.\nThis term loan and the line of credit will provide ongoing flexibility.\nWe expect the acquisition of Barber-Nichols to be accretive in fiscal 2022, even with the $2.15 million or approximately $0.20 a share in added amortization costs.\nWe will continue to look for both organic and M&A-related growth opportunities and believe we have the financial strength to invest in both areas.\nWith the addition of Barber-Nichols, we believe there are some excellent opportunities in both arenas.\nOn to slide 6.\nOrders in the commercial markets picked up in Q1 off a very low base in the previous two quarters.\nWith a $236 million backlog, we are well positioned for long-term growth.\n80% of that backlog is in the defense market, which provides an excellent baseline for our business, not just this year, but in upcoming years as well.\nBefore I pass it over to Dan, I would be remiss if I didn't recognize Jim for his 37 years of service at Graham, the last 15 years being as leader.\nHe has transitioned Graham from a company which has -- which was capacity limited and had minimal growth engines to a much broader organization with strong footprints in defense and the Asian energy markets to couple with our long history in the United States and Middle East.\nLook nearly anywhere in the world and you will see Graham equipment in many world-class refining and petrochemical facilities.\nYou will also see Graham equipment playing a key role on US Navy vessels which support our country's national defense.\nI've known Dan for the past three years, including negotiating the acquisition with or perhaps against him during part of that time.\nDan is a very high character leader with a great history at Barber-Nichols and I expect him to do the same at Graham.\nOver the past many months when the Board members have asked for my view as Dan as a potential CEO, I was and continue to be unequivocal in my belief that Dan is the right CEO to take Graham forward.\nNow that I've set the bar high, Dan, I'll pass the call over to you.\nVery kind words, very kind introduction.\nI've spent two and a half years getting to know Graham, their leadership and at a high level their business.\nIndirectly, I've learned a little about their culture, their people, their customers and their Board.\nOver the last two months, I've met with the executive team, managers, employees, customers and the Board to understand the Company in more depth.\nThese interactions have helped me understand the proud engineering and manufacturing heritage at Graham, the importance of the Company in the community of Batavia, New York and how they have become a trusted partner to their customers across the world in the critical process industries that they serve.\nAs I go through my slides, I'll give you an idea of how we are developing our strategy to build upon our strong legacies while leveraging our opportunities in the defense and space industries.\nSpecifically, we'll be working to generate sustainable earnings growth, reduce that earnings volatility, improve operating performance, generate strong cash flows to reinvest in our business and provide a dividend to stockholders.\nThe ultimate goals are to provide an acceptable return to our stockholders and provide benefit to all of our stakeholders.\nNow let's focus on slide 7.\nWith Graham Corporation acquired Barber-Nichols, we recognize that the two businesses have individual strengths, serving their respective markets that we do not want to disrupt.\nOur strategy is to leverage the strengths of each as platforms that provide potential for both organic and inorganic growth.\nAs such, Graham operations and BN operations both operate under the Graham Corporation umbrella.\nAs we consider future capital investments, our plan is to add new companies and technologies with related engineered product that can stand alone yet collaborate to win bigger business.\nLeverage best practices between subject matter experts in the companies, share services across the organizations and provide career paths for key employees.\nWhen we do these things, each member company can remain focused and agile while accomplishing more than they could alone.\nAs you look at slide 7, this depicts our two platforms for expansion.\nBarber-Nichols is currently in space and defense predominantly.\nGraham manufacturing is currently in Defense, Energy and Petrochemical.\nFor the space industry, we believe there are acquisition opportunities in this expanding market as it gains more interest in private investment.\nWe will be looking for small acquisitions that we can tuck in as well as medium acquisitions that can stand on their own and are complementary to our current businesses.\nWe are also focused on internal investments to develop new products and technologies in that space industry.\nBoth Graham and Barber-Nichols are well engaged in the defense industries.\nWe'll be looking for new areas to provide value as well as internal investments and acquisitions that can help us grow into new and more sophisticated product.\nGraham has been a world leader in vacuum and heat transfer products for energy and chemical/petrochemical applications.\nAs Jim and Jeff had discussed over many years, the domestic market is flat and the international markets have room for growth.\nWe intend to focus on our domestic installed base and provide customers the support they need to keep those plants running at an optimized level.\nWe'll continue to invest in international markets and grow our presence around the world through our successful shared margin strategy.\nMore recently, both companies are seeing opportunities to engage in the alternative and clean energy markets through turbomachinery and heat transfer products.\nClean energy is actually an area where synergy between companies is possible.\nStrategically, we plan to both service and grow our legacy business while having the engineering and new product capability to participate in these new alternative and clean energy markets.\nNow each one of these markets that have gone over have their own risk and reward profiles.\nHaving teams focused in each area is paramount and we are well along with the organizational changes needed to successfully execute our strategies in each of the markets.\nLet's move to slide 8.\nAs Jim and Jeff discussed earlier, we look at fiscal '22 as a transition year, with a tough start, getting better sequentially by quarter.\nMeanwhile, we are seeing a stronger pipeline with more inquiries and new orders in the second quarter.\nGraham manufacturing second quarter orders are $9.5 million to date, while Barber-Nichols has booked $9.1 million.\nBased on the timing of customers' projects, we are holding our revenue guidance at $130 million to $140 million of which Barber-Nichols is expected to contribute between $45 million and $48 million.\nCombined, the Defense segment is expected to account for almost half of the revenue and EBITDA is expected to be in the $7 million to $9 million range.\nCapital expenditures are planned to be in the $3.5 million to $4 million range, including the Barber-Nichols capital expenditure.\nLet's go to slide 9.\nAs alluded to in my initial remarks, we are transforming Graham Corporation.\nBarber-Nichols was the initial transformational acquisition.\nWe will be looking to solidify the Barber-Nichols investment through further investment on its platform to enable growth in the defense and space industries as well as other industries as opportunities arise.\nCoincident with the acquisition, we believe we are at or near the bottom of the energy and petrochem cycle.\nWe have been preparing for an up-cycle expansion that we believe will start in FY 2023.\nOur welder training program has been very successful in refilling our pipeline of future employees.\nWe are qualifying additions to our supply base to enable additional capacity with the expectation of a potential up cycle.\nOur plans include expanding our international offices with sales, quality and project management personnel.\nBoth Barber-Nichols and Graham have leading market positions and strong brand recognition.\nWe believe that strong engineering, working hand-in-hand with customers on challenging applications and delivering high-quality products on time will enable us to maintain those brand strength and market leadership positions.\nAs we advance our transformation, we will be improving our market presence with linked and updated websites and social media.\nWe believe that this will expand our exposure to a broader audience that doesn't yet recognize our growth and earnings potential.\nPersonally, I have a strong interest in being a great corporate citizen and working with all of our stakeholders to build a better stronger business for us all.\nWith the BN acquisition, Graham puts its large cash reserves to work and created a more efficient balance sheet.\nAs we continue to improve our business and further our strong cash-generating capabilities, we'll intend to make smart choices to allocate that capital for further growth with a keen focus on returns.\nWe are very optimistic about this new combination and the future it presents for all of us.\nWhen you have a talented team of people that can see problems for your customers, work with them to design and build solutions to those problems and then shift when the markets change, you will be successful.\nAt Graham Corporation, we have that ability and we will be looking to add more.\nSummary: ",

financial measures are available on the Investors section of our website, www.\nfortive.com, under the heading Investors quarterly results.\nWe completed the separation of our prior Industrial Technologies segment through the spin-off of Vontier Corporation on October 9, 2020.\nAnd have accordingly included the results of the Industrial Technologies segment as discontinued operations.\nAll references to period-to-period increases or decreases and financial metrics are year-over-year on a continuing operations basis.\nWe were very pleased with our second quarter results.\nAs you can see on slide three, our performance once again highlighted the benefits of our strategy to provide differentiated connected workflow solutions for our customers, creating a portfolio with enhanced resilience and long-term earnings power.\nDuring the quarter, we capitalized on accelerating point-of-sale trends across a number of our larger businesses, continued growth from our software offerings and improving conditions across our key end markets.\nAgainst this backdrop, we delivered core revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margins that exceeded the high end of our guidance, driving exceptional earnings growth and free cash flow conversion.\nAs we highlighted at our Investor Day on May 19, we are building on the foundation of our advantaged hardware positions and expanding our software capabilities to address our customer's critical workflow needs and accelerate their ongoing digital transformation.\nIn the second quarter, our SaaS offerings delivered low double-digit growth, and we also drove significant improvement across our professional services offerings.\nWe continue to see strong momentum at eMaint, including increasing demand from its expansion into the food and beverage, pharmaceutical and healthcare verticals.\nGordian and Accruent both had strong quarters as they executed on opportunities provided by increasing demand from facility owner operators and improvements in access to customer sites.\nBoth companies are well positioned to capitalize as customers focused on post-COVID return to work challenges and digital transformation priorities.\nCenters also performed very well in the quarter as access to hospital customers improved, executing on strong demand for its SaaS offerings among existing and new independent delivery network customers.\nLooking across the portfolio, we continue to be excited about our expanding offering of EHS workflow solutions, which are well positioned to meet the significant long-term sustainability requirements of our customers.\nISC and Intellect performed well, capitalizing on strong broad-based growth across end-markets and key geographies.\nAt the same time, we are excited with the early progress at ehsAI where the company closed its largest deal to-date in its first joint marketing campaign with Intelex and generated strong growth in its sales pipeline.\nThroughout the second quarter, we continue to apply the Fortive Business System across the portfolio to drive innovation, growth and share gains.\nDeployment of our lean portfolio management toolset, which significantly accelerates the efficiency and impact of R&D investments, achieved a greater than 40% increase in our on-time program delivery.\nThe application of FBS and digital analytics and search optimization generated 25% growth in digital traffic, from pre-pandemic levels across the portfolio.\nMeanwhile, the use of FBS growth tools has accelerated innovation at Fluke Health Solutions over the past 18 months and continues to drive excellent top line performance.\nWe have created good early momentum in our partnership with Pioneer Square Labs including the recent spin-in of TeamSense, a provider of innovative workflow solutions to streamline communications with hourly workers.\nThis marks the first business incubated at Pioneer Square Labs to be integrated into the Fortive portfolio.\nWhile still very early, we are pleased with the progress thus far at TeamSense and are excited to develop additional technologies that accelerate safety and productivity solutions for customers within our core markets.\nIn early July, we announced the acquisition of service channel.\nThe transaction brings a differentiated high-growth software business with an integrated service provider network and significant proprietary data assets to the portfolio, enhancing our ability to meet the evolving needs of facility owners around the world.\nFollowing the expected closing of the acquisition in Q3, we will have significant balance sheet capacity supported by our strong and resilient free cash flow generation.\nAs we highlighted at our Investor Day, we see substantial runway across our $40 billion served market for disciplined capital allocation to accelerate our strategy.\nTurning to a quick summary of the results in the quarter on slide four, we generated year-over-year total revenue growth of 26.7% as revenue strength exceeded the high end of our guidance.\nAdjusted operating margin was 22.2% while adjusted earnings per share was $0.66, representing a year-over-year increase of 53.5%.\nGiven the outperformance for both top line and our adjusted operating margin we delivered $282 million of free cash flow, which represented 118% conversion of adjusted net income.\nOn slide five, we take a closer look at the Intelligent Operating Solutions segment.\niOS posted total revenue growth of 31.2% in the second quarter.\nThis included mid-20% core growth in North America, low 30% core growth in Western Europe and low 20% core growth in China.\nFluke's core revenue increased in the mid-30% range.\nFluke also grew by mid-single digits on a sequential basis as we continue to see robust demand across its businesses, highlighted by growth at Fluke Industrial.\nFluke Industrial generated share gains across a range of key channel partners and retail accounts as point-of-sale accelerated through the quarter.\nFluke's broader ii900 Acoustic Imaging product line also continues to perform very well, as revenue approximately doubled in the quarter on strong growth across both Western Europe and North America.\nFluke Networks also performed well, driven by the recent launch of its LinkIQ product line, which continues to exceed initial expectations tied to office reopenings and network modifications.\nIn Fluke reliability, our efforts to accelerate performance of Pruftechnik are gaining traction as we took advantage of increasing demand for alignment and other services, while eMaint also delivered another strong quarter.\nWith the accelerated pace of orders at Fluke, we did see some backlog build due to supply chain responsiveness.\nIndustrial Scientific increased by mid-teens, driven by strong execution in instruments and rental as demand from oil and gas markets rebounded and the business continued its expansion into new end markets.\nThe company's iNet offering remained resilient, increasing by mid single-digits with net retention solidly above 100%.\nIntelex grew by high single-digits in Q2, reporting a record revenue quarter.\nIntelex continues to leverage FBS and has driven improvements in lead generation and funnel conversion.\nAlso in the second quarter, Intelex disclosed multiple deals for its enhanced ESG platform to help customers launch, scale and optimize their sustainability programs and meet increasing demand for transparency on a growing set of critical non-financial reporting metrics.\nAccruent grew by mid single-digits in the second quarter with low double-digit growth in its SaaS business.\nAccruent generated strong sales and bookings for its Meridian solution for engineering document management and its maintenance connection, CMMS offerings.\nThe business also capitalized on the strong demand for its EMS event, workspace and resource scheduling offerings as companies plan and execute their return-to-work strategies.\nThe company continues to generate new customer logo wins and improving growth in recurring bookings.\nImportantly, Accruent also delivered improved performance in its professional service business, which generated mid single-digit growth as customer site access continue to improve.\nGordian increased by mid-teens, driven by low 20% growth in the procurement business and high teens growth in estimating.\nGordian generated a record month for procurement revenue in June with accelerating time lines for key projects across a number of large customers.\nThis included increased project spend by the New York City Department of Education and School Construction Authority.\nMoving to Slide six.\nPrecision Technologies segment posted a total revenue increase of 25.1% in the second quarter.\nThis included low 20% growth in North America, mid-20% growth in Western Europe and mid-teens growth in China.\nTektronix increased by approximately 30%, with another quarter of strong demand across its product businesses, including accelerating point-of-sale trends in each of its major regions.\nBoth mainstream and performance of oscilloscopes had a strong quarter with high demand for semiconductor, industrial manufacturing and communications applications.\nTektronix service business again showed its stability and resilience increasing by low teens.\nTektronix continues to benefit from the accelerated focus on driving innovation with Q2 new product introductions performing very well, including its family of automated test solutions for high-speed data transfer.\nIn the second quarter, Tektronix held six regional innovation form events, which stimulated the adoption of its tech scope platform, resulting in accelerated funnel creation for the company's broader hardware and software offerings.\nSensing Technologies increased by low teens in the second quarter with growth driven by continuation of the broad market recovery.\nSensing performed very well in China with another quarter of mid-teens growth, driven by demand for factory automation solutions.\nElsewhere, Anderson-Negele continues to make progress with its approval of its paperless process recorder IoT solution aimed at the dairy industry with broader commercial rollout expected in the second half of the year.\nSensing also continues to drive market share gains elsewhere across its portfolio, particularly etc.\n, led by its differentiated critical environment solution and strong demand across its HVAC customers.\nPacSci EMC grew in the low 20% range, with the business seeing some alleviation of the COVID-related shutdowns and approval delays that impacted shipments in previous quarters.\nPacSci EMC continues to see good growth in the commercial space market with the resumption of launches by OneWeb providing recurring revenue for smart controllers and initiators.\nAlso on July 20, we were excited to watch the company's mission-critical technology, ensure safe and reliable separation of Blue Origin's new Shepherd capsule from its booster during its maiden voyage.\nMoving to Advanced Healthcare Solutions on Slide seven.\nTotal revenue increased 21.8%, including 11% core growth.\nThis included high single-digit core growth in each of North America, Western Europe and China markets.\nASP grew by high single digits in the second quarter, led by strong growth in Western Europe and China.\nASP also realized improved growth in North America, highlighted by high single-digit growth in the US.\nOverall, ASP grew its consumable revenue high teens as the rate of elective procedures across most geographies continue to improve.\nWhile elective procedure volumes increased on a year-over-year basis, Q2 volumes came in a bit lower than expected at approximately 93% of pre-COVID levels, which was consistent with the Q1 exit rate.\nASP also continued to expand its global installed base of terminal sterilization capital equipment, which grew at a 3.5% annualized rate in Q2.\nWe expect this continued installed base expansion to provide an additional tailwind to consumable revenue as procedure volumes normalize going forward.\nCensis increased in the mid-20% range with mid-teens growth in its CensiTrac SaaS offering as well as strong growth in its professional services business.\nMany hospital customers are now allowing access to vendors which resulted in a significant increase in activity in the second quarter, particularly with integrated delivery networks.\nFluke Health Solutions increased by low double digits even as it lapped a sizable COVID-related revenue tailwind in the prior year.\nFHS saw high-teens growth from its Optimize and OneQA software solutions, which benefited from accelerated growth investments over the last 18 months.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to Chuck, who will take you through some additional details on our margins, free cash flow and balance sheet.\nWe delivered solid margin performance in Q2 and driven primarily by strong fall-through on our revenue outperformance.\nAdjusted gross margins were 57.3%, up 100 basis points on a year-over-year basis.\nThis increase reflected 130 basis points of price realization as we delivered another quarter of solid performance managing price cost across the portfolio.\nQ2 adjusted operating profit margin was 22.2%, 170 basis points above the high end of our guidance, also driven by stronger volume and high associated fall-through.\nWe reported 240 basis points of core operating margin expansion, including 570 basis points of core OMX at the iOS segment.\nBoth Fluke and Tektronix delivered strong core operating margin expansion through disciplined option of FBS to drive sales conversion as demand accelerated across their end markets.\nAt the same time, strong contributions from some of the acquired pieces of our portfolio, including ISC, Gordian, Censis and LANDAUER also contributed to the margin outperformance across the segments.\nOn Slide eight, you can see that in the second quarter, we generated $282 million of free cash flow, representing a 118% conversion of adjusted net income.\nFree cash flow over the trailing 12 months increased 15% to $943 million.\nToday, our net leverage is approximately 1 time and we expect net leverage to be around 1.2 times at year end, including the funding of the acquisition of the service channel, but excluding any additional M&A.\nThis gives us significant capacity to continue to deploy toward our key capital allocation priorities.\nTurning now to the guide on slide nine.\nGiven the strong performance in the second quarter and the improvement in our outlook for the rest of the year, we are once again raising our 2021 guidance.\nFor the full year, we now expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be $2.65 to $2.75, representing a year-over-year growth of 27% to 32% on a continuing operations basis.\nThis assumes total revenue growth of 13.5% to 15%, adjusted operating profit margins of 22.5% to 23.5%, and an effective tax rate of 14% to 14.5%.\nIt also assumes total revenue growth of 8.5% to 11% in the second half of 2021.\nWe continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income for the full year.\nWe are initiating third quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.62 to $0.66, representing year-over-year growth of 24% to 32%.\nThis assumes total revenue growth of 11.5% to 14.5%, adjusted operating profit margin of 21.5% to 22.5% and an effective tax rate of 14% to 14.5%.\nFor the third quarter, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income.\nWith that, I'll pass it back to Jim for some closing remarks.\nBefore I move to questions, I want to provide a quick update on our sustainability and inclusion and diversity efforts, which is shown on slide 11.\nDuring our Investor Day program on May 19, we introduced an accelerated greenhouse gas reduction goal, which now targets a reduction of 50% in greenhouse gas intensity for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2025 relative to our 2017 base year.\nDuring the second quarter, we also issued our 2021 sustainability report, which included Fortive's second annual GRI index, first annual SASB index and the 2017 to 2020 greenhouse gas emissions profile.\nDuring the quarter, we also became a signatory to the UN Global Compact, committed to alignment with the task force and climate-related financial disclosure by 2022 and announced our 2025 aspirational inclusion and diversity goals.\nWe continue to make significant strides and are highly committed to accelerating our sustainability and inclusion and diversity progress in the coming years.\nAcross all three of our strategic segments, we are expanding on strong established positions with offerings that address the critical workflow needs of our customers and markets with attractive long-term growth drivers.\nOur strong earnings and free cash flow performance in the first half of this year clearly demonstrated the benefits of this strategic focus and the momentum building in our portfolio.\nAs we look ahead, we will continue to invest and expanding the capabilities of the Fortive Business System as we accelerate operating improvements and innovation to increase the value we offer to our customers.\nWith strong free cash flow and significant M&A capacity we are well-positioned to pursue the key organic and inorganic growth initiatives that will drive consistent double-digit earnings and free cash flow growth in the years to come.\nThat concludes our formal comments.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:They are also referenced on page two of our financial supplement.\nWith that, let's start our teleconference with opening comments from Dave Nunes, President and CEO.\nFirst, I'll make some high-level comments before turning it back over to Mark to review our consolidated financial results.\nThen I'll ask Doug Long, our Senior Vice President of Forest Resources, to comment on our U.S. and New Zealand timber results.\nAnd following the review of our timber results, Mark will discuss our real estate results as well as our outlook for the balance of 2021.\nWe started 2021 with encouraging momentum across all our businesses, a testament to the strength and diversity of our timber markets and the positioning of our real estate portfolio.\nIn the first quarter, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $70 million and pro forma earnings per share of $0.08 per share.\nAdjusted EBITDA exceeded the prior year quarter by 47% as favorable results in the New Zealand Timber, Pacific Northwest Timber and Real Estate segments more than offset a modest decline in adjusted EBITDA from our Southern Timber segment.\nAs we reflect on the first quarter, we're pleased with how our team worked collaboratively to capitalize on strong domestic markets, improving real estate market trends and growing demand for logs from China.\nDrilling down to our different operating segments.\nOur Southern Timber segment generated adjusted EBITDA of $32 million for the quarter, which was 5% below the prior year first quarter.\nA 7% increase in net stumpage prices and stronger nontimber sales were more than offset by 18% lower harvest volumes due to the front-loaded timing of 2020 harvest activity as well as weather-related disruptions we experienced earlier this year.\nIn our Pacific Northwest Timber segment, we achieved adjusted EBITDA of $18 million, an improvement of 81% versus the prior year quarter.\nThis strong result is attributable to a sharp increase in log pricing given strong domestic demand and robust lumber markets as well as higher volumes from the acquisition of Pope Resources.\nIn our New Zealand Timber segment, first quarter adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $21 million.\nThis year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA was due to significantly higher harvest volumes and sawtimber pricing as the first quarter of 2020 was severely impacted by COVID-19-related headwinds.\nLastly, in our Real Estate segment, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $5 million.\nThis year-over-year improvement was driven by an increase in acres sold, excluding the large disposition in 2020 amid growing buyer demand as well as a 9% increase in weighted average prices.\nWhile improved versus the prior year quarter we anticipated coming into the year, Q1 Real Estate activity was relatively light in the context of our full year expectations due to the timing of closings.\nLet's start on page five with our financial highlights.\nSales for the quarter totaled $191 million, while pro forma sales totaled $180 million.\nOperating income was $29 million and net income attributable to Rayonier was $11 million, or $0.08 per share.\nAdjusting for the operating income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in our Timber Funds segment, pro forma operating income was $27 million.\nFirst quarter adjusted EBITDA of $70 million was above the prior year quarter as higher results in our New Zealand Timber, Pacific Northwest Timber, and Real Estate segments more than offset a modestly lower contribution from our Southern Timber segment.\nOn the bottom of page five, we provide an overview of our capital resources and liquidity at quarter end as well as a comparison to year-end.\nOur cash available for distribution, or CAD, for the quarter was $47 million compared to $27 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher adjusted EBITDA and lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher cash taxes and interest.\nA reconciliation of CAD to cash provided by operating activities and other GAAP measures is provided on page seven of the financial supplement.\nConsistent with our nimble approach to capital allocation, we raised $37 million through our at-the-market, or ATM, equity offering program during the first quarter at an average price of $33.31 per share.\nAs previously discussed, we view the ATM program as a cost-effective tool to opportunistically raise capital, strengthen our balance sheet and match fund bolt-on acquisitions.\nIn sum, we closed the quarter with $78 million of cash and $1.3 billion of debt, both of which exclude cash and debt attributable to the Timber Funds segment, which is nonrecourse to Rayonier.\nOur net debt of $1.2 billion represented 21% of our enterprise value based on our closing stock price at the end of the first quarter.\nLet's start on page eight with our Southern Timber segment.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of $32 million was $2 million below the prior year quarter.\nThe decline relative to the prior year quarter was largely driven by an 18% decrease in harvest volumes due to the front-loaded timing of 2020 activity as well as weather-related disruptions incurred earlier this year.\nSpecifically, winter snowstorms in the Gulf region and wet ground conditions in Georgia resulted in lost production days compared to the first quarter of 2020.\nThe decline in volumes during the first quarter was partially offset by higher net stumpage prices and nontimber income.\nSpecifically, average sawlog stumpage pricing was roughly $28 per ton, a 3% increase compared to the prior year quarter.\nSawlog pricing is gradually improving as we are successfully leveraging continued lumber market strength into higher sawlog prices in certain U.S. South markets.\nFurthermore, increased pricing tension due to the growing demand for export-grade logs are becoming more visible in our coastal markets.\nHowever, pricing trends continue to vary considerably by region, underscoring the importance of local timber market dynamics.\nPulpwood pricing climbed 7% from the prior year quarter, reflecting the weather conditions that constricted supply during the first quarter as well as a favorable mix shift toward our coastal Atlantic markets.\nOverall, weighted average pine stumpage prices were up 8% versus the prior year quarter based on higher sawtimber and pulpwood prices as well as a more favorable mix of sawtimber.\nFirst quarter nontimber sales of $8 million were $2 million above the prior year quarter.\nA large pipeline easement sale drove the increase as compared to prior year quarter.\nMoving to our Pacific Northwest Timber segment on page nine.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $18 million was $8 million above the prior year quarter.\nThe year-over-year improvement was largely attributable to robust domestic lumber markets, driving significantly improved pricing.\nFirst quarter harvest volume was 13% above the prior year quarter.\nThe year-over-year increase was largely driven by the incremental volume from last year's acquisition of Pope Resources.\nAt $91 per ton, our average delivered sawlog price during the first quarter was up 21% from the prior year quarter.\nStrong pricing was sustained throughout the quarter even as domestic mills in the region maintained ample log inventories.\nMeanwhile, pulpwood pricing fell 23% in the first quarter relative to the prior year quarter as sawmill residuals remain plentiful amid increased lumber production.\nNotably, the Pacific Northwest is seeing some improved demand from the export market.\nTransportation constraints restricting the flow of European spruce salvage logs coupled with the ban on Australian log imports into China are translating into improved demand for exports from the Pacific Northwest.\nWith domestic log demand already at very healthy levels due to the strength in domestic lumber markets, we believe stronger export market demand will create additional pricing support, particularly for whitewood species.\nI'd also like to offer a few brief comments on the impact of last year's wildfires in Pacific Northwest.\nAs a reminder, none of our feed timber properties were directly impacted by the fires, although roughly 10,000 acres of Timber Fund properties sustained some fire damage.\nConsistent with the update we provided in February, our operations in the region have not been materially impacted from the salvage efforts conducted by others.\nThere have been some localized hauling cost increases in the areas directly impacted by the fires.\nHowever, the location of our timberland, the solid demand for green logs from many of our customers and the steady business we have been able to provide to our logging crews in the region has resulted in minimal impact to our operations.\nOverall, we remain well positioned to capitalize on solid domestic demand trends, improving export market conditions and favorable pricing environment we currently see in Pacific Northwest, especially following last year's potential integration of Pope Resources.\nPage 10 shows results and key operating metrics for our New Zealand Timber segment.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of $21 million was more than double the $10 million that we reported in the prior year quarter.\nThe increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven by much stronger pricing and a more normalized level of harvest activity versus a prior year period constrained by COVID-19 disruptions.\nIncreased volumes and pricing were partially offset by reduced carbon credit sales.\nWe opted to defer carbon credit sales during the quarter as we expect that the value of these credits is poised for further price depreciation due to recent changes to New Zealand's climate change goals and proposed changes to the country's emissions trading scheme.\nAverage delivery prices for export sawtimber climbed 28% from the prior year quarter to $120 per ton, reflecting improved trade demand as well as escalating trade tensions between China and Australia.\nNew Zealand log export pricing continues to benefit from the ban on Australian log imports in China.\nAs we have previously noted, prior to the ban, Australia was applying approximately 10% of the total volume imported by China.\nFurthermore, while the abundant supply of European spruce continues to compete for market share in China, availability has at least temporarily been constrained by higher shipping costs and the lack of container availability.\nIn turn, we have seen tremendous pricing upside in New Zealand on the export front, albeit partially offset by materially higher shipping costs.\nWe expect these costs to remain elevated given the global economic recovery and shipping demand for a wide range of commodities.\nShifting to the New Zealand domestic market.\nAverage delivered sawlog prices increased 16% from the prior year period to $81 per ton.\nThe increase in U.S. pricing was driven primarily by foreign exchange rates as New Zealand domestic pricing improved by a more modest 4% in the first quarter versus the prior year quarter.\nAverage domestic pulpwood pricing climbed 19% as compared to the prior year quarter.\nIn sum, despite the recent increase in shipping costs, we believe our New Zealand operations are well positioned to capitalize on further strengthening of the Chinese economy and any prolonged reduction in log imports from Australia as well as continued healthy domestic demand.\nI'll now briefly discuss the results from our Timber Funds segment.\nHighlighted on page 11, the Timber Funds generated consolidated EBITDA of $7 million in the first quarter on harvest volume of 145,000 tons.\nAdjusted EBITDA, which reflects the look-through contribution from the Timber Funds was $1 million.\nLastly, in our Trading segment, we reported $200,000 of adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter.\nAs a reminder, our trading activities typically generate low margins and are primarily designed to provide additional economies of scale to our feed timber export business.\nAs detailed on page 12, real estate closings were relatively light during the first quarter, which was consistent with our expectations and guidance we provided earlier this year.\nSpecifically, sales totaled just over $10 million on roughly 2,400 acres sold at an average price of nearly $4,200 per acre.\nReal estate adjusted EBITDA was $5 million in the first quarter.\nThe bulk of first quarter sales were in the rural category.\nRural sales totaled roughly $2,400 -- 2,400 acres at an average price of nearly $4,100 per acre.\nOverall, we have seen a meaningful uptick in demand for rural land as the space, privacy and recreational opportunities offered by these properties are attracting buyers.\nWe expect this positive momentum to continue, and we remain focused on achieving price realizations well above timberland values.\nSales in the improved development category totaled roughly $250,000 and consisted of three residential lots in our Wildlight development project north of Jacksonville, Florida, for an average price of $84,000 per lot, or $406,000 per acre.\nWhile development closings were limited in the quarter, we are very encouraged by the pipeline that we built for the balance of 2021.\nOverall, the team is capitalizing on growing demand for rural land as well as residential lots and commercial parcels within our development projects.\nWe remain optimistic that a combination of demographic trends, historically low mortgage rates and an increased need for space will benefit our various real estate sales categories.\nRelative to the first quarter, we expect a significant increase in the EBITDA contribution from our Real Estate segment over the next few quarters.\nSpecifically, on the development front, there is currently healthy demand from homebuilders for lots and entitled infrastructure served land.\nIn February, we are excited to announce that, Publix, a popular supermarket chain based in Florida, is set to anchor a new shopping center in Wildlight.\nWe believe that as this community continues to get more established, interest from builders will continue to grow.\nWe're also encouraged by the pipeline of opportunities for our properties in Richmond Hill, Georgia and the West Puget Sound area of Washington.\nNow moving on to our outlook for the year.\nBased on our solid start to 2021 and our expectation that there will be a significant pickup in real estate closings as the year progresses, we believe we are on track to achieve full year adjusted EBITDA toward the upper end of our prior guidance range of $285 million to $315 million.\nIn our Southern Timber segment, we expect to achieve our full year volume guidance of 6.2 million to 6.4 million tons as we anticipate the demand from lumber mills will remain strong and that select U.S. South markets will continue to benefit from improving export demand.\nFurther, we continue to expect a modest improvement in weighted average pricing relative to the prior year, with quarterly fluctuations largely driven by geographic mix.\nIn our Pacific Northwest Timber segment, we expect to achieve our full year volume guidance of 1.7 million to 1.8 million tons.\nHowever, given we pulled forward some volume into the first quarter to capture favorable demand and pricing, we anticipate lower quarterly harvest volumes for the balance of the year.\nWe further expect that strong domestic lumber markets and a pickup in export demand will hold pricing at or above first quarter average prices through the rest of the year.\nIn our New Zealand Timber segment, we expect to achieve our full year volume guidance of 2.6 million to 2.8 million tons with increased quarterly harvest volumes for the balance of the year.\nWe expect continued strong export and domestic demand, and we further expect that the restriction on Australian log imports into China will constrain competing log supplies.\nWe anticipate this positive operating momentum will translate into log prices remaining near or above levels realized in the first quarter, which will be partially offset by elevated shipping costs.\nIn our Real Estate segment, we expect a significant pickup in closings over the balance of the year based on our current pipeline of opportunities.\nOur pipeline has grown substantially as we have progressed through 2021, driving our increasingly optimistic sales outlook for residential and commercial properties within our real estate development projects.\nWhile first quarter closings were relatively light as expected, we remain confident that we will achieve or exceed our prior full year adjusted EBITDA guidance.\nAs we approach the one year anniversary of the Pope Resources acquisition, which closed last May, we remain very pleased with the integration process and the benefits realized from this transaction.\nThe addition of these high-quality assets and the integration of Pope's personnel into the Rayonier family has meaningfully increased our operational flexibility and market reach within the Pacific Northwest.\nWe've leveraged these improvements to our team and our portfolio as market conditions continue to improve over the past year.\nAlongside the Pope integration, we've also continued to focus on other opportunities to grow and improve our portfolio.\nTo this end, we closed on $30 million of negotiated bolt-on timber acquisitions across the U.S. South to start 2021.\nWe also published our inaugural carbon report in March.\nThis report detailed the 5.7 million metric tons of net carbon sequestered by our forest operations in 2019 and demonstrates the important role that working for us play in fighting climate change.\nRayonier's business model provides a natural climate change solution.\nOur trees remove carbon from the atmosphere during their growth cycle.\nAnd after harvesting, a significant portion of this carbon remains stored for an extended period of time within downstream wood products.\nBuilding on our inaugural carbon report, we plan to release a comprehensive sustainability report this summer.\nWe believe our mission of providing industry-leading returns, financial returns to our shareholders while serving as a responsible steward of our lands is well aligned with the holistic approach embodied by greater adherence to ESG principles.\nAnd we're proud of the progress we've made to date on enhancing our ESG disclosures.\nWe look forward to further engagement on these important topics with our shareholders and other stakeholders going forward.\nIn summary, we are benefiting from strengthening end markets and continuing to make progress on several important strategic priorities.\nI'm very proud of the accomplishments of our people and their unwavering commitment to building long-term value for our shareholders.\nDespite the unprecedented challenges encountered over the past year, our team is working hard to better position the company for long-term success.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Our earnings slides provide a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics used.\nCore means designated financial metrics excluding the impact of the recent s::can and ATi acquisitions.\nWe believe this reference point is important for year-over-year comparability.\nI couldn't be more pleased with the dedication and execution demonstrated by our team supporting our customers and delivering record sales in the face of widespread supply chain inflation and logistics challenges.\nOur strong order momentum from the first quarter continued into the second, and even with that strong execution, our backlog reached another record high as we exited the second quarter.\nOur two water quality acquisitions s::can and ATi delivered strong top line performance above our expectations with solid earnings per share accretion.\nOverall, it was a great quarter, due in large part to the activity in the trenches day in and day out.\nAs you can see on Slide 4, total sales for the second quarter were $122.9 million compared to the coronavirus impacted trough of $91.1 million in the same period last year, an increase of 35%.\nOverall utility water sales increased 38%.\nExcluding the approximately $12 million of sales from s::can and ATi acquisitions, core utility water revenues increased 22% year-over-year.\nComparing back to the pre-COVID impacted second quarter of 2019, core utility water sales increased 11%.\nAs Ken noted, we continue to experience robust orders, however supplier allocations of certain electronics and other components along with logistics challenges again limited manufacturing output in deliveries.\nWe did experience growth in overall meter sales and BEACON software as a service revenue and we benefited from strategic value-based pricing actions.\nWe exited the quarter with another record high backlog, which bodes well for our sales expectations moving forward.\nAs anticipated, the flow instrumentation product line sales rate of change returned to growth with a 22% year-over-year improvement, stabilizing demand trends across the majority of global end markets and applications as well as an easier comp influenced the increase.\nWe were pleased with the operating profit margins generated in the quarter in light of the significant and varied inflationary forces.\nThe quarter's operating margin was 15.2%, an increase of 130 basis points year-over-year.\nGross margin for the quarter was 40.8%, an increase of 150 basis points year-over-year.\nMargins benefited from favorable acquisition mix as well as the higher volumes and positive product sales mix, namely higher SaaS revenues, along with favorable value-based pricing realization.\nCombined, these drivers tempered the cost headwinds from higher brass and other component and logistics inflation.\nTaking a closer look at copper, prices have settled back down into the $4.30 range after escalating to about $4.80 earlier in the quarter.\nThis is generally in line with our most recent year-over-year headwind estimate, which was approximately $7 million to $8 million on a full year basis unmitigated.\nAs our margins demonstrate, we have executed well in implementing appropriate pricing mechanisms to offset this inflation and we will continue to actively monitor pricing in light of the inflationary pressures.\nTurning to SEA expenses.\nThe second quarter spend of $31.4 million was sequentially in line with the $31.6 million from Q1 2021 and represents an increase of $8.2 million from the prior year.\nYou may recall, the prior year included the benefit of various cost reduction actions taken at the onset of COVID-19 including temporary furloughs.\nThe SEA run rate includes both the s::can and ATi along with the higher level of acquired intangible asset amortization, and is in line with our ongoing expectations of normalized SEA leverage in 25% to 26% range over time.\nThe income tax provision in the second quarter of 2021 was 25%, slightly higher than the prior year's 24.3% rate.\nIn summary, earnings per share was $0.48 in the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 45% from the prior year's earnings per share of $0.33.\nWorking capital as a percent of sales was 24.3% on par with the prior quarter-end.\nInventory increased due to the manufacturing output constraints as well as commodity inflation as described earlier.\nFree cash flow of $11.9 million was lower than the prior year, the result of higher cash tax payments and the increase in inventory.\nOn a year-to-date basis, free cash flow conversion of net earnings is sitting at 147%.\nWe took the opportunity to upsize the facility to $150 million and to add additional flexibility in the form of leverage covenants and an accordion feature among others.\nOur strong cash flow combined with our borrowing capacity provides us with ample liquidity to fund our ongoing capital allocation priorities.\nTurning to Slide 5.\nWe updated the chart we introduced last quarter with actual second quarter data.\nGiven the number of different variables at play in both the current year and prior year comparables, we think this chart can be helpful in understanding the uneven results we have and we'll continue to see in our sales.\nThe robust growth rate we experienced this quarter excluding the acquisitions was the result of continued strong order rates as well as the record high backlog with which we started the quarter.\nNot surprisingly, it was also due in part to the easier comp from the most significantly COVID-19 impacted second quarter last year.\nAs we enter the back half of the year, the strong order momentum and record high backlog will be supportive of our growth outlook.\nThe third quarter will see a difficult comp, both in terms of sales and profitability based on the post-COVID lockdown recovery in both manufacturing output and orders last year.\nOur supply chain team continues to work tirelessly at [Indecipherable] with the varied electronic and other component shortages.\nWhile we don't expect to be back to normal, we do expect further backlog conversion as the year moves ahead.\nWe are very pleased with the results from the last two water quality acquisitions this quarter contributing just over $12 million of revenue in the quarter, a pro forma growth rate in the double-digits.\nTheir underlying performance along with the integration work underway to establish and cross-trained sales resources and harmonized product offerings within water quality validates our confidence in the underlying strategy of combining water quantity with quality in order to accelerate our customers' digital transformations.\nIn summary here on Slide 6, the step change in order rates over the past several quarters confirms the fundamental market demand for intelligent water solutions to monitor, manage and support operational efficiencies throughout the water distribution system.\nWe are uniquely positioned with a full line of smart water offerings encompassing both water quantity and quality to serve utility and industrial customers alike.\nA record backlog is one of those good problems to have and the challenge we expect will persist for some time as we migrate through the second half of the year and beyond.\nElectronic and other component suppliers are making good progress in restoring and building capacity, however, the rate of recovery is fluid and will continue to be uneven until inventory levels are able to be -- to fully meet demand.\nDespite the component availability, inflation and logistics challenges, our teams are working hard to build supply chain resiliency and actively communicate to suppliers and customers to proactively manage expectations.\nOur effective sourcing strategies, market driven innovation and operational agility are supporting Badger Meter's profitable business growth and delivering value for shareholders.\nFinally, I want to highlight several additional ESG related disclosures that we've added to our website.\nOne is an outline of how Badger Meter works to align our ESG efforts with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, notably Goal 6, 3 and 11 that focus on water, health and safety and sustainable cities.\nThe second is a stand-alone SASB focused report providing annual metrics and other information for 2020, which is cross-referenced to GRI.\nBadger Meter continues to advance its ESG journey as we work to understand and mitigate the most material and impactful risks of climate change and preserve and protect the world's most precious resource.\nSummary: ",

participating on the call.\nWe hope everyone is enjoying their fall.\nThey continue performing at a high level and reaping the rewards of a very positive environment.\nOur third quarter results were strong and demonstrate the resiliency of our portfolio and of the industrial market.\nSome of the results the team produced include, funds from operations coming in above guidance up 14% compared to third quarter last year and ahead of our forecast.\nThis marks 34 consecutive quarters of higher FFO per share as compared to the prior year quarter, truly a long-term trend.\nOur quarterly occupancy averaged 97.1%, up 50 basis points from third quarter 2020 and at quarter end, we're ahead of projections at 98.8% lease and 97.6% occupied.\nOur occupancy is benefiting from a healthy market with accelerating e-commerce and last mile delivery trends.\nQuarterly releasing spreads were at record levels at 37.4% GAAP and 23.9% cash and year-to-date, those results are 31% GAAP and 18.5% cash.\nFinally, cash same-store NOI rose 5.2% for the quarter and 5.6% year-to-date.\nIn summary, I'm proud of our team's results, putting up one of the best quarters in our history.\nToday, we're responding to the strength in the market and demand for industrial product by both users and investors by focusing on value creation via development and value-add investments.\nI'm grateful we ended the quarter at 98.8% leased, our highest quarter on record and to demonstrate the market strength, our last four quarters marked the highest four quarterly rates in our company's history.\nLooking at Houston, we're 96.7% leased.\nIt now represents 12% of rents, down 140 basis points from a year ago and is projected to continue shrinking.\nAs we've stated before, our development starts are pulled by market demand.\nBased on the market strength we're seeing today, we're raising our forecasted starts to $340 million for 2021.\nThis represents an annual record level of starts for our company.\nTo position us for this market demand, we've acquired several new sites with more in our pipeline along with value-add and direct investments.\nMore details to follow as we close on each of these opportunities.\nAnd Brent will now review a variety of financial topics, including our 2021 guidance.\nOur third quarter results reflect the terrific execution of our team, strong overall performance of our portfolio and the continued success of our time-tested strategy.\nFFO per share for the third quarter exceeded our guidance range at $1.55 per share and compared to third quarter 2020 of $1.36 represented an increase of 14%.\nThe outperformance continues to be driven by our operating portfolio performing better than anticipated, particularly occupancy and rental rate growth.\nFrom a capital perspective, during the third quarter, we issued $49 million of equity at an average price over $176 per share.\nIn July, we repaid a maturing $40 million senior unsecured term loan.\nAnd in September, we closed on the refinance of $100 million unsecured term loan that reduced the effective fixed interest rate from 2.75% to 2.1%, with five years of term remaining.\nIn our ongoing efforts to bolster our ESG efforts, we incorporated a sustainability-linked metric into the amended terms.\nThat activity combined with our already strong and conservative balance sheet, kept us in a position of financial strength and flexibility.\nOur debt to total market capitalization was below 17%, debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 4.7 times and our interest and fixed charge coverage ratio increased to over 8.5 times.\nOur rent collections have been equally strong.\nBad debt for the first three quarters of the year is a net positive $346,000 because of tenants whose balance was previously reserved but brought current, exceeding new tenant reserves.\nThis trend continues to exemplify the stability, credit strength and diversity of our tenant base.\nLooking forward, FFO guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021 is estimated to be in the range of $1.54 to $1.58 per share and $6.01 to $6.05 for the year, a $0.15 per share increase over our prior guidance.\nThe 2021 FFO per share midpoint represents a 12.1% increase over 2020.\nAmong the notable assumption changes that comprise our revised 2021 guidance include: increasing the cash same-property midpoint by 8% to 5.6%, decreasing reserves for uncollectible rent by $900,000, increasing projected development starts by 24% to $340 million and increasing equity and debt issuance by combined $95 million.\nIn summary, we were very pleased with our third quarter results.\nWe will continue to rely on our financial strength, the experience of our team and the quality and location of our portfolio to carry our momentum through the year.\nNow Marshall will make some final comments.\nIn closing, I'm excited about where we stand this far into 2021.\nWe're ahead of our initial forecast and adhering that momentum into 2022.\nOur company, our team and our strategy are working well, as evidenced by the quarterly results.\nAnd it's the future that makes me most excited for EastGroup.\nOur strategy has worked well the past few years.\nWe're further seeing an acceleration and a number of positive trends for our properties and within our markets.\nMeanwhile, our bread and butter traditional tenants remain and will continue needing last-mile distribution space in fast-growing Sunbelt markets.\nThese, along with the mix of our team, our operating strategy and our markets has us optimistic about the future.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO.\nAnd I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO.\nI will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends.\nThen we will take questions.\nIn addition, as a result of our previously announced two for one stock split effective on March 4, 2021, all share and per share data discussed on this earnings call is on a post-split basis.\nThe company closed the first quarter with sales of $2.377 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.53 and $0.52, respectively.\nSales were up 28% in U.S. dollars, 25% local currencies and 23% organically compared to the first quarter of 2020.\nSequentially, sales were down 2% in U.S. dollars, 3% in local currencies and 4% organically.\nOrders for the quarter were $2.734 billion, which was up 27% compared to the first quarter of 2020 and up 9% sequentially, resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.15:1.\nBreaking down sales into our two segments.\nThe interconnect business, which comprised 96% of sales, was up 28% in U.S. dollars and 25% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of last year.\nOur cable business, which comprised 4% of our sales, was up 17% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of last year's.\nAdam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.\nOperating income was $465 million in the first quarter of 2021.\nOperating margin of 19.6% was down 100 basis points sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 adjusted operating margin and up a strong 260 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2020.\nThe year-over-year improvement in operating margin was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes, combined with the benefit of a lower cost impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the impact of a more challenging commodity and supply chain environment.\nThe sequential decline in operating margin was driven by normal conversion on the reduced sales levels as well as a more challenging commodity and supply chain environment.\nFrom a segment standpoint, the interconnect segment -- in the interconnect segment, margins were 21.5% in the first quarter of 2021, which increased from 19.1% in the first quarter of 2020 and decreased 100 basis points sequentially.\nIn the cable segment, margins were 8.8%, which increased from 7.6% in the first quarter of 2020 and decreased from 10.3% in the fourth quarter.\nGiven the continuing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are very proud of the company's performance.\nOur team's ability to effectively manage through this crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture, which has enabled us to capitalize on the many opportunities for incremental sales, while driving strong operating performance in this very dynamic market environment.\nThe company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 23.9%, which compared to 15.9% in the first quarter of 2020.\nOn an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 24.5% in the first quarter of both 2021 and 2020.\nOn a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share increased by 33% to $0.53 compared to $0.40 in the prior year period.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 49% to $0.52 from 35% -- $0.35 in the first quarter of 2020.\nThe company continues to be an excellent generator of cash.\nCash flow from operations was $321 million in the first quarter or 97% of GAAP net income.\nAnd net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $243 million or 74% of net income.\nFrom a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 85, 73 and 59 days, respectively, all within their normal ranges.\nDuring the quarter, the company repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock for approximately $153 million.\nAnd during the month of April, the company repurchased a small amount of remaining stock authorized under our existing stock repurchase plan.\nThe elevated level of cash on hand at the end of the first quarter was driven by borrowings under the company's U.S. commercial paper program in anticipation of the MTS closing in early April.\nTotal debt was $4.6 billion, and net debt was $2.3 billion.\nTotal available liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.1 billion, which included total cash and short-term investments on hand.\nFirst quarter 2021 EBITDA was $559 million, and our net leverage ratio was 1.0 times.\nFollowing the close of the quarter, on April 7, we completed the acquisition of MTS, which Adam will discuss in more detail in a moment.\nThe MTS acquisition was funded by a combination of cash and cash equivalents on hand as well as additional borrowings under the company's U.S. commercial paper program.\nOn a pro forma basis, including the MTS acquisition and the anticipated divestiture of the test and simulation business, total available liquidity and net leverage at March 31, 2020 would be $3.2 billion and 1.4 times, respectively.\nUntil the divestiture of the MTS test and simulation business has closed, we will account for and report the test and simulation business as a discontinued operation.\nAs such, the expected sales and earnings of the test and simulation business are not included in our guidance.\nOur guidance also excludes cash and noncash expenses that will be expensed in the second quarter related to the MTS acquisition.\nThese expenses, which we expect to total approximately $85 million or $0.12 per share, include costs related to the early extinguishment of debt, noncash purchase accounting-related expenses, external transaction expenses, severance and other costs.\nIn conjunction with the divestiture of the test and simulation business, the company will also incur certain additional cash tax-related and other acquisition-related costs, which will not be included in income from continuing operations.\nOur guidance does incorporate the expected results of the MTS Sensors business, which as previously announced, is expected to generate $350 million in sales and $0.05 in diluted earnings per share in the first 12 months after closing.\nAnd I certainly hope that you, your family, your friends and all of your colleagues are continuing to stay safe and healthy.\nAs Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the first quarter.\nI'll then discuss our trends and our progress across our diversified served markets.\nAnd then finally, I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter.\nAnd of course, we'll have time for Q&A at the end.\nOur results in the first quarter were substantially better than we had expected coming into the quarter as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales as well as adjusted diluted earnings per share.\nSales grew a very strong 28% in U.S. dollars and 25% in local currencies.\nAnd on an organic basis, sales increased by 23%.\nAnd we had organic growth in nearly all of our end markets and driven particularly by growth in the automotive, mobile devices, industrial and IT datacom markets.\nAnd I'll talk about each of those markets in a few moments.\nCraig mentioned, we booked record orders in the quarter of $2.734 billion, and that represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.15:1.\nDespite continuing to face a range of operational challenges related to the ongoing pandemic as well as increased costs related to commodities and supply chain pressures, our operating margins were very healthy in the quarter, reaching 19.6%, which was a 260 basis point increase from last year's levels.\nCraig mentioned our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew a very robust 49% from prior year, which is again an excellent reflection of the Amphenol organization's strong execution.\nWe generated operating and free cash flow of $321 million and $243 million in the first quarter, respectively, both clear reflections of the high quality of the company's earnings.\nI just want to say how proud I am of our team this quarter.\nAnd our results once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amid the very dynamic and challenging environment.\nAnd I'd like to make a few comments on our acquisitions in the quarter.\nFirst, as we announced on April 7, we were very pleased to close on the acquisition of MTS Systems earlier than originally anticipated.\nAlso, as previously announced, we had signed an agreement to sell the MTS test and simulation business to Illinois Tool Works for a sale price of $750 million.\nAnd that is -- that remains subject to certain post-closing adjustments and excludes transaction-related expenses.\nWe expect this sale to close following the receipt of all required regulatory approvals.\nWe especially look forward to the strength of the combined breadth of our company's highly complementary sensor product portfolios, which, we believe, will enable us to offer our customers an expanded array of innovative technologies across multiple end markets.\nWe expect the MTS Sensors business to add approximately $350 million of sales and $0.05 in adjusted diluted earnings per share in the first 12 months after closing.\nMore importantly, though, we look forward to realizing the long-term benefits of the opportunities created by the collective strengths of Amphenol and MTS Sensors for many years to come.\nWe're truly excited about this significant acquisition, which ultimately has positioned Amphenol as one of the broadest and most diversified sensor companies in the industry.\nIn addition to the MTS acquisition, we also closed on two other small acquisitions during the first quarter.\nIn February, we acquired Euromicron, a manufacturer of highly engineered fiber optic interconnect solutions for the mobile networks and IT datacom markets.\nBased in Germany, with annual sales of approximately $25 million, Euromicron represents a great addition to our interconnect product offering for customers across the European communications market.\nAnd then in March, we completed the acquisition of Cabelcon from Corning Inc. Cabelcon, which also has sales of approximately $25 million, is a Denmark-based designer and manufacturer of high-technology connectors and interconnect assemblies, primarily for customers in the European broadband market.\nOur ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company.\nNow turning to our trends across our served markets.\nI would just comment that we remain very pleased that the company's balanced and broad end market diversification continues to create great value.\nWe believe this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets while continuing to expose us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry.\nThis diversification has become ever more valuable given the many market dynamics related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNow turning first to the military market.\nThe military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter.\nAnd as we had expected coming into the quarter, sales grew by 3% from prior year and were essentially flat organically with growth in naval, unmanned aerial vehicles, communications and vehicle ground systems, offset by declines or flat performance in other applications.\nSequentially, our sales were modestly down by about 3%.\nLooking into the second quarter, we expect sales to grow in the low double digits from these first quarter levels as we benefit from the addition of MTS Sensors together with the increased demand for interconnect products.\nWe're especially excited by the addition of the sensors products of MTS to our military product offering.\nTogether with our already leading interconnect products as well as our broad exposure across virtually all defense programs, we look forward to supporting the continued adoption of next-generation electronics into a wide array of military hardware.\nThe commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the quarter.\nAnd not surprisingly, and as expected, sales were down significantly, declining by 47% from prior year as the commercial aircraft market continued to experience unprecedented declines in demand for new aircraft due to the ongoing pandemic-related disruptions to the global travel industry.\nSequentially, our sales were a bit better than expected, moderating by just 3% from the fourth quarter.\nAnd looking into the second quarter, we do expect a sequential improvement in sales as we benefit from our recently completed acquisitions.\nRegardless of the ongoing challenging environment in commercial air, our team working in this market remains committed to leveraging the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems integrated into those airplanes.\nThe industrial market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter.\nSales in industrial in the first quarter were better than expected, growing a very strong 33% in U.S. dollars and 33% organically.\nThis was driven by robust growth in battery and electric heavy vehicle applications, rail mass transit, heavy equipment, instrumentation, factory automation, alternative energy and medical, really a broad performance across many of the segments.\nOn a sequential basis, sales grew by a better-than-expected 6% versus the fourth quarter.\nLooking into the second quarter, we expect the industrial market to once again grow in the low teens versus the first quarter.\nAnd as we benefit from the addition of MTS Sensors, while continuing to gain momentum in many segments of the industrial market.\nThe acquisition of MTS Sensors has expanded our range of sensors sold into the industrial market, adding position, vibration, force and shock sensors that are used in a wide array of industrial applications.\nTogether with our existing sensor operations, we now have a diversified range of sensors supporting virtually all of the segments of the industrial market that we serve.\nI remain truly proud of our team working across the industrial market around the world.\nOur high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering positions us strongly with customers who are accelerating their adoption of electronics, no matter the application.\nThe automotive market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in this market were also much stronger than we expected, growing 52% in U.S. dollars and 44% organically, as our team was able to execute strongly in the face of a robust and broad recovery in the automotive market.\nIn particular, we saw very strong growth of our products that are used in electric and hybrid electric vehicles in the quarter.\nA great confirmation of our global team's long-term efforts at designing in high-voltage and other interconnect and sensor products into these important next-generation platforms.\nSequentially, our sales increased by 6% from the fourth quarter.\nNow as has been widely reported, there are a variety of supply chain challenges facing the automotive industry.\nAccordingly, as we look toward the second quarter, we do expect a modest sequential decline in sales as the global supply chain disruptions temporarily impact certain pockets of new vehicle production.\nI'm extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market.\nThey have really demonstrated their agility and resiliency through these most turbulent times and thereby, have secured the company's position with our customers across the automotive market.\nWe look forward to benefiting from their efforts long into the future.\nThe mobile devices market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter.\nSales in this market increased by a better-than-expected 51% from prior year, with strength across all product types, including particularly in wearables and laptops.\nSequentially, our sales declined by 35%, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter and is within the typical range of first quarter seasonality that we have seen traditionally in the mobile devices market.\nLooking at the second quarter, we anticipate a further high single-digit sequential sales decline, which is also not atypical for this market in the second quarter.\nWhile mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile markets, our outstanding and uniquely agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2021 and beyond.\nOur leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, thereby positioning us well for the long term.\nNow turning to the mobile networks market.\nThis market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, and sales did grow from prior year by 4% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically, as strength from products sold to OEMs was offset in part by a moderation of our sales to network operators.\nWe were encouraged, though, to realize a better-than-expected sequential growth of 19% in the mobile networks market in the quarter as mobile network operators increased their spending on next-generation networks.\nLooking to the second quarter, we do expect a modest increase in sales from these first quarter levels, helped by the addition of Euromicron, which expands our offering for mobile networks operators in Europe and positions us well to support future network upgrades.\nOur team continues to work aggressively to expand our position in next-generation equipment and systems around the world.\nAnd as our customers ramp up the investment of these advanced networks, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both original equipment manufacturers as well as mobile network service providers.\nThe information technology and data communications market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter.\nSales in the quarter were stronger than expected, rising 25% in U.S. dollars and 24% organically from prior year, really on broad-based strength across networking, storage and server applications.\nWhile we had expect sales to decline coming out of the fourth quarter, we were pleased to realize actually a sequential growth of 6% as customers continue to increase their demand for our high-technology products, use service providers and in data centers around the world.\nLooking to the second quarter, we expect a further increase of sales in the mid-single digits from these levels as customer demand continues to accelerate.\nWe remain very encouraged by the company's outstanding technology position in the global IT datacom market.\nOur customers around the world, no doubt about it, are continuing to drive their equipment to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power.\nIn turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom with our unique, high-speed, power and other interconnect products.\nFinally, the broadband market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by a very strong 16% from prior year as broadband spending levels remained elevated.\nOn a sequential basis, sales grew slightly from the fourth quarter.\nWe do expect a high-teens sequential sales increase in the second quarter as customers continue to upgrade the capacity of their networks to support the significant increase in demand for bandwidth and as we benefit from our recent acquisitions, including Cabelcon.\nThe addition of Cabelcon expands our offering for broadband customers in the European market, which enables us to provide a more diversified range of products for their next-generation networks and the related upgrades.\nWe look forward to continuing to offer this expanded product offering to broadband service operators around the world, all of whom are working to increase bandwidth to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses.\nNow turning to our outlook, and given the current still dynamic market environment as well as assuming no new material disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and constant exchange rates.\nFor the second quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $2.415 billion to $2.475 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.53 to $0.55.\nThis would represent strong sales growth of 22% to 25% and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 33% to 38% compared to the second quarter of last year.\nAnd I would just note that the second quarter of last year, as you will recall, was already a strong recovery quarter for the company coming out of the first quarter.\nI remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the ongoing challenges that are in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability.\nThe entire Amphenol organization remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world.\nAnd with that, operator, we'd be happy to take whatever questions there may be.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm here today with Chairman and CEO, Todd Bluedorn; and CFO, Joe Reitmeier.\nTodd will review key points for the quarter and Joe will take you through the company's financial performance and outlook for 2021.\nTo give everyone time to ask questions during the Q&A, please limit yourself to a couple of questions or follow-ups and requeue for any additional questions.\nAll comparisons mentioned today are against the prior year period.\nFor information concerning these risks and uncertainties, see Lennox International's publicly available filings with the SEC.\nIn the first quarter, we continued to see strong momentum in our Residential business, combined with strong improvement in Commercial and Refrigeration, as the overall company set new first quarter highs for revenue, profit and earnings per share.\nOverall, for the company, revenue was up 29% to a new first quarter record of $931 million.\nAt constant currency, revenue was up 28%.\nGAAP operating income was a first quarter record $114 million, up 213%.\nGAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was a first quarter record $2.20, up 588%.\nTotal segment profit rose 208% to a first quarter record of $116 million.\nTotal segment margin expanded 720 basis points to 12.4%, and adjusted points to 12.4%, and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations rose 305% to a first quarter record $2.27.\nLooking at our business segments for the first quarter, we've realized double digit revenue growth and margin expansion in all three businesses.\nIn Residential, we set new first quarter highs for revenue and profit.\nResidential revenue was up 37%.\nSegment profit rose 197% and segment margin expanded 850 basis points to 15.9%.\nReplacement business was up more than 40% and new construction was up more than 25%.\nBreaking it down between our Lennox business and our Allied business, Lennox revenue was up about 25%, and Allied was up about 70%.\nLet me take a moment to unpack the strength we saw in Residential in the quarter.\nFirst, with strong operational execution, our Residential team is capitalizing on its ability to deliver to meet contractor and distributor demand and gain share.\nPost the 2018 tornado and the initial 2020 pandemic impact, we are back on offense with production, distribution and executing our playbook for market share gains.\nSecond, Residential benefited from the colder winter weather with heating degree days up 13% from the first quarter last year.\nYou may recall, we had a soft first quarter in 2020.\nThird, I'd like to note that we had -- I would like to note that we had a 6% benefit to revenue for more days in the quarter this year than last year.\nThat happens every four years as we reset the calendar.\nConversely, the fourth quarter will have a 6% headwind from fewer days in the quarter this year.\nThis applies to Residential as well as all our other businesses.\nAdjusting for the days, Residential grew 31% with Lennox growing nearly 20% and Allied growing about 65%.\nIn addition, for Allied, we had approximately $25 million of pull-forward in the first quarter from different distributor loading patterns this year than last year.\nAdjusted for both days and this pull-forward, Allied was up approximately 35% in the quarter.\nWorking through all this math I gave, adjusting for days and the pull-forward in our Allied business which sells to independent distribution, overall Residential segment revenue was up about 25%.\nWe believe this compares to mid-teen sell-through for the industry, driven in part by the favorable cold weather that I talked about.\nOur performance that is above that is due to market share gains.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we are back on the offensive with production, distribution and executing our playbook for gaining share.\nThe team has had strong operational execution to drive this outperformance, and we are well positioned for the summer season and our largest season of quarters.\nIn Commercial, revenue, segment profit and margin were all first quarter records.\nRevenue is up 12%.\nAt constant currency, revenue was up 11%.\nSegment profit was up 47% and segment margin expanded 330 basis points to 13.8%.\nIn the first quarter, we saw broad strength in Commercial as year-over-year growth turned positive across all of our businesses.\nAt constant currency, Commercial equipment revenue was up mid-teens in the quarter.\nWithin this, replacement revenue was up mid-teens with planned replacement up mid-teens and emergency replacement up high teens.\nNew construction revenue was up high single digits.\nBreaking out revenue another way, regional and local business revenue is up mid-teens, national account equipment revenue is also up mid-teens.\nOur team won three new national account equipment customers in the quarter.\nOn the service side, the next National Accounts Services revenue was up mid-single digits.\nVRF revenue was up mid-30s percentage.\nSome highlights to mention for Commercial.\nSchools continue to be an area of focus for us.\nWe have a dedicated sales force and product line that will drive a multiyear growth opportunity for us in this market.\nToday, K-12 schools are just a little under 10% of revenue for this -- equipment revenue for this segment.\nThis business is up more than 20% for us in the first quarter.\nAnd given the recent stimulus package that benefits HVAC, indoor air quality spending for schools, we expect K3 schools to be a growth vertical for us moving forward.\nIndoor air quality continues to be an important focus for us with our building better air initiatives.\nMost interest and activity we are seeing are in this K-12 school segment but conversations are taking place with many customers across many industry verticals.\nWe have launched our new Model L Rooftop unit as we continue to lead the field and energy efficiency.\nThe Model L features variable speed technology and an all-new advanced control system.\nWe're seeing high customer interest in this industry-leading product for 2021 and beyond.\nOverall, for Commercial, entering the second quarter, momentum continues with backlog up double digits and strong order rates.\nIn Refrigeration for the first quarter, revenue was up 21%.\nAt constant currency, revenue is up 17%.\nIn North America, revenue was up more than 25%.\nEurope Refrigeration revenue was up low single digits at constant currency, and Europe HVAC revenue was up mid-single digits at constant currency.\nRefrigeration segment margin expanded 560 basis points to 6.3%.\nThe segment profit rose to $8 million from $1 million in the prior year quarter.\nLike in Commercial, momentum continues for Refrigeration entering the second quarter with backlog up double digits and strong order flow led by North America.\nThe strong performance for the company overall in the first quarter and outlook for the second quarter and year, we are raising 2021 guidance.\nWe now expect 7% to 11% revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $11.40 to $12.\nWe are also raising free cash flow guidance to $375 million for the full year.\nWe now assume about 55% of earnings in the first half of the year compared to the prior guidance of about 50%.\nThis reflects the strong first quarter performance and second quarter outlook.\nWe repurchased $200 million of stock in the first quarter and plan on another $200 million for a total of $400 million in our guidance for the year.\nI'll provide some additional comments and financial details on the business segments for the quarter, starting with Residential Heating & Cooling.\nIn the quarter, revenue from Residential Heating & Cooling was a first quarter record $606 million, up 37%.\nVolume was up 32%.\nPrice was up 1% and mix was up 4%.\nForeign exchange was neutral to revenue.\nResidential profit was a first quarter record $96 million, up 197%.\nSegment margin expanded 850 basis points to 15.9%.\nSegment profit was primarily impacted by higher volume, favorable price and mix, higher factory productivity, sourcing and engineering-led cost reductions, distribution and freight savings and favorable foreign exchange.\nPartial offsets included higher commodity, warranty and other product costs and higher SG&A.\nNow turning to our Commercial Heating & Cooling business.\nIn the first quarter, Commercial revenue was a first quarter record $199 million, up 12%.\nVolume was up 15%.\nPrice was flat and mix was down 4%.\nForeign exchange had a positive 1% impact to revenue growth.\nCommercial segment profit was a first quarter record $27 million, up 47%.\nSegment margin was a first quarter record 13.8%, which was up 330 basis points.\nSegment profit was primarily impacted by higher volume, lower material costs and lower SG&A.\nPartial offsets included unfavorable mix.\nIn Refrigeration, revenue was $125 million, up 21%.\nVolume was up 15%.\nPrice was up 1% and mix was up 1%.\nForeign exchange had a positive 4% impact to revenue growth.\nRefrigeration segment profit was $8 million in the first quarter compared to $1 million in the prior year quarter.\nSegment margin was 6.3%, up 560 basis points.\nSegment profit was primarily impacted by higher volume, favorable price and mix, lower material costs and higher factory productivity.\nHigher SG&A was a partial offset.\nRegarding special items in the first quarter, the company had net after-tax charges of $2.7 million that included a $2 million net charge for other tax items, a $1.9 million net charge in total for various other items and a $1.2 million benefit for excess tax benefits from share-based compensation.\nCorporate expenses were $16 million in the first quarter compared to $14 million in the prior year quarter.\nOverall, SG&A was $145 million compared to $131 million in the prior year quarter.\nSG&A was down as a percent of revenue to 15.6% from 18.1% in the prior quarter.\nIn the first quarter, the company used $18 million in cash from operations compared to a usage of $99 million in the prior year quarter.\nCapital expenditures were approximately 25 -- $24 million in the first quarter and in the prior year quarter.\nFree cash flow was a negative $42 million in the first quarter compared to a negative $123 million in the prior quarter.\nThe company paid approximately $30 million in dividends in the quarter and repurchased $200 million of stock.\nTotal debt was $1.17 billion at the end of the first quarter and we ended the quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.8.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $40 million at the end of the first quarter.\nWe now expect the industry to see high single-digit shipment growth in Residential, Commercial Unitary and Refrigeration markets in full year, up from our prior assumption of mid-single-digit growth in these end markets.\nFor the company, we are raising guidance for 2021 revenue growth from a 48% range to a new range of 7% to 11%, and we still expect foreign exchange to be neutral to revenue for the full year.\nWe are raising guidance for 2021 GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations from a range of $10.55 to $11.15 to a new range of $11.33 to $11.93, and we are raising our 2021 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations from $10.55 to $11.15 to a new range of $11.40 to $12.\nNow let me run through the key points in our guidance assumptions and the puts and takes for 2021.\nFirst, for the items that are changing.\nWe have announced a second round of price increases and now expect a benefit of $90 million in price for the year, up from our prior guidance of $50 million.\nWe now expect residential mix of $10 million, up from our prior guidance for neutral mix.\nWe expect a benefit of $15 million from sourcing and engineering-led cost reduction actions, down from our prior guidance of $25 million.\nAnd this change reflects inflationary pressures from suppliers.\nFor commodities, we now expect a $55 million headwind, up from our prior guidance of $30 million.\nCorporate expenses are now expected to be approximately $95 million, up from prior guidance of $90 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation.\nAnd now for the guidance items that remain the same.\nWe still expect a $20 million benefit from factory productivity.\nWith 30 new Lennox Stores planned for this year, we will be at a more normal run rate with distribution investments compared to last year.\nFreight is still expected to be a $5 million headwind and tariffs are also expected to be a $5 million headwind.\nWe are planning for SG&A to be up approximately 7% for the year or a headwind of about $45 million.\nNow within SG&A, we are making investments in R&D and IT for continued innovation and leadership in products, controls, eCommerce and factory automation and productivity.\nA few other guidance points.\nWe still expect neutral foreign exchange.\nWe still expect interest and pension expense to be approximately $35 million.\nWe continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 21% on an adjusted basis for the full year.\nWe are still planning capital expenditures to be approximately $135 million this year, about $30 million of which is for the third plant at our campus in Mexico.\nWe expect construction to be completed at the end of 2021 and have the plant fully operational by mid-2022, and we expect nearly $10 million in annual savings from the third plant.\nFree cash flow is now targeted to be approximately $375 million for the full year, up from prior guidance of approximately $325 million on the strong earnings performance in the first quarter and our current outlook.\nAnd finally, we still expect the weighted average diluted share count for the full year to be between 37 million to 38 million shares, which incorporates our plans to repurchase $400 million of stock this year.\nAnd with that, let's go to Q&A.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO of Aflac Incorporated, will begin with an overview of our operations in Japan and the US.\nFred Crawford, President and COO of Aflac Incorporated, will then touch briefly on conditions in the quarter and discuss key initiatives, including how we are navigating the pandemic.\nMembers of our US executive management team joining us for the Q&A segment of the call are: Teresa White, President of Aflac US; Virgil Miller, President of Individual and Group Benefits; Eric Kirsch, Global Chief Investment Officer and President of Aflac Global Investments; Al Riggieri, Global Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary; June Howard, Chief Accounting Officer; and Steve Beaver, CFO of Aflac US.\nWe're also joined by members of our executive management team in Tokyo at Aflac Life Insurance Japan: Charles Lake, Chairman and Representative Director, President of Aflac International; Masatoshi Koide, President and Representative Director; Todd Daniels, Director and CFO; Koji Ariyoshi, Director and Head of Sales and Marketing and Assistant to Director Sales and Marketing.\nBefore we begin, some statements in this teleconference are forward looking within the meaning of federal securities laws.\nAlthough we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature.\nActual results could differ materially from those we discuss today.\nWe encourage you to look at our Annual Report on Form 10-K for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results.\naflac.com and includes reconciliations of certain non-US GAAP measures.\nI'll now hand the call over to Dan.\nAt our first quarter conference call one year ago, we were facing the early days of the pandemic.\nAt that time, I shared with you, actions that we've taken to ensure that we protect the employees, the distribution partners, the policyholders, and the communities.\nI'm proud of our response and our ability to handle these challenging times for everyone.\nOur People First embodies the spirit of corporate culture, which we refer to as the Aflac way.\nWithin the pandemic environment, we are encouraged by the production of the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines.\nBut we also recognize that vaccination efforts are still in the early stages around the world.\nOur thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected.\nAnd we are cautiously optimistic, while also remaining diligent.\nThere is one essential message that I continue to emphasize with our management team.\nIt is imperative that we control the factors we have the ability to control.\nAnd what we don't have the ability to control.\nWe must monitor continually to be ready to adapt.\nThis approach allows us to respond in the most effective way possible.\nIn the first quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 26.4%.\nWhile earnings are off to a strong start for the year, it's important to bear in mind that they are largely supported by low-benefit ratio associated with -- excuse me associated with a pandemic condition.\nBefore covering our segments, I'll make a few comments about the overall perspective.\nPandemic conditions in the first quarter continued to impact our sales results, as well as earn premium and revenues, both in the United States and Japan.\nWe continue to expect these pandemic conditions to remain with us through the first half of 2021, but look for improvement in the second half of the year, as communities and businesses, further open-up, allowing more face to face interactions.\nDespite the fact that sales in both the United States and Japan had been suppressed considerably due to the constrained, face-to-face opportunities, we did not sit still.\nWe continue to make progress in integration of our accelerated investment in our platform, while continuing strong earnings performance.\nLooking at the operations in Japan in the first quarter, Aflac Japan generated solid overall financial results with a profit margin of 23.1%, which was above the outlook range that we provided at the Financial Analyst briefing.\nAflac Japan also reported strong premium persistency of 95%.\nSales were essentially flat for the first quarter, with the January launch of our new medical product.\nAll said, that continued impact of the pandemic conditions.\nWe are encouraged by the reception of the new medical product, by both, consumers and the Salesforce.\nIn addition, Japan Post group's announcement, to resume proactive sales in April, paves the way for gradual improvement in Aflac Cancer Insurance sales in the second half of the year.\nWe are actively working with Japan folks to ready the platform, recognizing that it will take time to return to the full string.\nWe continue to navigate evolving pandemic conditions in Japan, including the recent reestablished state of an emergency, for Tokyo, Osaka and two other prefectures, affected from April, the 25th, through May the 11th.\nRestrictions will be tightened to curb the movement of people and group activities during the major holiday known as Golden Week.\nTurning to the US, we saw a strong profit margin of 27.3%, Aflac US also reported very strong premium persistency of 80%.\nMax will cover the persistency later.\nCurrent pandemic conditions continue to notably impact our sales results, largely due to reduced face-to-face activity.\nAs expected, we saw modest sequential sales improvement in the quarter with an overall decrease of 22.1%.\nIn the US Small businesses are still in the recovery mode, and we expect that they will be that way for most of 2021.\nAt the same time, larger businesses remain focused on returning employees to the worksite rather than modifying the benefits for their employees.\nWe strive to be where the people want to purchase insurance.\nThat applies to both Japan and the United States.\nIn the past, this is meeting face-to-face with individuals to understand their situation, propose the solution and close the sale.\nFace-to-face sales are still the most effective way for us to convey the financial protection only Aflac products provide.\nHowever, the pandemic has clearly demonstrated the need for virtual means.\nIn other words, non face-to-face sales that help us reach potential customers and provide them with the protection that they need.\nEven prior to the pandemic, we've been working on building our virtual capacities.\nGiven the current backdrop, we have accelerated investments to enhance the tools available to our distribution in both countries, and continue to integrate these investments into our operation.\nIn addition, we continue to build out the US product portfolio with previously acquired businesses that serve as a base for Aflac network dental and vision and group, absence management and disability.\nWhile these acquisitions have a modest near-term impact on the top line, they better position Aflac for future long-term success in the United States.\nOur core earnings drivers, which are persistency, underwriting profits, investment income and expense ratios continue to drive strong pre-tax margins both in the United States and in Japan.\nBoth Japan and the US, we experienced sequential sales growth in the months of January, February and March.\nIn addition, provided we don't experience the setback in terms of pandemic conditions, we're forecasting a sequential increase in absolute sales in the second quarter over the first quarter in both the US and in Japan.\nAs always we placed significant importance on continuing to achieve strong capital ratios in the US and in Japan on behalf of our policyholders and shareholders.\nWe remain committed to prudent liquidity and capital management.\nWe issued our first sustainability bond in March as we seek to allocate proceeds from the issuance to reinforce our commitment to social and environmental initiatives as we balance purpose for profit.\nWe treasure our 38-year track record of dividend growth and remain committed to extending it, supported by the strength of our capital and cash flows.\nAt the same time, we will continue to tactically repurchase shares.\nFocus on integrating the growth investments we've made in our platform.\nBy doing so, we look to emerge from this period in a continued position of strength, and leadership.\nI've always said that the true test of strength is how one handles adversity.\nThis past year confirms what I knew all along, and that is that Aflac is strong, adaptable and resilient.\nWe will continue to work to achieve long-term growth, while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policyholders.\nBy doing so, we look to emerge from this period in a continued position of strength and leadership.\nI don't think it's a coincidence that we've achieved success, while focusing on doing the right things for the policyholders, the shareholders, the employees, the sales distribution, the business partners and the communities.\nIn fact, I believe success, and doing the right thing go hand-in-hand.\nI'm proud of what we've accomplished by balancing purpose with financial results.\nThis is ultimately translated into a strong, long-term shareholder value.\nNow I turn the program over to Fred.\nI'm going to touch briefly on current pandemic conditions in Japan and in the US, then focus my comments on efforts to restore our production platform in 2021.\nJapan has experienced approximately 575,000 COVID cases and 10,000 confirmed deaths since inception of the virus.\nThrough the first quarter of 2021 and since the inception of the virus, Aflac Japan's COVID impact has totaled approximately 10,500 claimants with incurred claims of JPY1.9 billion.\nWe continue to experience a low level of paid claims for medical conditions other than COVID, as policyholders refrain from routine hospital visits.\nThere are essentially three areas of focus in building back to pre-pandemic levels of production in Japan.\nOur traditional product refreshment activities, online sales driving productivity in the face of pandemic conditions and active engagement with Japan Post to begin the recovery process in cancer insurance sales.\nAs Dan noted, there has been a positive reception to our revised medical product.\nThis product was designed to better compete and the independent agent channel where we had seen a decline in market share heading into 2020.\nSales of medical insurance are up 34% over the first quarter of 2020 and up 8% over the 2019 quarter.\nThe new product called EVER Prime has enhanced benefits that on average result in 5% to 10% more premium per policy versus our old medical product.\nThe product also includes a low claims bonus structure that has contributed to growth among younger demographics.\nWe have technology in place to allow agents to pivot from face to face to virtual sales, and an entirely digital customer experience.\nThe agent is not removed from the process.\nThe agent can make the sale and process the policy from point of solicitation to point of issuance entirely online without face-to-face contact.\nWe introduced this capability in October of 2020 and for the month of November, we processed 1,600 applications utilizing this digital experience.\nIn the month of March that number doubled to approximately 3,200 applications.\nNot surprisingly, we are seeing higher adoption rates among younger demographics.\nOn March, 26, we launched a national advertising campaign promoting the capability and expect to see increased utilization.\nWe see this capability contributing to productivity even after pandemic conditions subside.\nOn Japan Post, as Dan noted, we anticipate sales volume will recover gradually in the second half of 2021.\nSeparate from Japan Post activities to revive sales, Aflac Japan is actively supporting recovery in the sale of cancer insurance.\nThis includes reinforcing communication on Japan Post sales policy, down to the postal branch level, training and education on our latest cancer products, and sales proposal strategies and identifying existing cancer policyholders in the Japan Post system to both explain the benefits of their current products and create an opportunity for potential upgrade.\nIt's important to remember that the Japan Post sales force has been inactive for 18 months.\nTherefore product training and sales coaching are critical efforts in the coming months.\nTurning to the US, there is approximately 32 million COVID-19 cases and 575,000 deaths as reported by the CDC.\nAs of the end of the first quarter, COVID claimants since inception of the virus has totaled approximately 38,000, with incurred claims of $130 million.\nAlong with infection rates declining from peak levels in 2020, our data suggests hospitalization rates and days in the hospital have trended lower.\nHowever infection hotspots in areas of the US remain.\nAnd as is the case in Japan, there is concern over a potential fourth wave of infection.\nExecutive orders requiring premium grace periods are still in place in nine states with six states having open ended expiration dates, persistency has improved.\nHowever, most of that improvement is attributed to the combination of state orders and lower overall sales as we typically experienced higher lapse rates in the first year after the sale.\nTurning to recovery and restore efforts, we have seen our agent channel and small business benefit franchise hurt by the pandemic.\nIt's important to note that roughly 390,000 of our 420,000 US business clients have less than 100 employees, critical areas of investment include recruiting, training, technology advancement and product development, key indicators of recovery include agent and broker recruiting, a built in average weekly producers and traction in the rollout of our dental and vision products.\nFor the first quarter, we are running at approximately 70% of the average with the producers during the same period in pre-pandemic 2019.\nTrends are positive, and we expect to narrow this gap throughout the year assuming pandemic conditions improve.\nWe are experiencing favorable recruiting numbers, have reopened training centers closed during the pandemic and veteran agents are reengaging, after a difficult year.\nWe are in the early days of our national rollout of Aflac network dental and vision.\nOur dental product is approved in 43 states, and vision in 41 states with more states coming online throughout the year.\nNetwork dental and vision is critical in the small business marketplace, and a key component to agent productivity, along with new account growth, retention and penetration or seeing more employees at a given employer.\nThis month, we are completing the national training programs, making select product refinements and reinforcing incentives to drive new dental accounts.\nIn addition, we are busy upgrading our administrative platforms to ready for increased volumes.\n2021 is the year of launch, learn and adjust, and we expect to see our pipeline, close rate and new accounts gradually increasing throughout the year.\nOur premier life and disability platform acquired from Zurich is now operating under the Aflac brand.\nWe have started to see our quoted pipeline build in the last 45 days.\nHowever, many employee -- employers are reluctant to move critical benefit plans while sorting through returning to work site and changing workforce dynamics.\nIn addition, benefit consultants often proceed with caution in a year or so after an acquisition.\nWe need to remain patient over the next few years as we settle into this new line of business.\nOur competitive calling card is the proven premier service and technology capabilities of the acquired platform, coupled with Aflac Group's core leadership in supplemental work site benefits.\nWe will not resort to winning business via relaxed underwriting and pricing standards in this highly competitive market.\nFinally, earlier this year, we launched our new e-commerce direct-to-consumer platform, Aflac Direct.\nWe offer critical illness, accident and cancer and are approved in approximately 30 states with more states and product coming online throughout the year.\nThis platform targets individuals, the self employed, gig workers and part-time employees.\nIn short, those who are not offered traditional benefit packages at the work site.\nWe are actively building out a licensed agent call center to better manage conversion rates and control overall economics.\nWith a modest amount of committed marketing dollars, we are attracting about 500,000 visitors per month to aflac.com, which has resulted in 120,000 leads for call center conversion this year.\nWe are currently experiencing a 15% conversion rate once in the call center.\nThis is a data analytics-driven business and core metrics will improve as this model matures.\nIn terms of the contribution of these businesses to overall sales in 2021, we expect these three growth initiatives will make up roughly 10% of sales in 2021 after having contributed less than 5% to 2020 sales.\nWe remain committed to the revenue growth targets discussed at our November investor conference.\nWe expect these initiatives to drive incremental revenue in excess of $1 billion over the next five to seven years.\nAs these separate initiatives mature, they leverage off each other.\nNetwork dental and vision drives agent recruitment and conversion to average weekly producers, employer paid benefits drives supplemental work site sales, and direct-to-consumer expands our addressable market, while being leveraged to funnel work site leads to our agents in the field.\nIn the future, as employees leave the work site, a digital relationship directly with Aflac helps with persistency and customer satisfaction.\nAs Dan noted, we issued our inaugural sustainability bond, raising $400 million to be invested toward our path to net zero emissions by 2050 and investments that support climate, as well as diversity and inclusion efforts.\nThe bond offering itself is an important step, in that it requires formal processes around reporting, tracking and auditing of qualified sustainable investments.\nThis rigor serves to benefit the control environment surrounding our enterprisewide ESG reporting and accountability.\nIn addition, Aflac Global Investments announced late February, a partnership with Sound Point Capital Management to create a new asset management business, focused on the transitional real estate loan market.\nAs part of that alliance, we have made an initial $1.5 billion general account allocation to the newly created Sound Point Commercial Real Estate Finance, LLC, with $500 million of that amount dedicated to providing transitional and other debt financing to support economically distressed communities, designated as qualified opportunity zones.\nAflac will hold a 9.9% minority interest in this newly created investment LLC, with the ability to grow our stake over time in line with future growth of the new venture.\nI'll now pass on to Max to discuss our financial performance in more detail.\nLet me follow my comments with a review of our Q1 performance, with a focus on how our core capital and earnings drivers have developed.\nFor the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased 26.4% to $1.53, with a $0.02 positive impact from FX in the quarter.\nThis strong performance for the quarter was largely driven by lower utilization during the pandemic, especially in the U.S. and a lower tax rate compared to last year.\nVariable investment income went $24.5 million above our long-term return expectations.\nAdjusted book value per share, including foreign currency translation gains and losses, grew 20.6%, and the adjusted ROE, excluding the foreign currency impact, was a strong 16.7%, a significant spread to our cost of capital.\nStarting with our Japan segment.\nTotal earned premium for the quarter declined 3.6%, reflecting first sector policies paid up impact, while the earned premium for our third sector product was down 2.2%, as sales were under pressure in 2020.\nJapan's total benefit ratio came in at 68.4% for the quarter, down 100 basis points year-over-year, and the third sector benefit ratio was down -- was 58%, also down 100 basis points year-over-year.\nWe experienced slightly higher than normal IBNR release in our third sector block as experience continues to come in favorable relative to initial.\nThis quarter, it was primarily due to pandemic conditions constraining utilization.\nPersistency remains strong, with a rate of 95%, up 50 basis points year-over-year.\nOur expense ratio in Japan was 21.3%, up 130 basis points year-over-year.\nWith improved sales activity, expenses naturally pick up in our technology-related investments into converting Aflac Japan to a paperless company continues, which also includes higher system maintenance expenses.\nAdjusted net investment income increased 6.9% in yen terms, primarily driven by favorable returns on our growing private equity portfolio and lower hedge costs, partially offset by lower reinvestment yield on our fixed and floating rate portfolio.\nThe pre-tax margin for Japan in the quarter was 23.1%, up 60 basis points year-over-year, a very good start to the year.\nTurning to the US, net earned premium was down 4.1% due to weaker sales results.\nPersistency improved 240 basis points to 80%, as our efforts to retain accounts and reduce lapsation show early positive results.\nAs Fred noted, there are still nine states with premium grace periods in place.\nSo we are monitoring these developments closely.\nBreaking down the 240 basis points persistency rate improvement further, 70 basis points can be explained by the emergency orders in place, 90 basis points by lower sales as first year lapse rates are roughly twice total in-force lapse rates.\nAnd the residual of 80 basis points includes conservation efforts executed on last year.\nOur total benefit ratio came in much lower than expected.\nAt 39.1%, a full 900 basis points lower than Q1 2020.\nIn the quarter, we experienced lower paid claims, especially in the month of January, as pandemic conditions impacted behavior of our policyholders.\nThis is in line with disclosures in 2020, indicating a negative correlation between infection levels and claims generating activities like accidents, elective surgeries and physical exams.\nThis low activity level related to non-COVID claims accounted for most of the year-over-year drop in the benefit ratio.\nOur total incurred COVID-related claims also came in lower than expected due to an IBNR release.\nWe estimated new COVID claims at approximately $42 million, and this was offset by an IBNR release of $41 million.\nAs our experience accumulates, we have refined our assumptions, and this led to this IBNR reserve release.\nWe expect the benefit ratio to increase gradually throughout the remainder of the year, with the resumption of normal activity in our communities and by our policyholders.\nFor the full year, we now expect our benefit ratio to be toward the lower end or slightly below our guided range of 48% to 51%.\nOur expense ratio in the US was 38.5%, up 10 basis points year-over-year, but with a lot of moving parts.\nWeaker sales performance negatively impacts revenue.\nHowever, the impact to our expense ratio is largely offset by lower DAC expense.\nHigher advertising spend increased the expense ratio by 70 basis points along with our continued build-out of growth initiatives, group life and disability, network and innovation and direct-to-consumer.\nThese contributed to a 110 basis point increase to the ratio.\nThe strategic growth initiative investments are largely offset by our efforts to lower core operating expenses as we strive toward being the low-cost producer in the voluntary benefit space.\nNet-net, despite a lot of moving parts, Q1 expenses are tracking according to plan.\nIn the quarter, we also incurred $6 million of integration expenses not included in adjusted earnings associated with recent acquisitions.\nAdjusted net investment income in the US was down 0.6% due to a 22 basis points contraction in the portfolio yield year-over-year, partially offset by favorable variable investment income.\nProfitability in the US segment was very strong, with a pre-tax margin of 27.3%, with a low benefit ratio as the core driver.\nWith Q1 now in the books, we are increasing our pre-tax margin expectation for the full year.\nInitial expectations were for us to be toward the low end of 16% to 19%.\nWe now expect to end up for the full year toward the high end of this range indicated at start.\nIn our Corporate segment, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $26 million as adjusted net investment income was $20 million lower than last year, due to lower interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.\nOther adjusted expenses were $7 million lower as our cost reduction activities are coming through.\nOur capital position remains strong, and we ended the quarter with an SMR north of 900% in Japan and an RBC of approximately 563% in Aflac Columbus.\nUnencumbered holding company liquidity stood at $3.9 billion, $1.5 billion above our minimum balance, excluding the $400 million proceeds from the sustainability bond that we issued in March that reinforced our ESG initiatives and believe that sustainable investments are also good long-term investments.\nLeverage, which includes the sustainability bond, increased but remains at a comfortable 23% in the middle of our leverage corridor of 20% to 25%.\nIn the quarter, we repurchased $650 million of our own stock and paid dividends of $227 million, offering good relative IRR on these capital deployments.\nWe will continue to be flexible and tactical in how we manage the balance sheet and deploy capital in order to drive strong risk-adjusted ROE with a meaningful spread to our cost of capital.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to David to begin Q&A.\n[Operator Instructions] Natasha, we will now take the first question.\nSummary: ",

Excellence is delivering as well using our enhanced processes and tools, as well as integrated planning between commercial, supply chain and operations we recently piloted changes at the nutrition facility that are on track to unlock a 20 plus percent increase in production capacity at that location.\nI have already resulted in enhancements in customer service, without additional capital spending.\nWe'll be rolling these kinds of improvements out to other locations.\nIn our expand pillar, we're continuing to harvest our investments.\nFor example, year-to-date, our Algar Agro acquisition has tripled its year-over-year operating profit.\nIn a very short time, Algar has grown to be an important component of the South American business.\nWe've successfully expanded production of high-quality USP grade alcohol in Peoria and Clinton to meet high demand for hand sanitizer.\nWe announced the construction of a new state-of-the-art production facility in Spain that will dramatically expand our ability to meet growing demand for probiotics and other consumer products to support health and wellness.\nWe also signed a long-term agreement with Japanese start-up Spiber Inc\nThis project taps into our innovative spirit and capabilities, creating value from across our supply chain from the corn we buy to the dextrose we make to the science and manufacturing technology we have invested in.\nAnd it meets a critical need in the marketplace for both consumer and industrial products that come from sustainable sources.\nOur transformation and growth and our confidence in the future will not be possible without readiness.\nBy the end of the third quarter, our team identified and executed on readiness initiatives that unlocked almost $1.2 billion in run rate benefits.\nAnd now, I'm pleased to announce that we are on track to achieve $1.3 billion by the end of the year.\nReadiness encompasses and supports our entire company.\nIt drives the strategic imperatives that help us fulfill our purpose, such as sustainability.\nWe are advancing our sustainability efforts on many fronts.\nSuch as our Strive 35 goals to improve our performance on greenhouse gases, energy, water and waste.\nReadiness creates growth enablers.\nFor example, we're continuing to elevate our commercial excellence with innovative tools like our consumer insight programs and virtual customer technologies.\nAnd of course, readiness is one of the key elements, powering the growth algorithm we laid out at the beginning of the year, because of its success, along with tremendous progress in our harvest and improved initiatives, we now expect to meet or exceed the high end of our $500 million to $600 million goal for targeted improvements in 2020.\nIn 2014, we started a new journey with the acquisition of WILD Flavors, and the launch of a full-service nutrition business, offering customers a broad array of products and services.\nI could not be more proud of the growth we have seen since then.\nNutrition has delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent year-over-year OP growth.\nRevenue is up 5.7% on a currency-adjusted basis for the first nine months of the year.\nAnd in the years since we acquired WILD, we are nearly tripled OP in the flavors business.\nAs we've been getting more and more questions about that business and its growth potential, we decided that it was the perfect time to update and explain the business further.\nAs Juan mentioned, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.89, up from the $0.77 in the prior year quarter.\nExcluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $849 million, up 11%.\nAnd our trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 8.3%, 255 basis points higher than our 2020 annual lack.\nOur trailing four-quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $3.7 billion.\nOur cash flows are strong, as we generate about $2.3 billion of cash from operations before working capital for the first nine months of the year.\nThe effective tax rate for the third quarter was a benefit of approximately 13% compared to an expense of 19% in the prior year.\nOur Q3 tax rate was impacted by our debt retirement actions as well as the sale of our Walmart shares, and higher year-over-year Walmart earnings and U.S. tax credits.\nAbsent the effect of earnings per share adjusting items, our effective tax rate was approximately 11%.\nWe expect our adjusted tax rate for Q4 to be similar to this adjusted Q3 effective tax rate.\nAs we announced at various points during Q3, we've taken several actions over the last few months to both utilize and enhance our strong balance sheet.\nThese actions were not about cash flow or liquidity as we had cash and available credit capacity at the end of the quarter of almost $10 billion.\nThey were about creating balance sheet optionality for future transactions, while maintaining a strong credit rating profile.\nWe monetized a portion of our Walmart investment through a block sale of Walmart stock, and issuance of bonds exchangeable for Walmart shares at a future date.\nAs we have indicated, we view our significant remaining Walmart stake as strategic, and we do not have any intentions to sell additional shares.\nLeveraging our strong cash position, we also rebalanced our mix between long and short-term debt, economically retiring higher coupon debt through positive NPV transactions and reducing interest payments in the future.\nCombined, these actions allow us the flexibility to make strategic investments, further bolt-on acquisitions or buyback shares when it makes sense to do so, all while continuing to make progress in deleveraging our balance sheet and maintaining our single A credit ratings.\nThese actions were also a significant driver of our tax rate.\nReturn of capital for the first nine months was $724 million, including around $115 million in opportunistic share repurchases, the vast majority of which were executed earlier this year.\nWe finished the quarter with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 27%, down from the 30% a year ago.\nCapital spending for the first nine months was about $560 million.\nWe expect capital spending for the year to be around $800 million that we previously indicated and well below our depreciation and amortization rate of about $1 billion.\nOther business results were lower than the prior year quarter, driven by lower ADM investor services earnings and captive insurance underwriting losses, including a $17 million settlement impact for the high water claim with Ag Services and Oilseeds.\nIn the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $196 million were higher year-over-year, due primarily to variable performance-related incentive compensation accruals, which were low in the prior year.\nCorporate results this quarter also included $396 million related to the early debt retirement charges that I referred to earlier, which is an earnings per share adjustment item.\nNet interest expense for the quarter was similar to the prior year period.\nLooking forward, we expect unallocated corporate expenses to be in line with our initial $800 million guidance for calendar year and Q4 net interest expense to be slightly lower than Q3.\nWe also expect a loss of about $50 million in other business in Q4 due to anticipated intercompany insurance claim settlements.\nAg Services and Oilseeds results were higher than the third quarter of 2019.\nIn Ag Services, we saw extremely good execution around the globe.\nThe North American team did well to capitalize on strong industry export margins and volumes, and the global trade team had another strong quarter as they continued their focus on serving customers.\nAg Services also benefit from a $54 million settlement related to the 2019 US high water insurance claims, which is partially offset by an expense in captive insurance.\nThe crushing team also did a great job executing in a solid demand environment.\nBoth Ag Services and Crushing saw expanding margins during the quarter resulting in around $155 million in total negative timing effects, which led to lower results.\nThose timing impacts are expected to reverse in the coming quarters.\nRefined Products and Other was significantly higher year-over-year, driven by improved biodiesel margins around the globe.\nEquity earnings from Wilmar were substantially higher versus the prior year period.\nLooking ahead, we expect to see strong North American exports in global crush margins in the fourth quarter, combined to contribute to a very strong Ag Services and Oilseeds performance.\nWith results significantly higher than the third quarter of this year, though lower than Q4 of 2019, which included a $270 million benefit for two years of the retroactive biodiesel tax credit.\nCarbohydrate Solutions results were significantly higher year-over-year.\nThe Starches and Sweeteners sub-segment was substantially higher driven by strong risk management and improved net corn costs as well as a balanced ethanol industry supply and demand environment.\nReduced foodservice demand affected sweetener and flower volumes, but we're seeing good demand recovery for starches in North America.\nThe Vantage Corn Processors team did a good job executing on the wet mill fuel ethanol distribution and capitalizing on higher year-over-year industry margins, while managing the fixed costs from the two temporarily idled dry mills, increased volumes and margins on USP grade industrial alcohol to support the hand sanitizer market also contributed to higher year-over-year profits.\nLooking ahead, we expect the fourth quarter for Carbohydrate Solutions to be close to Q3 of this year and substantially higher than the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by improved year-over-year fuel ethanol margins and higher industrial-grade sales.\nWhile Sweetener and Flower volumes will still be impacted by weaker food service demand, we expect the year-over-year percentage decline to be smaller than it was in Q3.\nOn slide eight, Nutrition delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent year-over-year profit growth.\nHuman Nutrition results were substantially higher versus the prior year quarter, with strength across the entire pantry, including flavors, plant-based proteins, and probiotics.\nAnimal Nutrition was also higher year-over-year, driven by continued delivery of Neovia synergies, strengthen livestock and year-over-year improvement in amino acids, partially offset by softer aquaculture feed demand as well as negative foreign currency impacts.\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect nutrition to deliver another quarter of 20-plus percent year-over-year OP growth with a typically seasonally weaker Q4 in human nutrition, offset by seasonally stronger animal nutrition.\nI'd now like to transition to Vince Macciocchi, President of our Nutrition business for an update and overview of the business.\nVince, congratulations to you and your team for not just a great quarter, but for consistent delivery of strong growth.\nI'm proud of the team who have delivered in so many ways.\nWhen I reflect upon the growth we've made in the journey we are still taking, I keep coming back to our purpose, to unlock the power of nature, to enrich the quality of life.\nI think it's remarkable how these few words sum up, not just what we do, but why our work is so important.\nThe global population is growing, and consumer behavior is shifting in ways we couldn't have predicted only 10 or 15 years ago.\nThe scale of the change and the opportunity for ADM is enormous.\nGlobal sales of specialty ingredients across both human and animal nutrition are as much as $85 billion and growing at a rate of 5% to 7% per year.\nThese specialty ingredients, which represent the majority of the nutrition portfolio aside from fee going to the full array of consumer nutrition products for humans and animals, many of which are projected to grow significantly in the coming years.\nFor example, global market for functional beverages could be as large as $190 billion in 2024.\nThe global dietary supplement market could be worth more than $77 billion in that same time frame.\nGlobal retail sales of alternative proteins are already a $25 billion market today, with a projected growth rate of 14% per year.\nGlobal retail sales of pet food are projected to grow at 4% per year, reaching $120 billion by 2024.\nThese aren't just numbers.\nThey're indicators of significant long-term trends in how people choose food, drink and other products, driven by a global population that cares deeply about health and sustainability.\nAnd based upon the portfolio, footprint, capabilities and talent we've built, no other company is positioned to meet these needs and lead in these industries like ADM.\nIt's been six years since we started on this journey.\nIn that time, we built or expanded more than 16 facilities from our pea protein complex in the US through our network of free mix plants in China.\nWe've enhanced our science and technology capabilities, invested in market research and consumer insights and built new interactive ways to engage with customers.\nFrom our more than 50 global customer innovation centers to daily virtual innovation and tasting sessions.\nWe've made platform acquisitions, and we've added bolt-ons.\nAll in all, we have invested just over $6 billion to build our global leadership position in nutrition.\nThese investments are delivering results.\nSince 2014, we've increased our annual revenue by $3 billion.\nAnd by the end of this year, we'll have grown operating profits by more than $300 million over those six years, more than double.\nOur human nutrition business can offer customers ingredients, flavor systems or turnkey product development solutions, supporting them every step of the way to take their ideas from concept to prototype to market in record time.\nIn Animal Nutrition, only 1.5 years after we completed our Neovia acquisition, we can look back on a successful integration in which we exceeded our synergy goals and built a global business that offers a full portfolio of on-trend items from pet treats to enzymes to ingredients for aquaculture to meet evolving customer needs.\nIn our health and wellness business, which is part of our human nutrition subsegment, our scientists are expanding the universe of pro, pre and post biotics and other functional products to meet growing demand from stand-alone supplements to ingredients that help enhance our array of human and animal solutions.\nTaken together, our extremely broad portfolio of ingredients and solutions can add value for customers across both human and animal nutrition.\nFor instance, taste and color are just as important for animal nutrition customers today, as they are for food and beverage customers.\nFunctional ingredients matter in both Human and Animal Nutrition & so on across our entire pantry.\nThen we add the rest of ADM's capabilities.\nIn plant-based protein, for example, we have the unique advantage of ADM's broad and integrated value chain from sourcing and transporting the soybeans and peas to transforming them into high-protein ingredients at our own facilities.\nTo adding the colors, flavors, oils and other key elements to create just the right taste, appearance, juiciness and sizzle for delicious finished plant-based products.\nWe're proud to have come this far in six short years, but our eye is on the future.\nWe are confident in continuing our growth story.\nIt starts with the global category trends I outlined earlier.\nIt continues with our extensive and ongoing research into consumer behavior and needs.\nEarlier this week, we released our latest view of the top consumer trends of 2021 based upon research that includes our proprietary outside voice consumer insights program.\nOur findings show that the events of the past year are accelerating and deepening fundamental market shifts, including consumers taking a more proactive approach to nourishing body and mind, the microbiome as the gateway to wellness.\nContinued growing demand for plant-based foods.\nSustainability is a key driver of purchasing decisions and transparency as a building block of consumer trusts.\nThe last piece of the equation is how our team brings it all together for our customers combining unmatched customer support and service with our vast value chain to deliver ingredients, systems and solution that align perfectly with market trends and needs.\nThese are the reasons we expect to continue to lead the industry outpacing the market and operating profit growth, and we remain confident in reaching $1 billion in OP in the medium-term future.\nAnd congratulations to you and the entire ADM team for another outstanding quarter.\nAcross the enterprise, we are continuing to advance our work to enrich the quality of life and meet key needs for consumers around the globe.\nAt the time of heightened concerns around food security, ADM's bust global value chain is helping ensure that countries and families can continue to put nutritious, delicious foods on the table.\nAs consumers focus more and more on proactive approaches to health, we're expanding the frontier in groundbreaking, functional ingredients and supplements for people with conditions like migraine and atopic dermatitis.\nAnd we're paving the way to a new world of precision nutrition personalized for every individual.\nAnd as sustainability becomes a key driver of consumer decisions and business success, we're playing a leading role in the transition to a low-carbon economy for our industry.\nWe are committed to our purpose, and our team is continuing to deliver for our customers, our shareholders and all could depend on us.\nAnd that is why we are confident in a strong finish to 2020 and a positive momentum continuing through 2021.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Except to the extent required by law, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update earlier statements as a result of new information.\nDespite the ongoing pandemic and most of our team working from home, Hilltop had an unbelievable quarter, with record breaking mortgage earnings that more than offset a sizable and judicious reserve build at the Bank.\nBefore getting into the results of the quarter, I would like to start on Slide 3, and provide an update on our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFrom an operation standpoint, we are very fortunate to have realized Hilltop over the past three years by building a robust holding company and integrating the functional departments of our operating companies.\nThis is enabled us to ensure business continuity while prioritizing the health and safety of our employees.\nWe continue to operate with the majority of our employees working remotely, so that essential staff can work safely from our offices.\nWe are tracking all COVID-19 cases to ensure the quarantine of affected employees and to ensure impacted offices are cleaned so that they can get back open as soon as possible.\nWe are also providing frequent and open communication so that everyone adheres to safety protocols and feel connected.\nWhile we did see an increase in employee cases this past quarter, the overall number remains low and has not had a material impact on our businesses.\nSince the start of the pandemic, we have been in constant contact with our clients to continue to serve their needs, and in particular provide relief and support where required.\nBy partnering with our borrowers that had been impacted by COVID-19, the Bank has provided deferrals on $1 billion of loans of which $619 million were principal only and $349 million for principal and interest for the more severely impacted borrowers.\nAs the initial 90-day deferrals are starting to come due, the Bank has already received requests for approximately $120 million of second-round modification.\nWe will be reviewing each of these requests on a case-by-case basis to ensure they are need-based and assess their viability.\nCertain industries including hotel and restaurants, have been more severely impacted.\nSo we anticipate a large portion of those credits will be requesting second deferral.\nAs well, the Bank booked over 2,800 PPP loans totaling $672 million.\nThis was a huge effort by our bankers, who were able to help many customers in need.\nAs the pandemic persists, we will continue to provide personal banking assistance including the waving of fees, increased daily spending limit and the suspension of residential foreclosure activity.\nMoving to Slide 4.\nFor the second quarter of 2020, Hilltop reported net income of $128.5 million or $1.42 per diluted share resulting in a 3.3% return on average assets and a 23% return on average equity.\nNet income from continuing operations was $97.7 million.\nAs noted at the bottom of the page, the results for National Lloyds this period and the gain on its sale are included in discontinued operations.\nThis quarter illustrates the strength of our businesses and the importance of diversification.\nWith the mortgage and broker-dealer businesses both delivering strong growth from fee income that alleviated the impact of the provision at the Bank.\nFavorable market conditions aided our results, but I'm most proud of our team for working closely together and executing on the opportunities that arose.\nOn June 30, the National Lloyds sales to Align Financial closed for total cash proceeds of $154 million, resulting in a net gain on sale of $32 million, which was non-taxable.\nThis was a great outcome for both parties.\nHilltop also had an important strategic accomplishment in the quarter.\nWith the successful issuance of $200 million of subordinated debt, which further bolsters our liquidity and capital to persevere the current recession and to enhance our position to take advantage of future opportunities.\nAs for managing risk.\nNet charge-offs for the period were $16.4 million, which included $12.5 million that was the oil and gas credit that was reserved for in Q1 2020.\nThe allowance for credit losses increased by $49.6 million this quarter as Hilltop built its loan reserve to reflect the deteriorated economic outlook from Q1 2020.\nWe also continue to enhance our liquidity position and ended the period with $6.6 billion of cash, security and secured borrowing capacity.\nMoving to Slide 5.\nPlainsCapital Bank recorded a pre-tax loss of $17.5 million largely due to our sizable CECL provision of $66 million that was partially offset by stable net interest income and lower operating expenses.\nThe Bank's pre-provision net revenue increased 5% from the second quarter 2019.\nNotably, Jerry and the Bank team did a great job growing PPNR while working tirelessly to process PPP loan and borrower deferral request.\nPrimeLending had an outstanding quarter and generated pre-tax income of $138 million, an increase of $116.5 million from Q2 2019.\nThat was driven by a 54% increase in origination volume and a 35 basis point increase in gain on sale margins.\nSteve Thompson and the entire PrimeLending team worked over time to process the overwhelming volumes and they took advantage of the industry's oversupply by raising prices and retaining servicing.\nHilltopSecurities, increased pre-tax by $6 million to $28 million, driven by profitable growth in the fixed income services and structured finance businesses.\nBrad Winges and the HilltopSecurities team are well under way in raising the caliber and profile of the firm to become the preeminent municipal focused investment bank.\nAdditionally, they completed the major system conversion for HilltopSecurities in the quarter.\nMoving to Slide 6.\nHilltop has a synergistic and durable business model, that is something we have been building toward -- throughout the life of our company.\nThrough acquisitions, we initially integrated our company for capital and funding purposes.\nOver the past three years, we have largely implemented our platform for growth and efficiency initiatives by integrating the shared services departments and executing on efficiency projects to build a scalable platform.\nAnd now with the sale of National Lloyds we have solidified our business model, which is a franchise anchored by PlainsCapital Bank and augmented with powerful fee income businesses in PrimeLending and HilltopSecurities.\nWe have made significant investments in talented professionals and system, and believe we are in a solid position to grow these core businesses.\nI'll start on Page 7.\nAs Jeremy discussed, for the second quarter of 2020, Hilltop reported consolidated net income attributable to common stockholders of $128.5 million, equating to $1.42 per diluted share.\nIncome from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders equated to $97.7 million or $1.08 per diluted share.\nHilltop's continuing operations generated $202 million of pre-provision net revenue or PPNR during the second quarter, which brings the first half of 2020 total PPNR to $302 million.\nPPNR increased by $125 million or 162% versus the prior year period.\nGrowth versus the prior-year period was driven by diversified revenue streams and led by strong mortgage originations.\nDuring the second quarter revenue related to purchase accounting was $3.3 million and expenses were $1.3 million resulting in a net purchase accounting pre-tax impact of $1.9 million for the quarter.\nIn the current period, the purchase accounting expenses largely represent amortization of deposit and other intangible assets related to prior acquisitions.\nWe expect that revenue from purchased loan accretion will continue to decline as the purchase loan portfolio continues to run off.\nFurther, we expect the revenue from purchased loan accretion will average between $3 million and $5 million per quarter for the remainder of 2020.\nGiven the significant growth in earnings, coupled with the successful sale of National Lloyds, and the subordinated debt raise completed during the second quarter Hilltop's capital position has been significantly strengthened as we both address the ongoing impacts of the pandemic and position the company to take advantage of opportunities that may be presented over time.\nHilltop's period end Common Equity Tier 1 ratio equated to 18.46% and the Tier 1 leverage ratio equated to 12.6%.\nI'm moving to Page 8.\nNet interest income from continuing operations for the second quarter equated to $104.6 million and declined by $2.7 million versus the second quarter of 2019.\nThe decline in net interest income was driven by lower purchase loan accretion of $3.2 million offset by interest income from higher loan held for sale and loans held for investment during the quarter.\nDuring Q2, Hilltop's consolidated average earning assets increased by $1.9 billion as the business experienced significant inflows of customer deposits across all product types.\nDeposit growth coupled with planned actions including Hilltop's $200 million subdebt raise, an increase in acquired brokered deposits of approximately $550 million and proceeds from the sale of National Lloyds all contributed to the increase in the ending period balance of cash on deposit at the Federal Reserve which grew by approximately $1.2 billion versus the prior quarter.\nIn addition, the Bank generated PPP loans of $672 million, net of approximately $21 million of deferred fees which will be recognized over the life of loans.\nLastly, the mortgage warehouse lending business generated growth of approximately $120 million versus the prior quarter, as mortgage volumes surged in the second quarter.\nThe second quarter Hilltop consolidated net interest margin equated to 280 basis points and declined by 61 basis points versus the prior quarter.\nThis decline was driven by the aforementioned growth in average earning assets, the build in liquidity as well as lower yields on loans, securities and deposits.\nWe expect that NIM will continue to be pressured in the third quarter, after which we expect that we will begin to see a modest rebound during the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of 2021.\nA significant driver of the improvement will be our efforts to reduce our cash and liquidity position over the second half of the year to between $5 billion and $6 billion.\nWe continue to monitor the capital markets, Hilltop's mortgage volumes and overall market functions related to liquidity and we will continue to balance our excess liquidity against the risk over time.\nTurning to Page 9.\nThe table on the bottom right of Page 9 highlights the liquidity that we maintain at the bank as of June 30.\nThe Bank ended the period with over $6.6 billion of liquidity, including both cash, securities and secured borrowing sources.\nFurther, at period end, the parent maintained $388 million of cash, which equates to approximately 4 times annual expenses, dividends and debt service.\nMoving to Page 10.\nNoninterest income for the second quarter equated to $468 million.\nDuring the period mortgage applications and locks were very robust as PrimeLending locked approximately $7.4 billion in new mortgages.\nThis is a record rate lock quarter for the business and reflected the impact of lower rates and better-than-expected demand for purchase mortgages across our markets.\nThe combination of strong lock-in origination volume and improving gain on sale spreads resulted in mortgage production and fee income increasing by $176 million versus the prior year period.\nDuring the second quarter, gain on sale margins in our mortgage business did expand by 43 basis points versus the first quarter of 2020.\nWe expect the gain on sale margins will move higher during the third quarter to between 430 and 450 basis points.\nFurther, we expect that spreads will remain elevated versus historical levels, but begin to moderate during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nDuring the second quarter, the securities business continued to show solid progress as fixed income capital markets delivered revenue growth of approximately $12 million and structured finance saw market conditions improve and revenue increased by $6.5 million versus the prior year.\nAt the period end, the mark on the structured finance loan pipeline stood at $15 million.\nIt remains important to note, that results from our fixed income and structured finance businesses can be volatile as market rates, spreads and volumes can change significantly from period to period.\nTurning to Page 11.\nNoninterest expenses increased from the same period in the prior year by $66 million to $370 million.\nThe growth in expenses versus the prior year were driven by the increase in variable compensation of approximately $56 million at both PrimeLending and HilltopSecurities.\nThis increase in variable compensation was directly linked to strong fee revenue growth in the quarter compared to the prior year period.\nNon-variable personnel expenses rose versus the prior year by $8 million driven by increases in over time hour at work, notably in our mortgage operations as well as deferred compensation and project labor spend in the period.\nOver the last nine quarters, we continue to make progress in aligning our businesses to the current market conditions and driving efficiencies across the franchise.\nThrough these efforts, headcount, professional service costs and marketing and development expenses continued to trend lower as we make progress against our efficiency and objectives.\nDuring the second quarter, Hilltop incurred $3.5 million in costs on $5.6 million of spend related to our ongoing core system improvement.\nDuring the second quarter, we continued to make progress and are moving into the final stages of implementation of our three core system installations.\nThe new core loan system has been installed throughout the mortgage business.\nThe securities team completed the Phase 1 implementation of the new operating platform HilltopSecurities.\nAnd we have now begun the final deployment of the new general ledger and ERP system across Hilltop.\nWe expect that all of these implementations will deliver significant value to our franchise and position Hilltop for profitable growth in the future.\nI'm turning to Page 12.\nTotal average held for investment loans grew by 9% versus the second quarter of 2019.\nGrowth versus the same period in the prior year was driven by $672 million of net PPP loan originations, coupled with growth in our mortgage warehouse lending business, which experienced growth of approximately $219 million versus the prior year period.\nOther business loans declined versus the first quarter of 2020, as customer demand has remained soft.\nLoan yields have declined over the prior four quarters and continue to decline in the second quarter.\nLower market rates, including the prime rate and LIBOR rates coupled with lower purchase loan accretion has contributed to the yield decline.\nWe do expect that loan yields will continue to be pressured in the coming quarters as market rates remain low and we've added $672 million in PPP loans that yield 100 basis points.\nLastly, our loan pipeline remains stable, but many clients are delaying pricing and funding on new loan commitments until they have greater clarity on the economic impact of the pandemic.\nMoving to Page 13.\nDuring the second quarter, Hilltop continued the process of building excess liquidity to prepare for the potential disruptions that may be caused by the pandemic and support outsized mortgage origination activity.\nSecond quarter average total deposits were approximately $11.2 billion and have increased by $2.2 billion or 25% versus the first quarter of 2020.\nDuring the quarter, the bank swept back to the securities business approximately $200 million in deposit as the securities business can achieve a better return of those funds then the bank can earn on excess cash.\nExcluding the growth from PPP deposits, the subdebt raise and the proceeds from the National Lloyds, customer deposits have continued to grow as customers retain cash until clarity emerges related to the economic activity.\nAs shown in the graph, the bank has been able to deliver growth in noninterest bearing deposits, which increased by approximately $600 million or 21% versus the first quarter of 2020 on an ending balance basis.\nTurning to Page 14.\nDuring this quarter, net charge-offs equated to $16.4 million or 92 basis points of total bank held for investment loans on an annualized basis.\nCharge-offs during the quarter largely represent the final disposition of a single energy credit and the writedown of the assets related to real estate properties that were all reserved for during the first quarter.\nWhile non-performing assets improved as is a percentage of criticized loans in the second quarter, it is important to note that the Bank approved $968 million in COVID-19-related loan modifications during the second quarter, and these deferrals are not reflected in the graph on this page.\nFurther, in the graph on the bottom right, Hilltop allowance for credit losses, the Bank's loans held for investment increased to 2.1% during the quarter.\nAs it relates to the allowance to credit loss to bank loans ratio, if we exclude PPP balances and our collateral maintenance loans, which we believe will have little loss content over time because of the collateral coverage of the loan types which include broker dealer margin and correspondent loans and mortgage warehouse lending loans, the coverage ratio at the end of the period equates to 2.6%.\nI'm turning to Page 15.\nDuring the second quarter, the macroeconomic outlook deteriorated materially from the outlook that we leveraged to evaluate allowance for credit losses during the first quarter.\nWe have presented a few key metrics for comparison in the table at the bottom of this page.\nThe outlook we use as our base case for CECL modeling as of June 30, reflects that GDP will fall significantly in Q2 with a material rebound during the third quarter of 2020 and then a slower, but steady improvement through the end of 2021.\nFurther, our base case assumes US unemployment remains elevated between 8% and 10% through at least Q4 2021.\nThe impact of these economic changes yielded a net allowance build of $60 million in the quarter, including the economic impacts, charge-off, and specific reserves, the allowance for credit losses increased by approximately $50 million in the second quarter.\nIn addition to the changes in economic factors, we incorporated model overlays to reflect ongoing reopening efforts, the potential impacts to the most at-risk portions of the portfolio included -- including the COVID-19 loan modification portfolio as well as the impact of government stimulus.\nAs it relates to future period, it remains very difficult to assess how the economy will react as the pandemic continues over the coming quarters.\nHowever, assuming the economic performance generally aligns with our current base case outlook, the primary factors affecting allowance will be credit portfolio migrations and new loan originations over time.\nAs we've noted in the past, we do expect that allowance for credit losses could be volatile in the future, given the potential for significant shifts in the economic outlook from one reporting period to another.\nTurning to Page 16.\nWe are updating our views of the COVID-19 impacted portfolio to represent those customer loans that requested and received a payment deferral during the period versus the broader portfolio views that we've discussed during the first quarter.\nWe believe that this group of loans represents the highest risk portfolio related to COVID-19 and that the relationship management credit teams are managing these relationships to monitor performance as these clients progress through these very challenging times.\nAs previously mentioned, the Bank approved deferrals for $968 million of loan portfolio representing approximately 13.5% of the total loan portfolio, excluding PPP loans.\nImportantly, $619 million were principal only deferrals and $349 million were principal and interest deferrals.\nIn the table, we provided detail on how the $968 million stratified across industry segments and also the amount of allowance for credit loss in dollars and percent terms prior to these loans as of June 30.\nNotably, the ACL loan coverage on this portfolio is 7.1% as of period end.\nAs of July 24, we have received requests for follow-on deferrals related to $122 million of loans and we'll be evaluating those requests during the third quarter.\nOf the follow-on request, 56% are restaurant and bars and 36% are hotels.\nWe do expect that many of our hotel clients will request additional deferrals as those businesses continue to show significant stress.\nAs well as the case in the first round of deferrals, our top priority is protecting the principle of the bank, while working to aid our clients in progressing through these unprecedented times.\nAny follow-on deferrals will be need-based and our target will be to extend for an additional 90-day period.\nMoving to Page 17.\nDuring the second quarter, the energy portfolio declined by $42 million.\nThe decline was driven by customer pay downs and the final resolution in charge-off of large energy credit we referenced during Q1 of 2020.\nIn total, the energy portfolio represents $104 million of outstanding balances and $59 million of unfunded commitments for a total exposure of $163 million.\nAs of June 30, our allowance for credit losses on the energy portfolio equates to $9 million or 8.7% of the outstanding balance.\nTurning to Page 18.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, PlainsCapital Bank incurred a pre-tax loss of $17.5 million, driven by a $66 million provision expense, as previously reviewed.\nThe quarter's results reflect stable net and noninterest income and ongoing improvement in our operating expenses.\nThe efficiency ratio during the quarter equated to 54% and reflects the ongoing efforts to reduce deposit costs, lower operating costs and drive prudent revenue growth over time.\nDuring the first quarter, and in response to the pandemic and the unknown economic impacts, we suspended the retention of single-family mortgages by the Bank.\nAs we move forward and assuming markets continue to function in an orderly fashion and consumer credit remains stable, we expect to begin retaining PrimeLending originating mortgages during the second-half of 2020.\nTurning to Page 19.\nPrimeLending generated a pre-tax profit of $138 million during the second quarter of 2020, driven by strong origination volumes that increased from the prior year by $2.1 billion or 54%.\nAs noted earlier, gain on sale margins expanded during the second quarter versus the prior year, as market volumes and pricing actions provided for higher spreads.\nDuring the period, refinanced activity represented 47% of total origination.\nFurther, we expect that during the third quarter, the portion of originations that are refinanced transactions, will remain elevated from our historical level.\nDuring the second quarter, Hilltop retained approximately 89% of the mortgage servicing rights related to loans sold during the period.\nBeginning in March and carrying into the second quarter, the market for servicing deteriorated substantially as concerns regarding funding, servicer advances as well as margin requirements escalated as the pandemic accelerated.\nGiven Hilltop's strong liquidity and capital position, we were able to retain the mortgage servicing rights and the asset is now approximately $82 million.\nWe do expect that we will continue retaining a significant portion of the servicing rights for loans sold over the coming quarters and the asset could grow to between $150 million and $175 million by year end.\nThe results of our mortgage business during the quarter were very solid, and we're pleased with how our mortgage origination team is executed under some very challenging circumstances during the second quarter.\nTurning to Page 20.\nHilltopSecurities delivered a pre-tax profit of $28 million in the second quarter of 2020.\nIn the quarter, fixed income services generated solid revenue growth as their traders were able to happily negotiate challenging conditions, both in terms of pricing and liquidity.\nThe performance of the team demonstrates the progress we have and continue to make in this business.\nWe made substantial investments in the team and our broad set of capabilities, and those investments are returning dividends in 2020.\nThe structured finance business delivered growth versus the same period in the prior year of $6.5 million as the secondary markets for mortgage-related bonds improved from the market dislocation in March.\nIt remains important to note the results from our fixed income and structured finance businesses can be volatile as market rates, spreads and volumes can change significantly from period-to-period.\nAs noted earlier, the securities team made significant progress in launching their new operating system during the second quarter.\nWhile this is a significant milestone, the team will continue working over the coming quarters to enhance and optimize the system.\nTurning to Page 21.\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding the economy, specifically related to the pandemic, we're updating our 2020 commentaries, but we're not providing updated guidance or outlook.\nWhile it is not clear exactly how the economy will rebound, or the timeline of that rebound, which we believe will be directly linked to the success in managing the virus and subsequent outbreaks, we remain focused on delivering against those items that we can control.\nWe're committing to the -- we're committed to the ongoing safety of our associates and our clients as well as helping our clients work through these unprecedented challenges that the pandemic has presented us all.\nWe remain committed to executing our platform growth and efficiency initiatives and delivering against our 2021 commitments.\nLastly, and most important, we are focused on delivering prudent growth across all of our business lines, while maintaining a moderate risk profile and delivering long-term shareholder value.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:A little reminder for those of you who may be listening by phone.\nIf you are unable to listen to our entire call today, the conference call will be archived on the company's website for your review at a later date.\nBefore beginning, let's take our usual cautionary reminder.\nSo it's factors can include weather conditions, changes in regulatory policy, competitive pressures, and various other risks that are detailed in the company's SEC reports and filings.\nWe appreciate your continued support and interest in the company.\nToday, I want to give you a quick view of our financial performance supported by commentary on market conditions.\nThen I will turn to the global supply chain, which is a subject of strong interest to most industries.\nI will then ask David to cover financial and operational matters in great detail.\nAfter that I will return with an update on our green solutions and precision application initiatives.\nSo at the -- on Slide four here at the end -- as we ended Q2s conference call, we presented a scorecard on how we did in the first half of '21 versus what we had given at the beginning of the year as our target.\nSo I'm going to update that now through the third and year-to-date through third quarter.\nAnd so with revenue, we were at 25% through the first half through three quarters were exactly still 25%.\nWith our gross profit margin, we were tracking right on 39% through three quarters last year we had slipped a little to 38%, we're still holding at 39% at this point.\nOur operating expenses, you know, we said we would maintain hope to move down slightly if we could as a percent of sales in the first half we had dropped from 35% to 34% and year-to-date, we are now at 33% versus 34%.\nOur interest expense is down now at 20%, so we're attracting certainly below 2020 and believe we'll outperform our initial forecast.\nOn our tax rate, we were 31% versus 23% at -- through the first half, we're now at 27% versus 20% at this point last year.\nWe do expect that rate to drop in the fourth quarter and certainly to meet or exceed our mid-20% range.\nOn our debt to EBITDA, you can see we've dropped from 2.5 times to 2.1 times and as we look at it now, we expect to drop further and probably below the 2 times target that we had drawn out.\nAnd as far as net income is concerned, pretty much the same we were at 86% for the three quarters we're at 87% increase.\nDefinitely a faster rate than our 25% revenue growth and our EBITDA is moving up, as we're now 39% increase from where we were at this time last year.\nSo our strong performance was across all sectors, but our domestic crop business led the way, we benefited from a combination of factors.\nLet me just focus first on commodity prices and I'll start with cotton.\nAnd what we've done is we've measured the price per pound.\nThis is with macro trends as of September 27th of '20 and then comparing that to September 27th of '21, a pretty dramatic increase, it's about 59% increase.\nAnd so this has prompted growers to invest heavy -- more heavily in corn.\nWe've benefited from our corn, I mean, from our cotton insecticides Bidrin, which had a very strong third quarter.\nIn addition, we've had an increase in our cotton defoliant, Folex, which was very strong in the third quarter and we're still seeing orders in -- we saw orders in through October, so that's a big part of our benefit here so far.\nLet's get this back up to where we were.\nSo, soybeans have -- we're at $10.21 a bushel, have increased to $12.85 over that year period, 26% increase.\nYou may recall that we have improved our soybean portfolio with several herbicides we've acquired over the last three years, and as such, soybeans are moving up as a crop for us.\nI think currently or last week we were around 7%, 8%, but -- so it's looking positive for us in that sector.\nAnd then, corn moving from $3.79 a bushel up to $5.42.\nAnd with that, we've seen strong performance with Aztec and our number one corn soil insecticide and IMPACT, which is our number one herbicide -- corn herbicide and we've launched of two new, we had IMPACT C, which was with Atrazine, we've launched off now IMPACT CORE, which is with Seed to [Phonetic] CORE, and SINATE with IMPACT plus glufosinate.\nAnd all four of these are performing well at this point.\nSo our increase overall in the ag sector was up 38% for US crop.\nAnd so that certainly did lead the way for us and this is despite us having logistics issues for our biggest product normally, which is our soil fumigant products where large volume and certainly impacted by the supply chain disruptions.\nOn the remaining sectors, OHP continues to see strong performance, particularly in the markets of the horticulture and plants and in greenhouse activity.\nAMGUARD again professional pest market that is also recovering well.\nAgNova, our Australian business, which is tripled where we were last year.\nAgrinos, which is adding incremental new business.\nMexico is performing well as our other two sectors, Brazil and Central America.\nOverall, these combine to increase17% versus where they were this time last year.\nSo I want to take a second to just talk about supply chain.\nAnd I was at an industry meeting last week, where I was asked to talk a little bit about supply chain from a manufacturing side.\nAnd as I was driving from our plant in Alabama up to the conference in Memphis, I was listening to the radio and the COO of Toyota was talking about specifically the jam that's occurred in the Long Beach Harbor, which is where I grew up.\nAnd he was saying that there are currently 540,000 containers and you're looking at boats here that have about 500 containers on them and 540,000 that are sitting at the port today that have not been -- that are backed up waiting to be unloaded.\nSo that's about 100 vessels and if you go down there, you can see them anchored all up and down the Southern Coast there.\nAnd the current ability to unload at that port is about 18,000 containers a day.\nSo if you looked at it and said, well, I guess in 30 days, we would be able to unload those 540,000 containers, which is true, but the problem is that 29,000 new containers are arriving each day.\nAnd so we're not going the right way and there doesn't seem to be any real solution at the moment.\nSo why is this happening?\nAnd I guess, you know, we talk about maybe a perfect storm that's occurred.\nWe have a shift in buying pattern due to COVID, people got behind, they panicked on certain items.\nSo things shifted around.\nSome items are plentiful, some are short, as you certainly were aware, as you hit your supermarkets or if you try to get a car, anything with circuit boards.\nWe've been operating with the same port capacity for years and generally, being able to kind of make it through, but we just haven't had this bigger shift in buying pattern.\nSame thing with containers, there is limited number of containers and those containers are being delayed as they're sitting waiting to be unloaded or in some cases, the empties are having trouble getting back.\nAnd just a word, we've got products that we were -- we've been trying to ship to Australia and we can't get a truck to take us -- to take it from the 20 miles from our plant down to Long Beach Harbor.\nIf they get there, they're going to wait eight hours and truckers don't particularly want to do that.\nAs such -- lot of the empty containers are just winding up on residential streets throughout the harbor area, as truckers are frustrated and they're just dropping the trailers anywhere and moving on.\nSo, it's created quite a miss and of course, we're dealing with somewhere in that 60,000 to 80,000 truckers short, which makes even once those containers do get offloaded, it gets difficult to actually move them out of the harbor.\nSo what's to be done?\nHow do you deal with it?\nAnd I really, kind of, boil this down to three key factors: first is, production itself.\nWe've got to decide if the product that you're searching for, whether it's intermediate or finished good is going to be produced and when it's going to be produced.\nI'll talk a minute about us dependence on China.\nBut for instance, China has shut down a number of factories for environmental, not necessarily that factor, but production sites.\nAlso, the government is, kind of, prioritizing energy and certain high energy products are not getting permitted to continue for production.\nSo that's putting a squeeze that goes across the world.\nSo first is, can you -- is the product -- can you make that purchase order.\nWe've had products that we've ordered and they've come back and said, you've got to pay more.\nAnd so we say, OK, and then it's like, well, we're not going be able to ship anything.\nSo that's certainly the first thing that you've got to identify, are you going to be able to produce or get the product itself?\nThe second is on logistics, which we talked a little bit about, but those containers that you saw that come over -- last year, we were running about $2,500 to $3,000 per container.\nThis year they've picked up to $26,000 per container and that's just bringing them into the US.\nOnce they are here, then you've got to get it moved from there to your factory or your production site and then from that standpoint, you've got to get it delivered and you've got this shortage of truckers and you've got to try to figure out how you're going to get it, and then how much you're going to pay.\nSo it gets to be sometimes a bidding war.\nIf you want the product to get to point A, how much we'll pay to do it rather than kind of standard fares.\nSo that kind all boils down to maybe -- and the most important point is, let's assume you do get your goods, you clearly need to do quick calculations to understand exactly how much those goods are costing.\nWe're also seeing cost rises in factories as labor wages are going up.\nAnd so we're working with our finance team to look at all SKUs and doing analysis in real-time of what our costs are and making sure that we present those to our commercial product managers, so they have a vision of what's their cost of goods that they're selling.\nAnd so I think the companies that can go through this process will fare the best.\nThere is no real clear vision as to when this disruption I think will cease.\nIt will hit other areas harder than others and will be cyclical.\nAnd so I think you just got to be nimble to understand where this is going.\nSo, on the positive side, again, we're sitting here with six production sites here in North America that gives us the ability to produce and be in a stronger position to handle the instructions.\nI mentioned with China about 8% of our portfolio is dependent on materials from China.\nFew years ago, we've started the process of second sourcing, if we could, outside of China, due to the tariffs, which were pushing up to 31%.\nSecond, we manufacture 46% of our portfolio within our six North American factories.\nHaving these manufacturing facilities gives us both greater independence and the ability to respond quickly to market conditions.\nThird, we order goods from overseas on a comparatively sporadic basis.\nBy contrast, many of our consumer businesses or many of the consumer businesses that's being computing goods, probably and that sort of thing rely upon a steady stream of imported goods.\nNevertheless, we are working closely with our logistics partners to ensure that we can get good from Point A to Point B, and we are ordering good from overseas further and advance sound looking at lesser congested ports, through that means we have been able to manage through the supply chain conditions and at this stage we're optimistic that we will be able to continue to do so without material interruption.\nWith regard to our public filing, I understand from my controller that we are in the file and the queue to file and so I expect that we will file within the half hour or 45 minutes.\nAnd as I have mentioned in previous conference calls, our industry is one that considered critical in all jurisdictions in which we operate and during the pandemic in 2020 and now throughout the nine months of 2021, our business, our customers, our suppliers have all operated without major disruption throughout, so it's been a good place to be during this difficult time.\nAnd this is our quarterly sales performance, you can see that our sales have increased, as Eric mentioned since the first -- the third quarter of 2020.\nOverall, our sales were up about $30 million to a $147 million, that's a 25% increase over the prior year.\nOur US sales were up about 33% or $22 million and our international sales were up about 16% or $8 million.\nAnd because of the very strong US performance, despite the strong international performance, our international sales reduced to about 40% of total sales, whereas this time last year there were at about 43%.\nAnd during the third quarter of 2021, our production performance has been much better this was we expected.\nAnd that has an impact on our gross margin performance and when I look at the crop business, our gross margin performance improved by about 50%, including the impact of the recovery of [Indecipherable] in the factory.\nAnd our non-crop business had significant mix changes in 2021 in comparison to the prior year.\nWith some higher margin business happening earlier in the year in 2020, as compared to this year.\nAnd as a result, our margins have remained comparatively flat in the quarter.\nFor international sales gross margin improved, as compared to the prior year and is primarily the result of the addition of businesses acquired late in 2020, which generate margins higher than our pre-existing business performance.\nI particularly like this graph, because I think it gives a quick way of visualizing the impact of the factory performance has on our results.\nAnd you can see that in the third quarter of 2021, on the far right of the graph, our factories cost is about 1.2% of net sales on the recovery and that compares, if you look back a couple of quarters to the third quarter of 2020, you will see that the cost amounted to 2.5% and that's just a reflection of the kind of activity that we managed to record in the factory in this third quarter.\nOperating expenses increased by about 24% and that amounted to $9 million.\nOur newly acquired businesses accounted for about 14% of the increase and freight accounted for 17%, and then the balance was incentive compensation linked to financial performance, some legal expenses, and increased marketing costs.\nAnd overall our opex as a percentage of sales remained steady at 33%.\nOur operating income in the third quarter was up 112% versus last year.\nIn addition, we made some immaterial adverse changes in the value of two investments we've had for some time.\nAs Eric mentioned, our interest expense continues to track about 24% below the prior year.\nOur tax rate is a little higher than last year, primarily as a result of the strong taxable income in comparison to the prior year.\nAnd finally, our bottom line is about $5.5 million, which is up 88% in comparison to the prior year.\nFor the first nine months of 2021, our sales were up 25%.\nGross margin in absolute terms are up 27%.\nAll our main activities in US crop, US non-crop and international, contributed to this exciting performance.\nOur operating expenses increased primarily as a result of the new businesses acquired in the final quarter of 2020, increased performance linked incentive compensation, legal costs, some increases in travel and costs associated with the volume changes, such as freight and warehouse costs.\nOverall, operating costs were up 22%, as compared to the net sales increase I mentioned a moment ago of 25%, and operating costs, compared to sales improved 33% in 2021, as compared to 34% last year.\nInterest expenses reduced by 23% as a result of cash generated over the last 12 months, and overall, our net income has increased by 87%.\nNow, I'd like to turn my attention to the balance sheet.\nAs you can see from this slide, during the third quarter, we increased cash generated from operations by 56%, as compared to the same quarter of the prior year.\nFurther, you can see that the movements on working capital was in line with the prior year and this performance includes the expanded scope related to the businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nOverall, net cash from operations increased by 34%.\nAt the end of September 2021, our inventories were about $167 million, as compared to $176 million this time last year.\nIf for a moment, we exclude the impact of products and entities acquired since December 2019, which accounted for $10 million of inventory at the end of Q3, our base inventory decreased by 11% from this time last year.\nSo we feel that we have controlled inventory well during this phase of the company's annual cycle.\nOur current inventory target for the end of the financial year remains at $155 million that compares with $164 million at the end of 2020.\nThat target is, obviously, dependent on a few things, including a continued low impact from the pandemic, normal weather patterns, and no more acquisitions this year.\nWith regard to liquidity, under the terms of the credit facility agreement, the company uses consolidated EBITDA as defined in that agreement to determine leverage.\nOur consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four quarters to September 30th, 2021, was $66 million, as compared to $49 million for the four quarters to September 30th, 2020.\nThis taken in conjunction with outstanding indebtedness translates to borrowing availability amounting to $95 million at the end of September 30th, 2021, as compared to $45 million at the same time last year.\nAs you can see from this chart, we've been controlling debt well even as we work through the annual cycle and as we continue to invest in the business for the future.\nOverall, in summary then, the second -- the third quarter of 2021, we have increased sales by 25%, improved overall margins, we have managed operating expenses, which increased in absolute terms, but declined when expressed as a percentage of sales, our net income increased by 88%.\nWe have a similar story for the first nine months of 2021, we increased sales by 25%, gross margins by 24%, operating costs have reduced when compared to net sales, our interest expense is down and net income has improved by 87%.\nFrom a balance sheet perspective, accounts receivables increased driven by strong sales, inventories have been well-controlled, working capital has been held flat during the quarter and debt is lower than this time last year.\nDespite three acquisitions in the intervening 12-months.\nAnd finally, our liquidity position has improved significantly.\nWith that, I will hand back to Eric.\nAnd recently, in quarterly earnings calls, we've provided updated information on our two strategic growth initiatives in green solutions and prescriptive application technology.\nSo let me just go into green solutions.\nSo we mentioned last time that we have, kind of, grown our technology on the green solutions and we've now -- see that we've got 100 different products in our expanding portfolio.\nSo in this slide, we break out the functional categories of our offerings.\nAs you can see, it's a balanced range of solutions with a strong emphasis on bio-fertilizers, bio-stimulants, bio-pesticides, and micronutrients.\nThese products allow us to offer not only our traditional crop protection, kind of, defensive products but beneficial plant nutrition and soil health amendments, as well and so we've developed quite a balanced and growing portfolio.\nSo green solutions has posted steady recent growth as seen on this slide.\nFor Q3, we increased about $10 million, which is 26% increase from Q2.\nAnd I think most of -- a good portion of that growth anyway was attributed to increased sales in LatAm, Brazil, India, and Australia.\nYear-to-date, our revenue is at just $27 million and for the full-year, we're up in our forecast from the $32 million to $35 million range.\nWe're now sticking somewhere in that $35 million to $37 million range.\nAnd of that, about $10 million is coming from.\nLatAm, which is our largest so far.\nSo when you look through what we're focusing on and keeping our eyes on the targets of what we're trying to do in expansion, we've got registrations underway in LatAm, the Columbia business has been transitioned over completed and working well.\nWe've got a pipeline building for further distribution in Europe and Africa.\nWe've got our US group that's looked at opportunities now for some significant increases in '22.\nAnd part of that's a result of the 1,500 spot trials we mentioned last time that we were doing in '21, which are basically looking to benefit in the '22 period.\nWe've also linked this with our SIMPAS trials where we're introducing iNvigorate, which again is a nitrogen fixation product that looks extremely promising.\nWe've got turf and ornamental, our trials are near completion at this point.\nWe've got large scale customer demo plots that we're doing.\nAgain, looking for a pickup for next year.\nWithin then AMGUARD, we mentioned before, our bioherbicide product that we are looking for both consumer and professional pest use on our way to potentially developing for agricultural use.\nThis is significant given Bayer's decision to exit the consumer market through -- at least, domestically through Scotts with RoundUp the kind of leading herbicide in that space.\nSo we see demand for solutions, strong and we think we're well-positioned there.\nWe think Greenplants, which we acquired as part of Agricenter in the latter part of 2017, we knew we had some strong products with which to expand, but it has taken us a while to work that into our other areas.\nAnd we recently moved product into China, and Colombia.\nWe have got other areas down in Australia where we think we've got some strong growth potential.\nBi-PA, which is a consortium in Belgium that we became part of six, seven years ago, maybe, David?\nAnd we've got really our first product that's come out of that.\nIt's a biofungicide that's called Vintec, originally developed in Europe for grapes.\nThey tried this on grapes and -- but we've seen some very strong activity in almonds, and we received our registration in California recently.\nThere's over 1 million acres of almonds in California, and we think we've got a nice fit for a biotreatment for canker, a particular disease that hits almonds.\nAnd we're also doing testing in bananas in Central America that also is looking promising and we're hoping to get registrations there as well.\nSo I guess what we're saying here is, it's a modest change just that we're looking -- kind of moving the needle a few million dollars up in '21 on our target which basically we're looking to double that in the next couple of years and then double that in the next couple of years as well.\nSo it's an aggressive growth, but given all the products that we have and the development work we're doing, the high demand for solutions in that space, currently, we're feeling that our forecast is looking good.\nShifting over to SIMPAS, again, you guys have seen how this graphic demonstrates how the system works.\nDuring our last call, we've updated our forecast revenue for SIMPAS through '25.\nAt this point, the forecast remains unchanged.\nWhat we did do since our last call, as we talked about that we were going to be reaching out to progressive retailers to then focus on their precision farmers begin that shift to prescription application of crop inputs.\nAnd so, with this, we've identified a number of retailers that fit this.\nWe've got over a dozen retailers so far that have entered into agreements for distribution of SIMPAS with us.\nWe expect that, that number to double over the next few months and we've identified I think there is 26 here mostly in the Midwest, but also we've got five retailers in the South.\nSo I guess one question is what's in it for a retailer?\nSorry about that, so these retail partners can provide agronomy and prescription software capabilities needed for targeting SIMPAS inputs of crop protection, plant nutrition, and the soil health fertility enhancements.\nWith this on-the-ground template, SIMPAS can dispense and deposit ingredients that will give the grower maximum yield, minimum cost, elevated return on investment, and beneficial environmental outcomes.\nThese precision ag services help build a strong bond between the grower and the retailer creating a long-term business loyalty.\nKind of one final point that I want to make as we showed this slide before about the attention of the Ultimus software data retention that's part of SIMPAS, which allows concrete documentation through MDR to beneficial agricultural treatment practices.\nAs we pointed out in the emerging carbon credit market, the ability to authoritatively validate such beneficial practices can facilitate securing financial compensation that could substantially offset the investment outlay in adopting technologies such as SIMPAS.\nSo we are working with USDA on sharing this technology, which they were very excited about and they asked us or invited us to apply for a grant and which is under the Agricultural Innovation Center for Program of USDA, and we did get the grant at the end of September.\nA decision-making process is somewhere in that two to eight months, so we expect a decision by Q2 of '22.\nBut this grant that we submitted is for nitrogen reduction by using a SIMPAS Ultimus system, decreasing the use of synthetic fertilizer and in its place applying soil health products.\nSo Ultimus gives the carbon credit program a way to verify, measure, and validate what the grower is doing to qualify for the credits.\nWhen linked to the permanent ledger, since it's blockchain, Ultimus makes an immutable record of everything that was applied to the field by volume and by location.\nAs I've mentioned before, we know of no one else in our industry that has climate-friendly technology as comprehensive of our SIMPAS Ultimus system, particularly when used to dispense our green solutions.\nSo let me end these comments by letting somebody else have the last word.\nThis quote is from Jason Ore, who is an Ore Farms in Iowa and a happy user, I think he has been in the last year or two with SIMPAS and so his words are, the opportunities are endless.\nI can foresee in the future dozens of SIMPAS supplied solutions being applied this way.\nThis is going to change the way we producers look at in-furrow application.\nSo with that, I'd like to open it up to any questions you may have.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time.\nSo, we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to one.\nSince 2016, Virgil has been a beloved member of the Nike, Jordan and Converse family.\nHe was a brilliant creative force who shared a passion for challenging the status quo and pushing forward a new vision, while inspiring multiple generations along the way.\nBut what stood out to me personally about Virgil, was his humility and humanity.\nWe offer our condolences to the many who shared a connection with Virgil.\nHe will be missed greatly.\nAs we look at Q2, the creativity and resilience of our entire NIKE, Inc. team helped deliver another strong quarter.\nThe results we delivered offer continued proof that our strategy is working, even as we execute through global macroeconomic constraints.\nWhenever there's turbulence, I always go back to the fundamentals and for Nike, that means putting the consumer at the center and leveraging our long-term competitive advantages, which include a culture deeply rooted in innovation, a brand that deeply connects with consumers, fueled by compelling storytelling, and an unmatched sports marketing portfolio and we believe a fourth emerging competitive advantage for us is Digital, as we are one of the few brands that can directly connect with and serve consumers at scale.\nWe also continue to benefit from structural tailwinds that have accelerated during the pandemic.\nTailwinds that include a larger movement of health and fitness that is taking place around the world, consumers' desire to wear athletic footwear and apparel in all moments of their lives and an expanding definition of sport, and last, the fundamental shift in consumer behavior toward digital plays to our increasing digital advantage.\nAs I've said before, challenges create opportunities for strong brands to get stronger and that's what's happening here.\nAnd we are now in a much stronger competitive position today than we were 18 months ago, and that trend continues.\nWe are seeing this strength come to life this holiday season.\nOur brands' deep connection with the consumer is driving strong holiday sales, most notably with North American Digital leading the industry over Black Friday week, with close to 40% growth.\nAnd our Singles Day performance showcased our brand strength in greater China as we added 13 million new members, and Nike was again the number one sport brand on TMall.\nMore broadly, this holiday season has shown the power of our digital transformation across the globe.\nDigital is the engine driving our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy.\nAnd Q2 was another incredible quarter for sport led by our deep roster of athletes and teams.\nLet me just touch on a few of the highlights from the quarter.\nFollowing the exciting end of the WNBA and MLB seasons, the energy around sport continues with the NBA, NFL, European soccer and upcoming college football bowl season, where 16 of the top 20 teams and three out of the four Playoff participants are Nike teams.\nWhen these leagues are as exciting as they are today, our business benefits.\nNike athletes continue to lead the way across the sports landscape, highlighted by Barcelona captain Alexia Putellas, who won the Ballon d'Or as the best female footballer in 2021.\nWe were also thrilled to see Marcus Rashford receive his MBE from Prince William last month, an honor very well deserved for his work to support vulnerable children during the pandemic.\nAnd congratulations to Cristiano Ronaldo for reaching yet another remarkable milestone by becoming the first player in recorded history to score 800 career goals in official matches.\nAnd I also have to give a special shout-out to Shalane Flanagan who was wearing the Nike Air Zoom Alphafly Next%, when she completed the six World Marathon Majors in six weeks running each of them in under two hours and forty-seven minutes.\nThis achievement offers all of us a reminder of the joy and unrelenting spirit of sport.\nAs we deliver against our Consumer Direct Acceleration Strategy, we continue to drive separation as the most innovative sports brand by delivering a constant pipeline of new products that sets the standard and what's more, we're aligning against our key growth drivers of Women's, Jordan and Apparel, as well as to our commitments to sustainability.\nIn Women's, we launched a brand new shoe designed specifically for dancers.\nThe Nike Air Sesh, was designed by Tinker Hatfield, in collaboration with professional dancers and it choreographers prioritizes both style and performance with a mid-cut leather upper and a cushion foam under the foot.\nWe launched the Air Sesh for Nike members first, with a wider release to take place soon.\nAs we continue to accelerate our strategy and fuel the expanded definition of sport, we are able to more deeply connect with women and create an even sharper focus.\nAnd this quarter also saw the debut collection from the Serena Williams Design Crew, our apprenticeship program that advances diversity in design.\nThe Crew connects innovation, design and purpose in a uniquely powerful way, fueled by our commitment to the full spectrum of sport for women, across performance and lifestyle.\nSerena joined us on campus a few months back to help open the Serena Williams Building at our World Headquarters.\nAlong with our LeBron James Innovation Center, these two buildings represent the most remarkable investment in sport innovation in the world.\nWe were also thrilled to see the Jordan Brand launch the AJ36.\nThe AJ36 is NIKE Inc.'s first shoe using leno-weave, a process that creates material that is uniquely strong, lightweight and adaptable to all foot shapes making the AJ36 one of the lightest Air Jordans ever.\nConsumers can expect to see us iterate on this innovation in future seasons.\nIn Apparel, we're driving energy in the market through design that resonates with consumers.\nThe latest NBA City Edition and MLB City Connect uniforms are great examples as we grow the culture of the sport by listening to local team communities and using thoughtful design to celebrate the game.\nWe also launched FIT ADV, the next generation of performance apparel that combines weather-ready tech and innovative design to help athletes take on extreme conditions.\nThis represents the pinnacle of Nike apparel innovation and is currently in Nike's performance apparel collections.\nAnd next year, it will be available in Nike lifestyle products across all platforms.\nAnd finally in sustainability, we launched Alphafly Next Nature, our most sustainable performance shoe and our first sustainable performance running shoe.\nThis continues the progress made by our Cosmic Unity sustainable basketball shoe by reaching more than 50% total recycled content by weight.\nLearnings from the Alphafly Next Nature will be scaled across our running line, creating higher performing products with more sustainable materials.\nWe know the future of sport depends on a healthy planet and we remain committed to doing our part to protect that future.\nAs we connect consumers with the strongest innovation, athlete roster and brand storytelling in the world, we are also elevating their experience through One Nike Marketplace.\nWe are creating the marketplace of the future, where we serve consumers with seamless, consistent, and premium experiences.\nThrough Nike membership, we increasingly know and serve our consumer across a connected marketplace.\nI'd like to highlight three examples from this quarter of how Nike is driving a more elevated and premium member experience across the marketplace.\nFirst, we recently launched new wellness content and workouts featuring Megan The Stallion in our Nike Training Club app.\nMegan's content drove record high engagement, drawing 2 times increase in daily active users in NTC, and her curated looks saw more than double the demand, compared to any other product content viewed during that same time period.\nSecond, ahead of Singles Day in Greater China, we activated a new member experience on TMall and improved the onboarding journey.\nAs a result, the Nike Flagship store on TMall was the number one brand for new member recruitment across sport, driving a 20 point increase in member demand penetration this year.\nAnd third, just last month, we announced a partnership with one of our strategic retail partners, Dick's Sporting Goods, who shares our vision for the future of retail specifically, shopping and experiences that are amplified by digital and personal to each consumer's journey.\nThis new partnership allows shoppers to link their Nike member account and their DSG account together to unlock exclusive offers, products and experiences.\nRecently, I had an opportunity to visit one of DSG's newest concepts, the House of Sport door in Rochester, NY.\nI must say I was blown away at the store's unique service model, interactive sport experience and enhanced showcasing of product, which creates a true destination for consumers and will alter future expectations at retail.\nOur partnership with DSG is a new model for how brands and retailers work together delivering product, experience, and connection service to delight consumers at scale.\nWe are fulfilling our vision, that through connected member experiences and inventory, powered by connected data and technology, we can provide consumers with greater access to the very best of Nike with more speed, convenience and connection to our brand and sport than ever before.\nAs we look forward there is even more opportunity to connect consumers with Nike across digital platforms that integrate sport, innovation, culture, and commerce.\nFor example, we recently opened a new space in our New York digital studio to produce the weekly Sneakers livestreams that are driving industry leading engagement metrics.\nWeekly content includes launch previews in our Sneakers Live Heating Up show, and a new Jordan franchise presented through the lens of female Jordan fans, called J-Walking.\nOur stories go deep and engage a two-way interaction with the community.\nAs a result, our consumer engagement is 3 times the industry average for livestreams.\nAnd speaking of Sneakers and Jordan, the first set of invitations for the AJ11 Cool Grey was sent to the largest female-focused group yet and sold out in the first hour.\nThe group was selected utilizing our new Dedication Score designed to reward member groups with high product affinity.\nWe continue to see exclusive access serve as a defining marketing mechanism to connect with consumers.\nIn Q2, we also launched the 3D immersive world of NIKELAND on Roblox.\nNike is meeting young athletes wherever they are, encouraging them to let their imaginations run wild and rewarding real-world movement through new virtual experiences.\nThe Nike, Jordan and Converse brands have always thrived at the intersection of sport, creativity, innovation and culture.\nThe RTFKT acquisition allows us to extend this reach to serve and delight consumers and creators in both the physical and virtual worlds.\nWe will invest in the very talented RTFKT team, creator community and cutting-edge innovation to deliver next generation experiences that involve the RTFKT and NIKE Inc. brands.\nToday, we are stronger than we were before the pandemic, and I couldn't be more excited by the opportunity ahead of us.\nOur results this quarter are evidence that our strategy is working.\nThrough all we've navigated, this team has worked together with creativity and resilience to serve our consumers and serve our communities.\nAs you've heard us say before, Nike is a growth company with boundless potential.\nAnd our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy is transforming our operating model by driving deeper and more direct connections with consumers through digital.\nOur teams continue to navigate through unprecedented levels of volatility with flexibility, agility and grace, leveraging the operational playbook we created at the onset of the pandemic to stay focused on what matters most.\nWe have embraced new ways of working, elevated experienced players into new leadership roles, reorganized the company to create even deeper focus on the consumer, and developed new capabilities to serve consumers directly with speed and at scale.\nNike's second quarter financial results were in line with the expectations we established 90 days ago, fueled by continued Brand momentum, the strength of our product franchises with extraordinary levels of full price realization, and strong season-to-date Holiday sales, offset by lower levels of available inventory supply relative to marketplace demand.\nAs John mentioned, we had an incredible Black Friday week with Nike Direct in North America and EMEA increasing over 20% versus the prior year, on top of last year's meaningful gains.\nTo accomplish this, I'm particularly proud of the work by our supply chain teams.\nIn late October, I was able to visit our North America distribution centers in Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Mississippi, to review our expanding digital fulfillment capabilities and holiday readiness plans.\nOur teams are executing those plans with precision, optimizing available inventory to meet demand with improved service levels and lowering carbon impact, all enabled through technology and automation.\nStaying on the topic of supply chain a little longer.\nFactory reopening in Vietnam is on plan.\nNearly all impacted factories began reopening in October.\nAs of today, all factories are operational and employee attendance rates have improved, with weekly footwear and apparel production now at roughly 80% of pre-closure volumes.\nIn total, Vietnam factory closures caused us to cancel production of roughly 130 million units due to three months of lost production volume and several months to ramp back to full production.\nCompared to ninety days ago, we are increasingly confident supply will normalize heading into fiscal '23.\nTurning to our digital business.\nNike's digital growth is outperforming comparisons and being fueled by our member-centric focus.\nNike Digital grew 11% in the quarter, on a currency neutral basis, setting the pace for the industry.\nNike Digital is now 25% of total NIKE Brand revenue, up 3 points versus the prior year and more than double the digital mix in fiscal '19.\nEnhanced onboarding experiences are attracting millions of new members into the top of the funnel, and we are focused heavily on member engagement and buying.\nMember engagement grew 27% and repeat buyers grew 50% versus last year, driving overall higher AUR, AOV and member buying frequency.\n40% of total digital demand this year is coming from our mobile apps, highlighting the strength of our digital platform.\nWe now have over 79 million engaged members across our Nike ecosystem.\nAnd as Nike's digital ecosystem continues to grow, we are beginning to see the compounding benefits of scale from brand awareness and consumer connection, to data informed personalization and inventory utilization, to loyalty.\nThis quarter, we held our first globally coordinated Member Days event, setting records in member engagement.\nFrom member exclusive product offerings to our first livestreamed member events from our Nike Town London and Passeig de Gracia Store in Barcelona, we created a distinct member experience and set a record for weekly active users on the Nike App in North America.\nNow moving to one final topic.\nConnecting with today's consumer means serving them with the product they want when and where they want it.\nConsumers want a premium, seamless and personalized experience, with minimal friction across their journey to explore, engage, connect and purchase products from the brands they love.\nAs we've discussed before, Nike is focused on creating One Nike Marketplace that elevates the brand by creating direct consumer connections through fewer, more impactful wholesale partners, with a connected mobile digital experience at the center built for the Nike member.\nOver the past four years, North America has reduced the number of wholesale accounts by roughly 50%, while delivering strong growth and recapturing consumer demand through Nike Direct and our strategic wholesale partners leading the way for Nike.\nIn the second quarter, North America Digital grew 40% versus the prior year, pushing Nike Digital to 30% of total North America marketplace, bringing Nike Direct to 48% of total.\nIn order to enable this growth and drive the shift in marketplace composition, we have accelerated investment to evolve our distribution network and scale a digital first supply chain, leveraging advanced analytics, automation and technology.\nWe have opened two new regional service centers on both coasts, which are able to deliver more units to consumers with shorter delivery times.\nWe also enabled ship from store capabilities across our store fleet, all leveraging advanced analytics from our Celect acquisition.\nOn automation, we have added more than 1,000 robots in our distribution centers to handle the digital growth.\nIn our digital distribution center in Memphis, robots handled more than 10 million units that would have otherwise required manual labor.\nWe continue to scale O2O consumer services across our store fleet, including buy online, pick up in store, and digital order returns in store.\nVolumes are relatively small today, but we have significant opportunity to scale.\nWe have also established new fulfillment models with key strategic partners to create inventory visibility across the marketplace and optimize full price digital demand.\nWhen we do this right, the consumer wins.\nThe progress being made to create One Nike Marketplace has accelerated North America's revenue growth and gross margin expansion for yet another quarter, illustrating how Consumer Direct Acceleration will fuel Nike's growth and profitability toward the fiscal '25 outlook we shared in June.\nNow let me turn to the details of our second quarter financial results and operating segment performance.\nNIKE, Inc. revenue grew 1% and was flat on a currency neutral basis, led by 8% growth in Nike Direct offset by a 6% decline in wholesale, due to optimization of available inventory supply.\nNike Digital grew 11% and Nike-owned stores grew 4% with significant improvements in traffic and higher conversion rates.\nGross Margin increased 280 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by higher Nike Direct margins due to lower markdowns, higher full price mix and foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased freight and logistics costs.\nSG&A grew 15% versus the prior year primarily due to normalization of spend against brand campaigns, digital marketing investments to support heightened digital demand, strategic technology investments and wage related expenses.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.9% compared to 14.1% for the same period last year.\nThis was due to a shift in our earnings mix and the effects of stock-based compensation.\nSecond quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.83, up 6% versus the prior year.\nBefore we move into operating segment results, I want to recall a few points I made last quarter regarding the impact of Vietnam factory closures on the short-term performance of each of our geographies, beginning in the second quarter.\nNorth America and EMEA finished the first quarter with high levels of in transit inventory, resulting in prior season supply that was arriving late due to longer transit times, which could be sold in the second quarter.\nWe saw that in our Q2 results.\nHowever, Greater China and APLA, located closer to our sourcing base with shorter standard transit times, experienced a decline in units sold in the second quarter due to lost production and lower available inventory supply.\nWe also saw that reflected in our Q2 results.\nWith that in mind, let's review the operating segments.\nIn North America, Q2 revenue grew 12% and EBIT grew 21%.\nDemand for Nike remained incredibly strong, with season-to-date holiday retail sales across the total market growing double-digits, energized by the continued momentum from the return to sport and the beginning of an outstanding holiday season.\nPerformance sport dimensions delivered strong double-digit retail sales growth, led by Running, Fitness, and Basketball, on lower levels of sell-in due to available inventory supply.\nWomens retail sales grew high double-digits, more than twice the rate of men's, with strong growth across both footwear and apparel.\nNike Direct had an outstanding quarter, growing 30% versus the prior year.\nAs I mentioned earlier, Digital maintained its momentum growing 40% and setting holiday records on Black Friday week.\nNike-owned stores also delivered strong double digit growth, with traffic trending toward pre-pandemic levels, and strong increases in AUR, due to lower closeout inventory levels and significant year-over-year improvements in markdown rates and promotions.\nDespite strong retail sales momentum in the wholesale channel, revenue declined 1% as marketplace inventory levels remain lean, and Vietnam factory closures and longer transit times disrupt the flow of inventory supply to meet marketplace demand.\nIn EMEA, Q2 revenue grew 6% on a currency neutral basis and EBIT grew 22% on a reported basis.\nSeason-to-date holiday retail sales across the total market grew double-digits, with strong growth across all consumer segments.\nThe region was energized by the start of the global football season and the Champions League tournament across the continent.\nNike players continue to dominate on the pitch with the Mercurial boot being the lead scorer in a number of European professional leagues.\nWe saw a strong consumer response for the Mercurial boot and launch of the Champions League third kit.\nWholesale revenue grew 6% on a currency neutral basis as we comp prior year market closures.\nNike Direct also grew 6% led by double digit growth in Nike-owned stores as we comp prior year store closures, with traffic improvement due to tourism picking up and back to school holidays.\nNike Digital was down 1% as we compare to extraordinary levels of off price sales in the prior year, as the geography leveraged digital in the prior year to liquidate excess inventory.\nThis quarter, our full price Digital business grew over 20%, resulting in a 30 point improvement in full prices sales mix, double-digit growth in AUR and improvement in markdown rates and promotions.\nThis contributed to strong year-over-year expansion in gross margin and return on sales profitability.\nIn Greater China, Q2 revenue declined 24% on a currency neutral basis and EBIT declined 36% on a reported basis, however, season-to-date holiday retail sales across the total market have trended more favorably.\nResults for this quarter were as expected, as we navigated lower full price product supply due to the Vietnam factory closures.\nWe saw disproportionate impacts to our wholesale revenue, which declined 27% on a currency neutral basis.\nNike Direct declined 21%, with declines in both digital and physical retail channels.\nCOVID-related lockdowns continue to drive volatility in retail traffic, however, we did see traffic recover to pre-pandemic levels at times throughout the quarter.\nDigital declined 27%, partially impacted by delay in product launch timing on Sneakers.\nOver the 11.11 consumer moment, we drove stronger digital performance with significant member acquisition and higher AOV through better engagement with consumers.\nWhile challenging, we continue to leverage our operational playbook and remain optimistic about the longer term in Greater China.\nThis quarter, we extended our Joy of Sport brand campaign, utilizing local influencers, Olympians and other athletes that are part of Nike's leading sports marketing portfolio in Greater China.\nThe Jordan brand added to the energy by announcing their first female athlete signing in Asia, with basketball player Yang Shu Yu.\nTo support this activity and normalize our marketing investment levels, we increased our investment in demand creation in the second quarter by more than 40% versus the prior year.\nOur local team remains focused on creating distinctive and authentic connections with Chinese consumers.\nWe celebrated the 40th anniversary of Nike's operations in China by using the Express Lane to reintroduce the original Nai-ke collection, with robust storytelling on the history and heritage of these iconic products.\nDuring our first launch, all product sold through in the first hour.\nWe will continue to expand the Express Lane to bring unique, localized offerings to the consumer, leveraging our most popular global product franchises to drive uniquely Nike energy in the marketplace.\nWe see encouraging signs in Greater China and while inventory supply has been a major disruption in the marketplace, we continue to expect fiscal '22 to be a year of recovery.\nHaving said that, we expect to see sequential improvement from here, beginning in the third quarter.\nNow moving to APLA.\nQ2 revenue declined 6% on a currency neutral basis and EBIT declined 8% on a reported basis.\nDouble-digit revenue growth, on a currency neutral basis, in SOCO was offset by declines in Asia Pacific territories which faced a greater impact from Vietnam factory closures as well as the business model shift in Brazil.\nSeason-to-date holiday retail sales across the total market grew versus the prior year, despite supply disruptions and door closures in SEA&I and Pacific.\nNike Direct grew 6%, led by Nike Digital growth of 25%.\nOur teams maximized market moments with all territories delivering successful Member Days and locally relevant activations including Singles Day in South East Asia, Buen Fin in Mexico and Cyber Week in Japan.\nMexico's digital business more than doubled as we enabled a localized assortment and fulfillment capabilities through the Nike App.\nFinally, APLA continues to leverage the Express Lane, their digital ecosystem and global partnerships to create locally relevant product and meaningful engagement with consumers around the world.\nConsumers in APLA are highly connected, and our team continues to innovate on digital experiences that are locally relevant.\nThe Dia De Los Muertos footwear pack saw 100% sell through and this story was extended to the world through our new partnership with Roblox.\nNow let's turn to our financial outlook.\nAs we approach the end of the second year of the pandemic, it is becoming even more challenging to compare quarters and fiscal years due to multiple waves of COVID-related disruption at different times, across the consumer marketplace and now supply chain.\nWe expect the operating environment to remain volatile as COVID-variants continue to cause disruption to business operations.\nOur fiscal '22 financial outlook reflects inventory supply significantly lagging consumer demand across Nike's portfolio of brands.\nHowever, Nike's long-term market opportunity is larger than ever, and so we remain focused on what we can control in the short-term and on where we are heading through our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy and on what is required to deliver on our fiscal '25 financial outlook.\nSpecifically for fiscal '22, we continue to expect Revenue to grow mid single-digits versus the prior year, in line with guidance from 90 days ago.\nFor Q3, we expect revenue to grow low single-digits versus the prior year, due to the ongoing impact from lost production from COVID-related disruptions in Vietnam.\nWe are raising our gross margin guidance to expand 150 basis points versus the prior year.\nWe expect to continue benefiting from exceptional demand against the backdrop of lean marketplace inventory.\nFull price realization will remain above our long-term target, with lower channel markdowns.\nHowever, we expect product costs to rise in the second half due to higher macro input costs.\nWe are also planning for supply chain cost for the full year to increase relative to our estimates 90 days ago, with a greater impact in the second half.\nLast, we now expect foreign exchange to be a 55 basis points tailwind versus prior year.\nWe continue to expect SG&A to grow mid-to-high teens for the full year as demand creation spend normalizes and we continue to invest in the capabilities to support our consumer-led digital transformation.\nWe now expect our effective tax rate to be in the low teens for the full year.\nConsumer Direct Acceleration is driving our business forward and it is transforming our financial model.\nWe continue to prove that we can manage through the uncertainty and volatility in the current operating environment But we are doing more than just managing through, we are building Nike for the future with deeper consumer connections, a pipeline of product innovation to serve the needs of the modern athlete, and new operational capabilities required to serve consumers directly and digitally, at scale.\nWe have a clear vision of our brands' long-term future, and so we remain focused on what is required to win over the long-term.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm Rubun Dey, Head of Investor Relations.\nAnd with me to talk about our business and financial results are Horacio Rozanski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lloyd Howell, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.\nDuring todays call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics, which we believe provide useful information for our investors.\nWe include an explanation of adjustments and other reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our first quarter fiscal year 2022 slides.\nWe are now on slide four.\nAs always, Lloyd and I are pleased to share our latest financial results and to represent the great work of the more than 28,000 people of Booz Allen.\nOur industry, in fact, the entire economy is transitioning to more in-person work as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAnd at Booz Allen, we are excited about the opportunities this presents to our people and clients.\nAfter my remarks, I will give Lloyd the floor to cover the financials in more depth.\nLet me start with an overview of the quarter.\nOn our last call in late May, we talked about our near and midterm priorities and our fiscal year 2022 outlook.\nWe said we expect another year of significant revenue growth with strong earnings growth, continued cash generation and strategic deployment of capital.\nAt the same time, we noted that the pattern for the year would likely look different from recent years with lower revenue growth in the first half and significant acceleration in the second half.\nThis pattern is due to several factors, including the recovery from the pandemic, the implementation of a new financial system and our acquisition of Liberty IT Solutions.\nAs such, we are pleased to reaffirm our guidance for the full fiscal year.\nOperationally, we continue to move back to pre-pandemic business rhythms.\nIn our Defense and Civil businesses, we are aligned to our governments top priorities, have a robust pipeline and several great wins in the quarter.\nThese two parts of our portfolio represent three quarters of our revenue, and they continue to deliver solid growth.\nIn our intelligence business, hiring is going well, and the portfolio reshaping we have done has yielded some important wins.\nThe first quarter decline in revenue was largely due to low billable expenses, and we continue to expect a growth year in this business.\nGlobal Commercial represents 2% of our revenue.\nContinued declines are tied to our portfolio reshaping and the impact of the pandemic.\nWe do expect to see year-over-year growth in the second half of the fiscal year.\nTaken together, our entire portfolio of business produced low single-digit revenue growth year-over-year, as we expected.\nThe relatively slow growth was driven primarily by a return to more normal staff utilization and PTO trends compared to the first quarter of first quarter of last fiscal year, when the country was largely in lockdown.\nAt the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share were ahead of our expectations.\nBook-to-bill for the quarter was also strong.\nAnd we are excited about the quality mission center work we are winning.\nCash from operations came in light, primarily driven by one-time costs related to the Liberty transaction.\nLloyd will discuss all the numbers in detail in a few minutes.\nAs you may remember, on our last call, we spoke about a set of near and midterm priorities that are critical to our success.\nThe main reason for our optimism about the year is the great progress we have made to-date.\nLet me go through them briefly.\nOur top priority is recruiting.\nAnd in the first quarter, we began to see results from our laser focus in this area.\nWe are seeing sequential month-over-month growth and believe momentum will build over the remainder of the year.\nSecond, the reshaping of our intelligence and global commercial portfolios continues.\nWe believe the tactical and strategic moves we are making will yield year-over-year growth.\nThird, we are very pleased to have completed the Liberty acquisition in mid-June.\nOur teams are working side-by-side and everything we have seen since the closing confirms that this was a great deal for Booz Allen and for Liberty.\nWe are very excited about the strategic opportunities we have to augment each others strengths.\nFourth, the NextGen financial system successfully launched on April 1st and is running very well to the great credit of the team.\nAfter more than three years of preparation, launching the system and executing the first quarter closed without any major disruptions were critical milestones.\nAnd fifth, we continue to invest in our people and capabilities as we carefully manage the transition to a post-COVID environment.\nConsistent with that creating the best possible experience for our talent is a constant area of focus for us.\nIn that vein, I would like to take a few minutes today to share with you how Booz Allen is thinking about the future of work.\nWe are cautiously optimistic that the worst of the pandemic is behind us in the United States and most places that Booz Allen operates.\nAs such, we are preparing to fully reopen our offices the day after Labor Day, provided that health and safety allow it.\nAs we move toward that reopening, we intend to take the best of what we have learned over the past 16-months and create ways of working that better serve our talent, our clients and the critical missions we are part of.\nGoing forward, our workforce will have three operating models.\nFirst, we have always had a small group of employees who are purely remote, and we expect that to continue and for that group to remain relatively small.\nSecond, we have a group of people who work full time at government and our facilities.\nAnd that too will continue, although we expect it to proportionately decline from historical levels.\nOur clients have shown a great deal of creativity over the course of the pandemic.\nAnd based on this experience, many are interested in flexible models that better serve their missions while reducing the number of people who are 100% on-site.\nThe third workforce model is a hybrid.\nAnd we expect overtime for this to be a majority of our people.\nEmployees in this group will spend less time in Booz Allen and client offices than previously and instead have a mix of telework and in-person collaboration.\nThis gives people much more flexibility in their personal and family lives while at the same time preserving our culture and the close connection to clients, our firm and each other.\nWhat is most exciting about the future of work conversations we have been having internally and externally is the opportunity everyone sees for greater flexibility.\nIn fact, there is an expectation that we need to work in new ways because the technology allows it and the competition for talent simply requires it.\nTo succeed, today and in the future, employers, whether they are in the government or the private sector must foster a workforce that is more distributed, more digital and certainly more diverse.\nBooz Allen is a leader in this area, working with our government clients to help them rethink and reshape the way they accomplish critical missions.\nMany clients believe that the reality of todays world and the needs of the next decade demand fundamental change in how federal agencies execute their business on behalf of all of us.\nAnd consistent with who we are we will lean into those change opportunities proactively.\nAnd so as we look toward the fall and beyond, our firm has a lot to be optimistic and excited about.\nWe are working very hard to take care of our people, build our business, serve clients and position Booz Allen for the future.\nAs always, our overriding goal is to continue to create near and long-term value for our investors and all our stakeholders.\nAnd with that Lloyd, over to you.\nBefore I jump into the financials, I want to note that this has been a truly busy quarter for us.\nA few of the major highlights included closing our acquisition of Liberty and launching the integration process, replenishing our balance sheet through the bond market.\nInvesting in latent II, a highly strategic, rapidly growing company in the AI ML space.\nDoubling down on our recruiting and hiring efforts with promising results.\nImplementing our NextGen financial system.\nAnd, of course, engaging across the firm on our strategic review and our next investment thesis.\nWe are energized by the pace of activity and look forward to sharing more in the months to come.\nNow on to first quarter performance.\nAs we noted in May, we expected some early year choppiness in our top-line results as we move into a post-pandemic operating rhythm.\nHowever, we were able to maintain strong performance at the adjusted EBITDA and ADEPS line through disciplined cost management.\nAdditionally, we are encouraged by our solid bookings performance as well as our pace of recruiting.\nOperating cash flow was light of our initial forecast, but we view most of the moving pieces as either one-time or transitory.\nAltogether, today s results are in line with the expectations we laid out last quarter, and we remain confident in our plan for the full fiscal year.\nAt the top-line, in the first quarter, revenue increased 1.7% year-over-year to $2 billion.\nLiberty contributed approximately $16 million to revenue growth.\nRevenue excluding billable expenses grew 1.9% to $1.4 billion.\nRevenue growth was driven by solid operational performance, primarily offset by higher-than-normal staff utilization in the comparable prior year period.\nTop-line performance for the quarter was in line with our expectations.\nAs a reminder, we forecast constrained low single-digit top-line growth in the first half of the year, driven by four dynamics: First, the need to ramp up on contracts and hiring; second, a more normalized utilization rate in the first half of this fiscal year compared to the high staff utilization in the first half of fiscal year 2021, which we believe to be worth roughly 300 basis points of growth.\nThird, high PTO balances coming into the fiscal year with an expectation that our employees will take more time off; and fourth, minor timing differences in our costing of labor, resulting from implementation of our new financial system.\nAs we noted before, we expect growth to accelerate throughout the year.\nNow let me step through performance at the market level.\nIn defense, revenue grew 4.4%, with strong growth in revenue ex billable expenses, partially offset by significant materials purchases in the prior year period.\nIn Civil, revenue grew 6%, led by strong performance in our health business and the addition of Liberty.\nWe expect momentum to build throughout the year.\nAs more administration priorities ramp up and we continue to capture opportunities, building on our strong win rates.\nRevenue from our intelligence business declined 6.4% this quarter.\nRevenue ex-billable expenses grew in line with our expectations, but were more than offset at the top-line by lower billable expenses.\nWe are excited by a number of critical recent wins in the portfolio.\nAnd we believe we have the right leadership and strategic direction in place to execute a growth year.\nLastly, revenue in Global Commercial declined 27.4% compared to the prior year quarter.\nWe anticipate year-over-year growth in the second half, an outcome that is largely dependent on hiring additional talent to capitalize on growing demand as well as moving past challenging prior year comparables in international.\nOur book-to-bill for the quarter was 1.3 times, while our last 12-months book-to-bill was 1.2 times.\nTotal backlog grew 16.5% year-over-year, including Liberty, resulting in backlog of $26.8 billion, a new record.\nFunded backlog grew 1.6% to $3.5 billion.\nUnfunded backlog grew 91% to $9 billion and price options declined 3.7% and to $14.3 billion.\nWe are proud of our bookings performance in the first quarter, coming off a seasonally strong fourth quarter results.\nWe believe that the stability of our longer-term book-to-bill demonstrates continued strong demand for our services as well as the high value placed on our understanding of client missions.\nPivoting to headcount as of June 30th, we had 28,558 employees, up by 1,177 year-over-year or 4.3%.\nAccelerating headcount growth to meet robust demand for our services is our top priority for the year.\nWe are encouraged by how we closed the first quarter, and we expect to see progress throughout the year.\nMoving to the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $238 million, up 11.8% from the prior year period.\nThis increase was driven primarily by our ability to again build for fee within our intelligence business as well as the timing of unallowable expenses within the fiscal year.\nThose items, along with continued low billable expenses as a percentage of revenue pushed our adjusted EBITDA margin to 12%.\nWe expect billable expenses and unallowable spend to pick up as we move throughout the year.\nFirst quarter net income decreased 29% year-over-year to $92 million, primarily impacted by Liberty transaction-related expenses of approximately $67 million.\nAdjusted net income was $146 million, up 12.3% from the prior year period, primarily driven by the same factors driving higher adjusted EBITDA.\nDiluted earnings per share declined 27% to $0.67 from $0.92 in the prior year period.\nAnd adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15% to $1.07 from $0.93.\nThese increases to our non-GAAP metrics which exclude the impact of the transaction-related costs noted were primarily driven by operating performance and a lower share count in this quarter due to our share repurchase program.\nTurning to cash, cash flow from operations was negative $11 million in the first quarter.\nThis decline was driven primarily by lower collections largely attributable to timing around receivables associated with the integration of our new enterprise financial system.\nAs our employees and clients adapt to the new invoicing system, we expect to return to a more typical collections cadence over the coming months.\nOperating cash flow was negatively impacted by approximately $67 million of transaction costs paid in the first quarter, which includes approximately $56 million of cash payment at closing of the Liberty acquisition.\nThese cash payments represent a reallocation of a portion of the overall $725 million purchase price prior to adjustments from investing cash flows into operating cash flows.\nCapital expenditures for the quarter were $9 million, down $11 million from the prior year period, driven primarily by lower facility expenses.\nWe still expect capital expenditures to land within our forecast range for the year.\nDuring the quarter, we issued $500 million of 4% senior notes due 2029.\nAdditionally, we extended the maturity of our Term Loan A and revolving credit facility to 2026 and increased the size of our revolver by $500 million to $1 billion of total capacity.\nThose moves are in support of our disciplined capital deployment strategy.\nWe will continue to use our balance sheet as a strategic asset.\nDuring the quarter, we paid out $52 million for our quarterly dividend and repurchased $111 million worth of shares at an average price of $83.91 per share.\nIn total, including the close of the Liberty acquisition, we deployed $889 million.\nToday, we are announcing that our Board has approved a regular dividend of $0.37 per share, payable on August 31st to stockholders of record on August 16th.\nAs our actions this quarter demonstrate, we remain committed to preserving and maximizing shareholder value through a disciplined balanced capital allocation posture.\nPlease move to slide seven.\nToday, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2022 guidance.\nAs we discussed last quarter, the first half, second half dynamics we laid out are still the guiding framework for our full-year growth expectations.\nWe expect total revenue growth to be between 7% and 10%, inclusive of Liberty.\nOur contract and hiring ramp will determine where we land within that range.\nWe continue to expect revenue growth to accelerate throughout the year.\nWe expect adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid-10% range.\nWe expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4.10 and $4.30 based on an effective tax rate of 22% to 24% and 134 million to 137 million weighted average shares outstanding.\nADEPS guidance is inclusive of both Liberty and incremental interest expense from our $500 million bond offering.\nWe expect operating cash flow to grow to $800 million to $850 million, inclusive of the aforementioned $56 million of cash payments related to the Liberty transaction.\nDue to these one-time payments, we expect to end the year at the lower end of our range, with partial offset through a combination of working capital management and operational performance.\nAnd finally, we expect capex in the $80 million to $100 million range.\nIn summary, we are starting off the year just as we expected and look forward to a great year.\nWe were ambitious in trying to execute both a major acquisition and a companywide rollover of our financial systems in the same quarter.\nWith that, Rubun, let s open the line to questions.\nOperator, please open the line.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:And for the Q&A session, we'll be joined by president and COO, Mike Lukemire.\nI'd refer you to our Form 10-K, which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, so that you might familiarize yourself with the full range of risk factors that could impact our results.\nFor the last month, I've been thinking about the key themes I wanted to cover today, and I also spent a lot of time thinking about who exactly I wanted to target with my remarks.\nI won't spend a lot of time focusing on the quarter or the past year but it is worth pointing out that we've just finished our third straight record year, and remain extremely optimistic.\nconsumer was against a 24% comp, and a 39% growth in Hawthorne was against a comp of 64%.\nI know there are obvious questions to address.\nOur stance on pricing, the commodity outlook, excess inventory in the cannabis market, and our thoughts about capital allocation.\nWe'll cover all of these topics, as well as share our thoughts about fiscal '22.\nBut I've been a public company CEO for 20 years now.\nAnd too often, I've seen the markets focus with short-term issues overwhelmed the bigger picture.\nSo I want to spend most of my time focused on more than our current results.\nFrankly, there are a lot of great things happening at the company right now.\nSome of them I can't share with you, but they're very exciting.\nOur business is in important inflection point, one that could transform what we look like five years from now.\nWe have the opportunity to make this company stronger to make the moat around our business wider and deeper, and to empower a new generation of leaders to shape it through their eyes, not just mine or my executive team.\nWe also see the current volatility in the market as an opportunity.\nIf you're willing to lean in during times like this, there is potential to capture opportunities that others can't and an opportunity to further strengthen your competitive advantages, and leveraging those advantages, it's what drives long-term shareholder value.\nSo I want the real takeaway from today to be a better understanding of the journey we're on.\nAnd I'll be honest, my target audience is pretty narrow.\nTo our sell-side friends, I appreciate the need to get your models refined and to share that information with your clients.\nWe're committed to giving you what you need, but my comments are not aimed at you.\nMy comments are also not aimed at short-term investors.\nI'm not going to get pulled into a rabbit hole about our quarterly splits to spot market price of commodities, or a bridge to year-over-year SG&A.\nI do, however, want to speak to those investors who see the long-term opportunity in SMG shares.\nI want you to know where we're headed, and why we're confident that our efforts will create shareholder value.\nI won't ignore the key questions about fiscal '22, but weave them into a broader context of how we're operating the business rather than the confines of how it impacts the P&L.\nIn order to look ahead, I need to look backwards for just a moment.\nFor the five-year period, we've completed on September 30.\nOur strategic plan assumed a relatively mature core business, and enterprise growth of roughly 4% to 6%, driven by the higher growth at Hawthorne.\nWe sought to achieve a consistent shareholder return of 10% to 12% by leveraging the P&L, repurchasing shares, maintaining a roughly 2% dividend yield.\nWe also set a five-year target of cumulative free cash flow of $1.5 billion.\nWe exceeded each of those goals.\nWhile we are proud of the achievement, we know that the strategy has run its course because the opportunities are different now.\nAnd we're different, too.\nAnd so the next step in our evolution will reflect these realities.\nWe have defined five distinct pillars of growth for the next five years.\nThree of the five pillars, related to the U.S. consumer business; the other two are related to Hawthorne.\nFirst, we see a higher level of sustainable growth with our existing brands in our core business based largely on our ability to reach a new generation of consumers.\nSecond, further growth of our direct-to-consumer efforts is there for the taking, if we invest in people, brands, partnerships and infrastructure.\nThird, live goods remains a meaningful growth vehicle and a gateway for a more direct relationship with gardeners.\nOur goal remains the same for consumers to see us as a gardening company, not a gardening supply company.\nFourth, to support Hawthorne's future growth, we must continue to put the commercial grower at the center of everything we do.\nThis means further strengthening our model, driven by innovation and technical solutions.\nAnd fifth, there is no doubt the cannabis industry will continue to evolve and grow.\nAnd there's little doubt that those companies, creative and courageous enough, to wait until that pool early, have the potential for a first mover advantage.\nWe've shown our willingness to do this when we created Hawthorne.\nAnd as I'll describe later, we intend to do it again.\nAs we pursue these pillars, we are strengthening our team.\nFocusing on succession planning, and ensuring our ESG efforts, are embedded into our operations, and also better understood by our key stakeholders.\nWe debated as a team and with our board whether to pursue all of these opportunities at once.\nWe all agreed we had to, but we recognize that succeeding against all these pillars requires us to reorganize and empower a new generation of leaders.\nWhile there are no plans for me or any member of the current team to step away, nearly every member of my team has made changes to their organizations.\nThe level of oversight needed to succeed against these efforts requires Mike Lukemire to spend more of his time on the strategy and implementation of the fastest-growing areas of the business.\nHe has reshaped this organization so that each of these pillars reports directly to him.\nconsumer segment to Josh Peoples and Dave Swihart, who will effectively serve as co-leads of that business.\nOn the corporate side, Cory has fortified his leadership team with an infusion of outside talent.\nAnd Denise Stump and Jim King have realigned their teams to better meet the needs of the business.\nIn addition, most of the M&A opportunities we're pursuing includes a management team that can further strengthen our own.\nIf every opportunity we see manifest itself, we could double the size of Scotts Miracle-Gro within five years.\nThat's not the goal necessarily.\nWe want smart growth, not growth simply for the sake of it, but the magnitude of the opportunity could be game changing.\nLet me briefly tell you how we expect to execute against these pillars, or I can, I'll talk about them in the context of our expectations for next year.\nBetween the first two pillars, we believe the U.S. consumer segment can achieve sustainable long-term growth of 2% to 4% annually.\nOur previous strategic plan assumed growth of 0% to 2%.\nIf we can sustain growth at this higher level, those added two points carry significant P&L leverage and improved cash flow.\nIt's worth noting that the guidance we set for next year assumes flat to slightly declining growth in the U.S. consumer segment.\nThis is based on an assumed reset of the business in a post-COVID world.\nSpecifically, we're planning for a decline in unit volume offset by pricing.\nYou'll remember from our Q3 call that we took roughly five points of pricing, effective in August.\nIn recent weeks, we've communicated to our retail partners a second price increase effective in January.\nThis more targeted increase will range from mid-single to low double-digits depending on the product line.\nIn total, we now expect pricing in '22 to be on the high single-digit side with the goal of covering commodity prices.\nWhile we believe our sales assumption for '22 is a prudent way to plan, the trends suggest a better outcome.\nConsumer POS, in units in fiscal '21 was six points higher than in 2020.\nMore importantly, it was 21 points better than fiscal '19 and actually got stronger later in the year.\nConsumer volume during the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, while down seven points from last year's record performance was 35 points higher than the same period in fiscal 2019.\nConsumers are showing us that lawn and garden is an essential part of their lives.\nEvery cut of the data tells us they have stayed with the category and our brands throughout this past season.\nThose trends have continued in October.\nWhile it's a relatively small month, it's an important conclusion to the season, especially in the Midwest and Northeast.\nPOS and units were up 4% in October, compared to last year's record result and up 42% compared to fiscal 2019.\nAs we enter the off-season, the POS numbers won't tell us much until February.\nAnd obviously, we won't know until next summer, how much of the COVID bump we've retained.\nBut I'm confident we'll have a significantly higher base to grow from.\nWe continue to invest with that in mind.\nMillennial homeowners clearly have become a demographic tailwind, and are more than offsetting baby boomers who are leaving the category.\nThis group of consumers care more about gardening than their parents, and see the categories more rewarding and purpose-driven as well.\nA 30-year-old couple buying a home today and entering our category for the first time has the potential to stay with us for 20 years or longer.\nWe must operate with that time frame in mind.\nWe don't want our marketers to worry about hitting a target for Wall Street.\nTheir job is to drive consumer engagement, brand loyalty, and market share.\nAnd we're going to give Josh Peoples and his team the tools to get that done.\nThe same holds true for our direct-to-consumer pillar.\nThis area is approaching 10% of our U.S. consumer sales and will only grow higher.\nWhen we think about direct-to-consumer, it goes well beyond selling items on our website.\nIt also means collaborating closely with our retail partners to support their online efforts.\nIt also means finding new partners who can help us boost the appeal of gardening and have their own digital platforms that we leverage.\nPatti Ziegler is one of our brightest and most creative leaders, and directs our direct-to-consumer effort.\nIn addition to the efforts I've already mentioned, she and her team have launched native online brands like green digs, knock-knock, and instead.\nBut one of their greatest successes has been with AeroGrow.\nPatti has been a champion for the potential of our direct-to-consumer platform since day one, and continues to reimagine the future of this business.\nSucceeding in our direct-to-consumer effort also requires improving our IT and supply chain infrastructure.\nDave Swihart, whose role has recently been expanded to lead both supply chain and R&D, is driving toward that goal.\nWe need to improve our ability to ship directly to consumers, especially in categories like live goods, which has significant online potential.\nUntil recently, our direct-to-consumer efforts didn't want your attention, but that's changed.\nWhile it remains too early to gauge the ultimate potential of this pillar, it will be a significant contributor to growth as we go forward.\nI'm equally convinced our third pillar, live goods will be even more important.\nLive goods are the gateway to lawn and garden category, but historically have been highly regional, poorly marketed, and highly commoditized.\nWe believe, we can do better.\nWe've got a great start with Bonnie and its leader, Mike Sutterer, and we're working with Bonnie's other owner, Alabama Farmers Coop or AFC, to pursue other growth opportunities that holds significant potential.\nLike us, AFC has a vision to create a national branded business across several categories of live goods.\nTogether, we believe we can better meet the needs of gardeners and our retail partners through innovation, marketing, and supply chain.\nWe've already made tremendous progress improving the Bonnie business.\nAnd even there, we've only scratched the surface.\nThe other two pillars are related to Hawthorne.\nChris will spend more time discussing the current environment, but I want you to know I'm not obsessing about the sales in Q4 or what we think about Q1.\nI believe Chris and his team have a good handle on the current environment.\nMore importantly, I believe they're navigating the choppiness in the market, while keeping their eye on the long-term opportunity.\nIf the market is challenged for a couple of quarters, expect them to take advantage of it.\nWe won't chase sales but we will take an aggressive stance to further solidify Hawthorne and strengthen its market position.\nSo expect us, for example, to further enhance our innovation efforts.\nI finally visited our new R&D facility in British Columbia last week.\nI've recently visited field stations in Oregon, Florida and, of course, Ohio.\nWhat's been the takeaway, that the work we're doing on hemp and cannabis research, is changing the industry.\nFrom lighting to nutrients, to growing media, our research is not just focused on continuing to improve our product offerings but more importantly, to help growers get a better and more cost-effective outcome.\nOur unique understanding of plant science and the nuances of indoor cultivation is unmatched.\nNot only is no one in the industry doing, what Hawthorne is doing, our competitors can't even try to replicate that model.\nI think, you should keep that in mind.\nWe also are likely to use this period as an opportunity to step up our M&A efforts.\nWe continue to be disciplined in our M&A efforts but the economics of some of our deals have become more attractive recently.\nThe final pillar of our strategy is embedded into the recent creation of a new subsidiary called the Hawthorne Collective.\nI've been alluding for months about the opportunities to invest in emerging areas of the cannabis industry, but this is my first opportunity to discuss the effort in detail.\nIt starts with our recent investment in RIV Capital, a Canadian-based publicly traded company, that owns or invest in a series of cannabis-related businesses.\nWe share a common vision with the other major investors at RIV, to create a fully integrated business, based on the acquisition of licenses for cultivation and distribution.\nFrom there, Roof can partner with some of the most well-managed brands in the cannabis industry.\nThere's a lot of speculation regarding the potential for new brands to prosper, as the market expands in the categories like beverages.\nHowever, too few people are focused on existing brands in traditional categories.\nThis is already a multibillion-dollar market, with brands operating in the silos of individual states.\nWe're convinced there is tremendous potential for some of those brands to flourish more broadly as the market expands, and our investment in RIV reflects that belief.\nWe believe that our unique level of expertise in the cannabis industry, gives us the right to win in areas beyond our existing portfolio.\nHowever, today, we cannot make direct investments in those areas.\nIn fact, we can't even have a direct ownership stake in a company that does, but we can create an ownership option, which is what our convertible loan to RIV Capital reflects.\nIn the near term, we do not expect to see an impact from the investment in RIV on our P&L, and the amount of capital we've employed $150 million does not impact our ability to invest in other areas, or return cash to shareholders.\nIn the intermediate term, it is possible RIV may seek further capital infusions.\nWe could be interested depending on the opportunities I'm not going to speculate on how much we might invest.\nThe honest answer is it depends.\nBut just as we did when we purchased General Hydroponics, Botanicare, Gavita and Can-Filters, we're willing to make investments others might avoid, until there is more clarity about the future.\nIf you're a short-term investor, you may not like it.\nBut the long-term potential is real and is significant.\nUltimately, if we convert our financial interest in RIV into equity, which is definitely the goal, it may prompt us to reassess our current capital structure.\nMany of you have asked if we break Hawthorne off as a separate company.\nI've said we'd only consider doing that for strategic reasons, and not to chase valuation, and that's still true.\nOver the past year, we've worked to understand what a potential separation would require, and I believe we're capable of pulling trigger on such a move if we decided, it made sense.\nLet me be clear.\nWe have no near-term plans to do this.\nBut could it become a viable option?\nI think, the possibility is growing.\nAs I transition to Cory, I want to emphasize that I'm just as confident about our near-term plans as I am about our long-term strategy.\nThe U.S. consumer business is performing well, and our consumers continue to demonstrate how important they see this category in their lives.\nAt Hawthorne, while we continue to expect top-line pressure through Q1.\nI'm confident in our team's ability to power through it, and we still expect sales growth on a full year basis.\nAre there more challenges out there right now than a year ago?\nAm I thrilled with the equity price right now?\nBut we're on a path to build a better, and stronger business, and we won't be distracted by the noise around us.\nI mentioned earlier that we exceeded all the financial targets that we set with our previous strategic plan.\nAnd the goal is to remain on a path that allows shareholders to continue benefiting from the opportunities, I outlined in our new plan, and the pillars that I've discussed.\nThe confidence we all have is part of our decision to increase our share repurchase efforts.\nI told you last quarter, we had allocated $250 million for that purpose.\nWe now expect to add another $100 million to that total, and we hope to acquire as many of those shares as possible in the next two quarters.\nCory, why don't you pick it up from here?\nI'm going to spend a few minutes on the big themes from our Q4 results, especially around sales and gross margin.\nAnd in between, I'll turn things over to Chris to provide some color on Hawthorne.\nU.S. consumer sales did better than we expected, finishing up 11%, compared to the 7% to 9% growth we expected.\nAt $3.2 billion, sales grew by nearly $900 million in the last two years.\nThe supply chain team deserves a lot of credit for their ability to deliver this growth.\nThe targeted investments we have made and will continue making in this area will prove to be key.\nConsumer engagement remained extremely strong through the fourth quarter, and that kept our retailers equally engaged.\nconsumer segment, sales declined 28% in Q4, we were up against a plus-92% comp.\nAlso, remember that Q4 had six fewer days this year than last year.\nAdjusting for that, sales in the quarter would have declined 23%.\nAt Hawthorne, the calendar shift cost us sevent points for the quarter.\nWhile year-over-year sales declined 2%, the segment would have been up 5% on an apples-to-apples basis when adjusting for the calendar.\nAnd the U.S. Hawthorne business, grew by over 10% last year in Q4 given the same comparison.\nFinally, recall that Hawthorne was up against a plus-64% comp in the same period a year ago.\nOn a full year basis, Hawthorne grew 39% to $1.4 billion.\nI'll remind you that number was $640 million in fiscal 2019.\nWe have more than doubled the sales of that business in two years and all of that growth was organic.\nOn the segment profit line, Hawthorne earned $164 million in fiscal '21, for an operating margin of 11.5%.\nThe profit was up 46% from last year and more than 200% from 2019.\nWe've said repeatedly that we're trying to strike a balance between growth and improved profitability.\nI think, the results speak for themselves.\nAs many of you know, I served as a finance lead at Hawthorne, almost since the inception of that business, before joining the corporate team as CFO.\nAs you look at the Hawthorne results, I encourage investors to look deeper than the numbers.\nWhile the growth and profit improvements have been impressive.\nThe improvements we've made to how the business operates tell an even better story from the integration of seven separate businesses to the implementation of SAP, the revamping of our sales force, and the creation of the world's only cannabis-focused R&D program, the efforts of this team have been outstanding.\nI know all of you want to know more about the current state of the business.\nI'll leave the details around the numbers to Cory, but I know you guys are wondering about the current state of the industry, and how we're navigating it.\nSo let me address that for a few minutes.\nWe're, obviously, seeing some disruption in the market right now, but we expect it to be temporary.\nOur field sales team, began seeing the signs of potential slowdown in late June.\nWe got smarter about the issues in July, and that allowed us to share some of those insights on our third quarter conference call in August.\nThat's when we caution that the growth will be significantly slower in Q4 than we've seen for the rest of the year.\nSince then, many of you have been asking whether this will be a replay of 2018.\nWe don't see it that way at all, and we're not alone.\nSome of you were in Las Vegas a couple of weeks ago for the MJBiz conference.\nIt's the largest cannabis trade show in the world.\nAnd if you were there, you saw firsthand, that this is not an industry that's spreading about the future.\nConsumer demand for cannabis products continues to grow, and the market continues to expand.\nAs it relates to the current environment, what was clear to me in Vegas, was the industry is becoming increasingly adept at navigating the choppiness that's inevitable in a market like this.\nWhat's happening right now is actually pretty straightforward.\nIn California, there were simply too much cannabis harvested in the past few months, especially from outdoor growers in the northern part of the state.\nOn top of a strong harvest from the first turn of crops earlier in the year, many growers harvested their second crop of cannabis earlier this season due to concerns about wildfires drought, and in the case of the legacy market, fear of increased enforcement efforts.\nThe combination of too much product and relatively poor quality has put downward pressure on wholesale cannabis prices.\nHowever, that issue should solve itself once the current supply makes its way through the marketplace, because the legacy market remains a big part of what's happening in California, the available data isn't great.\nSo that makes it hard to give you a precise answer on how long it will take for the current oversupply to work itself through the market.\nThat's why we're currently forecasting Hawthorne sales to decline in the first quarter.\nThat said, the single most important fact is the end market for cannabis continues to expand, and we expect to start seeing growth again in the new calendar year.\nAnd virtually no one is expecting that fact to change for the foreseeable future.\nIn fact, many high-end growers have told us that current market issues are not impacting them at all, and they continue to flourish.\nAnother important fact to remember is that unlike in 2018, there are no regulatory issues getting in the way right now.\nThree years ago, California badly boxed the rollout of the recreational marketplace.\nThat overwhelmingly was the issue that impacted the market back then.\nIt was nearly impossible to get a license to operate legally, regardless of whether you were a cultivator or a dispensary.\nWhile the current marketplace in California remains more expensive and bureaucratic than other states, it is vastly improved from what we've seen in the past and the legal market there continues to grow.\nSome of you are also wondering whether the current situation will result in some consolidation.\nThe answer is pretty simple.\nYes, of course, it will.\nBut those kinds of ebbs and flows are exactly what we expect to happen.\nIt's what happened in Colorado back in 2015, it happened in Oregon when it went legal, and it's likely to happen in California to some degree.\nIn fact, that's also what we're seeing right now in Oklahoma.\nLike many new markets, Oklahoma, had explosive growth out of the gates and probably got a bit overbuilt.\nSo we expect to pause there before growth resumes.\nWe have told you repeatedly over the years that this industry is likely to be choppy from time to time.\nThis is not the first time the industry has seen an oversupply of cannabis and just to be clear, it will not be the last.\nWhat's important for Hawthorne as we keep running our play.\nThe growth will be there in the long term.\nI'm not worried about that.\nInstead, I want to make sure that we're doing everything we need to distance ourselves from the competition.\nJim has already told you that we won't slow down on our innovation efforts, which, by the way, go much further than just new product development, which brings me full circle to the MJBiz conference a couple of weeks ago in Vegas.\nLike most major trade shows, MJBiz, was canceled last year due to COVID.\nSo we haven't seen the industry all-in-one place for over two years.\nWhat was clear to us and frankly, nearly everyone we interacted with is how far Hawthorne has come in those two years and how much we've distanced ourselves from the competition.\nWe have fundamentally changed our approach to selling, and that transformation is continuing.\nWe've brought new products to the market that have improved the results for growers, by both increasing the yields and lowering their operating costs.\nAnd we've used the innovation to help us in more qualitative ways, like the establishment of the Hawthorne Social Justice Fund, within our corporate foundation.\nWhile I understand the questions you all need to ask about the step down in our growth rate, I would urge you not to lose sight of the bigger picture.\nThere is no doubt that we're the clear leader in the industry.\nThere is no doubt that our competitive advantages are unique, and there's also no doubt that the cannabis industry still has miles of runway ahead of it.\nSo looking ahead at fiscal '22, I'm not worried about a few speed bumps.\nRather, I'm excited to see how much further we can push this business, and continue to lead the way in an industry, that remains poised for years of growth.\nLet's move down the P&L now to the gross margin line.\nLike nearly all other CPG companies, we've continue to see pressure from higher commodities and distribution costs.\nHowever, the year-over-year change in the margin rate during Q4 require some additional context.\nIn Q4 of fiscal '21, the adjusted gross margin rate was 17.4% compared with 24.3% in 2020.\nCompanywide sales in Q4 of last year were up nearly 80%.\nSo the fixed cost leverage in a relatively small quarter drove a massive improvement in the margin rate.\nIf you compare the Q4 gross margin rate in '21 versus '19, you'll see the difference is only 100 basis points, and that difference is a combination of segment mix and higher commodity costs.\nOn a full year basis, the gross margin rate declined 270 basis points to 30.3%.\nThe year-over-year increase in commodity costs of about $85 million nearly all of which was on plan, was the primary reason for the decline, followed by higher distribution costs.\nAs you know, we did not adjust our prices this year until August in the U.S. consumer business.\nSo we had limited ability to offset the commodity inflation during the first three quarters of the year.\nThat story will change significantly in fiscal '22, which I'll explain further when I cover our guidance for next year.\nHigher volume was able to drive improved fixed cost leverage, and conversion, to help offset the commodity cost increases.\nSG&A came in 2 percentage points lower in fiscal '21 at $743 million.\nIt declined 21% in the quarter to $161 million.\nLower variable compensation was the main driver.\nAlso, in Q4 of 2020, and we used some of our strong earnings upside, to significantly increase our annual contribution to The Scotts Miracle-Gro Foundation, which we did not repeat in fiscal '21.\nInterest expense was $5 million higher in Q4 compared with a year ago.\nbut essentially flat on a full year basis.\nRemember, we issued $900 million of bonds in the second half of the year, which drove an increase in the quarter.\nOn the bottom line, adjusted net income, which excludes restructuring, impairment, and onetime items, was up 28% to $528 million or $9.23 a share.\nThat's just $0.01 shy of a $2 per share increase in a single year and more than twice the $4.47 a share we earned in 2019.\nThe earnings per share number is on the high end of the revised range we've set in early June, and is a major accomplishment given the difficult comps, and some of the cost hurdles we've had to clear in the second half of the year.\nBut instead of spending more time on those details, I want to switch gears and share our thoughts about goal '22.\nThis assumes the U.S. consumer segment is flat to minus 4%, and that Hawthorne grows 8% to 12%.\nNone of those ranges assume the potential impact from acquisitions.\nconsumer, we are going into the year with the assumption that unit volume will decline high single digits.\nRoughly half of that decline is expected from lower shipments in the first half of the year.\nRemember that last year's Q1 was up nearly 150%, as retailers worked hard to remedy depleted inventory levels.\nSince current retail inventory levels remain higher than a year ago, we likely won't see a repeat of that kind of initial load-in.\nWe're also for planning purposes, assuming modest declines in consumer takeaway in fiscal '22, mostly driven by the difficult comps we've faced in the first half.\nAs Jim already indicated, consumer POS has been stronger than we expected in recent months, and has actually been positive for the fall season.\nIt's easy for us to lean in to meet the higher consumer demand if it comes, but the prudent play is to assume a slight decline.\nMost and perhaps, all of the planned unit volume decline, should be offset by pricing.\nYou should see some benefit from pricing in Q1 from the August price increases, and the balance will begin during our Q2.\nAs it relates to Hawthorne, we're planning for 8% to 12% growth on a full year basis.\nAs we expect to see continued pressure in Q1.\nAs Chris said, it's hard to be precise regarding the current inventory supply issues in the industry, but we're hoping to see a return to growth sometime in Q2.\nLet's move on to gross margin.\nWe expect to see gross margin rate decline by 100 to 150 basis points on a full year basis.\nWe are cautiously optimistic that our pricing moves will offset expected commodity pressure.\nThat said, we expect about 65% to 70% of our costs to be locked in by the end of the calendar year.\nSo we'll still have some exposure if costs move higher than the planned increases we are assuming.\nThe two biggest pressures on the rate next year, will come from lower fixed cost leverage and segment mix.\nWe would expect some leverage out of SG&A, meaning this line can range from a 6% decline year over year to a slight increase, maybe 2%.\nThere are no major moving pieces in SG&A, and we remain committed to investments, we believe will drive the business, not just in fiscal '22, but the years to follow.\nBelow the operating line, interest expense should be roughly $25 million higher, based on the full year impact of our recent bond offering.\nOur guidance also assumes no offsetting earnings impact from acquisitions, which is a pretty conservative starting point.\nAll of this rolls up to a guidance range for adjusted earnings per share of $8.50 to $8.90.\nI also want to talk about cash flow for a moment.\nFor the year we just completed, free cash flow, that's operating cash flow minus capex, came in at $165 million.\nWhile that is low from historical standards.\nThere are three main reasons behind the year-over-year decline.\nFirst was variable compensation that was earned in fiscal '20, but paid out in fiscal '21.\nThat was about a $60 million impact.\nSecond, we increased capex by about $45 million.\nThird, inventory levels were up $500 million from fiscal '20.\nWhile most of this increase was paid during the year, we did lean on our vendor partners more than in the past to achieve extended payment terms.\nAs we look to fiscal '22, we're aiming for free cash flow of up to $300 million.\nWe expect capex to increase again, and we also expect inventory levels, while flat on a unit basis to be higher overall because of the increased cost.\nThese investments are necessary to continue meeting the required service levels to our customers, which is the higher priority.\nBut as it relates to inventory, we find ourselves in a very good place right now.\nIn both U.S. consumer and Hawthorne, we believe some competitors will have a hard time meeting demand.\nAnd in the consumer business, we expect the market to see shortages of grass, seed and sphagnum peat moss.\nThe key ingredient used in growing media.\nWe do not expect to be impacted by those issues, and we do not expect to have any problems getting our customers at the appropriate inventory levels either.\nI agree with Jim's assessment.\nWe've got a lot of moving pieces right now and several active initiatives that could require us to update our outlook as we move through the year.\nBut even in the unlikely event that none of those efforts come to pass, I believe the business is in a great spot.\nThe challenges we're seeing on the cost of goods line are pretty consistent with what you've been hearing from other companies over the past two weeks.\nAnd just as we said we would, we've taken aggressive action to

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I would like to start by expressing how grateful I am to our colleagues for their continued hard work and commitment, especially to those who are continuing to experience the devastating effects of the pandemic.\nWe have not yet seen a uniform recovery as there are still many regions around the world that have been ravaged by the pandemic.\nAs many of you are aware, India is facing a particularly dire situation at the moment.\nOur colleagues and customers that are very much on our minds and we are working closely with our team in India to ensure safety of our employees and their families, and we're doing all we can to support our customers.\nDuring today's call, I will provide you a brief overview of our first quarter operating results as well as an update on our three phase transformation plan focused on; Number 1, beginning our commercial momentum; Number 2, further strengthening our organization with leadership and performance management; and Number 3, aligning our portfolio with growth areas.\nNext, I will provide some thoughts on how our business is positioned to drive sustainable growth.\nMike will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our updated second quarter and full-year financial outlook.\nBriefly reviewing our operating results, for the first quarter revenue grew 31% as reported, 27% on a constant currency basis, and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share grew 99% year-over-year.\nThis strong start for the year was driven by growth across all end markets as we saw continued strength in pharma and earlier-than-expected recovery in non-pharma spending by our customers, new product traction and strong commercial execution by our team.\nLooking more closely at our top-line results.\nFirst, from a customer end market perspective, all our end markets grew double-digits during the first quarter.\nOur largest market category pharma grew 28% in constant currency, industrial grew 24%, and academic and government grew 29%.\nMoving now to our sales performance by geography.\nOn a constant currency basis; sales in Asia grew 41%, with China up 109%; sales in Americas grew 14%, with US growing 13%; and sales in Europe grew 25%.\nFrom an operating segment perspective, our Waters division grew 26%, while TA grew by 28% on a constant currency basis.\nCustomer activity continued to improve in the first quarter with pharma leading the way driving better-than-expected trends in recurring revenues and a significant growth in instrument revenue.\nRecurring revenues grew 15%, with services growing 14% and chemistry consumables revenue growing 18%, driven by combined pharma strength and improved industrial demand.\nLC instruments grew across all of our major geographies and market categories with more than 40% growth.\nIt's encouraging to see both HPLC and UPLC instrument units grow double-digits, driven by pent-up demand, integration of the Arc HPLC and strong execution of our LC replacement initiative.\nThe success of the launch of the Arc HPLC in the general purpose HPLC space cannot be understated and the ACQUITY PREMIER has been received very well by customers since its February launch.\nMass spec sales were also strong in the first quarter with growth in excess of 50% as demand in the pharma market remains robust.\nIn addition to rebound, we saw in other markets, including clinical, food and environmental and biomedical research.\nDemand was solid for our tandem quads in Europe and China, particularly in pharma and in food.\nRevenue grew 28% as demand rebounded in the core industrial business and strength continued in pharma medical devices and semiconductors.\nGrowth was robust across all major geographies and product lines with particular strength in thermal and electrophoresis.\nLooking deeper at our sales performance by geography.\nAll major regions grew double-digits.\nChina built further on last quarter's strength, more than doubling sales year-over-year, results were strong across all end markets as China continued its recovery from last year's COVID disruptions.\nPharma was particularly strong in China, driven by triple-digit growth in both contract labs and traditional Chinese medicine.\nOur food business in China also saw meaningful growth, driven by a significant rebound in contract testing organizations to the level that were above those we saw in 2018 and in 2019.\nThis is just one quarter and not indicative of a trend, but it demonstrates that the market is recovering and our execution has improved.\nIndia sales grew double-digits for the third consecutive quarter, despite worsening conditions and continued pandemic challenges throughout the country.\nEurope experienced broad-based strength across all customer end markets, including meaningful sequential improvements in both industrial and academic and government markets.\nIn the US, both pharma and industrial markets had strong growth in the quarter, while demand in our academic and government market remained soft as it lags behind other markets in reopening.\nIn summary, we had a great start for the year with strong year-on-year growth that was broadly based than last quarter.\nWith impressive performance across all our regions, end markets and product categories.\nPharma demand has not subsided and many of our non-pharma markets are now in the process of recovering, which gives us greater confidence as we look to the remainder of the year.\nNow I would like to talk more broadly about our business and its overall direction moving forward, including the strength of the Company, the effectiveness of the markets that we serve, and our deep commitment to innovation as we look beyond this quarter into the longer term.\nOur three-phase transformation plan is; Number 1, beginning our commercial momentum; Number 2, strengthening our organization with leadership and performance management; and Number 3, aligning our portfolio with growth areas.\nLooking at our first priority of beginning our commercial momentum, let me review some initiatives I mentioned previously.\nFirst, our instrument replacement initiative.\nWe delivered a significant acceleration in instrument revenue growth to 45%.\nIn February, we launched the ACQUITY PREMIER system augmenting the already solid placement of Arc HPLC launched in June of 2020, creating new opportunities for instrument replacements.\nAdditionally, we have gained traction with customers to replace aging tandem quad mass spec instruments with newer instruments.\nSecond, as part of our CROs CDMO expansion initiative, we've seen revenue growth accelerate to strong double digits in both these customer segments.\nCustomers continue to perceive us as a strong technical partner as they transfer methods from originators and they see us as a strong collaborator rather than a competitor.\nThird, our e-commerce initiative has begun to deliver tangible results, search engine optimization and paid search had lead to search impressions that are up more than 40% year-on-year.\nWhile not every click translates to immediate revenue increasing traffic is an important first step in our e-commerce efforts.\nFourth, driving launch excellence.\nLet me start with liquid chromatography.\nWhile the Arc HPLC is a leader in general purpose HPLC space, I want to focus on the ACQUITY PREMIER.\nLast year we launched the ACQUITY PREMIER Columns and follow that up with the ACQUITY PREMIER System last quarter.\nThough, we are still in the early stages of the revenue ramp up for both the Columns and the System sales of ACQUITY PREMIER Columns are significantly outpacing prior successful chemistry launches, including the original ACQUITY Columns.\nTurning to mass spec.\nIn 2019, we launched the BioAccord, Cyclic IMS, SYNAPT XS, TQ-S cronos and a next generation version of our TQ-S micro.\nPairing our tandem quad with ACQUITY PREMIER creates industry-leading reproducibility and sensitivity for challenging assays.\nWith expanding applications of the BioAccord, we've maintained our focus on bringing a versatile, easy to use and robust LCMs system to the QA-QC space.\nDuring Q1, we launched a full workflow for peptide multi-attribute method on the new Waters Connect platform to enable the monitoring of quality attributes at the peptide level.\nThis adds to already existing simple use applications of peptide mapping impacts of unit mass analysis, released glycan profiling and oligonucleotide mass confirmation.\nOver the last year, we established the BioAccord into the workflows for characterizing mRNA molecules that have since become vaccines.\nIn fact, BioNTech recognized Waters for our support of its COVID-19 vaccine development and relief efforts.\nLastly, Cyclic was launched in September of 2019 and is targeted at the most advanced high resolution mass spec users.\nAugmenting traditional LCMs with high-resolution ion mobility allows us to separate molecules with additional -- with identical molecular weight based on their different shapes.\nThis is now especially relevant from one of the structural changes in the sugar pattern of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\nWe do recognize that we still have a bit of work to do on our mass spec informatics applications and we are addressing this through the development and rollout of our Waters Connect software platform across our full mass spec portfolio.\nToday, Waters Connect support biopharma characterization and monitoring workflows with a range of capabilities on the BioAccord, Xevo QTof and [Indecipherable].\nAnd with the launch of our RDa Benchtop -- Benchtop Tof in Q1, Waters Connect also enables small molecule workflows.\nWe're grateful that we've earned the trust and partnership with our customers as we develop further applications and beta test upcoming products and software.\nNext from our TA Instrument division.\nLast year we launched the X3 DSC, which offers unique advantages for routimg high throughput labs and R&D, especially in pharma, electronics and advanced materials.\nThe ability of the X3 DSC to deliver high sensitivity measurements of physical properties more quickly than comparable products is enabling these measurements to be more broadly deployed in manufacturing processes, where scientists can evaluate multiple combinations in parallel, reducing time to market.\nThe more time I spend with my R&D colleagues together with our customers the more impressed I am with the strength of our deeply, deeply technical culture.\nMoving on to our second priority.\nYou've already seen the plan leadership transitions we announced last month.\nAmol Chaubal will join as the CFO on May 12th, Amol has deep experience in pharma and diagnostics and has led many transformations in his prior roles through both organic and inorganic growth.\nMike will continue to serve as our Corporate Controller and I'm pleased to add that Mike will also assume the role of Chief Accounting Officer.\nSecondly, we have established a dedicated Innovation Board, which I will share that includes leaders from R&D, Business Development and Marketing.\nThe Innovation Board will review unmet needs in markets we serve, assess technology proof of concepts and monitor the execution of top R&D programs.\nThough their retirements are effective July 2, they've graciously which we offer to service consultants for a period of time to ensure a smooth transition.\nBoth Jon and Jianqing have deep commercial and transformation experience in global leadership roles in fast growing markets such as molecular diagnostics and bioprocessing.\nI'm really pleased with our new team and I look forward to introducing them to you in the coming months.\nThat brings us to our third priority aligning our portfolio with high growth areas.\nWhile we won't take our eye off commercial execution, which remains our top priority, we have recently started our strategic planning process.\nAnd I'd like to share you -- share with you some high-level thoughts on where we are today.\nOur number one priority is to continue strengthening the core meaning LCMs, and materials characterization instruments, informatics, service and consumables.\nSecond, is staffing into faster growing adjacencies where we can bring our strength of managing compliant data without competing directly with our customers.\nThese adjacencies include opportunities to increase our exposure to biologics, be it in reagents, other instrument technologies or bioprocessing, all in accelerating LCMs into diagnostics or other high-growth markets.\nLastly, we will maintain our long-standing disciplined approach to financial management, capital structure and capital deployment as we are focused on maintaining a top-tier ROIC.\nOver the coming year, I look forward to sharing more with you on our strategy, as well as the data points that give us confidence that we have the foundation in place to sustainably grow in this attractive market.\nWith that, I'd like to pass the call over to Mike Silveira for a deeper review of the first quarter financials and our outlook for the remainder of 2021.\nIn the first quarter, we recorded net sales of $609 million, an increase of approximately 27% in constant currency.\nCurrency translation increased sales growth by approximately 4%, resulting in sales growth of 31% as reported.\nLooking at product line growth.\nOur revenue -- our reoccurring revenue, which represents the combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue increased by 15% for the quarter, while instrument sales increased 45%.\nChemistry revenues were up 18% for the quarter, driven by strong pharma market growth and improving industrial demand.\nOn the service side of our business, revenues were up 14% as customers continue to reopen labs and catch up on performance maintenance, professional services and repair visits.\nAs we noted on our last earnings call, reoccurring sales were impacted by five additional calendar days in the quarter, which primarily impacted service revenues.\nLooking ahead, compared to 2020, there is no year-over-year difference in the number of calendar days for this year's second or third quarter.\nHowever, there are six fewer calendar days in the fourth quarter of this year.\nBreaking first quarter operating segment sales down further, sales related to Waters Division sales grew 26%, while TA Instrument sales grew 28%.\nCombined LC and LCMs instrument sales were up 47%, while TA system sales grew 34%.\nNow I'd like to comment on our first quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year.\nGross margin for the quarter was 58.2%, a 350 basis point increase compared to 54.7% in the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to an increase in sales volume and favorable effects.\nMoving down to first quarter P&L.\nOperating expenses increased by approximately 9% on a constant currency basis and 11% on a reported basis.\nThe increase was primarily attributed to higher labor incentive compensation costs and higher depreciation from IT investments we made over the last few years.\nIn the first quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 14% an increase from last year, as compared to the comparable period included some favorable discrete items in the prior year.\nNet interest expense was $7 million for the quarter, a decrease of about $3 million, as anticipated on lower average outstanding debt balances.\nOur average share count came in at 62.6 million shares, flat with the first quarter of last year.\nOur non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the first quarter increased 99% to $2.29 in comparison to the $1.15 last year.\nOn a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $2.37 compared to $0.86 last year.\nTurning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet, I would like to summarize our first quarter results and activities.\nWe define free cash flow as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and excluding certain special items.\nIn the first quarter of 2021, free cash flow grew 60% year-over-year to $193 million, after funding $40 million of capital expenditures.\nExcluded from free cash flow was $14 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation.\nIn the first quarter, this resulted in $0.32 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow.\nOur increased free cash flow was primarily a result of sales growth and better operating margins compared to the prior year.\nIn the quarter, accounts receivable days sales outstanding came in at 84 days, down 15 days compared to the first quarter of last year.\nInventory decreased by $16 million in comparison to the prior year quarter on higher sales volumes.\nWaters maintains a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile.\nIn terms of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased approximately 600,000 shares of common stock for $173 million in the first quarter.\nThese capital allocation activities along with our free cash flow results in cash and short-term investments of $810 million in debt of $1.7 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter.\nThis resulted in a net debt position of $893 million and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1 times at the end of the first quarter.\nOur capital deployment priorities remain consistent, invest for growth, maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility, and return capital to shareholders.\nWe remain committed to deploying capital against these priorities and as Udit commented earlier, we have begun a new strategic planning process.\nAs we continue to execute against our priorities, we will evaluate deploying capital to open up attractive and adjacent markets.\nAs we look forward to the remainder of the year ahead, I would like to provide some updated context on our thoughts for 2021.\nOne, while the business environment remains subject to volatility, we are seeing good momentum in our market segments, which will help us exceed the 2019 levels.\nTwo, we believe this momentum will continue into the second quarter, but that the strong double-digit growth will mostly occur in the first half of the year due to more challenging comparisons in the second half of the year and the six fewer calendar days that we will have in the fourth quarter.\nThree, we continue to expect that all major geographies will perform better this year than they did in 2020 led by growth in China.\nFour, our near-term growth initiatives are expected to continue to ramp, led by our LC replacement initiative, which we expect to contribute increasingly to our performance.\nThese dynamics support updated full-year 2021 guidance for constant currency sales growth up 8% to 11%.\nAt current rates, the positive currency translation to 2021 sales growth is expected to be approximately 1 percentage points to 2 percentage points.\nGross margin for the full year is expected to be between 57.5% and 58%.\nEvery year we look to balance growth, investment and profitability.\nAccordingly, we expect 2021 operating margins of between 28% and 29% based on a combination of investments, the normalization of COVID-related cost, and disciplined expense controls.\nMoving now below the operating income line, other key assumptions for the full year guidance are as follows; net interest expense of $35 million to $38 million; a full year tax rate in the range of 14.5% to 15.5%; the net impact of our share repurchase program in 2021 that will result in an average diluted 2021 share count of 61.5 million to 62.0 million shares outstanding.\nOver the course of the year, we will evaluate our share repurchase program and provide quarterly update as appropriate.\nRolling all this together, and on a non-GAAP basis, full-year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $9.85 to $10.05, which assumes a positive currency impact on full year earnings-per-share growth of approximately 3 percentage points.\nLooking at the second quarter of 2021.\nWe expect constant currency sales growth to be 14% to 16%.\nAt today's rates, currency translation is expected to increase second quarter sales growth by approximately 3 percentage points.\nSecond quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.25 as the significant prior year COVID cost savings actions start to normalize.\nAt current rates, the positive currency impact on second quarter earnings-per-share growth is expected to be approximately 1 percentage point.\nLike in summary, there is much to be pleased about -- with our first quarter results, driven by strong growth across each of the major end markets with pharma leading the way.\nOur transformation plan is well under way with commercial momentum and a strong leadership team in place.\nWe now turn toward developing a new strategy as we work more closely to align our portfolio with higher growth areas of the market.\nSummary: ",

potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, the markets we serve and our financial results.\nWe're pleased to report another good quarter of results.\nWe executed well and we continue to do a great job for our customers on many fronts in quality, delivery service, and our technology partnerships.\nOur supply chain teams work 24/7 to overcome unprecedented logistics challenges and material shortages to keep our factory supplied.\nAnd I am most pleased that we achieved a record level of performance and safety something our teams have been working hard at in all of our plants around the world.\nAs a company, we delivered GAAP earnings per share of $0.95, $0.83 on an adjusted basis on $232 million in revenue, an increase of nearly 10% from Q3 last year.\nOur Machine Clothing segment continues to fire on all cylinders and grew sales by 11% compared to Q3 last year with excellent profitability and free cash flow generation.\nEngineered composites delivered top-line growth of nearly 7% and performed well, as we work toward the upturn in commercial aerospace.\nOur profitability was solid with gross margins of 40%, operating margins of 19%, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 26% and we continued our strong free cash flow generation, over $40 million in the quarter.\nWe have low debt and a healthy balance sheet, and we look forward to continuing solid performance from our Machine Clothing segment and gradual recovery in commercial aerospace.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, long-term secular trends are favorable and Albany's market positions, global footprint, and product development take advantage of these trends.\nIn our Engineered Composites segment, we expect commercial aerospace to gradually improve with narrow-body aircraft demand improving before wide-body demand.\nConsequently, we're hiring employees and planning for a ramp-up in LEAP production driven by Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX growth.\nWe are coordinating with Safran to expand production in our three LEAP facilities in the US, France, and Mexico.\nWe see positive signs in international travel bookings as borders reopen and people have begun to travel internationally, although we don't expect any near-term pickup in wide-body production demand such as for our Boeing 787 composite frames line as there still inventory in the system and international travel has been slow to recover.\nOur AEC businesses continue to perform well on our military platforms Sikorsky CH-53K helicopter, Lockheed Martin's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and Jazan missile programs.\nWe're fortunate to be on excellent programs and our teams are executing well.\nWe also continued our pursuit of new customers and new applications for advanced composites.\nDuring the quarter, we announced our technology collaboration with Spirit AeroSystems to apply our advanced 3D woven composite technology to hypersonic vehicles and take advantage of our proprietary 3D woven composites in a high-temperature environment providing both structural robustness and thermal protection, and building on our proven ability to industrialize 3D woven composites at high volumes.\nThis is an example of the intense collaboration our teams are good at, working closely with our technology partners in the design, development, and commercialization of the most advanced composite applications.\nIn addition to working on engine component applications with our partner Safran, we continue development of Wing applications with Airbus Wing of Tomorrow program and other composite programs in commercial and defense applications.\nOur Machine Clothing segment continue to perform exceptionally well.\nOur engineers and sales and service teams in MC work closely with key customers to develop the next generation of belt materials for improved operational efficiency, performance, and durability.\nAnd customers value our service technical expertise and innovation.\nWe saw a good demand in the quarter for new products and all product lines.\nDemand in MC's end markets has been resilient and particularly strong in packaging in the Americas.\nTissue markets have held up although demand is mixed and flat overall as tissue machine utilization is below long-term averages and tissue producers are working through distortions caused by the pandemic's effect on away-from-home paper markets.\nThis should improve as workers go back to offices and students are back in school.\nIn other end markets, demand was strong in the quarter for corrugators, nonwovens, and building products.\nEven publication was better this quarter, likely a pause in the longer-term secular decline of printing and writing grades of paper.\nWe are seeing significant logistics challenges and price inflation on various raw materials and wages.\nSo far, supply chain management and operations teams have done an excellent job.\nThey've been able to secure the materials we need to run our operations that only moderate increases in cost.\nIn general, we strive to offset inflationary costs through productivity savings.\nThis time may be different, as we don't see inflationary pressures abating anytime soon.\nIf anything, conditions grew more challenging during the third quarter.\nLet me make a few comments on corporate governance and capital allocation before turning the call over to Stephen.\nIn early August, the company move closer to a single-class share structure following the secondary offering of nearly all of the Standish Family's ownership in the company with our few remaining shares converted to Class A common stock.\nAs a result, today, there are more than 32.3 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding and less than 1,200 shares of Class B stock outstanding, which are held by two former employees.\nThe transaction effectively created a conventional single-class governance structure for our shareholders.\nAs we mentioned in the past, our priority is to use our balance sheet first for organic growth investments where we can add value for our customers.\nAnd then acquisitions that fit our strategy enable us to build on our technology, leadership, and market positions in both segments.\nAdding to these options, Albany's Board of Directors has authorized a $200 million share repurchase program, expanding the set of capital allocation alternatives we have at our disposal.\nWe continue to look for acquisitions that advance our technology and market position at a fair price and we're focused on value creation from both an organic and inorganic investment perspective.\nIn summary, we had another good quarter.\nOur businesses are executing well, we continue to push the envelope in our technology development with new products in both segments, and secular trends in our end markets are favorable.\nSo with that, I'll hand the call over to Stephen for more detail on the financials.\nI will talk first about the results for the quarter and then comment on the outlook for our business for the balance of the year.\nFor the third quarter, total company net sales were $232.4 million, an increase of 9.6% compared to the $212 million delivered in the same quarter last year.\nAdjusting for currency translation effects, net sales rose by 8.8% year-over-year in the quarter.\nIn Machine Clothing also adjusting for currency translation effects, net sales were up 9.9% year-over-year.\nAll major grades of product led by engineered fabrics and packaging grades contributed to the year-over-year increase in net sales.\nEngineered composites' net sales, again, after adjusting for currency translation effects, grew by 6.7% primarily driven by growth on LEAP and CH-53K partially offset by expected declines on the 787 and F-35 platforms.\nDuring the quarter, the ASC LEAP program generated about $25 million in revenue, comparable to the first two quarters of this year, but up about $9 million from the third quarter of last year.\nWe are pleased with the reduction in our inventory of LEAP-1B finished goods.\nDuring the most recent quarter, we reduce that inventory by over 30 engine shipsets down to about 140 engine shipsets on hand.\nGiven the current rates of the inventory consumption on that program, we would not plan to have that inventory level drop below about 100 engine shipsets, so we can see the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of inventory destocking.\nI'm looking forward to an earnings call for I no longer have to discuss LEAP-1B inventory at all.\nWe hope to return to a more normal levels of production on LEAP-1B on par with the current production rates for LEAP-1A early in 2022.\nHowever, we do have some concern with the rate of which Boeing is destocking its inventory of finished 737 MAX aircraft, so there is still some lack of clarity around 2022 build rates.\nWe will hopefully have better insight for you on our fourth quarter call.\nAlso during the quarter, we generated under $3 million of revenue on the 787 program down slightly from the second quarter, but down from almost $9 million in the same quarter last year.\nThird quarter gross profit for the company was $92 million, an increase of over 5% from the comparable period last year.\nThe overall gross margin decreased by 160 basis points from 41.2% to 39.5% of net sales.\nWithin the MC segment, gross margin was flat at 51.5% of net sales as the benefit from improved absorption was offset by the impact of year-over-year foreign currency changes and rising input costs.\nFor the AEC segment, the gross margin declined from 21.6% to 16.1% of net sales caused by a smaller impact from changes in the estimated profitability of long-term contracts, a change in program mix, and lower fixed cost absorption due to the lower 787 and F-35 revenues, and the impact of sharing with our customer base a portion of The Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection grant received during the quarter.\nThe $5.8 million benefit of this grant appears in the corporate portion of the results while the reduced profitability caused by sharing a portion of the grant with our customer base is reported in the segment results.\nDuring the quarter, we recognized a net favorable change in the estimated profitability of AEC's long-term contracts of about $2 million but this compares to a net favorable change of about $3.5 million in the same quarter last year.\nThird quarter Selling, Technical, General, and Research expenses were $47.4 million in the current quarter, down slightly from $47.8 million in the prior year quarter and were down as a percentage of net sales from 22.6% to 20.4%.\nWhile R&D was up over $4 million -- over $1 million this quarter and while we also incurred higher travel expenses, these were more than offset by a foreign currency revaluation gain this quarter compared to a foreign currency revaluation loss in the same quarter last year.\nTotal operating income for the company was $44.5 million, up from $38.8 million in the prior year quarter.\nMachine Clothing operating income rose by $9.8 million, driven by higher gross profit and lower STG&R expense.\nAnd AEC operating income fell by $3.9 million caused by lower gross profit and higher STG&R expense partially offset by lower restructuring expense.\nThe income tax rate for this quarter was 29.4% compared to 24.7% in the same quarter last year.\nThe higher rate this year was caused by the generation of a higher share of our global profits in jurisdictions with higher tax rates and by less favorable discrete income tax adjustments.\nWe reported over $2 million in expense under other income expense this quarter primarily due to a true-up of indirect taxes in a foreign jurisdiction.\nNet income attributable to the company for the quarter was $30.9 million, an increase of over $1 million from $29.6 million last year.\nThe increase was caused primarily by the higher operating profit, partially offset by higher interest expense and the higher tax rate.\nEarnings per share were $0.95 in this quarter compared to $0.92 last year.\nIn addition to the normal non-GAAP adjustments we typically make to cover the impact of foreign currency revaluation gains and losses, restructuring expenses, and expenses associated with the CirComp acquisition and integration, this quarter, we are also adjusting out the impact of The Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection grant as we do not believe it is reflective of ongoing profitability.\nAfter making these non-GAAP adjustments, adjusted earnings per share was $0.83 this quarter compared to $0.96 last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA declined by 2.6% to $60.2 million for the most recent quarter compared to the same period last year.\nMachine Clothing adjusted EBITDA was $59.2 million or 38.4% of net sales, up from $52.6 million or 37.9% of net sales in the prior year quarter.\nAEC adjusted EBITDA was $16.3 million or 20.8% of net sales, down from last year's $19.5 million or 26.6% of net sales.\nTurning to our debt position.\nTotal debt, which consists of amounts reported on our balance sheet as long-term debt or current maturities of long-term debt remained steady at $350 million.\nWe have a floating to fixed interest rate swap in the place of debt level for the life of the current credit agreement and currently, we do not intend to pay down total debt below that level.\nCash increased by about $33 million during the quarter resulting in a reduction in net debt by the same $33 million.\nCapital expenditures in the quarter of about $9 million were roughly the same as incurred in the same quarter last year.\nFrom a capital deployment perspective, as Bill mentioned, our priorities are unchanged.\nThe first priority is organic investments followed by disciplined and targeted acquisitions followed by returning capital to shareholders.\nOur fundamental strategy has not changed.\nHowever, given our modest leverage and strong free cash flow outlook, the Board of Directors has authorized a $200 million share repurchase program.\nWe believe that such a program will be the most efficient, effective and value-additive approach to returning additional capital to our shareholders.\nWhile there is no guarantee that we will execute all or even any of this authorization, it is the company's intention to make use of this authorization subject to prevailing market conditions and while recognizing the inherent limitations on how quickly we can execute such a significant program.\nFully executed, the share repurchase program would increase our net leverage a little under one turn of EBITDA leaving us with sufficient dry powder for additional strategic actions.\nAs we look forward to the balance of 2021, the outlook for the Machine Clothing segment remains strong.\nQ3 revenues were up over 11% compared to last year partially aided by some currency tailwinds to revenue, primarily due to strong euro.\nPackaging and tissue grades remain the primary drivers of long-term growth.\nWhile we also saw a nice recovery in publication revenue in the third quarter, driven by a return to office and schools, a continuation of this recovery is in jeopardy as a result of the Delta Varian surge which at par has paused some return to office efforts.\nAlso, after we get through the pandemic effects, we do not expect any change in the long-term secular decline in the publication market.\nI would also like to note that the growth rate for the MC segment this quarter was unusually high driven by timing of customer needs.\nSegment orders year-to-date are up about 6% compared to last year and backlog entering Q4 is only modestly higher than at the same time last year.\nWe typically generate about 23% to 25% of the segment's revenue in the fourth quarter, and we expect this year to be broadly similar to that.\nAs a result, we are raising our previously issued guidance of revenue for the segment to between -- to be between $600 million and $610 million, up from the prior range of $585 million to $600 million.\nFrom a margin perspective in Machine Clothing, we delivered another strong quarter, with adjusted EBITDA margins of almost 39%.\nWe are seeing increased pressure from input expenses of all types particularly logistics and expect these pressures to continue to increase through the balance of the year.\nHowever, as previously discussed, many of these cost increases began in Q2 and accelerated in Q3, have yet to materially impact our results due to both the terms of our supply agreements and the roughly six-month lag between procuring raw materials of the higher cost and those cost being reflected in the segment's cost of goods sold.\nWe will see more impact from these cost pressures in Q4, but we will not see the full impact until 2022.\nIn addition, late in the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter, we have seen some relaxation of travel restrictions in certain regions and are beginning to see our level of visits to customers increase, which will result in somewhat higher STG -- oh, sorry.\nSG&A in the fourth quarter.\nDriven primarily by the strong revenue performance, we are increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the segment to a range of $215 million to $225 million, up from the prior range of $210 million to $220 million.\nTurning to Engineered composites.\nWe delivered a strong quarter, very much in line with expectations.\nLast quarter, we indicated that we expected Q3 profitability to be similar to that delivered in Q1 and it was within a few hundred thousand dollars of that level.\nWe were very pleased to be awarded an Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection grant during the quarter of $5.8 million which recognizes the challenges that we, along with the rest of the industry have experienced due to the COVID pandemic.\nHowever, as I already noted, we have adjusted the effects out of both Q3 adjusted results and segment guidance for the year as it is not reflective of continuing operational performance.\nWhile unlikely to have any material impact on the balance of 2021, we are concerned about the slow recovery of the Boeing 787 program where Boeing has indicated that they will continue to produce at a low rate for the foreseeable future.\nAs of the end of the third quarter, we had the equivalent of about five shipsets of 787 product in either finished goods or WIP which is not unusually high.\nHowever, significant quantities of our finished goods exist in Boeing's overall supply chain, which combined with Boeing's low level of production will likely lead to very low levels of production for us, for the foreseeable future and may even lead to significant production gaps.\nAny impact in 2021 would be modest as we are not anticipating any significant recovery on the program this year, but it will likely delay any meaningful recovery on the program until beyond 2022.\nAs you know, our production levels on the F-35 have been uncertain this year, as our customer has dealt with issues elsewhere in the supply chain over the last 18 months and with lower depot consumption of aftermarket parts.\nWe are confident in our outlook for the balance of the year, but I will note that Lockheed Martin and its government customer have established a new outlook for program production that plateaus at 156 aircraft in 2023, a lower rate, and an earlier date than the previously planned plateau.\nThe F-35 remains a very good and profitable program for us.\nThis programmatic change has no impact on this year, but it will likely temper the revenue upside in the program for us in future years.\nOverall for the AEC segment, the year is progressing largely as we expected when we last issued guidance, although we are now less concerned about downside risk.\nTherefore we are raising the lower end of our guidance range for segment revenues resulting in the range of between $310 million, up from the previous range of $290 million to $310 million.\nFrom a profitability perspective, given the year is progressing largely as expected, we are maintaining the previously issued guidance range for AEC adjusted EBITDA of between $65 million and $70 million.\nWe are also updating our previously issued guidance ranges for company-level performance, including revenue of between $900 million and $920 million increased from prior guidance of $880 million to $910 million.\nEffective income tax rate of 28% to 30%, unchanged from prior guidance.\nDepreciation and amortization of about $75 million, unchanged from prior guidance.\nCapital expenditures in the range of $40 million to $50 million also unchanged from prior guidance.\nGAAP earnings per share of between $3.23 and $3.38 increased from prior guidance of $2.84 to $3.14.\nAdjusted earnings per share of between $3.15 and $3.30 increased from prior guidance of $2.19 to $3.20 and adjusted EBITDA of between $230 million and $240 million increased from prior guidance of $225 million to $240 million.\nOverall, while the pandemic is not yet behind us and risks still remain across our business, we are very pleased to be able to raise guidance yet again, reflecting the hard work and dedication of our teams across the globe.\nThe coming years will continue to be a challenge as we and the rest of the industry slowly recover from the severe downturn in commercial aviation and as the machine clothing market searches for its new post-pandemic normal.\nWe also recognize of our risks ahead in terms of supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures, should the recent and current increases be more than transitory.\nHowever, our track record of operational excellence and continuous improvement positions us well to address these challenges.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Today's discussion will also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as operating income and accident share loss and combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, among others.\nI will begin by discussing our second quarter financial highlights in the context of the current business and economic environment.\nI'll then provide a strategic review of each of the segments during the quarter.\nJeff will review our financial results in more detail and provide some thoughts on the quarters ahead.\nWe are very pleased to report outstanding second quarter results, highlighted by strong growth with net written premium increases of 11.7% or 8.6% on an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of 2020 premium returns, driven by gains across all segments.\nOperating income of $104 million or $2.85 per share, operating return on equity of 14.7% and a combined ratio of 94.4%.\nOur strong underwriting results are a reflection of our ability to capitalize on evolving market opportunities while navigating the complexities of this dynamic underwriting environment.\nFrom my perspective, there are two key takeaways for the second quarter results.\nFirst, our growth has accelerated and exceeded pre-COVID-19 levels in all segments.\nAnd second, we continue to achieve broad-based profitability with strong underlying underwriting results in each of our businesses.\nI would like to briefly discuss each of these points in turn.\nWith respect to growth, we delivered a meaningful step-up in premium increases in each of our business segments compared to the first quarter of this year.\nAll of our major segments now are exceeding pre-COVID-19 growth levels as a result of our disciplined and consistent pricing strategy, strong retention and robust new business production metrics.\nStrong relationships with our agent partners provide an opportunity for solid growth potential going forward, as we capitalize on our most profitable market sectors and leverage our state-of-the-art technology platforms.\nAdditionally, we continue to enhance the level of sophistication within our claims data and analytics, including our real-time driving pattern and inflation monitoring tools.\nI've never been more confident in our ability to grow profitably.\nIn Personal Lines, we delivered growth of 11.6% in the quarter or 5% excluding the effect of premium returns in the prior year period.\nOur continued strong growth momentum in this business is a reflection of sustained agent and customer interest in our attractive account offerings, targeted pricing actions, the strength of our market position and our ability to successfully adapt and navigate a competitive marketplace.\nWe grew our Commercial Lines business by 11.7%, driven by the strong performance of our specialty portfolio as well as our small commercial business, which benefited from the economic recovery and is beginning to see the impact of the rollout of our new quote-and-issue platform, TAP sales.\nOverall, we are well positioned to continue driving growth in all segments, and we now expect to deliver mid- to high single-digit growth for the remainder of the year.\nRegarding loss trends, we are still experiencing some remaining lower auto loss frequency in the quarter, reflecting the fact that a meaningful portion of our customer base likely has the opportunity to utilize more flexible working arrangements.\nAdditionally, in many areas of the country, our data indicates reduced traffic and less congested rush hours as potentially lingering consequences of the pandemic.\nWe expect frequency will reach its new normal over the course of 2021, which may provide some persistent lower accident frequency in certain geographies, given our mix and customer profile.\nWe believe this benefit will be partially offset by near-term increased severity from materials inflation and more severe accidents, including elevated fatalities.\nWe delivered strong Commercial Lines profitability in the quarter, although we experienced some elevated property losses, including in other commercial, which we do not believe are necessarily recurring or indicative of a trend.\nWe've been watching the overall property large loss activity for several quarters, and we believe it is consistent with that of the market.\nThus, we think that there is room for additional rate increases in the property lines moving ahead.\nAnd as always, we remain very prudent on our loss selections.\nWe are mindful about the potential for increased social inflation, medical information and treatment delays and other inflationary trends.\nWe are watching the economic recovery and the acceleration of business activity closely, as well as the full reopening and catch-up of the court system in many jurisdictions.\nWhile the impact and duration of inflation on our book of business is yet to be determined, we believe our comparatively short reserve duration positions us well to manage through that potential exposure.\nWith that as background, I would now like to share some recent highlights by business beginning with Personal Lines.\nOur efforts to selectively apply rate adjustments where warranted have been very successful, as demonstrated by our sequential PIF growth of 1.8% in auto and 1.7% in home during the quarter.\nNew business growth came in ahead of expectations, and we are seeing significant sequential improvement and retention.\nOur preferred customer focus and our value-based approach represents significant competitive advantages, particularly as agents become even more strategic with their Personal Lines operating models and carrier placement decisions.\nAccount business represents over 85% of our overall book, leading to a high level of retention and business stability.\nOur Personal Lines retention improved by over two points in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, demonstrating the agility of our approach and the success of our business strategy even in this very dynamic environment.\nIn Personal Auto, we expect our claims auto frequency to gradually approach new normal levels as the year progresses.\nThough the pricing environment remains competitive, we are seeing clear indications that the rate deceleration has bottomed out and the industry is looking to increase rates.\nThis is to be expected given the nature of the Personal Lines pricing cycle, as historically, Personal Auto rates adjust to loss trends rather quickly.\nWe believe we are more favorably positioned for the future given our prudent pricing strategy throughout the pandemic.\nAs a result, we have much less of a need to significantly increase rates and create customer disruption in the near future.\nWe continue to gain momentum with Hanover Prestige, our full account offering for customers with higher value homes and autos and more complex insurance needs.\nThese customers represent a growing segment of the Personal Lines market, which further positions us as a strategic partner with agents.\nThe contribution of this offering to our overall growth is increasing every quarter with the second quarter benefiting new business growth by three points.\nTurning to Commercial Lines.\nWe executed extremely well on our strategic priorities, posting growth of 12% in Specialty and 11% in Core Commercial, driven by a pickup in new business, rate increases and exposure growth.\nStrong topline growth in our Core Commercial business is expected to continue through the year, driven by the reopening of the economy, continued rate increases and a successful launch of TAP Sales, our small commercial quoting platform, which is proving to be a great addition to our already strong small commercial offering.\nIn the second quarter, we launched this new platform in an additional nine states, bringing the total to 20 states, and we complete the implementation countrywide for our first product business owners advantage by year-end.\nAs a reminder, this multiyear significant investment delivers a comprehensive set of capabilities to the marketplace.\nIt includes a new user front end for our agents, new products and endorsements, new states, new sophisticated pricing algorithms, a new policy administration system and new self-service capabilities.\nIn those states where TAP sales was deployed in the first quarter of this year, submissions significantly increased and our hit ratio also improved.\nThe response to this offering has been incredibly positive with agents praising the product's ease of use and simplified quoting process, calling it best in market.\nThe efficiency gains are substantial, enabling the quoting and an issuance of a single location risk in 50% of the time it required before.\nThe investments we have made to modernize our infrastructure and enhance our capabilities across our business are being realized at a time when agents are consolidating and buying more agencies that have substantial small commercial books of business.\nThis is forcing them to become more strategic about the carriers with whom they do business.\nOur account focus, easy-to-use tools and product breadth are driving increased efficiencies for our agents and increasing our value proposition to them.\nWe are confident that our robust offering will provide further growth and agency penetration opportunities for us in the quarters ahead.\nIn Specialty, we also delivered significant growth.\nDuring the quarter, we achieved double digit growth in our Marine, E&S and management liability lines, which are among our most profitable businesses.\nWe continue to leverage our expanded products and capabilities in the financial institutions and retail E&S spaces as well.\nAnd we also advanced our total Hanover strategy, deepening the use of our specialty capabilities across our Commercial Lines customer base.\nAs agents continue to offer specialized products to more customers, we are confident that our Specialty business will continue to generate critical growth for us going forward.\nWe are pleased with the commercial rate environment and the exposure dynamics in our markets.\nWe achieved rate increases of 6.5% in Core Commercial and sustained strong retention at 84.9%.\nWe continued to implement double digit rate increases in Commercial Auto and upper single digits in property with granular pricing segmentation and a strong differentiation in price and retention by risk type.\nExposure growth exceeded historical levels in the quarter, which bodes well for our growth prospects going forward.\nWe achieved rate increases of 8.5% in Specialty, up from 7.5% in the first quarter.\nIn general, Specialty rates can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter as a result of large account renewals and other unique items.\nBut overall, pricing in our Specialty markets has been very strong with price increases continuing to outpace loss trends.\nThere continue to be meaningful drivers that support the strength of the rate environment in Commercial Lines, including the potential of an increase in social inflation, property loss pressures from materials costs, increased reinsurance costs and low interest rates.\nWe believe our focus on smaller accounts and differentiated offerings will help to shield us from meaningful pricing deceleration, which can occur in larger-sized brokered accounts.\nIn summary, the exceptional growth we delivered during the quarter reflects the significant positive momentum we have established across our business and sets the stage for continued profitable growth.\nWe are performing exceedingly well in an uncertain environment, leveraging our unique distribution capability, distinctive agency and customer-centric strategies; disciplined approach to underwriting and pricing; and broad and specialized product offerings.\nAs we begin the second half of the year, we are encouraged by our performance year-to-date and confident in our ability to advance our strategy and capitalize on opportunities for profitable growth going forward.\nAs I have said many times, we are extraordinarily proud of the work our team has done over the course of this public health crisis, delivering on our promises, maintaining and even enhancing the levels of service we provide to those who depend on us.\nAs we continue to drive our business forward, positioning our company to deliver sustained profitable growth, we are being very thoughtful and opportunistic determined to emerge from this ordeal as a better insurance company, employer and corporate citizen.\nWe are closely monitoring the rapidly changing employment trends and practices as well as employee preferences, intent on strengthening a culture that for us has been an important competitive advantage, enabling us to attract and retain outstanding talent.\nWe have begun to invite employees back to work on a largely voluntary basis and expect to fully reopen our offices sometime during the fall, assuming the public health environment is conducive to do so.\nWe are planning to embrace a progressive hybrid model, one that will enable us to provide agents and customers the products and services they expect and deserve and to provide our employees a flexible engaging work environment where they can build rewarding careers.\nThese are truly exciting times for those that are up for the challenge.\nFor the second quarter, we reported net income of $128.5 million or $3.52 per diluted share compared with net income of $115.2 million or $3.01 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2020.\nAfter-tax operating income was $104 million or $2.85 per share compared with $62.7 million or $1.63 per share in the prior year quarter.\nThe difference between net and operating income is due to the increase in the fair value of equity securities.\nBook value per share increased 4.8% in the quarter driven by earnings and to a lesser extent, an increase in unrealized gains in our fixed income portfolio.\nWith the economy largely closed in most of the country placed under stay-at-home orders, many lines of business experienced historically low frequency of claims last year.\nIn response to the fewer miles driven, we returned some premiums to our auto policyholders which impacted our reported net written premiums and underwriting ratios.\nIn addition, business exposures, payrolls and receipts were exceptionally low in 2020.\nAs the economy continues to open up and individuals return to the roadways, we believe our more recent growth trajectory and loss experience, as well as our original expectations for 2021 are better barometers by which to assess our performance.\nWe are pleased with our overall combined ratio of 94.4% in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 96.2% in the prior year quarter, which, a year ago, reflected several large catastrophe events, including losses from social unrest.\nIn the second quarter 2021, we incurred catastrophe losses of $76.8 million or 6.5% of net earned premium, 40 basis points above our quarterly expectation, primarily reflecting severe wind, torrential rain and hail events throughout the Midwest in June on the heels of a very light April and May.\nMichigan, our largest Personal Lines state, was severely impacted by the rain and flooding events in mid- to late June, particularly in the homeowners line.\nMichigan is a very profitable state for us and historically runs at a low 90s combined ratio.\nHowever, when adverse weather events occur, as expected, we do see losses.\nWe also experienced some favorable catastrophe development in the quarter from prior years, which is a testament to our prudent reserving approach.\nPrior year reserve development, excluding catastrophes, was favorable in the quarter, adding $12.6 million to the bottom line, primarily reflecting continued favorability in workers' compensation, Personal Auto and several Specialty lines.\nWe continue to be prudent in our reserving in Commercial Auto, where extension of loss patterns and prior bodily injury development warrant a cautious approach.\nAdditionally, in light of the pandemics effect on loss patterns in 2020, we remain vigilant as we assess ultimate loss costs.\nWith the economy regaining momentum, we are also mindful of the potential for reserving uncertainties related to social and economic inflation, delayed medical procedures and information as well as ongoing court delays.\nOver the past several years, we have placed a considerable amount of emphasis on strengthening our balance sheet.\nIt is stronger than it has been in many years coming out of the second quarter, and we believe such prudence will serve us well.\nClaims activity related to COVID-19 exposures continues to be very manageable, and we are holding substantial IBNR in that area.\nOur expense ratio for the second quarter of 2021 was 31.2%.\nThis was in line with our expectations, consistent with the second quarter of 2020, an improvement from the first quarter of this year.\nWe are confident that we can deliver a 30 basis point expense ratio improvement for full year 2021.\nOverall, current accident year combined ratio ex-CAT was 89% in the quarter.\nThis very strong underwriting result is a reflection of our diversified book of business, our earning in of rate increases and some lingering frequency benefit in Auto Lines.\nLooking at our underlying underwriting results by segment.\nOur Commercial Lines combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 89.5%, up 2.7 points from the second quarter of last year, primarily reflecting a comparison to an extraordinarily low level of losses in the second quarter of last year.\nOur CMP current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 57.6%, in line with most recent trends but slightly elevated compared to our expectations, driven by a higher incidence of property large losses.\nWe believe that our experience is relatively consistent with that of the industry, adding to our continued expectation that there is room for additional property rate increases in the marketplace.\nWe achieved substantial CMP property rate increases in the second quarter, and we believe this trend will continue.\nIn other Commercial Lines, the current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 55.3%.\nThis result reflected the impact of a large loss and reinstatement premium triggered thereon in our highly profitable Hanover Specialty Industrial business.\nIn fact, this particular loss was offset by the overall favorability in our specialty business within the quarter to bring overall loss amounts generally in line with our expectations.\nOur specialty industrial business runs at a long-term combined ratio in the sub 80s.\nWe are confident in our underwriting capabilities and future strong performance in this business.\nOur Commercial Auto current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, remains relatively consistent with the recent quarter's results.\nWe are continuing to take substantial rate increases to address the industrywide multiyear liability issues affecting this line.\nTurning to workers' comp.\nCurrent accident year loss ratio was 61.5%, which was generally in line with recent historical results.\nOur second quarter 2020 ratio was unusually low due to stay-at-home mandates for much of the country.\nWhile the underlying trends in this line remained largely favorable, we continue to be very prudent with our loss picks in light of the rate environment and the potential for new risks posed by office reopenings for certain businesses.\nCommercial Lines net written premiums grew exceptionally well at 11.7% in the second quarter, powered by our small commercial and Specialty businesses.\nWe achieved strong operating metrics, including improved rate, meaningful increases in exposures, return to strong new business growth and a solid core commercial retention of 84.9%.\nOverall, despite some minor and expected variability in losses, we are very satisfied with Commercial Lines trends and underwriting returns in the quarter.\nTurning to Personal Lines.\nOur combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was quite low at 85.3%, but up from 76.8% in the same period last year reflecting the benefit of COVID-19 related auto claims frequency declines.\nOur Personal Lines auto current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 62.2% below historical trends, but up slightly from 60% in the first quarter.\nWhile frequency trends industrywide are quickly moving toward historical norms, our business is still benefiting slightly from lower frequency.\nWe believe there may be a modest longer-term frequency benefit due to changing driving patterns from work from home flexibility of our customer base.\nSo we are observing these trends carefully, and we continue to do an excellent job managing the balance between growth, rate and profitability.\nCurrent accident year loss ratio in our homeowners line remained relatively consistent with prior results, but was slightly above our expectations.\nElevated property loss activity and higher material costs indicate the need for future rate increases.\nWe are seeing a significant push for rate in homeowners in the independent agency space.\nPersonal Lines net written premiums grew 11.6% in the quarter or 5% adjusted for last year's premium returns.\nThis strong result was driven by meaningful acceleration in new business.\nWe also reestablished momentum in our renewal premiums as a result of lower rate increases in certain areas and improve retention.\nThe strength of our data and analytics team and swift communication of market trends across our businesses positions us to opportunistically grow when market conditions allow and make well-informed adjustments when necessary.\nWe are pleased to see Personal Lines largely rebound to its pre-COVID-19 growth levels.\nWe have full confidence in Personal Lines strong growth and profitability prospects.\nMoving to investment performance.\nOur net investment income was $75.6 million for the quarter, up $17.9 million or 31% from the prior year period.\nThis is largely due to an unusual fluctuation in partnership income from period to period.\nNet investment income in the second quarter of 2020 was adversely affected by a $4.6 million loss on limited partnerships, while partnership income in the second quarter of 2021 was $16 million, exceeding our expectations by $9 million.\nOur partnership results through the first half of 2021 do not change our outlook for investment partnerships or overall net investment income for the balance of the year.\nNew money yields continue to put pressure on our overall net investment income.\nAlthough so far, we've been able to meaningfully offset it with robust cash flows from operations.\nWe expect cash generation from our underwriting operations to remain strong.\nCash and invested assets at the end of the second quarter were $9.1 billion, with fixed income securities and cash representing 85% of the total.\nOur fixed maturity investment portfolio has a duration of five years and is 96% investment grade.\nWe have a high-quality portfolio with a weighted average of A plus.\nNet unrealized gains on the fixed maturity portfolio at the end of the second quarter 2021 were $357.8 million before taxes.\nMoving on to our equity and capital position.\nOur book value per share of $88.23 reflects an increase of 4.8% in the quarter.\nWe continue to be thoughtful stewards of our shareholders' capital and deliver on our capital allocation strategy.\nThrough July 26, 2021, we repurchased approximately $10 million of stock, leaving about $395 million of capacity under our stock repurchase authorization that the Board expanded in May.\nIn addition, during the quarter, we paid a regular cash dividend of approximately $25 million.\nOur capital priorities remain unchanged.\nFirst, we strive to maintain our strong capitalization and liquidity; second, we continue to prioritize organic growth for which we generate plenty of capital; and third, we continue to maintain our policy of returning excess capital to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases.\nWe will continue to remain nimble and actively manage our capital with the best interest of shareholders in mind.\nLooking ahead, we now expect net written premium growth in the mid- to high single digits in the second half of the year.\nBased on our strong results in the first half of the year, we believe upper mid-single-digit growth for the full year is possible.\nWith two quarters of better-than-expected ex-CAT combined ratio performance, we are improving our full year 2021 ex-CAT combined ratio outlook from 90% to 91% to 89% to 90%.\nAs noted earlier, we remain on track to reduce our expense ratio by at least 30 basis points in 2021 to 31.3% and we expect our third quarter cat load to be 5.2%.\nWe are very pleased with our underlying performance and our ability to continue our positive momentum in the quarter.\nWe are well positioned to sustain our robust growth momentum and top quartile profitability, delivering value to our agents, customers and shareholders.\nIn addition, we are pleased to announce that we will be hosting a Virtual Investor Day on September 23, in which we will discuss the key aspects of our differentiated strategy, go-forward growth drivers and long-range financial targets.\nWe will be providing additional details in the coming weeks and look forward to seeing you there.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The Toro Company delivered record third quarter results.\nWe continue to benefit from robust demand in both our Professional and Residential segments and our operations team went above and beyond to execute even as global supply chain challenges affected availability.\nOur employees together with our channel partners, kept a sharp focus on serving the needs of our customers.\nAs a result, total net sales for the third quarter were up 16% year-over-year.\nProfessional segment net sales increased 15%, marking the second quarter in a row of double-digit growth for this segment.\nWe saw continued strength in landscape contractor and golf markets worldwide.\nHigher pre-season shipments of BOSS snow and ice management products, and strong demand for our rental and specialty construction equipment and Ventrac products.\nOur lineup of innovative products, combined with strong business confidence fueled robust demand.\nResidential segment net sales were up 23% and that comparison is on top of a 38% growth rate in the third quarter of last year.\nGrowth in the quarter was driven by strong retail demand for our zero-turn and walk power mowers.\nCustomers also continued to respond favorably to our all-season Flex-Force 60-volt product lineup, which offers power and durability with no compromise on performance.\nThe recent actions we've taken to introduce innovative new products, refresh marketing, and expand mass retail distribution continue to strengthen the Toro brand and drive positive results.\nAs noted last quarter, we expected supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures to escalate at a rate faster than could be fully offset in the near term, through pricing and other mitigating actions.\nDespite these challenges, both segments delivered solid earnings growth in the third quarter, Professional earnings up 7.6% and Residential earnings up 10.5%.\nI'll now touch on some of the key themes for the quarter.\nFirst is the robust and broad-based demand, we continue to see across our markets worldwide.\nThis has been driven by consumer and business confidence as well as customer investment priorities focused on outdoor environments.\nWe continue to capitalize on these drivers with our commitment to investing in new product development, our best-in-class distribution, and our talented teams.\nSecond, the continued escalation of global supply chain and inflationary challenges.\nThis included component availability constraints as well as material freight and wage related cost headwinds.\nOur operations team took extraordinary steps to enable us to source and produce as effectively as possible in this incredibly dynamic environment.\nWe also continue to execute on our productivity and synergy initiatives, demonstrated disciplined expense control and implemented market align pricing actions.\nRegardless of how long these pressures persist, we remain focused on managing the factors within our control.\nThird, in line with general economic trends we saw an increasingly challenging labor market, including wage pressures and workforce availability limitations in some of our manufacturing location.\nAcross the enterprise, we have talented and dedicated teams committed to serving our customers.\nWe're focused on having workforce and other resources in place to put ourselves in the best position to meet demand and deliver our products to the right places at the right time.\nOur innovative product portfolio, outstanding team, and deep relationships with our channel partners and end customers set us apart and position us well for the long term growth.\nWe have the financial capacity to invest in the future and we continue to allocate capital to best drive value for all stakeholders.\nThis fiscal year, we've made strategic investments in key technologies, both organically and through acquisitions to advance our priority areas of alternative power, smart, connected, and autonomous.\nOur healthy cash flow also has allowed us to return capital to shareholders while maintaining ample liquidity.\nLooking ahead, we will continue to execute against our enterprise strategic priorities of accelerating profitable growth, driving productivity, and operational excellence and empowering people.\nI'll discuss our outlook further following Renee's more detailed review of our financial results.\nAs Rick said, our record results for the third quarter were driven by robust demand in both our professional and residential segments.\nAgainst the backdrop of increasing supply chain, inflation and labor pressures.\nWe grew net sales for the quarter by 16.2% to $976.8 million.\nReported earnings per share was $0.89 per diluted share, up from $0.82 last year and adjusted earnings per share was $0.92 per diluted share, up 12.2% from $0.82 in the prior year.\nBoth of our segments delivered record top and bottom line third quarter results.\nProfessional segment net sales were up 15.2% to $718.5 million.\nThis increase was driven by broad-based demand in landscape contractor, golf, snow and ice management, rental and specialty construction, and Ventrac products.\nThis was slightly offset by lower sales of underground construction equipment due to supply chain disruptions that impacted product availability.\nProfessional segment earnings for the third quarter were up 7.6% to $122.3 million.\nAnd when expressed as a percent of net sales, decreased 120 basis points to 17%.\nThis decrease was largely due to higher material and freight cost, partially offset by net price realization and productivity improvements.\nResidential segment net sales for the third quarter were up 23% to $252.1 million.\nThis increase was primarily driven by strong retail demand for zero-turn and walk power mowers.\nResidential segment earnings for the quarter were up 10.5% to $31.5 million and when expressed as a percent of net sales, down 140 basis points to 12.5%.\nThis decrease was primarily driven by the same factors as in the Professional segment.\nTurning to our operating results for the quarter.\nWe reported gross margin of 33.9%, a decrease of 110 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year.\nAdjusted gross margin was 33.9%, down 130 basis points on a comparative basis.\nThese decreases were largely due to the same factors that affected Professional and Residential earnings.\nSG&A expense as a percent of net sales for the quarter increased 20 basis points to 21.4%.\nThis increase was primarily driven by more normalized spending compared to the third quarter of last year and a legal settlement in the third quarter this year.\nOperating earnings as a percent of net sales for the third quarter decreased 130 basis points to 12.5%.\nAdjusted operating earnings as a percent of net sales decreased 80 basis points to 13.1%.\nInterest expense was down $1.3 million for the quarter to $7 million, driven by lower debt levels and decreased interest rate.\nThe reported effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 19.3%.\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow.\nAccounts receivable totaled $301.2 million, down 2.2% from a year ago, primarily driven by channel mix.\nInventory was essentially flat to last year at $665.6 million.\nHowever, finished goods were significantly lower, driven by strong retail demand while working process was higher.\nThis was a reflection of the supply chain variability and our efforts to procure higher levels of key components when available.\nAccounts payable increased 53% from last year to $411.4 million.\nThis was primarily due to the timing of purchases as well as more normalized spending compared to last year.\nYear-to-date free cash flow was $429 million with the conversion ratio of 123%.\nThis positive performance was largely the result of higher earnings and lower working capital, primarily driven by higher payables.\nAt the end of the quarter, our liquidity remained at $1.1 million.\nThis included cash and cash equivalents of $535 million and full availability under our $600 million revolving credit facility.\nOur cash balances are elevated from pre-pandemic levels, largely driven by our desire to ensure adequate liquidity at the onset of pandemic.\nAnd our cash was further strengthened by the accelerated demand we're experiencing along with the related working capital impacts.\nOver the past nine months, we deployed the majority of cash generated year-to-date, including the funding of our Turflynx and Left Hand Robotics acquisition, an increase in our regular dividend with $85 million paid out so far this year, the resumption of share repurchases with $177 million through the third quarter and $100 million in debt pay down.\nWe also increased our capital expenditure budget reflecting our commitment to invest in key technologies and ensure we have the capacity to meet future demand.\nWe remain disciplined in our capital allocation strategy fueled by our strong balance sheet.\nOur priorities have not changed and include reinvesting in our businesses to support sustainable long-term growth both organically and through acquisition, returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and maintaining our leverage goals to support financial flexibility.\nAs we enter the final quarter of our fiscal year, we're benefiting from strong demand momentum and our leadership position in the markets we serve.\nAt the same time customer demand continues to outpace supply and production.\nWe're not immune to the challenges facing companies worldwide and we remain focused on serving our customers, winning in our markets and managing the factors within our control.\nWe previously indicated that operational headwinds would be most pronounced in the third quarter.\nAs a result of collective work of our team to fulfill additional demand, we were able to deliver a stronger third quarter than we had anticipated.\nThis resulted in lower finished goods heading into the fourth quarter.\nWe remain focused on procuring materials, components and other resources to accelerate the pace of production in the face of supply chain, inflation, and labor pressures.\nWith this backdrop, we are updating our full year fiscal 2021 guidance.\nWe now expect net sales growth of about 17%, up from 12% to 15% previously.\nWe anticipate the Professional segment growth rate will be similar to the company average, with the Residential segment exceeding the company growth rate.\nLooking at profitability, we now expect overall adjusted operating earnings as a percent of net sales for the full year to be similar to fiscal 2020.\nWe expect professional segment operating margins to be similar to last year.\nAnd we expect Residential margins to be down compared to last year, but still well above historical levels.\nThis reflects our volume leverage and strong operational performance year-to-date offset by increasing supply chain, inflation, and labor pressures.\nWe continue to take actions to counteract these market dynamics.\nBased on current visibility, we now expect full-year adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.53 to $3.57 per diluted share, up from our previous range of $3.45 to $3.55.\nThis higher earnings per share guidance reflects our strong year-to-date performance, the robust demand environment, and continued solid business execution while also taking into account the headwinds previously discussed.\nAll in, we remain well positioned to capitalize on this period of profitable growth as we continue to execute on our strategic long-term priorities.\nThe guidance Renee just discussed reflects continuing strong demand across our end markets as well as our current operational outlook.\nLooking at global key demand drivers for the remainder of the fiscal year and into fiscal 2022, we are watching consumer and business confidence levels along with developments related to COVID-19, customer prioritization of investments to maintain and improve outdoor environments, a continuation of strong momentum in golf and government support and funding of infrastructure investments.\nThese end market factors should continue to drive strong demand in the fourth quarter and into next year.\nOur biggest challenge remains our ability to produce, to meet retail demand across all of our markets given the current operating environment.\nWe believe constraints will begin to ease as we see improvements in key material and component availability, logistic channels and other COVID related factors.\nOur operations team remains committed to doing everything reasonably possible to meet increased production requirements and grow market share in this challenging environment.\nWhen operating constraints begin to ease, we expect to be in a better position to build field inventory from our current historically low levels.\nWe remain focused on driving productivity and synergies prudently managing expenses and implementing market based pricing actions as appropriate.\nWe are well positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities with our strong cash flow, market leadership, investments in innovation and trusted relationships.\nA few recent examples that highlight our commitment to innovation and relationships include for the second year in a row, a Partner of the Year Award from Tractor Supply Company, this time as omnichannel partner.\nFrom Green Industry Pros, the selection of three of our products for their 2021 Editor's Choice Award citing innovation and utility has factors.\nThe three products include the Exmark 96-inch Lazer Z Diesel, the Toro Z Master 4000, and Z-Spray LTS spreader sprayer.\nIn August, two of our rental and specialty construction offerings received Editor's Choice Award from Rental magazine, including the Ditch Witch SK3000 full size stand-on skid steer, which offers the most power in its class and the Toro Swivel Mud Buggy with superior traction and maneuverability.\nAnd finally, the International Sustainable Irrigation Expo recently recognized our Aqua-Traxx Azul micro-irrigation solution as new products of the year.\nIn addition to awards, our innovative products have been showcased at recent marquee events.\nEarlier this summer, our Perrot Irrigation Systems helps keep the playing fields in top condition at many of the Euro Cup Championship sites.\nIn July, our irrigation and turf equipment supported Paul Larsen and his team at Royal St George's Golf Club as their expert work was on full display at the Open Championship.\nAnd more recently, our turf and irrigation solutions helped Tokyo's Japan National Stadium and Kasumigaseki Country Club maintain pristine conditions for this summer's high-profile events.\nOur mission to deliver superior innovation and customer care is deeply rooted in our purpose of helping our customers enrich the beauty, productivity and sustainability of the land.\nThis long-standing focus on sustainability extends to our communities where we have a strong legacy of giving back.\nA few recent examples highlight this legacy.\nFirst, close to our worldwide headquarters, we partnered with Better Futures, an organization that works to transform the lives of men post incarceration and supports Minnesota's environment.\nOur donations of equipment and training resources helped further the organization's mission.\nSecond, on a national level, we've partnered with the American Rental Association Foundation on a new community impact project.\nThis initiative is improving communities across the US by rebuilding green spaces.\nThese are just a couple of examples of the many ways our company employees are giving back and promoting sustainability, supporting our customers, and communities as an important part of our culture and core to who we are as a company.\nIn closing, we are optimistic as we finished fiscal 2021 and head into 2022 while also acknowledging the continuing dynamic environment.\nWe believe our updated guidance appropriately reflects both the risks and the opportunities we face.\nWe have strong fundamentals and momentum across our businesses and are well positioned to capitalize on future growth.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:And Scott Wells, Chief Executive Officer of Clear Channel Outdoor Americas, will participate in the Q&A portion of the call.\nThese statements include management's expectations, beliefs and projections about performance and represents management's current beliefs.\nThere could be no assurance that management's expectations, beliefs or projections will be achieved or that actual results will not differ from expectations.\nDuring today's call, we will provide certain performance measures that do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles.\nThey provide a detailed breakdown of foreign exchange and non-cash compensation expense items as well as segment revenues and adjusted EBITDA, among other important information.\nFor that reason, we ask that you view each slide as William and Brian comment on them.\nThis is our third quarter conducting the call remotely.\nAnd once again, we ask that you bear with us in case there are any technical issues during the call.\nIt has certainly been an unprecedented year for many of us and like you, I'm sure we continue to feel the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nBut in the past quarter, we've also seen how robust our business is and how strongly it recovers as and when some kind of normality returns.\nWe delivered better than expected consolidated revenue in the third quarter with reported revenue down 32% compared to the prior year, a substantial improvement compared to the 55% decline we reported in the second quarter.\nExcluding China and FX, the decline would have been 27% better than the low 30% decline guidance we have provided in early August.\nOur performance in Europe was better than anticipated and well demonstrated the resilience of our medium.\nAs audiences returned to the streets, our advertisers returned to our medium.\nUS performance also showed sequential improvement and was in line with our expectations.\nAt the same time, we continue to implement initiatives to align our operating expense base with revenues.\nAs a whole and in the context of the pandemic, the results in the third quarter, especially in Europe were certainly encouraging.\nWe are continuing to leverage our investments in digital screens, in technology and in our footprint to manage through the crisis and ensure we have the flexibility to deal with the uncertainty as governments across all our markets deal with the ongoing challenges of COVID-19.\nOur focus on continued investment for long-term growth is well as demonstrated by the recent announcement of our winning the contract for the rights to advertise in the New York and New Jersey airports.\nWe are proud and excited to have won this significant tender and I congratulate Scott Wells and his team in securing it.\nI'll talk later in more detail about the contract and our confidence in its value to our business.\nNow as we look ahead, based on the information we have as of today, we expect a slight sequential improvement in the Americas revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter.\nHowever, we are not able to provide fourth quarter guidance for our European segment.\nThe recent mobility restrictions in our European markets, most notably in the UK and France in the past 10 days have created volatility in customer booking activity significantly limiting our visibility.\nI'm proud of the incredible work our team has done and continues to do to reinforce our solid foundation and drive operational efficiencies in the face of rapidly changing business conditions.\nMoving on, I'll provide an overview of our business, the current environment and views on where we see the out-of-home market going from here.\nSo please turn to Page 4.\nIn the Americas segment, year-over-year revenue was down 32% in the quarter, which is an improvement compared to the 39% decline reported in the second quarter.\nOur Americas business is centered around the top 20 markets, which contributed to the significant growth we were delivering up to and including the first quarter of this year prior to COVID-19.\nHowever, even though our audience levels are returning to normal, the largest markets in the top 20 are those most impacted by advertisers pulling back on our out-of-home spending, especially on the East and West Coast, where national advertisers are most likely to be focused.\nPlease turn to Page 5.\nEurope supported revenue was down 13% against prior year and excluding foreign exchange adjustment was down 18%, which as I noted at the beginning of my remarks is a substantial improvement compared to the 62% decline we saw in the second quarter.\nThe improvement in digital, which accounts for approximately 30% of European revenue and declined 17% excluding FX impact was even larger due to the speed at which advertisers were able to launch campaigns as business quickly returned once lockdowns were eased.\nAs I've stated in the past, our investment in digital is a key component of our strategy.\nOur digital network is a dynamic medium, which enables our advertisers to engage in real time, tactical, contextual and flexible advertising.\nI'd call out the strength of our sales team across Europe, we've done an excellent job responding with agility.\nAs markets opened up, our audiences were moving around again and advertiser interest returned.\nWe also benefited from our strategic focus on roadside locations, which historically account for about two-thirds of our total European revenue and are far less affected by COVID-19 driven restrictions than the transit environment which account for approximately 10% of our European revenue.\nOur UK business was a great example of this, where about 80% of revenue is historically from roadside inventory.\nSince mid-July, up until the recent announcements of new restrictions, our customer booking activity actually exceeded bookings made in the same period last year.\nMoving on to Page 6, and the Americas business.\nWith the outlook in the Americas improving, we remain cautiously optimistic for the near term.\nOur longer-term focus remains on returning to growth, which we believe we can achieve in 2021.\nAs we enter the fourth quarter, our visibility remains limited.\nHowever, we have shifted from playing defense to playing offense, leveraging the investments we've made, and continuing to make in technology.\nEven with the uncertainty created by the recent COVID-19 spikes, we believe our organization is in a stronger position to manage through the instability in the market.\nIn light of that instability, we have expanded our client direct selling initiatives.\nOur focus is on selling creative ideas as opposed to specific billboard locations.\nAs advertisers work to realign their advertising campaigns, we have found that CMO's are more willing to jump on a Zoom call to hear a great idea.\nOur ability to get a foot in the door is improving all the time.\nWe continue to demonstrate to advertisers how our RADAR suite of solutions can help us help them.\nThe audience levels are returning to normal, but travel patterns have changed.\nAudiences are spending more time close to home and less time in city centers, but they're still out and about.\nWith RADAR, we're able to quickly to adjust to these new travel patterns to help our customers understand the best inventory and roadways on which to reach their customers, we target those customers via our mobile ad and measure the success of the campaign.\nMore specifically, in the fourth quarter, we are seeing continued sequential improvements in our business.\nFor the first time since March, we've beaten comps in the number of weeks so far this quarter.\nIn our national business, the number of RFPs is improving and is close to 2019 levels.\nLocal continues to improve and we are seeing continued strength in our perm [Phonetic] inventory.\nWe're currently in the renewal season and most are keeping their locations.\nThat said, we are still waiting for more data to better understand the strength of the holiday season relative to previous years as advertisers continue to delay buying decisions.\nOur largest category business services is holding up well, and is performing at levels equal to last year.\nWe are seeing increases in beverages, with the continued weaknesses in amusements and entertainment.\nAdditionally, our revenue generated by our programmatic platform has rebounded faster than the rest of our business, although programmatic is still a small percentage of total revenue.\nMoving on to Page 7 for a review of the Americas technology initiatives and new contracts.\nDuring this past quarter, we continue to invest in technology and our digital footprint in America.\nWe added 19 new digital billboards this quarter for a total of 57 new digital billboards this year, giving us a total of more than 1,400 digital billboards.\nWe also partnered with Tremor Video to enhance our RADAR offering, which now provides advertisers a coordinated out-of-home and all screen video solution that seamlessly extends into TV, digital or social video campaigns that reach consumers when and where they're ready to engage with brands.\nThis is just the latest of enhancements to the RADAR suite, and we expect to continue to add customer friendly capabilities to RADAR in the coming months.\nIn addition, our data analytics capabilities expanded with our recently announced rollout of a new audience impressions methodology for airport adverstising, developed in partnership with the industry measurement body Geopath, this innovation provides advertisers a more precise understanding of consumers advertising Journeys and behaviors as they traverse airports.\nThe new methodology marks a shift from measuring campaign fully based on passenger count toward a more robust understanding of audience behavior and consumers' likelihood are being exposed to advertising in airports, using the same Geopath data that is used to measure audiences in the traditional roadside out-of-home sector.\nThe data will become available to advertisers through Geopath as well as through RADAR.\nAs I mentioned at the start, we are also delighted that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Board has awarded us the largest airport advertising contract in the US to transform JFK, LaGuardia, Newark and Stewart airports into world-class digital media platforms.\nThis is a landmark win for us and demonstrates our confidence in the underlying fundamentals of our business and our focus on long-term profitable growth opportunities beyond the temporary impact of the pandemic.\nThe contract is for 12 years and is contingent upon execution by both parties, which we expect to occur in mid-November.\nWe anticipate the contract will go into effect December 30, 2020.\nWe worked with the Port Authority to align our interests with contract terms that set the stage for both parties to achieve their goals under the current conditions and for years to come and it has the potential to become the new industry model.\nThe deal contains a two-year transition period to account for the impact of COVID-19 and the traffic recovery at Port Authority airport.\nThe actual MAG due each year, as well as capex spend after the two-year transition period will be dependent upon total passenger traffic.\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey airports are gateways to the world.\nAnd as the region and travel recover, we believe our team is best used to lead its historic transformation.\nWith the addition of these high-value marquee airport assets to our footprint, brands will have the unique one-stop shop ability to execute campaigns that reach consumers as they drive, walk or fly throughout at the New York and New Jersey metro area.\nMoving on to Page 8.\nIn Europe, where we are seeing a range of performances within our markets due to the resurgence of COVID-19 cases.\nAs I noted earlier, historically about two-thirds of our revenue in the region is generated by our roadside displays.\nIn October, we continue to see strength in our street furniture and billboard inventory, given the audiences were still on the street.\nIn contrast to continued weakness in transit, our largest categories FMCG and retail improved sequentially.\nIn addition, fashion and beauty are benefiting from the holiday season.\nHowever, our visibility into November and December has been impacted by the spike in new cases and new restrictions, which have led some advertisers to pause their activity.\nOf course, we are keenly aware of the recent developments around the second wave of COVID-19 in Europe and we are monitoring these closely.\nWhile the new restrictions and the uncertain environment will impact our business in the near term, they are not expected to last as long nor are they as limiting in terms of movement as those we saw back in March and April.\nAs a result, we believe the second wave will have a much smaller impact on revenue in the fourth quarter than it did in the second quarter.\nMore importantly, the resilience of the business is clear.\nWhen audiences return, out-of-home business comes back strongly.\nAnd as I said earlier, in the UK and elsewhere, we've seen booking equal or better to the prior year in many weeks during the past quarter.\nTurning to our European technology investments on Page 9.\nIn Europe, we continue to help brands navigate the audience and environmental impact of changing COVID-19 restrictions through the application of smart data.\nFor example, the UK's Return Audience Hub has become a go-to planning portal for advertisers.\nAs I mentioned last quarter, the hub monitors a huge anonymized mobile data set to learn and openly share how the portfolio is delivering audiences compared to pre-lockdown levels.\nClear Channel RADAR is now operational in both Spain and the UK and has further strengthened our ability to help brands engage audiences effectively as mobility patterns evolve.\nWe are seeing early benefits from our implementation of RADAR.\nFor example, in Spain, we've booked campaigns for PepsiCo using proximity to stores and more targeted audience demographic and behavioral data being able to respond to new audience behaviors and mobility patterns through the changes we are seeing as a result of COVID-19.\nWe continue to expand our digital footprint this year, adding 383 digital displays in the third quarter and 699 year-to-date for a total of over 15,000 screens now live.\nAs we continue to expand our digital reach across European cities, we are well positioned to deliver increased flexibility and enhanced contextual relevance at scale, improving our abilities in the brands' needs.\nThis is evidenced by the improving digital revenue trend in the third quarter.\nThroughout our digital transformation, we are committed to making Clear Channel inventory more accessible to both new and existing advertisers.\nAs in the US, we are developing our programmatic capabilities at an increased pace while securing and expanding partnerships with a number of the leading supply side platform partners.\nMost recently, in Spain, we successfully ran our first fully programmatic campaign to car brand Cupra in partnership with SSP Broadsign Reach.\nBroadsign Reach is already live across Holland and Switzerland.\nIn the UK, we just announced the new programmatic partnership with SSP high stack.\nAcross Clear Channel outdoor, we strive to create products and provide services that excite and engage our consumers, communities, advertisers and business partners.\nAs a result, we believe we are well positioned to return to growth in 2021.\nAt the same time, we recognize the pressures of the current environment and we will continue to take steps to preserve liquidity, including balancing the need to defer capital expenditures, and reduce costs while still investing in strengthening our platform.\nPlease turn to Page 10.\nBefore I review our third quarter results, I want to remind you that during our GAAP results discussion, I'll also talk about our results adjusting for foreign exchange, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.\nWe believe this improves the comparability of our results to the prior year.\nAdditionally, as you know, we tendered our shares in Clear Media on April 28, and therefore our Q3 results in 2020 do not include Clear Media.\nHowever, our results in Q3 of 2019 did include Clear Media's results.\nConsolidated revenue for the quarter decreased 31.5% from last year to $448 million.\nAdjusting for foreign exchange, it was down 33.1%.\nIf you exclude China and adjusted for foreign exchange, the decline in revenue was 27%, which was better than the low 30% decline we had projected in early August.\nOur better than expected results are due to a stronger than anticipated rebound in Europe.\nConsolidated net loss declined $77 million to $136 million in the third quarter of 2020 as compared to $212 million in the third quarter of 2019.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $31 million in the quarter, down 78.4% and excluding FX, was down 78.9%.\nNow on to Page 11 to discuss the Americas results.\nThe Americas revenue was down 31.8% during the third quarter from $328 million in 2019 to $224 million.\nAs William mentioned, this is an improvement over the second quarter results, which were down 39%.\nRevenue declines and national and local, as well as digital, improved relative to the second quarter, while the decline in airports increased.\nIn general, our airport inventory is considered premium space.\nSo while advertisers did not immediately reduce the airport advertising campaigns in the beginning of the second quarter, they began pulling ads in the back half of the quarter, and into the third quarter.\nLocal, which accounted for 64% of revenue was down 27.6%, and national, which accounted for 36% of revenue was down 38.2%.\nDigital accounted for 30% of revenue and was down 34.8%.\nThis compares to a 53.7% decline in the second quarter.\nOur long-term contracts for print large format billboard, which we refer to as perms, continue to hold up well, even though total print ad revenue was down.\nBoth direct expenses and SG&A were down 19% in the quarter, primarily due to lower site lease expenses and lower compensation costs, as a result of the decline in revenue and cost reduction initiatives.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $71 million, down 48% from the prior year.\nAs we have stated in the past, our business is a high fixed cost business, and although we are working on reducing expenses throughout the organization, the decline in revenue resulted in a larger reduction in adjusted EBITDA.\nPlease move on to Page 12 to review Europe.\nEurope revenue was down 13.4%.\nExcluding foreign exchange revenue, was down 17.9% in the third quarter.\nThis is a substantial improvement from the 62% decline reported in the second quarter, with all markets contributing to the improvement.\nFrance was up in the quarter due to the new Paris street furniture contract in addition to a partial rebound in the underlying market.\nDigital revenue accounted for 30% of total revenue that was down 16.6%, excluding FX, slightly less than the overall decline.\nAdjusted direct operating expenses and SG&A expenses were down 8.9%.\nThe decline is due to lower site lease expense, in addition to lower compensation expense, primarily related to the decline in revenue, in addition to cost reduction efforts.\nAdjusted EBITDA was a loss of $8 million, due to the decline in revenue and high fixed cost base.\nIn August, we issued senior secured notes through our indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, Clear Channel International BV, which we refer to as CCI B.V. Net proceeds from the note offering provides incremental liquidity for our operations.\nOur European segment consists of the businesses operated by CCI B.V. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nAccordingly, the revenue for our Europe segment is the revenue for CCI B.V. Europe segment adjusted EBITDA does not include an allocation of CCI B.V.'s corporate expenses that are deducted from CCI B.V.'s operating income and adjusted EBITDA.\nAs I just discussed, Europe and CCI B.V. revenue decreased $34 million during the third quarter of 2020, compared to the same period of 2019, $217 million.\nAfter adjusting for an $11 million impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, Europe and CCI B.V. revenue decreased $45 million.\nCCI B.V. operating loss was $38 million in the third quarter of 2020, compared to operating loss of $16 million in the same period of 2019.\nOn to Page 13 for a quick review of other.\nOur other segment includes Latin America and Clear Media.\nThe 2019 results include Clear Media, which was sold in Q2 of 2020.\nLatin America revenue was $7 million in the third quarter, down $15 million from the prior year.\nThe spike in COVID-19 in Latin America started later in the year, and it is taking longer to control the spread of the virus in Latin America.\nDirect operating expenses and SG&A were $13 million in the third quarter, down $4 million from the prior year.\nAdjusted EBITDA was a loss in the quarter.\nNow on to Page 14 to discuss capex.\nCapital expenditures totaled $26 million in the third quarter, down $34 million from the prior year, as we proactively reduced our capital spend to preserve liquidity and sold our stake in Clear Media.\nEven with this substantial reduction, we did continue to invest in digital in key locations with 19 new digital billboards in the US, and 383 new digital displays in Europe.\nPlease move to Page 15.\nClear Channel Outdoor's consolidated cash and cash equivalents, as of September 30, 2020, totaled $845 million, including $417 million of cash held outside the US by our subsidiaries.\nDuring the third quarter, we transferred a portion of the proceeds from the sale of Clear Media to the US.\nOur debt was $5.6 billion, an increase of just over $500 million during the year, as a result of our drawing on our cash flow revolver at the end of March, and issuing the CCI B.V. notes in August.\nCash paid for interest on the debt during the third quarter was $147 million, up slightly from the prior year, due to the timing of interest payments, partially offset by lower interest rates.\nThe company anticipates having approximately $21 million of cash interest payments in the fourth quarter of 2020, and $350 million in 2021, including the interest on the new CCI B.V. secure notes, with the first interest payment in April of 2021.\nMoving on to Page 16.\nAs William touched upon, we continue to focus on managing our cost base and strengthening our liquidity and financial flexibility, while driving improvements in the top line trends that will return the business to its pre-COVID trajectory.\nThis includes our proactive steps to right-size the business.\nIn addition to the temporary cost saving plans we enacted in the second quarter, we've also initiated restructuring plans throughout the company.\nPlans are expected to generate annualized pre-tax savings of approximately $32 million upon completion, with total charges for the plans in the range of $23 million to $26 million to achieve these savings.\nWhile we remain confident the business will return to pre-COVID levels, we still don't have the visibility yet on timing.\nGiven the uncertainty, we felt it was prudent to take the appropriate steps to work to align the cost base with the current business environment.\nAdditionally, during the third quarter, as previously discussed, we issued $375 million in senior secured notes in August through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary CCI B.V.\nWe continue our site lease contract negotiations with landlords and municipalities to better align fixed site lease expenses, with reductions in revenues.\nWe generated rent abatements of $24 million during the third quarter and $53 million year-to-date.\nWe continue to benefit from compensation cost reductions through actions enacted in the second quarter, the majority of which are temporary.\nWe obtained European government support and wage subsidies of $7 million in the third quarter and $15 million year-to-date.\nWe eliminated and reduced certain discretionary expenses.\nWe deferred capital expenditures, as I just mentioned, and we deferred site lease expenses and other payments to optimize working capital levels.\nFrom a liquidity standpoint given what we know today, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity, including the $845 million of cash at the quarter end, to fund the needs of the business as the economy and our business recover.\nPlease move to Page 17.\nAs William mentioned, in the Americas, we expect to see a slight improvement on a sequential basis in revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin.\nIn Europe, we saw a strong sequential improvement in the third quarter.\nHowever, our visibility in the fourth quarter has been impacted by the recent mobility restrictions put in place in some of our largest European markets, most notably in the UK and France.\nThese restrictions have created volatility in customer booking activity, significantly limiting our visibility and ability to provide guidance.\nAs I mentioned, our team continues to work exceptionally hard through the challenging environment and we are seeing the results of our efforts.\nWe're encouraged by the way we've seen advertisers return to our inventory in the last quarter, demonstrating the resilience of our medium and the value of our locations.\nThey're benefiting from our continued investments in technology and expansion of our digital footprint and are proud of securing new contracts most especially winning the New York and New Jersey Port Authority airports.\nWe remain focused on the strong, medium, and long-term opportunities within our sector and are confident Clear Channel is well positioned to capitalize on these improving trends.\nAs I conclude my remarks, I want to reiterate a few things.\nFirst, as Brian mentioned, the actions we took earlier in the year give us what we believe to be sufficient liquidity to manage through the pandemic, even with the spikes we've seen in the US and Europe.\nSecond, we will continue to identify both temporary and permanent costs reductions to better align our expenses with the current economic environment and expand on our restructuring plans.\nThird, in the third quarter, we delivered better than expected results, with a strong rebound in Europe demonstrating the underlying resilience of our business.\nIn recent weeks, in both some European markets and the US, we have at times equaled or bettered prior year performance.\nWhen infection rates decline and restrictions are lifted and our audience return, our markets come back.\nLooking ahead, the course of the pandemic is still unclear with the second wave in Europe and continued uncertainty in the US.\nAlthough, we expect the next few quarters to remain challenging, we believe in the underlying fundamentals of our industry and our business.\nAs both Brian and I said, given the resilience of our team, investments in our business, and strength of our platform, we expect to deliver a slight sequential improvement in Americas revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter.\nWe are not providing fourth quarter guidance for Europe, given the recent mobility restrictions creating significant volatility in our booking activity.\nHowever, we remain cautiously optimistic that we will return to growth in 2021.\nLastly, as we've stated before, we always remain open to dispositions and opportunities that accelerate our path to creating enhanced value for shareholders.\nHowever, given the current economic environment, our focus remains on continuing to own, operate and enhance the value of the current portfolio of assets in order to drive shareholder value as the economies rebound.\nI look forward to providing updates regarding our progress.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We appreciate you joining us today and hope you're staying safe and well.\nWe are pleased with the strong start to 2021 and ongoing recovery in our automotive and industrial businesses.\nThe GPC team remained focused on solid execution and in delivering strong financial results through improving sales trends, increasing operational efficiencies and enhancing customer value.\nThrough the quarter, we operated thoughtfully with the physical and mental well-being of our employees the top priority as our 50,000-plus GPC teammates are the core of our success.\nTurning now to our first quarter financial results.\nTotal sales for the quarter were $4.5 billion, up 9% from last year and significantly improved from the 1% sales decrease in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nGross margin was also a positive, representing our 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin expansion and our teams in the field continued to do a great job of managing our expenses through ongoing cost actions and the carryover of expense reductions implemented last year.\nThese results drove a 41% increase in operating profit and an 8.1% operating margin, which is up 180 basis points from the first quarter of last year.\nOur strong operating performance drove net income of $218 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.50, up 88%.\nWe also continued to fortify our balance sheet ensuring ample liquidity and solid cash flow.\nWe are proud of our teams and we are encouraged by our results and we intend to build on this momentum throughout 2021.\nTurning now to our business segments.\nAutomotive represented 66% of total sales in the first quarter and Industrial was 34%.\nBy region, 73% of revenues were attributable to North America with 16% in Europe and 11% in Asia-Pac.\nTotal sales for Global Automotive were $3 billion, a 14% increase from 2020 and much improved from a 1% increase in Q4 of 2020.\nComp sales were up 8%, improved from a 2% decrease in the fourth quarter and segment profit margin was up 250 basis points, driven by strong operating results in each of our automotive operations.\nSales were driven by positive sales comps across all our operations with 15% comps in Europe and Asia-Pac, 7% comps in the US and 3% comps in Canada.\nThe ongoing global economic recovery, including financial stimulus in the US, improving inventory availability, favorable weather conditions and our focus on key growth initiatives were all sales drivers in the quarter.\nWe would add that while we continue to expect a reasonable level of inflation as we move through 2021, price inflation was not a factor in our first quarter sales.\nIn Europe, sales were much improved from Q4 as our team capitalized on the strengthening sales environment, despite lockdown throughout the region.\nIn addition, initiatives to grow key accounts, enhance inventory availability and the ongoing launch of the NAPA brand continued to prove effective in driving profitable growth and market share gains.\nFor the quarter, our teams in France and the UK outperformed in the region with strong double-digit sales comps.\nWe would also call out a much improved performance by our team in the Benelux region.\nThe strong sales recovery combined with excellent expense controls produced a 500-basis point improvement in operating margin.\nSo a terrific start to the year for our European operations.\nIn Asia-Pac, our Automotive sales remained in line with the mid-teen growth we experienced through the second half of 2020.\nFor the quarter both retail and commercial sales held strong as the region operated through multiple lockdowns associated with the pandemic.\nRetail sales, which represent over 40% of our total sales volume through our Repco stores continued to outperform posting a 33% increase in March and plus 24% in the quarter.\nOur commercial sales continued to accelerate as well posting double-digit sales growth in the quarter.\nWe continued to benefit from the strength in online sales, which reached record highs at three times pre-COVID levels.\nFinally building on the NAPA brand name has been well received and we remain focused on growing our NAPA presence in the region.\nSumming it up, this group continues to perform at a very high level on both the top and bottom lines, resulting in a 150-basis point improvement and profit margin for the quarter.\nIn North America comp sales in the US were up 7% helping this business post a 180-basis point increase in profit margins.\nIn Canada, we operated through a variety of regional lockdowns which impacted our larger markets of Ontario and Quebec.\nComp sales were up 3% and operating margin was up 130 basis points.\nSales in the US, which posted its strongest quarterly comp since the first quarter of 2015, were driven by solid growth in both the retail and commercial segments.\nThis was our first quarter of positive commercial comps since pre-pandemic and our team produced record sales volumes in the month of March.\nIn addition, both ticket and traffic counts were positive on both our retail and commercial transactions, marking our first increase in traffic counts since several quarters.\nBy region, the Atlantic, Midwest and West Groups posted the strongest growth, although we would also call out our Northeast Group, which produced solid growth in the quarter.\nThis is notable as this region of the US has been most affected by the COVID-19 lockdowns over the past 13 months.\nLikewise, we would add that product sales in categories such as batteries, tools and equipment and brakes were strong this quarter.\nWe are especially encouraged to see the rebound in our brakes business which generally is a positive indicator for our commercial business.\nOn the retail side, which continues to outperform with strong double-digit growth, we continued to drive sales via investments in retail specialists and store refreshes, as well as targeted promotions.\nWe would also call out our ongoing omnichannel investments and the increase in B2C online sales, which reached record levels in the quarter and were up 150% from the prior year.\nOur commercial sales, our other wholesale category of independent garage customers, continued to generate strong growth.\nWe have been encouraged by the number of new accounts we are serving.\nClearly our investments in increasing the number of professional salespeople on the street has been effective in attracting new customers to NAPA.\nWe were also pleased to see improved sales with our NAPA AutoCare and major account customers which posted positive sales growth for the first time in several quarters.\nSales to the fleet and government group were down year-over-year, but sequentially improved from the fourth quarter and we look for further improvement in sales for this segment.\nAs we look ahead, we are excited for the growth opportunities we see for our Global Automotive segment.\nWe expect further improvement in aftermarket fundamentals such as increased miles driven, a growing vehicle fleet and an increase in vehicles aged six to 12 years, all favorable for the industry.\nWe can assure you we remain focused on our initiatives to deliver customer value and ultimately sell more parts for more cars.\nThese plans include further enhancing our inventory availability, strengthening our supply chain and investing in our omnichannel capabilities.\nIn addition, we expect to expand our global store footprint with additional bolt-on acquisitions, changeovers and new greenfield stores to further enhance our competitive positioning.\nSo now let's discuss the global Industrial Parts Group.\nTotal sales for this group were $1.5 billion, flat with last year.\nComp sales were down 2%, improved from the 4% decrease in Q4 and reflecting the third consecutive quarter of improving sales trends.\nMarch was a breakout month with the North American Motion team posting a 7% increase in average daily sales and achieving record sales volumes.\nThis was a tremendous accomplishment and another turning point for GPC in our emergence from the pandemic.\nThe ongoing recovery over the last nine months is in line with the continued improvement in the industrial economy which you can see in several key indicators for our business.\nFor perspective, PMI was 64.7% in March, an increase of 4.2 points from December 31st.\nIn addition, industrial production increased by 2.5% in the first quarter, the third consecutive quarter of expansion, following the significant downturn in the second quarter of 2020.\nImportantly, we can see these positive indicators translating to more activity with our customers, which are operating at higher run rates as well as releasing capital project orders.\nThe strengthening sales environment, along with our initiatives to drive growth and control cost produced an 80 basis point margin improvement with segment profit margin at 8.3% versus 7.5% last year.\nDiving deeper into our Q1 sales.\nWe will start by saying that inflation remains a non-factor in our numbers thus far.\nThat said, we are seeing more pricing activity and expect another year of 1% to 2% price inflation from our suppliers.\nFor the quarter, we experienced improving sales trend among virtually all product categories and industries served.\nWe were especially encouraged by the recovery in the equipment and machinery aggregate and cement and wood and lumber sectors, all key industry groups for us.\nIn addition, we continue to benefit from the build-out of our omnichannel capabilities with digital sales up two times from the first quarter in 2020.\nA key driver of our digital growth relates to our inside sales center which is generating incremental sales to new Motion customers.\nWhile still a relatively small percentage of total sales, we are excited by the potential for future sales growth.\nWe also remain focused on growing our services and solution businesses to expand our expertise and sales opportunities in areas such as equipment repair, conveyance and automation.\nWe have made several bolt-on acquisitions to build scale in these areas and our services and solutions capabilities remain a key consideration in our overall M&A strategy for the Industrial business.\nto further ensure profitable sales growth, we continue to enhance our pricing and category management strategies.\nIn addition, we plan to continue to optimize our supply chain network and further improve our productivity, while delivering exceptional customer service.\nClosing out our Industrial comments.\nWe remain bullish about our Motion business and we are excited to see this team moving back into a growth mode.\nSo now I'll conclude my remarks by providing a brief update on our ESG initiatives.\nAs outlined in our Corporate Sustainability Report, GPC embraces our responsibility to innovate in ways that provide for our environment, our associates and the communities in which we operate.\nIn Q1 we expanded our training and development programs to ensure personal growth and enhance our comprehensive well-being program focused on the emotional, financial and physical health of our GPC teammates.\nAdditionally, we continue to make progress in the advancement of our corporate commitment to diversity and inclusion, we are actively recruiting talent that is representative of the communities we serve, training our teammates to mitigate unconscious bias and model inclusive behaviors while strengthening partnerships that support our D&I initiatives.\nFinally, we remain focused on our mission to be good corporate citizens where we both work and live.\nSince 1928, we have been giving back to communities and causes that make a difference and that legacy continues in 2021.\nFirst I want to congratulate the global GPC team on the performance this quarter.\nAs Paul mentioned, our team delivered solid performance in the first quarter and have strong momentum.\nThe environment has improved compared to 2020, but we remain cautious as global uncertainty continues to be a part of doing business each day.\nAreas of attention for us include COVID-19, inflation, global logistics and product and labor availability.\nWe also have more challenging year-over-year comparisons that will require sustained momentum during the second half of the year.\nDespite the uncertainty, the GPC team is energized and focused to deliver performance.\nI'll now share some additional perspective on our strategic initiatives in progress.\nThe foundation of our priorities is based on the customer experience and understanding their needs and working to exceed their expectations.\nWe are analyzing and listening to customer feedback and are corresponding to strength and opportunities.\nIn the simplest terms, our customers need us to be easy to do business with, reliable and helpful.\nThis independent data reinforces our priorities and serves as a guiding principle in terms of required action and strategic investment.\nTo deliver a best-in-class customer experience we have opportunities to simplify and integrate our existing operations.\nThe global teams are executing multi-year plans to realign teams, streamline processes, improve operational productivity and reduce costs.\nThese initiatives will not only create operating efficiency, but also enable faster team execution, deliver a better customer experience and accelerate profitable growth.\nI'd like to highlight a few initiatives that illustrate our efforts to simplify and integrate.\nFor example, we're working to optimize facilities footprint and coverage, simplify and integrate disparate legacy IT systems, streamline back-office support functions, offshore non-customer facing functional activities and centralize GPC indirect sourcing processes as a few examples.\nAs we simplify and integrate, we're simultaneously investing in our core business and positioning for the future.\nOur strong cash flow, solid capital structure and disciplined capital allocation provide the flexibility needed to continue to make these investments.\nKey pillars of our core investments include talent, sales force effectiveness, digital supply chain and emerging vehicle technologies.\nA few highlights of our progress across the key pillars during the quarter include.\nWe continue to take deliberate action across the globe to recognize high potential talent, infuse new capabilities into the organization and recruit diverse talent that is representative of the communities we serve.\nExamples include category management, digital, emerging vehicle technology and field leadership roles to name a few.\nTalent will always be a priority area of investment as we strive to be an employer of choice for teammates that share our GPC values and want to play a leadership role in our exciting future.\nTwo, sales force effectiveness.\nData and analytics to understand our unique customer segments, the different needs of each segment and associated strategies to serve the segment is a foundational element of sales force effectiveness.\nThe sales efforts reflect our omnichannel initiatives and include an increasing mix of both traditional selling and digital strategies.\nAs an example, the US automotive team revamped its sales intensity with new reporting tools to track customer visits, digital tools to communicate with field sales teammates and enhanced virtual product and skills training.\nIn addition, in 2021, the US automotive team adjusted compensation programs to better align incentives with profitable growth.\nAs I mentioned, digital is a foundational priority as we deliver a best-in-class customer experience and accelerate profitable growth.\nOur businesses delivered excellent performance via digital channels in the quarter.\nWe continue to see strong increases versus prior year across our global digital channels.\nDigital still represents a relatively small portion of our total sales and we're excited about the compelling digital vision our teams are executing.\nRelated, we continue to invest in foundational digital elements, including catalog, search and other critical customer experience elements, such as ease of ordering, pricing and analytics.\nOur supply chain initiatives are focused to ensure we have the right product available in the right market at the right time.\nWe are continuously executing inventory, facility, productivity, logistics and technology strategies to achieve this goal.\nOne solid example is the success the US Industrial team enjoyed with recent facility automation investments that delivered a 500% labor productivity improvement.\nOther select examples would be enhanced workforce management and delivery tracking tools in the US automotive business.\nLastly, emerging vehicle technologies.\nWe aspire to lead as it relates to the opportunities that emerging vehicle technologies present for our automotive industries.\nWe believe we have a unique position to leverage including our scaled global footprint, diverse portfolio, leading global brands, established customer-supplier relationships and one GPC team approach.\nThrough our planning process, we developed a multi-dimensional strategy to address electric vehicle trends.\nA few select highlights include the alignment of talent 100% dedicated to developing and executing EV strategies, product and category management strategies with existing and new SKUs, global supplier councils with existing strategic partners, advisory groups leveraging our 25,000 global repair center relationships and partnerships with strategic EV market participants.\nLastly, strategic bolt-on acquisitions are a key part of our GPC growth strategy.\nWe utilize acquisitions to acquire new customers, further penetrate existing priority markets, enter new geographies, acquire product and service capabilities and acquire talent.\nWe also believe our acquisition capabilities position us well as we selectively consider and test new business models.\nOur acquisition pipeline remains active and actionable given the fragmentation of our markets.\nWe believe our scale, market-leading brands, global footprint and unique culture position us to be an acquirer of choice.\nWe will remain selective and disciplined as we execute this important part of our strategy.\nSimilar to the approach utilized for our 2019 cost savings plan, the global teams develop tools in a monthly cadence to create visibility and status on initiatives.\nThis approach not only helps drive performance but also helps to share best practices around the globe as one GPC team.\nIn summary, I hope today's remarks reinforce our sense of focus and global teamwork.\nWe will remain agile as the global environment continues to evolve.\nAnd we will remain focused on what we can control as we execute through the balance of the year and beyond.\nAnd I'll now turn it to Carol to review the financial performance details.\nWe will begin with a review of our key financial information and then we will provide an update on our full-year outlook for 2021.\nTotal GPC sales were $4.5 billion in the first quarter, up 9% from last year and improved from the 0.7% decrease in the fourth quarter.\nGross margin was 34.5%, a 60-basis point improvement compared to 33.9% in the first quarter last year.\nOur steady progress in improving gross margin continues to reflect the positive impact of a number of initiatives, including our pricing and global sourcing strategies.\nAnd we also benefited from a sales mix shift to higher gross margin operations.\nWe would add that the level of supplier incentives in the quarter were in line with last year and neutral to gross margin.\nAnd as Paul mentioned earlier, there was minimal impact of price inflation in our first-quarter sales and this is true for gross margin as well.\nAs we move through the year, we will continue to execute on our initiatives to drive additional gross margin gains via positive product mix shifts, strategic pricing tools and analytics, global sourcing advantages and also strategic category management initiatives.\nOur selling, administrative and other expenses were $1.2 billion in the first quarter, up 4.6% from last year, or up 5.3% from last year's adjusted SG&A.\nThis reflects an improvement to 26.8% of sales this year, which is down nearly 100 basis points from 27.7% last year.\nSo tremendous progress and primarily due to the favorable impact of our cost savings generated in 2020 as well as ongoing cost control measures and also improved leverage on our stronger sales growth.\nOur progress in these areas was slightly offset by rising costs and freight expenses which we're closely managing and planned increases in our technology spend which supports our strategic initiatives as Will covered earlier.\nOur total operating and non-operating expenses were $1.3 billion in the first quarter, up 2.2% from last year or up 2.1% compared to last year's adjusted expenses.\nFirst quarter expenses include the benefit of approximately $20 million related to gains on the sale of real estate and favorable retirement plan valuation adjustments that are recorded to the other non-operating income line.\nAll in, our total expenses for the quarter improved to 28.1% of sales, down 190 basis points from 30% in 2020.\nTotal segment profit in the first quarter was $361 million, up a strong 41% on the 9% sales increase.\nAnd our segment profit margin was 8.1% compared to 6.3% last year, a 180 basis point increase.\nIn comparison to 2019, our segment profit margin has improved by 100 basis points.\nSo solid improvement and our strongest first quarter profit margin since 2015, a reflection of the positive momentum we're building in our businesses.\nOur net interest expense of $18 million was down from $20 million in 2020 due to the decrease in total debt and more favorable interest rates relative to last year.\nThe corporate expense line was $31 million in the quarter, down from $55 million in 2020 due primarily to the favorable real estate gains and retirement plan adjustment discussed earlier.\nOur tax rate for the first quarter was 23.8% in line with the reported rate last year and improved from the prior year adjusted rate of 26.5%.\nThis improvement primarily relates to the favorable tax impact of stock options exercised as well as the previously mentioned real estate gains and retirement plan adjustments.\nOur first quarter net income from continuing operations was $218 million with diluted earnings per share of $1.50.\nThis compares to $0.84 per diluted share in the prior year or an adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.80 for an 88% increase.\nSo now let's turn to our first quarter results by segment.\nOur Automotive revenue for the first quarter was $3 billion, up 14% from the prior year.\nSegment profit of $236 million was up a strong 65% with profit margin at 8% compared to 5.5% margin in the first quarter last year.\nThe 250 basis point increase in margin was driven by the continued recovery in the Automotive business and the execution of our growth and operating initiatives.\nWe were pleased to have each of our automotive businesses expand their margins for the third consecutive quarter.\nIn addition, we're encouraged that our first quarter margin also compares favorably to the first quarter of 2019, up 120 basis points.\nSo a broad recovery across our operations and we look for a continued progress in the quarters ahead.\nOur Industrial sales were $1.5 billion in the quarter, flat with last year and improved sequentially for the third consecutive quarter, which is consistent with the strengthening industrial economy.\nOur segment profit of $125 million was up 10% from a year ago and profit margin was up 80 basis points to 8.3% compared to 7.5% last year.\nThe improved margin for Industrial reflects the third consecutive quarter of margin expansion in both our North American and Australasian industrial businesses and it's also up by 90 basis points from the first quarter of 2019.\nSo another quarter of strong operating results for Industrial, which we expect to continue with stronger sales growth projected through the remainder of the year.\nSo now, let's turn our comments to the balance sheet.\nWe continue to operate with a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity and the financial strength to support our growth strategy.\nAt March 31st, total accounts receivable is down 27% from last year, which is primarily a function of the $800 million in receivables sold in 2020.\nOur inventory was up 6% from the prior year and accounts payable increased 14%.\nAnd our AP to inventory ratio improved to 124% from 116% in the last year.\nWe are pleased with our progress in improving our overall working capital position and we continue to believe we have opportunities for further improvement.\nOur total debt is $2.6 billion at March 31, down $1 billion or 28% from last March and down $60 million from December 31st of 2020.\nWe significantly improved our debt position throughout the course of 2020 with the issuance of new public debt and a new revolving credit agreement that provide for expanded credit capacity and more favorable rates.\nWith these positive changes to our debt structure, our total debt to adjusted EBITDA has improved to 1.8 times from 2.5 times last year.\nAdditionally, we closed the first quarter with $2.6 billion in available liquidity, which is up from $1.1 billion at March 31st last year and in line with December 31st.\nWe also continue to generate strong cash flow, generating $300 million in cash from operations in the first quarter, which is up from $28 million in the first quarter last year.\nWith a strong start to the year, including the increase in net income and the improvement in working capital, we continue to expect cash from operations to be in the $1 billion to $1.2 billion range and free cash flow of $700 million to $900 million.\nOur key priorities for cash include the reinvestment in our businesses through capital expenditures, M&A, the dividend and share repurchases.\nWe invested $48 million in capital expenditures in the first quarter, an increase from $39 million in 2020.\nLooking forward, we have plans for additional investments in our businesses to drive growth and improve efficiencies and productivity.\nWe continue to expect total capital expenditures of approximately $300 million for the year.\nAs you heard from Will earlier, strategic acquisitions remain an important component of our long-term growth strategy.\nWe continue to cultivate a strong pipeline of targeted names and we expect to make additional strategic bolt-on acquisitions to complement both our Global Automotive and Industrial segments in the months and quarters ahead.\nIn the first quarter we paid a cash dividend of $114 million to our shareholders.\nThe Company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since going public in 1928 and our 2021 dividend of $3.26 per share represents our 65th consecutive annual increase in the dividend.\nWe have actively participated in a share repurchase program since 1994.\nWhile there were no repurchases in the first quarter, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase up to 14.5 million additional shares and we will resume share repurchases in the months and quarters ahead.\nTurning to our outlook for 2021.\nIn arriving at our updated guidance, we considered several factors including our past performance, current growth plans and strategic initiatives, recent business trends, the potential for foreign currency fluctuations, inflation and the global economic outlook.\nIn addition, we consider the continued uncertainties due to market disruptions such as with COVID-19 and its potential impact on our results.\nWith these factors in mind, we expect total sales for 2021 to be in the range of plus 5% to plus 7%, an increase from our previous guidance of plus 4% to plus 6%.\nAs usual, these growth rates exclude the benefit of any unannounced future acquisitions.\nBy business, we are guiding to plus 5% to plus 7% total sales growth for the Automotive segment, an increase from plus 4% to plus 6% and a total sales increase of plus 4% to plus 6% for the Industrial segment, an increase from plus 3% to plus 5%.\nOn the earnings side, we are raising our guidance for diluted earnings per share to a range of $5.85 to $6.05, which is up 11% to 15% from 2020.\nThis represents an increase from our previous guidance of $5.55 to $5.75.\nWe enter the second quarter focused on our initiatives to meet or exceed these targeted results and we look forward to reporting on our financial performance as we go through the year.\nLooking ahead, the GPC team is excited for the ongoing recovery in the global economy and the growth prospects we see for both Auto and Industrial.\nOur strong balance sheet provides us the financial flexibility to pursue strategic growth opportunities and we remain focused on executing our plans to capture profitable growth, generate strong cash flow and drive shareholder value.\nAs a result, we are optimistic that we can deliver strong financial results in the quarters ahead.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:If you do not have a copy, it can be obtained in the Investor Relations section on our website at www.\nPlease note that we do not undertake to update such information to reflect the impact of circumstances or events going forward.\nIn addition, please be advised that due to prohibitions on selective disclosures, we do not, as a matter of policy, disclose material that is not public information on our conference calls.\nThat's always been obvious investment strategy favored at the end of every cycle.\nThese are really just select the few dominant technology masters of the universe that everyone loves, sit back and enjoy the multiple expansion.\nMeantime, valuation spreads between cheap and expensive have reached all-time highs all over the world.\nFurther, the volume of questions about whether value will ever work again or whether there is a new definition of value have been -- have become commonplace.\nThis is reminiscent of the late 1990s Internet bubble, when Michael Lewis' 1999 book, The New New Thing, described it all you needed to know.\nInvestors then like investors today, were mesmerized.\nBut values day is coming, paying less than the present value of future cash flows remains a winning strategy for long-term investment success, and the environment today makes this path even more attractive than normal.\nWe would argue that the seeds for unwinding today's extremes are right in front of us, especially as our COVID dominated world has led us into a recession, that history shows it's the key marker for the shift.\nConsidering the following four possible catalysts that could already be signaling that a shift is upon us.\nFirst, the recession is in place and the path toward economic recovery is becoming clear.\nWe examined recessions in the U.S. over the last 100 years and in Japan over the last 45 years, and the evidence is compelling.\nThe U.S. experienced 14 recessions during the past century.\nI'm looking at the five year returns, measuring from the beginning of the recession, the value outperformed the broad market by an average of 5% per year.\nSecond, interest rates stop falling, bringing multiple expansion from growth stocks to an end.\nInterest rates have been in structural decline for the past 40 years.\nThe trend has led us to a world where you can buy value stocks at PEs of 10 just like at any time in the past 70 years, while average growth stock multiples have doubled from 30 times to 60 times earnings.\nEven if rates don't rise, the tailwind enjoyed by growth stocks should dissipate.\nExuberant growth expectations for the technology masters of the universe revert to normal.\nConsider the math using Microsoft as an example.\nMicrosoft's stock price is up ten-fold during the past 10 years.\nThat's 25% per year, helped by strong growth in cloud technology replacing on-premises hardware demand.\nThis has led to 8% annual growth in operating income.\nTo get an 8% annual stock price appreciation going forward given Microsoft's high multiple would now require 20 years of 10% operating income growth.\nBut considering that, market analysts estimate that public cloud penetration of data needs has reached 30% to 35%, and that the possible maximum penetration for the public cloud would be approximately 70%.\nWe're about halfway to saturation.\nSo where will 20 years of growth come from?\nWe have yet to see.\nAnd finally, the conventional wisdom that technological change comes entirely at the detriment of the existing franchises proves to be mistaken.\nLet's consider the case of electric cars and Tesla versus VW.\nConventional wisdom and stock price suggest that the answer is obvious, Tesla will win.\nBut even if Tesla grows, does it make sense that VW has to shrink?\nTesla's stock is one of the darlings rising over ten-fold during the past five years.\nVW's stock on the other hand has barely changed in the same period.\nBut there are ultimately only two ways to win an auto manufacturing.\nOne, charge higher prices.\nIn other words, maintain a brand premium or two, manufacture at lower costs.\nIt seems inevitable, but these truths will apply to electric vehicles and that VW will succeed importing their brands strengths, think Porsche and Audi and scale advantages into the electric vehicle competition.\nIn fact, VW leads all competitors in the number of new electric vehicles that will be introduced over the next several years.\nTurning to the business front, we finished the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in net inflows.\nFor the previous 12 months, we had net positive flows of approximately $2.1 billion.\nIn fact, we have had positive net flows for each of the last three calendar years and six of the last eight years.\nNo small feat in a world questioning the efficacy of value investing.\nWe reported diluted earnings of $0.16 per share for the third quarter compared to $0.13 last quarter and $0.19 per share for the third quarter of last year.\nRevenues were $33.9 million for the quarter and operating income of $15 million.\nOur operating margin was 44.1% this quarter, increasing from 36.4% last quarter and decreasing from 46.3% in the third quarter of last year.\nTaking a closer look at our assets under management, we ended the quarter at $33.3 billion, up 5.7% from last quarter, which ended at $31.5 billion and down 7% from the third quarter of last year, which ended at $35.8 billion.\nThe increase in assets under management from last quarter was driven by net inflows of $1.1 billion, as I've just mentioned, and market appreciation including the impact of foreign exchange of $0.7 billion.\nA decrease from the third quarter of last year reflects $4.8 billion in market depreciation, including the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by net inflows of $2.1 billion.\nSeptember 30, 2020, our assets under management consisted of $13.3 billion and separately managed accounts, $18 billion in sub-advised accounts and $2 billion in our Pzena funds.\nCompared to last quarter, separately managed account assets increased, reflecting $0.4 billion in market appreciation and foreign exchange impact, partially offset by $0.1 billion in net outflows.\nSub-advised account assets increased, reflecting $1.3 billion in net inflows and $0.3 billion in market appreciation and foreign exchange impact, and assets in Pzena funds decreased slightly to $0.1 billion in net outflows.\nAverage assets under management for the third quarter of 2020 were $33.1 billion, an increase of 11.1% from last quarter and a decrease of 8.1% from the third quarter of last year.\nRevenues increased 12.7% from the last quarter and decreased 8.4% from the third quarter of last year.\nThe fluctuation in revenues primarily reflects severance [Phonetic] and average assets under management over the period as well as the impact to performance fees and fulcrum fees recognized.\nDuring the quarter we did not recognize any performance fees similar to last quarter when compared to $0.3 million recognized in the third quarter of last year.\nThe third quarter also reflects a reduction in the base fees of certain accounts related to the fulcrum fee arrangements of one client relationship.\nThese fee arrangements require a reduction in the base fee if the investment strategy underperforms its relevant benchmark or allows our performance fee if the strategy outperforms its benchmark.\nDuring the third and second quarters of 2020, we recognized $1 million reductions in base fees related to these accounts compared to $0.5 million reduction in base fees during the third quarter of 2019.\nThese fees are calculated quarterly and compare relative performance over a three year measurement period.\nTo the extent that three year performance record at this account fluctuate relative to its relevant benchmark, the amount of base fees recognized may vary.\nOur weighted average fee rate was 41 basis points for the quarter compared to 40.4 basis points last quarter and 41.2 basis points for the third quarter of last year.\nAsset mix and the impact of swings in performance fees and fulcrum fees are all contributors to changes in our overall weighted average fee rate.\nLooking at operating expenses, our compensation and benefits expense was $15.8 million for the quarter compared to $15.6 million last quarter and $16 million for the third quarter of last year.\nG&A expenses were $3.2 million for the third quarter of 2020 compared to $3.6 million last quarter and $3.9 million for the third quarter of last year.\nThe decrease from last quarter and the third quarter of last year, primarily reflects a reduction in travel costs and professional fees.\nOther income was $0.5 million for the quarter, driven primarily by the performance of our investments.\nLooking at taxes, the effective tax rate for our unincorporated and other business taxes was negative 6.8% this quarter compared to a positive 4.1% last quarter and negative 5.1% in the third quarter of last year.\nThe negative effective tax rate this quarter and in the third quarter of last year reflects the benefit associated with the reversal of uncertain tax position liabilities and interests due to the expiration of the statute of limitations.\nWe expect the effective rate associated with the unincorporated and other business taxes of our operating company to be between 3% and 5% on an ongoing basis.\nOur effective tax rate for our corporate income taxes, ex-UBT and other business taxes, was 26.5% this quarter compared to our effective tax rate of 26.6% last quarter and 24.4% for the third quarter of last year.\nThe fluctuation in these effective rates reflects certain permanently non-deductible expenses.\nWe expect this rate excluding these items to be between 23% and 25% on an ongoing basis.\nThe allocation to the non-public members of our operating company was approximately 78% of the operating company's net income for the third quarter of 2020 compared to 77.7% in the last quarter and 74.5% in the third quarter of last year.\nThe variance in these percentages is a result of changes in our ownership interest in the operating company.\nDuring the quarter through our stock buyback program, we repurchased and retired approximately 102,000 shares of Class A common stock for $0.5 million.\nAt September 30, there was approximately $10.7 million remaining in the repurchase program.\nAt quarter end, our financial position remained strong with $49.2 million in cash and cash equivalents as well as $70.3 million in short-term investments.\nWe declared a $0.03 per share quarterly dividend last night.\nWe'd now be happy to take any questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I hope you are all doing well and staying safe.\nObviously, there are many aspects of 2020 that we, along with many of you, are happy to turn the page on as we focus on a safer and healthier 2021.\nIn summary, we were pleased with our fourth quarter results, which demonstrated the continued stability and resiliency of our utility water end market.\nAs anticipated, flow instrumentation sales were less worse sequentially but still down year-over-year.\nWe delivered gross margin improvement, continued cash flow generation and earnings per share growth, albeit with a number of moving parts that Bob will walk through in more detail.\nI'm extremely pleased with our ability to complete two meaningful acquisitions over the past several months that are strategic growth drivers for Badger Meter.\nEarlier this month, we acquired Analytical Technologies, Inc, or ATi, combined with s::can, which we purchased in November 2020, we now have a great foundation in which to build a real-time, on-demand water quality monitoring offering to customers in both utility water and industrial markets.\nI'll talk about the water quality offering in more detail later on the call, as well as the current environment and what we see looking out into 2021 and beyond.\nAs you can see on Slide 4, total sales for the fourth quarter were $112.3 million compared to $107.6 million in the same period last year, an increase of 4%.\nThis reflects the activity stabilization we experienced in the third quarter, which has essentially continued despite the resurgence of COVID-19 cases and various regional restrictions.\nIn utility water, overall sales increased 8% against a difficult comparison in Q4 last year, which was also up 8% over 2018.\nThe acquisition of s::can completed in November 2020 contributed approximately 3 points of the current quarter's revenue growth, with core organic revenues in utility water up 5% year-over-year.\nOn an organic basis, this quarter's sales were the second highest in history, second only to the third quarter of 2020, which of course included a sizable chunk of pandemic-induced backlog catch-up as we discussed at the time.\nPositive revenue mix trends continued with further adoption of smart metering solutions, including increased ORION Cellular radio sales and BEACON software-as-a-service revenue, along with ultrasonic meter penetration.\nWe also ultrasonic meter penetration.\nWe also had the benefit of strategic pricing initiatives, which I'll discuss shortly.\nAs anticipated, flow instrumentation sales were sequentially less worse, down 10% year-over-year compared to the 18% decline experienced in Q3 2020, although activity levels continue to reflect the broadly challenged markets and applications served globally.\nOperating profit as a percent of sales was 15.1%, a modest 10-basis-point decline from the prior year's 15.2% with a number of moving parts at the gross profit and SEA line that I will dissect in more detail.\nGross margin for the quarter was 39.2%, up 100 basis points year-over-year.\nMargins benefited from higher sales volumes, strategic pricing actions and positive sales mix as previously discussed.\nThese favorable gross margin drivers were offset by a discrete network sunset provision recorded in the quarter as well as the natural post-acquisition drag to gross margins caused by amortization of the inventory fair value step-up recorded for the acquisition of s::can.\nI'm going to spend a bit of extra time today on three of these items, price cost, the acquisition impact to margins and the discrete network sunset provision, to help walk you through the impact in the quarter and thereafter as applicable.\nStarting with price cost.\nAs I'm sure you've seen copper prices, which are a proxy for our recycled brass input costs, have increased significantly.\nCurrently averaging around $3.60 per pound, this represents over a 30% increase year-over-year.\nWe've reminded investors that while meaningful, the impact of recycled brass on our cost structure has been moderating over time as we sell more software and radios versus primarily meters in the past.\nI will also remind you that we have and continue to offer polymer, mechanical and ultrasonic meters as part of our choice matters go-to-market philosophy.\nTo give you some level of sensitivity, if copper prices stay in this range for the entire year, it could be a potential cost headwind of about $4 million to $5 million year-over-year.\nThe other side of that price -- cost equation is price.\nAnd as we have done with working capital and operating metrics like SQDC, safety, quality, delivery and cost, we have designed more robust processes and metrics to actively manage strategic pricing for the evolving and valued solutions that we offer to customers.\nIn doing so, we have proactively implemented a number of strategic pricing actions that resulted in positive net benefit from price in the fourth quarter, in advance of the lagging headwind from input cost increases, principally copper.\nIt would be our expectation that we are largely able to offset commodity inflation with price during the year with perhaps some minor manageable lag effects.\nThe second topic is acquisitions and their impact to margins.\nIn the fourth quarter, s::can results were included for two months.\nSo these two months, as expected, totaled approximately $2.5 million in revenues.\nWe recorded the typical amortization of inventory fair value step-up and acquired intangible assets, which all told, resulted in a modest loss in Q4 2020 for the short stub period.\nAs we look to 2021, the combination of s::can and ATi, with total acquired revenue of approximately $37 million, we expect to be earnings per share accretive.\nThe first quarter of 2021 will include the remaining s::can, plus a full quarter of ATi inventory step-up amortization, but we expect normalized profitability in the remaining quarters.\nKen will discuss the longer-term opportunities for these acquisitions in his remarks.\nFinally, turning to the non-recurring discrete network sunset provision.\nThis relates to the sunsetting of the CDMA cellular network for the early adopters of our original cellular radio offering.\nThis sunset is a carrier event that is part of the natural evolution of technology and impacts a variety of IoT devices across an array of industries.\nAs the innovator in cellular radios for water metering applications and as a company focused on customer care, Badger Meter provided protections for such circumstances.\nUntil recently, firm's sunsetting plans by the carriers were not in place.\nNow that these plans appear more firm, we have taken this provision, which reduced gross margins in the quarter by approximately 300 basis points to cover future radio upgrades for these early cellular customers.\nTo be crystal clear, there is no defect in the radio itself.\nThe logical question then follows.\nWill this continue to be an ongoing challenge with cellular radios?\nThe short answer is no.\nThe CDMA network was already well established when Badger Meter introduced its first cellular radio.\nThese first networks had been in service nearly 20 years at that point.\nSubsequently, we have moved ahead of the technology curve, as demonstrated by the launch of ORION LTM [Phonetic] in 2019 and our continued innovation around cellular radio technologies.\nThese technologies will be supported by multiple generations of cellular networks.\nTurning to SEA expenses.\nThe fourth quarter's spend of $27.1 million increased $2.3 million from the prior year.\nThis includes the addition of s::can for two months, including the resulting intangible asset amortization.\nMore broadly, higher personnel costs were partially offset by lower travel, trade show and other pandemic-impacted expenses.\nIncluding both s::can and ATi in 2021, we expect ongoing SEA as a percent of sales to average in the 25% to 26% range.\nThe income tax provision in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 22.6%, slightly lower than the prior year's 24.3% rate.\nWith the additions of s::can and ATi, we don't expect a significant change in our normalized tax rate in 2021, absent any new statutory US tax code changes.\nIn summary, earnings per share was $0.45 in the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of 7% from the prior year's earnings per share of $0.42.\nWorking capital as a percent of sales was 26%, with about 1% of that associated with the addition of s::can.\nOn an organic basis, primary working capital as a percent of sales declined about 200 basis points year-over-year.\nOur full-year free cash flow of $80.5 million was 10% higher than the prior year's $73.2 million and represents approximately 163% conversion of net earnings.\nOur cash flow focus will not abate and we anticipate free cash flow conversion to exceed 100% in 2021.\nHowever, I would caution we do not expect to see the conversion at the robust levels of the past two years, given the structural change in working capital already achieved.\nWe ended the year with approximately $72 million of cash on the balance sheet after taking into account the s::can acquisition.\nIn early January, we deployed $44 million net of cash acquired for ATi, remaining in a net cash positive position.\nAlong with the continued full access to our untapped $125 million credit facility, we have ample financial flexibility to continue executing on our capital allocation priorities.\nTurning to Slide 5, I'd like to highlight the two transactions we completed since our last earnings call and how we believe they bring significant value to the Badger Meter portfolio.\ns::can acquired in November of 2020 and Analytical Technology, Inc, or ATi, acquired just a few weeks ago are both pioneers in providing real-time water quality monitoring solutions.\nThis is differentiated from traditional water quality testing because these solutions capture real-time data through sensors and systems that do not rely on labs, reagents or other consumables resulting in lower capital and operating cost for customers.\nJust as water quality -- just as water utility billing moved from manual reads to advanced metering infrastructure or AMI, we believe water quality monitoring will evolve from lab sample testing to online real-time collection, monitoring and reporting.\nAdding real-time water quality parameters to Badger Meter's core flow measurement, pressure and temperature sensing capabilities as to the scope of actionable data for utilities to improve operating efficiency and for industrial customers to monitor both process and discharge water.\nWe see multiple avenues for growth synergies by bringing together these two acquisitions into Badger Meter.\nFor example, from a water quality sensor standpoint, with this combination, we have a full product offering of both electrochemical and optical sensors.\nFrom a geographic standpoint, where ATi is strong in the US and UK, s::can has an installed base in 50 countries.\nFrom a scale and coverage standpoint, leveraging customer relationships, inside sales, rep networks and distributors will create a greater ability to cross-sell throughout the water ecosystem, including water utilities, wastewater treatment and industrial water applications.\nThere is no question it will take time and investment in order to realize these long-term growth synergies.\nWe need to advance our communications to capture quantity plus quality data parameters, online real-time VR industry-leading ORION Cellular radios.\nWe will need to augment BEACON and EyeOnWater to store, integrate, analyze and visualize information, providing a holistic view of the water network.\nThis is no small undertaking but one that we are organized to execute.\nIn the near-term, it is business as usual for the two acquired businesses.\nThe combined acquired annual sales of approximately $37 million with EBITDA margins in the mid-teens will be earnings per share accretive to our results.\nNow turning to our outlook on Slide 6.\nWhile we were all hoping that turning the calendar 2021 would also turn the page on COVID-19, that is obviously not the case.\nDespite the continued uncertainty, we remain fully prepared to manage safely in support of our customers in the essential water sector, as we did throughout much of 2020.\nThere has been no significant change in customer tone regarding utility budgets with spending on critical and necessary activities, which includes metering solutions required for billing and reducing non-revenue water.\nAs we have stated, our large and diverse customer base will have different needs, circumstances and priorities.\nBut as a whole, utility water bid tenders and awards are largely continuing with their normal processes with limited extended timelines or deferrals.\nWhile we don't provide guidance, Bob will walk through the detail on a few of the items that will impact us in 2021, including price/cost, SEA levels and the expected impact of recent acquisition activity.\nObviously, we had some significant quarterly swings on the top-line throughout 2020, so the growth rates that are uneven in normal circumstances will be more so during 2021.\nWe will continue to drive cash flow, which is the fuel to invest in and grow our business.\nThis includes both organic and acquisition-driven growth with a focus on additional product and software offerings serving water-related markets and applications.\nFor example, expanding functionality of our EyeOnWater software app that helps drive consumer engagement.\nFinally, we will continue to advance a variety of priorities on the ESG front, including relentlessly focusing on employee safety, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, fostering our culture of inclusion and of course promoting water conservation and quality.\nDespite the unprecedented backdrop of a health and economic crisis, we have delivered utility water revenue growth, SaaS revenue as a percent of sales growth to now 5%, strong EBITDA margin expansion, robust working capital management and cash flow and successful execution of two accretive acquisitions.\nIt's a true testament to the criticality of the water industry and the exceptional Badger Meter team.\nSummary: ",

non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations.\nReconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials and on our website.\nOn slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the second quarter.\nBelow that, you see our adjusted operating results, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis.\nAs you saw in our release, Ameriprise had another strong quarter and I feel good about how we're performing at this point in the year.\nThe environment in the US continues to improve as the economy reopens more fully and equity markets remain strong.\nRecent spikes in the virus are putting some pressure on Europe's recovery.\nBut overall, there is a lot to be hopeful for, as we look ahead.\nAs I consider this landscape, we are executing well across our businesses, driving growth through our lower capital fee-based businesses and freeing up capital to generate shareholder value.\nWe delivered another quarter of excellent organic growth in wealth and asset management and strong productivity across our system.\nThis included strong client flows with more than $16 billion of inflows in Wealth Management and Asset Management in the quarter, and we ended with assets under management and administration of 28% to $1.2 trillion, another new high.\nWith regard to recent strategic moves, we completed the RiverSource Life's fixed annuity reinsurance transaction.\nThis further advances our mix shift to capital-light businesses and frees up approximately $700 million of excess capital.\nAnd our acquisition of BMO's EMEA asset management business, which we announced in April is on track to close in the fourth quarter.\nLet's turn to our adjusted operating results for the quarter.\nMomentum in the business continues with revenues coming in strongly at $3.4 billion or 22% fueled by organic growth in markets.\nEarnings increased 34% excluding the reversal of the NOL a year ago with earnings per share up 39% reflecting strong business growth and capital return and ROE remains exceptionally strong at 37.5%.\nAs always, we continue to manage expenses well.\nLet's move to Advice and Wealth Management, where we are consistently generating good growth.\nOur strategic investments continue to be an important part of what we're doing.\nPeople are coming to Ameriprise for a high-quality advice experience backed by leading-edge technology.\nClient satisfaction remains high and clients are engaging with us personally and through our extensive digital capabilities.\nImportantly, our advisors are embracing our training, coaching, and powerful suite of tools that are fully integrated with our CRM platform, and we continue to add capabilities, including testing a new e-meeting tool that helps advisors prepare for client meetings in minutes.\nOur ongoing investments in the technology ecosystem are helping advisors connect with more clients and prospects and run their practices more efficiently.\nThis high level of engagement is leading to really good client activity, asset flows, and client acquisition.\nTotal client inflows were up 54% to $9.5 billion and that continue the positive trends we are seeing over the past several quarters.\nConsistent with strong client flows, wrap net inflows were $10 billion continuing a very strong run rate.\nTransactional activity also grew nicely, up nearly 30% over last year with good volume across a range of product solutions.\nAll of this momentum along with positive markets drove nice growth in advisor productivity up 14% adjusting for interest rates to a record of 731,000 per advisor.\nOn the recruiting front, we had 42 experienced advisors join us in the quarter, a bit below where we've been.\nWe're hearing that advisors have been focused on all that comes with reopening and some held off on transitioning firms of delayed the start dates.\nThat said, people are getting back to a more normal rhythm.\nWe are now hosting in-person meetings that complement our virtual recruiting, and we feel good about our pipeline for the third quarter.\nTurning to the bank, total assets grew to $9.7 billion in the quarter, we continue to move additional deposits to the bank, and we have adjusted our investment strategy to extend duration a bit.\nWe are also seeing a good pickup in demand for our lending solutions.\nLoan volumes are steadily increasing led by our pledge product, which represents a nice opportunity for future growth.\nWrapping up, AWM on metrics and financials remain very strong.\nMargin increased 380 basis points year-over-year and in the quarter at 21.4% showing consistent expansion since the Fed cut short-term rates a year ago.\nMoving to retirement and protection solutions, results were good and we continue to advance our strategic initiatives.\nWith regard to annuities, we had strong variable annuity sales with total sales up 88% from a year ago.\nThis was driven by increased demand for both our structured variable annuity product and our RAVA product without living benefits.\nTogether, this represented over two-thirds of sales in the quarter, a continuation of the shift that we're driving.\nOn the insurance side,Life and Health insurance sales approximately doubled driven by our VUL product which is appropriate product to this rate environment.\nNow let's discuss Asset Management, where we continue to grow the business consistent with our plans.\nAssets under management rose to $593 billion, up 25% over last year from strong business results and positive markets.\nRegarding investment performance, the team continues to generate excellent performance for clients across equity, fixed income, and asset allocation strategies with more than 80% of funds above median over the longer-term time frames on asset weighted basis.\nThis quarter, we had net inflows of $6.7 billion, an improvement of $4.1 billion from a year ago.\nExcluding legacy insurance partner outflows, net inflows were $8.1 billion.\nThese results build upon the favorable net flows we saw over the past several quarters.\nGlobal retail net inflows were $4.2 billion, driven by another quarter of strong results in North America.\nEngagement with clients and intermediaries remain excellent.\nSales and flows traction is broad based with 15 of our investment capabilities generating over $100 million of net inflows in the quarter and in EMEA, retail sales have been weaker given the risk off environment.\nAs I said, we're hopeful that EMEA flows will strengthen in the second half as the post pandemic reopening and economic recovery continue.\nIn terms of Global Institutional, we saw a nice improvement with net inflows of $3.9 billion ex legacy partner outflows with wins across equity and fixed income strategies in both North America and EMEA.\nI feel good about our sales pipeline.\nTurning to BMO, as we discussed with you, the acquisition will add important capabilities and build on our reach in EMEA.\nThe business remains in positive flows, and we continue to receive good feedback from clients and institutional consultants.\nAs I mentioned, we're on track to close in the fourth quarter.\nIn terms of the balance sheet, our capital management is excellent.\nThe business continues to generate substantial free cash flow, and we're freeing up additional capital.\nIn fact, the approximately $700 million of our reinsurance deal largely pays for the BMO acquisition giving us additional flexibility to return capital to shareholders at an attractive rate.\nIn summary, Ameriprise is in a terrific position.\nWe are performing well and generating strong results.\nOur team is serving more clients and deepening relationships.\nWe are delivering an excellent organic growth in both Wealth and Asset Management, and the BMO transaction will add an additional growth opportunity, and we're accelerating our business mix shift with the reinsurance of the fixed annuity block.\nI'd like to close by talking about our team.\nOur people have been coming back to the office a few days a week this summer and reacclimating.\nIt's been great to be together again in person.\nWe're looking forward to be in more fully back to school where conditions are safe to do so while maintaining a level of flexibility.\nAmeriprise delivered very strong financial results across the firm with adjusted operating earnings per share up 39% to $5.27.\nWe continue to demonstrate excellent metrics, earnings growth, and margin expansion in our core growth businesses of Advice and Wealth Management and Asset Management.\nSales of our retirement and protection products were up significantly from last year, and we're focused in low risk and higher margin offerings.\nWe are already seeing a shift in our enforced block and expect this to continue going forward.\nAs Jim mentioned, in the quarter, we continue to advance our strategic priorities to expand our growth businesses and reduce our risk profile.\nWe remain on track to close the acquisition of BMO's EMEA asset management business in the fourth quarter, which will expand our core geographic and product capabilities in attractive and growing market segments.\nAdditionally, we entered into an agreement to reinsure approximately $8 billion of fixed annuities and closed on the RiverSource Life transaction in early July.\nAs noted, we will free up approximately $700 million of capital, and we will have a marginal projected impact on fixed annuity profitability.\nIn addition to the reinsurance transaction, we continue to effectively manage our risk profile through product mix shift to lower risk and higher margin retirement and protects solution offerings.\nOur diversified model generates robust free cash flow and strong balance sheet fundamentals.\nWe returned 92% of adjusted op earnings to shareholders in the quarter, aligning us to our projected 90% target for the full year.\nIn the quarter, Ameriprise's adjusted operating net revenues grew 22% and PTI increased 35%, reflecting continued excellent business performance.\nRevenue and earnings in our capital-light businesses of AWM and asset management drove nearly 80% of the total, excluding corporate and other, a significant shift from a year ago even normalizing for the unusually high earnings in RPS last year.\nWe remain disciplined on expenses.\nG&A expenses were well managed, up 6% given the strong business growth in the quarter.\nOverall, we delivered another excellent quarter that underscores the strength of the business model that continues to yield robust profitable growth.\nTurning to slide 7.\nAdvice and Wealth Management delivered another quarter of excellent organic growth with total client assets up 28% to $807 billion.\nTotal client flows were $9.5 billion, the third consecutive quarter of total client flows at or above $9 billion, demonstrating the sustainability of our organic growth.\nOur focus is not only on growth, but profitable growth.\nIn the quarter, our pre-tax adjusted operating margin was 21.4%, an increase of 380 basis points from the prior year and an increase of 70 basis points sequentially despite continued low interest rates.\nOn page 8, financial results in Advice and Wealth Management were very strong with pre-tax adjusted operating earnings of $423 million, up 56%.\nAdjusted operating net revenues grew 29% to 2 billion, fueled by robust client flows and a 29% increase in transactional activity in addition to strong market appreciation.\nOn a sequential basis, revenue increased nicely to 5%.\nAmeriprise Bank continues to grow at a solid pace reaching nearly $10 billion in the quarter after adding $700 million of sweep cash to the balance sheet.\nExpenses remain well managed, and we continue to exhibit strong expense discipline.\nG&A expense increased 3%, reflecting increased activity and the timing of performance-based compensation expense.\nGoing forward, we remain committed to managing expense and margin in a disciplined manner.\nTurning to page 9, Asset Management delivered another strong quarter, driven by excellent investment performance and sustained inflows, resulting in an outstanding financial results.\nNet inflows were 8.1 billion, excluding legacy insurance partners, which is a continuation of an improved solid flow trends.\nAdjusted operating revenues increased 32% to $879 million, a result of the cumulative benefit of net inflows and market appreciation.\nOn a sequential basis, revenues were up 6%.\nOur fee rate remained strong at 52 basis points reflecting the strong momentum we are seeing across the board with strength in both equity and fixed income strategies.\nExpenses remain well managed and in line with expectation given the revenue environment.\nG&A expenses grew 12%, primarily from the timing of compensation expense related to strong business performance as well as foreign exchange translation and higher volume related expenses.\nAs with AWM going forward, we will manage expense tightly.\nPre-tax adjusted operating earnings grew 79%, and we delivered a 45% margin.\nMoving forward, we expect strong financial performance to continue and anticipate that margins will remain in the mid 40% range over the near term driven by current robust equity markets.\nLet's turn to page 10, retirement and protection solutions continue to perform in line with expectation in this environment.\nPre-tax adjusted operating earnings were $182 million.\nSales in the quarter were up significantly off a low base in the prior year driven by the pandemic.\nSales were above pre COVID levels resulting in an increase in distribution expense in the quarter.\nAdditionally, earnings in the prior year were positively impacted by the lower surrenders and withdrawals relating to the pandemic environment.\nImportantly, we continue to reduce our risk profile by growing sales of retirement products without living benefits.\nRetirement sales increased 88% during the quarter with two-thirds of the sales and products without living benefits.\nThis has shifted in the overall book and now only 62% of our block has living benefit riders, down over 200 basis points from a year ago.\nIn protection, sales nearly doubled as we continue to see a meaningful increase and higher margin in VUL and a significant decline in IUL.\nThis mix shift in both Retirement and Protection products are expected to continue going forward.\nNow let's move to the balance sheet on the last slide.\nOur balance sheet fundamentals remain extremely strong, including our liquidity position of $3 billion at the parent company and substantial excess capital of $2 billion, which does not include the capital release from the recently announced fixed annuity transaction.\nAdjusted operating return on equity in the quarter remained strong at 37.5%.\nWe returned $585 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buyback, and we are on track with our commitment to return 90% of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders for the year.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Also, please note that this teleconference is copyrighted by Brady Corporation and may not be rebroadcast without the consent of Brady.\nAs such, your participation in the Q&A session will constitute your consent to being recorded.\nEven in this challenging environment caused by the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 virus and the associated inflation and logistical challenges, the Brady team once again performed quite well.\nI'm proud of how the team was able to navigate this challenging economic environment and deliver for both our customers and our shareholders.\nThis quarter, we grew sales by a very healthy 16% and we increased earnings per share by 4.7%.\nIf you exclude the impact of amortization, then our earnings per share was up even more significantly at 9.1%.\nIn addition to this solid revenue and earnings growth, we have a rock solid balance sheet.\nThis quarter, we returned more than $30 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.\nAnd we're still in a net cash position of more than $90 million.\nIn our WPS business, sales were down by 7.8%.\nThis sales reduction was almost exclusively the result of very challenging comparables.\nLast year, our WPS team did an excellent job of providing COVID-related products to our customers.\nThe sale of these products, which included social distance signage and personal protective equipment, has since waned, thus resulting in challenging comparables.\nThe best way to look at our WPS business is to compare sales to the pre-COVID period of fiscal 2020, which would show that our current sales levels exceeded those historic pre-COVID levels.\nIn our Identification Solutions business, we continue to post excellent results with sales growth of 25.4% and segment profit growth of 21.2%.\nAnd if you exclude the impact of amortization expense, segment profit would have been up a robust 26.4%.\nOur Identification Solutions business is a very strong franchise and continues to perform extremely well.\nAs we look ahead, our priorities are the first to drive organic sales growth and ensure we are serving our customers extremely well during this period of challenging logistics.\nSecond, it is to take the necessary cost and pricing actions to offset the impacts of this inflationary environment and return to pre-pandemic gross margin levels.\nThird is to integrate our recent acquisitions, and finally, to deploy our capital to drive long-term shareholder value.\nIn our ID Solutions Business, we're embracing these priorities by increasing our investments in R&D, including the incremental R&D necessary to fully realize the benefits from our recent acquisitions.\nWe are certainly seeing benefits from our historical R&D focus as we're launching new products at an increasing rate, and we're continuing to distance ourselves from our competitors who neither have the scale nor financial wherewithal to invest as heavily in R&D.\nWe're also improving our online presence by upgrading our websites and investing more in digital marketing talent all while expanding our sales force and expanding geographically into underserved markets.\nWe're driving significant automation enhancements within our factories and distribution centers, which in a period marked by scarcity of labor and rising costs, this continuous push to drive automation is critical.\nOur strong new product lineup, investments to drive sales and our positive momentum in driving efficiencies give us confidence that our ID Solutions Business will continue to generate strong organic sales growth with very healthy margins in fiscal 2022 and beyond.\nIn our Workplace Safety business, we're capitalizing our common web platform by using our much stronger market intelligence to quickly adapt to changing market dynamics.\nWe've increased our investments to new product development and the pace of new product launches in an effort to increase the percentage of proprietary high-value products sold to our customers which will have a positive impact on our profit margins.\nAnd we're intensely increasing our advertising spend and our head count in certain businesses that have lagged in an effort to drive future revenues.\nThese investments resulted in reduced segment profit this quarter but will result in increased revenues as we progressed throughout the fiscal year.\nOur Workplace Safety business is headed in the right direction, and I'm confident that the changes we've been implementing and the investments we've been making will help drive long-term sales and profit growth.\nWhile we're investing in organic sales, we're also working to streamline our SG&A cost structure so that we can fund our sales growth initiatives while still driving down SG&A expense.\nAnd we're focused on becoming a more efficient manufacturer by automating wherever we can.\nIn addition to our focus on driving organic sales growth and becoming a more efficient organization, we're also actively integrating the three acquisitions that we completed in the fourth quarter last year which includes building out our industrial track and trace solution set.\nMuch of the increased R&D that you see relates to the investments necessary to build out a comprehensive solution that will help move us into faster growing end markets and accelerate sales growth for years to come.\nI'm confident we'll continue to see revenue growth in future quarters.\nHowever, we're seeing inflationary pressures across many different cost categories from wages to freight to raw materials, and we've had challenges securing supply of certain products including chips and selected products for our supply chain originates in Asia.\nIn general, we've been overcoming these shortages, but it has resulted in increased freight charges as we've used airfreight more than we have in the past.\nEven with these inflationary pressures, our gross profit margin was still an enviable 48.2%, which was right in line with the 48.2% experience in the fourth quarter of last year.\nBut our cost increases have neither been large enough nor fast enough to fully keep up with rising costs, resulting in our gross margins being down around 70 basis points and year-over-year basis.\nAs such, we're putting through additional price increases across many of our product lines to try to catch up with the rapidly increasing costs.\nWe believe that these gross margin challenges are temporary and that in the near term we'll return to our historical gross margin levels of close to 50%.\nEven with this challenging logistical environment, Brady is well-positioned as we look to the rest of this fiscal year and beyond.\nI'm confident in our ability to deliver results to our customers, our employees and, of course, our shareholders.\nThen I'll return to provide specific commentary about our Identification Solutions and Workplace Safety businesses.\nI'll start the financial review on slide number 3.\nSales in the first quarter were $321.5 million, which was an increase of 16% when compared to the same quarter last year, and GAAP pre-tax earnings increased 5.8% to $44.7 million.\nImpacting earnings this quarter was a significant increase in amortization expense from the acquisitions completed at the end of last year.\nIf you exclude amortization expense from all periods presented, and our pre-tax earnings would have increased by 11.3% to $48.5 million.\nGAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.67, which was an increase of 4.7% over last year's first quarter.\nAnd if you exclude amortization expense, then earnings per share would have increased by 9.1% to $0.72 this quarter compared to $0.66 in the first quarter of last year.\nSo, financially, Q1 was another strong quarter even with the logistical challenges and the inflationary pressures that Michael just mentioned.\nMoving to slide 4, you'll find our quarterly sales trends.\nOur 16% sales increase consisted of organic sales growth of 7%, and increase from acquisitions of 8.3% and an increase from foreign currency translation of 0.7%.\nOrganic sales growth in our ID Solutions Business was a robust 13.2% in Q1.\nOur Workplace Safety business benefited from strong COVID-related product sales in last year's first quarter, thus creating tough comparables.\nAs a result of these tough comparables, we saw a decline in WPS organic sales of 8.6% this quarter.\nIf we compare our sales levels to the pre-pandemic period, which for us would be the first quarter of fiscal 2020, you'll see that our total sales are up a full 12% over pre-pandemic levels.\nAnd if you compare sales by division, you'll see that Identification Solutions is 15.6% above pre-pandemic levels and workplace safety is 1.2% above pre-pandemic levels.\nThis strong performance not only against last year, but also against the pre-pandemic period, is a direct result of the investments that we've been making and the strong sales momentum that we developed just before the pandemic hit.\nTurning to slide number 5, you'll see our gross profit margin trending.\nOur gross profit margin was 48.2% this quarter, compared to 48.9% in the first quarter of last year.\nAs Michael mentioned, we're seeing inflationary pressures, and we're finding it difficult to fill open manufacturing roles.\nBut we're automating wherever we can, we're driving efficiencies at a strong pace, and we're putting it through targeted price increases.\nOn slide number 6, you'll find our SG&A expense trending.\nSG&A was $96.7 million this quarter, compared to $83 million in the first quarter of last year.\nSG&A was heavily impacted by a full quarter of expense from the three acquisitions completed near the end of last year along with the increase in amortization expense that I just mentioned.\nAmortization expense was $1.4 million in the first quarter of last year and was $3.8 million in the first quarter of this year.\nAnd as a percent of sales, SG&A was 30.1% this quarter, compared to 30% in the first quarter of last year so effectively, right in line with the prior year.\nHowever, if you exclude amortization expense from both the current year and the prior year then SG&A would have declined from 29.5% of sales last year to 28.9% of sales this year.\nSlide number 7 is the trending of our investments in research and development.\nThis quarter, we invested $13.9 million in R&D.\nWe're committed to increasing our R&D investments as we continue to see opportunities for incremental R&D within our core business and, specifically, in building out a comprehensive industrial track and trace platform that encompasses our printers, high-quality materials, RFID scanners, and barcode scanners.\nThese investments in R&D are critical to help propel Brady's long-term sales growth and protect our gross profit margins.\nSlide number 8 illustrates our pre-tax income trends.\nPretax earnings increased 5.8% on a GAAP basis and increased 11.3% if you exclude amortization expense from all periods.\nSlide number 9 illustrates our after-tax income and earnings per share trends.\nAs I mentioned, our GAAP earnings per share was $0.67 this quarter compared to $0.64 in last year's first quarter, an increase of 4.7%.\nAnd if you exclude the after-tax impact of amortization, our earnings per share would have increased by an even stronger 9.1%.\nOn slide number 10, you'll find a summary of our cash generation.\nWe generated $27.5 million of cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow was $16.2 million this quarter.\nOur underlying cash flow was strong, but we intentionally invested in both inventories as well as capital expenditures.\nThis quarter, we purchased two previously leased manufacturing facilities for a total cash outlay of $7.6 million.\nBoth of these facility purchases were ROI positive and will help secure our long-term future.\nThis quarter, we also continued to increase inventories as we've been intentionally prioritizing customer service and product availability over trying to optimize inventory levels and risk running out of critical materials.\nOver the last six months, we've increased our inventories by approximately $30 million.\nEven after returning more than $30 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, having heightened capex and intentionally increasing inventory levels, on October 31, we were still in a net cash position of more than $90 million.\nOur strong balance sheet puts us in a fantastic position to execute additional value-enhancing activities, including investing in R&D, completing additional acquisitions, and returning funds to our shareholders.\nOur approach to capital allocation has not changed and has been serving us well.\nFirst, we use our cash to fully fund organic sales and efficiency opportunities throughout the economic cycle.\nThis includes investing in new product development, sales-generating resources, IT improvements, capability-enhancing capital expenditures, and capex to further automate our facilities.\nWe will also -- sorry -- we will absolutely keep funding these investments where it makes sense and where the investments are ROI positive.\nAnd second, we focus on returning cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends.\nWe've now increased our annual dividend for 36 consecutive years, which puts us in a pretty elite group of companies.\nAfter fully funding organic investments and dividends, we then deploy our cash in a disciplined manner for either acquisitions, where we believe that we have strong synergistic opportunities or for buybacks when we see a disconnect in our view of intrinsic value versus Brady's trade-in price.\nSlide number 12 summarizes our guidance for the year ending July 31, 2022.\nOur full-year diluted earnings per share guidance, excluding amortization remains unchanged at a range of $3.12 to $3.32 per share.\nOn a GAAP basis, our full-year diluted earnings per share guidance also remains unchanged at a range of $2.90 to $3.10 per share.\nIncluded in our GAAP earnings per share guidance is an increase in after-tax amortization expense of approximately $6 million.\nAfter-tax amortization increases from about $5.5 million in fiscal 2021 to about $11.5 million in fiscal 2022, which is a delta of about $0.12 per share.\nAs we look at staging throughout the rest of this fiscal year, we anticipate our short-term gross profit margin challenges to persist throughout our fiscal second quarter, and history shows that our second quarter is seasonally our lowest quarter of the year and generally has earnings per share below that of Q1.\nAs we move beyond the second quarter, we expect to see increased benefits from our pricing actions as well as increased benefits from our many efficiency and automation projects.\nAs a result, we continue to expect that the majority of our earnings-per-share growth will come in the third and fourth quarters of this year.\nWe also expect total sales growth to exceed 12% for the full year ending July 31, 2022, which is inclusive of both organic sales growth as well as sales growth from the recently completed acquisitions.\nWe'll continue to make the investments necessary to drive organic sales growth, we'll continue to search for acquisitions that advance our strategies, and we'll continue to drive sustainable efficiency gains while being tight on non-revenue-generating expenses.\nAs for capital allocation, we'll keep investing in our organic business.\nWe'll keep investing in our industrial track-and-trace initiatives.\nWe'll continue to return funds to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic buybacks.\nWe did just buy back $18.9 million worth of shares last quarter, and we'll continue to look for acquisitions where the price is right and the strategic fit is clear.\nWe have a strong balance sheet, and we'll use it as a tool to drive long-term shareholder value.\nPotential risks to this guidance, among others, include the strengthening of the US dollar versus other major currencies such as the euro or the British pound, worsening logistics that don't allow us to meet our commitments to our customers, and further inflationary pressures that we cannot offset in a timely enough manner.\nSlide number 13 outlines the first quarter financial results for our Identification Solutions business.\nIDS sales increased 25.4% to $248.6 million.\nThis very robust sales growth is comprised of organic growth of 13.2%, acquisition growth of 11.6% and an increase of 0.6% from foreign currency translation.\nOrganic sales in our IDS division were once again very strong, not only versus the first quarter of last year but also against previous sequential quarters.\nAnd on the cost side, our strong focus on sustainable efficiency gains partially offset the input cost increases that we've been experiencing.\nSegment profit as a percentage of sales was 19.6%, which was down from 20.3% last year.\nHowever, if you exclude the sizable increase in amortization that Aaron mentioned, then segment profit as a percentage of sales would have increased from 21% of sales to 21.1% of sales, so an increase of about 10 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year.\nRegionally, organic sales in Asia were strong this quarter with growth of over 15% compared to the first quarter of last year.\nThis is the fourth consecutive quarter of Asian organic sales growth in excess of 10%.\nOrganic sales were also up more than 15% in EMEA despite several lockdowns continuing throughout most of the first quarter.\nOur European team once again did an excellent job driving sales growth while handling the period interruptions caused by the lockdowns.\nWe also had organic sales growth of nearly 12% in the Americas.\nWe saw growth in all product lines and geographies throughout the quarter and we were especially pleased with the bounce back in our healthcare product line where organic sales growth increased approximately 11%.\nIn general, the sales trends and ideas are very positive.\nOur commitment to R&D remains a high priority.\nWe've ratcheted up our investments to build a complete industrial track and trace solution.\nAnd although we're probably a full two years away from having a complete track and trace solution, we've already been experiencing very nice synergies from our recent acquisitions and we expect these sales synergies to only increase from here on out due to the complementary nature of our product portfolios and the more complete product offerings that Code, Magicard and Nordic ID bring to Brady.\nThese acquisitions are performing slightly better than expected and bring us valuable technologies that help us round out our product offerings and make Brady more valuable to our customers.\nClearly, we're devoting a significant amount of time and money to our track and trace product offerings.\nBut we are not sacrificing R&D investments in other areas such as printers and materials.\nWe continued our steady stream of new printer introductions by launching the J4300 Brady Jet Label Printer.\nThis inkjet printer combines with pretty high efficiency proprietary materials to balance the safety and complexity of compliance labels with the demands of industrial environments.\nOur industrial inkjet printers save our customers time by quickly and easily creating compliant, long lasting photo quality labels, signs and tags that are needed to create a safer, more efficient workplace.\nIt's a combination of our steady It's a combination of our steady stream of best-in-class printers, plus Brady's high-performance materials that sets Brady apart from our competition, from barcodes to extremely small text, to perfect photo quality images, our customers most important information needs to be visible and needs to stay put in any type of environment.\nSimply stated, Brady's printers and materials are all about high performance in the harshest of environments.\nOur R&D pipeline is strong and we continue to launch innovative new solutions that help our customers solve problems and be more efficient and effective.\nI'm excited about what we're doing in an ID Solutions business and how our acquisitions of Code, Nordic ID and Magicard will further accelerate our growth.\nWe're improving our customer service, investing in our future and streamlining the rest of our cost structure.\nThese positive revenue trends combined with our strong cost discipline, will help offset inflationary pressures and paint a bright future for our IDS division.\nMoving to slide number 14, you'll find a summary of Workplace Safety financial performance.\nWPS sales declined 7.8%, which consisted of an organic sales decline of 8.6% and an increase from foreign currency of 0.8%.\nThis sales decline was primarily driven by challenging comparables to last year's first quarter.\nOur WPS business performed extremely well and supplied our customers with a great deal of COVID-19-related products during the pandemic last year, and the demand for these types of products has declined substantially since then.\nOur WPS sales were $72.9 million this quarter, which were above the pre-pandemic sales experienced in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.\nEven in these challenging times with periodic shutdowns, our European WPS team did an outstanding job of increasing its customer base.\nAnd for those customers who initially came to us to purchase COVID-related products, our team has done a nice job providing these same customers with our core safety and identification products as well.\nOur Australian business performed similarly to our European business.\nDuring the pandemic, our Australian business grew organic sales over 10% in last year's first quarter.\nLooking back the challenging comparables, we were pleased with this quarter sales volumes as they were above pre-pandemic levels.\nOver the last several quarters, we've increased our Australian customer base and we continue to find opportunities to enhance our digital marketing approach to ensure that we retain our new customers and turn them into long-term repeat customers.\nThe sale of COVID-related products declined in North America as well this quarter, and this decline was not fully offset by our non-COVID product offerings thus leading to a decline in organic sales in the Americas.\nAnd as I alluded to earlier, we've made investments to improve certain of our lagging businesses in WPS including our business in the US that primarily serves micro businesses.\nWe've incurred start-up costs to open a new facility in the US, we've invested in head count, and we're also investing in additional advertising.\nAll in, these incremental investments were approximately $2.5 million.\nThese investments negatively impacted WPS' profitability this quarter, but we believe that these investments are critical to return our WPS business to sustainable, long-term, profitable growth.\nIn addition to these investments, our WPS business also experienced gross margin compression as a result of raw materials, freight and wage inflation as I mentioned.\nSimilar to our IDS business, we're taking actions to offset these cost increases.\nWPS' segment profit was $2.3 million, compared to $8 million in last year's first quarter.\nThis reduction in segment profit was directly related to the reduced sales volumes, the incremental investments that I just mentioned, as well as significant cost pressures.\nOur WPS team members are listening to their customers to identify what they need.\nThey're modifying their marketing campaigns to reach entirely new customers and entirely new industries, and they're working hard to address underperforming businesses within the portfolio.\nOur Workplace Safety business has one more quarter of moderately difficult comparables ahead of it, but we're laying the foundation for a solid recovery.\nI'm proud of the role that Brady played and continues to play in this long, ever-changing fight against COVID-19.\nIdentification Solutions and Workplace Safety products help companies with social distancing.\nOur products help schools reopen safely and safety and identification products were used by our frontline workers all around the globe.\nAnd now, our products are helping our customers increase efficiency to help them meet their own set of customer demand.\nThis pandemic is not over, and the financial impact stemming from the pandemic are certainly not over.\nThroughout the pandemic, we invested in growth and efficiencies, and it's this continual level of investment that will enable us to keep this strong positive momentum.\nBrady is in an enviable financial position.\nWe're coming off of record earnings per share here.\nOur earnings are up, and our balance sheet is very strong.\nWe're in a net cash position even after making three acquisitions toward the end of last year and returning more than $30 million to our shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends this quarter.\nWe will continue to invest in R&D, sales-generating resources and capacity-enhancing capex, all while being very tight on non-revenue-generating expenses and aggressively working through global logistical issues and inflationary forces.\nI'm very proud of how our team performed throughout this challenging period.\nTheir ability to deal with uncertainty, think on their feet and solve problems quickly all while never compromising the long term has built a solid foundation for Brady's future.\nWith that, I'd like to now start the Q&A.\nOperator, would you please provide instructions to our listeners?\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'll start by talking a little bit about the environment, the economy then we'll get into our numbers.\nSince we last talked to you three months ago really three big things have happened in terms of reducing uncertainty and reduced uncertainty is a good thing, always a good thing.\nSo the first and foremost and probably the biggest news of last year was the vaccine, which came out in November and is now being administered.\nObviously, we had the election uncertainty last time, we're past that now.\nWe also had the stimulus, which compared to the other two news is small news but nevertheless positive news.\nWe weren't expecting a stimulus to get done until the new administration takes over.\nBut I'm glad it was passed a few days -- a few weeks ago.\nSo with that as I look through 2021 it feels like a year with a very, very strong potential in the second half of the year possibly starting as early as second quarter.\nBut I do see a slow first quarter as all this good news is great but it actually has to get converted into reality.\nThe biggest risk obviously still remains vaccine distribution and to some extent a new variant of coronavirus.\nThere is still some uncertainty around it, but a hell of a lot less than this time 90 days ago.\nSo we're feeling very good as we put together our budget for the year.\nWe basically took assumptions that first quarter is always a slow quarter for us, but this year will be slow as well for all the reasons I just stated.\nBut then pipeline start to build up and we started executing on a growth strategy somewhere in the second quarter, but really bringing it in, in the second half of the year.\nQuickly looking back to this quarter, I'm very happy with the results where we announced $0.89 per share or $85.7 million in earnings.\nThat compares to $0.70 last quarter.\nAnd if you compare to the fourth quarter of 2019, which feels like a 100 years ago, it was $0.91.\nSo not bad for what we've gone through this year to come out just very close to where we were fourth quarter of 2019 from an earnings per share perspective.\nSorry, NII was $193 million and change, which was $6 million more than our last quarter, about $8 million more than fourth quarter of 2019.\nPPNR was down by $10 million compared to the last quarter, but showed a little increase compared to the fourth quarter of a prior year.\nLeslie will walk you through this, but there are some unique items in this in the expense category mostly having to do with compensation.\nWe had reduced our variable compensation accrual quite dramatically in the second and third quarter.\nAnd we've adjusted that back up, not all the way back up, variable competition will still be much lower than in previous years, but just not at the rate as we were accruing in the second and third quarter.\nThat's one part of that adjustment.\nThere's some -- we made a change in policy to give rollover pay time off due to the circumstances wherein to our employees that costs a couple of million bucks and then there's an accounting thing, which Leslie will walk you through -- smart enough to walk you through that.\nThe big story obviously continues to be deposit generation as well as deposit costs.\nWe had another solid quarter.\nTotal cost of deposits declined by 14 basis points.\nWe were at 57 basis points last quarter.\nThis quarter we ended up at 43 basis points.\nAnd if you look at our stock cost of funds at December 31, we were at 36 basis points.\nSo in other words we're starting this quarter already at 36 basis points and working our way down from there.\nSo I feel pretty good that this quarter will be another very strong quarter in terms of reducing cost of funds.\nI think we'll end up in the low 30s and on a spot basis I feel pretty confident that we will end up with a two handle.\nSo that's sort -- the one side but also our average DDA -- non-interest DDA grew by $966 million, which is again very, very strong.\nI will repeat what I've always said.\nOne quarter doesn't make anything.\nYou should always look at four quarter average or four quarter -- or last 12 month numbers to really get a feel for how the business is doing.\nBut no matter how you look at it this last four quarters or the last quarter has just been a very, very strong performance in the deposit side.\nOur non-interest DDA now stands by the way at over 25%.\nAnd I think a year ago we were at 18%.\nStill more work to be done here.\nWe are expecting this trend to continue into next year and for us to slowly work our way toward 30% DDA.\nAs we had predicted, risk rating migration has slowed quite significantly.\nI think for the first nine months of 2020 there was downward rating migration on $2.1 billion in loans.\nThis quarter it was $169 million.\nProvisioning came down very, very materially.\nIn fact, we have a net recovery of a small number of $1.6 million.\nAlso we had reported back in the summer, $3.6 billion in loans that were on deferral, if you remember.\nThat number is now down to $207 million or about 1% of total loans.\nWe do have $587 million in loans that were modified under the CARES Act.\nAs you know, under the CARES Act, we don't -- these don't show up as TDRs.\nBut nevertheless these modifications by the way are mostly IL modifications or 9 months to 12 months.\nA lot of these modifications are in the CRE, the hospitality portfolio, the hotel portfolio.\nAnd we believe that most borrowers who are going to come to us for temporary relief or deferral have been identified at this point.\nNPLs ticked up a little bit to $244 million, which is about 1.02% of loans but excluding the government guarantee sort of SBA loans that are in this bucket if you take that out, it's about 80 basis points.\nIn our C&I sub-segment, actually NPLs declined.\nThe net charge-off rate was stable at 26 basis points for the year.\nLet's talk a little bit about NIM.\nNIM was 2.33% for the quarter, I think last quarter was 2.32%, so 1 basis point improvement.\nTotal loans grew by $87 million and deposits grew $899 million total of which $219 million was non-interest DDA.\nThese are spot numbers.\nWhat I gave you earlier was average DDA.\nBook value is now up at $32.05, which is higher than what it was at this time last year, it was $31.33.\nCapital position is strong.\nThe board met yesterday and reinstated our share buyback program.\nIf you remember when we started we still had about $45 million left.\nSo, that hardly has been unfrozen.\nAnd then, the board wants us to get to this and then we'll meet again to talk about additional repurchases.\nCapital is -- CET1 is at 12.6% at holdco, it's 13.9% at the bank, and we, of course, declared our usual $0.23 per share dividend.\nStrategy for return to work; let me talk a little bit about this and going forward, not much has changed in terms of our positioning for return to what we still are working remotely and we expect to do that for at least the next two or three months and then make a decision beyond that at that time.\nThere have been multiple other cases in the company as you would expect in this quarter than in previous quarters, but none that are serious enough to have impacted any of our operations.\nThe strategy going forward again, we're waiting very anxiously for economic activity to pick up and for us to start participating in the next business cycle, which as we speak at the beginning right about now.\nThe focus will stay the same, which is to build a relationship-based commercial bank with a focus on small and middle market businesses, stay focused on building core business through non-interest DDA, identifying niche markets that the big guys don't pay much attention to, investing in technology and innovation and not just in branches and locations.\nThe game has really become about technology and solving customer pain points through innovation.\nAlso we haven't lost sight of all the initiatives we had in 2.0.\nThat was not just an exercise in time that you do and then forget about.\nIt really was about changing the culture and we will keep pushing forward on that front as well.\nWe did launch a new initiative earlier last year.\nIt's called iCARE, which stands for Inclusive Community of Advocacy Respect and Equality.\nIt is something that -- have been in the works since summer of last year, when we really announced it inside the company about two, two and a half months ago and gotten a very positive feedback.\nIt really is our effort as an organization to push and build a culture that celebrates and intentionally promotes diversity within the bank.\nThis is not just words.\nThis is, we're putting our money where our mouth is and taking on initiatives.\nWe think if we can do our bit and move things in the right direction by an inch and everyone does that, it will make a big difference in society.\nSo we're very excited about this.\nOur employees are very excited about this and more to come on this in the future.\nLet me see here.\nLet me turn this over to Tom.\nAnd he will walk you through a little more on the business side before Leslie gets into the numbers.\nSo let me start with deposits and a little bit more detail on the deposit book.\nAs Raj mentioned, total deposits grew by $899 million for the quarter and non-interest DDA grew by $219 million for the quarter.\nSo the deposit mix continues to improve.\nWe allowed higher cost deposits to run off this quarter, which we continued to do for the last few quarters as time deposits declined by $1.1 billion for the quarter.\nA little bit more detail on cost of funds.\nSo the total cost of funds plus cost of deposits declined to 43 basis points this quarter.\nOn a spot basis, the APY on total deposits was 36 basis points at December 31, which was down from a spot of 49 basis points at September 30, when compared to last year at December 31 it was 142 basis points.\nSo they continued progress there.\nThe spot rate on interest bearing deposits was 48 basis points as of December 31 compared with 65 basis points at September 30 and 171 basis points a year ago.\nSo we're seeing reductions in cost of deposits across all lines of business across all products that continues to be a very broad-based trend.\nAs we think about December 31, 2020, we had $1 billion of CDs in the book at an average rate of 1.61% that had not yet repriced since the last Fed cut in March of 2020.\nSo in the first quarter of this year, we have a significant amount of that just under $800 million that will reprice in this quarter.\nAdditionally, some CDs that matured and repriced early in the cycle will also reprice down again at their next maturity date.\nSo there's a very significant difference between what these will reprice at our current rates or running about 25 basis points.\nSo we right now continue to see good healthy pipelines and opportunities for core deposit growth across all business lines.\nIt's always a little bit more difficult to size deposit pipelines and timing of treasury management relationships coming onboard, but we continue to expect growth in non-interest DDAs at the levels that we're seeing now.\nIt's likely we'll see more time deposits run off at the same time as the mix of the overall book will continue to improve.\nWe are seeing some of the maturing CDs move into money market category as well, but obviously at significantly lower rates.\nSwitching to the loan side, as Raj mentioned in aggregate, total loans grew by $87 million in the fourth quarter and operating leases declined by $13 million.\nJust a little bit more detail on some of the segments, the residential portfolio grew by $408 million in the fourth quarter, of that $330 million was in the Ginnie Mae EBO segment.\nMortgage warehouse continued to perform well.\nTotal commitments grew by $90.5 million for the quarter and we ended the year at a little over $2.1 billion in mortgage warehouse commitments so the entire quarter and year was obviously very strong in the mortgage warehousing area.\nIn the aggregate, commercial real estate loans declined by $89 million for the quarter, multi-family declined by $171 million of which $151 million was in the New York market.\nSo beyond that, we had overall expansion in other segments of the real estate business, obviously.\nIf we look at loans and operating leases in aggregated BFG, including both franchise and equipment, we're down this year by -- down for the quarter by $124 million, given the COVID impact on the BFG portfolio in particular especially the franchise.\nWe've been focusing our efforts over the last couple of quarters really on portfolio management and exposure reduction versus new production.\nSo if we look into 2021 a bit and kind of break down sort of what we see happening in the different business lines.\nWe expect to see continued strong growth in the Ginnie Mae, EBO, and mortgage warehousing businesses.\nWe expect to see the C&I business start to return to a more normalized growth mode as the economy picks up and the vaccines and so forth are distributed.\nWe're seeing that as a high-single-digit growth for 2021 predominantly in the back end of the year.\nWe're forecasting a low-single-digit decline in CRE for 2021.\nWe continue to have some concerns about valuations in certain segments of the portfolio.\nClearly the hotel and retail segments will be challenged for a good portion of this year.\nSmall business lending is an area we expect to see good growth in 2021.\nWe've invested a lot of our technology and time and expanding small business area.\nAnd in the franchise area, we expect to see that continue to run off probably in the 20% kind of range in 2021 as we continue to work through that.\nPinnacle is expected to decline slightly mid-single digits but that may turn around if there are changes in corporate tax rates with the competitive landscape right now from an interest perspective.\nSwitching a little bit to the -- give you an update on PPP, I think the overall PPP process is going well.\nWe're in the forgiveness stage of -- on 3,500 loans that we originally made in round one to PPP, that's going very smoothly.\nWe probably have about 700 loans so far that have been forgiven and we expect that to continue in the first quarter of 2021.\nAnd we're participating in the Second Draw program to eligible businesses who were given First Draw PPP loans that just recently opened and we'll be open for clients in that phase.\nWe're expecting maybe a 50% to 60% Second Draw request from clients that we had in the First Draw.\nSo overall, I think PPP is going well.\nSome additional comments around loans that we've granted deferrals and I'd refer you to slide 16 in the supplemental deck for more detail around this as well.\nSo starting commercial, only $63 million of commercial loans were still under short term deferral at December 31.\n$575 million of commercial loans had been modified under the CARES Act.\nSo taken together this was $638 million or approximately 4% of the total commercial portfolio as of December 31.\nNot unexpectedly the portfolio segment most impacted has been the CRE Hotel segment, where $343 million or 55% of the segment has been modified as of December 31.\nI would remind you that the majority of our hotel exposure is in Florida.\nThe majority is in leisure properties.\nAnd so those are the segments that we're expecting to see rebound a bit more.\nAnd over the last few months, we've seen occupancy tick up to much better levels than we had seen a few months previous to that.\nAnd so we see in that segment more travel and leisure coming up and we also see some surveys that we've read recently about companies returning more back to the business travel segment as well.\nOur hotel book isn't really a business travel segment, but overall, we see the travel markets improving as we get into further deeper into 2021.\nOn the franchise side, 8% or $46 million of the franchise portfolio was on short-term deferral or had been modified as of December the 31 compared to $76 million or 12% that were on short-term deferrals as of September 30 and 74% that were granted initial 90-day payment deferrals.\n$48 million or 67% of our cruise line exposure has been modified under the CARES Act of December 31.\nAlmost 80% of the total commercial deferrals and modifications and almost 60% of the total loans risk rated substandard or doubtful are from portfolio segments that we had initially identified as -- meeting of heightened monitoring due to potential impacts from the pandemic.\nSo it continues to be those same segments that we're seeing all of this activity and we don't at this point see really any level of difficulties coming from other segments than the ones that we had at first identified.\nOn the residential side, excluding the Ginnie Mae early buyout portfolio, $144 million of loans are on short-term deferral, an additional $12 million had been modified under a longer-term CARES Act repayment plan at December 31.\nThis totaled about 2% of the residential portfolio.\nOf the $525 million in residential loans that were granted at initial payment deferral, $144 million or 27% are still on deferral, while $381 million or 73% of those loans have now rolled off.\nOf those that have rolled off, $362 million or 95% are now making regular payments while only 5% or $19 million have not resumed a regular payment program.\nJust as a reminder, when we refer to loans modified under the CARES Act we're referring to loans that have been excluded from modifications other than short-term deferrals and these are loans that if not for the CARES Act would likely to be classified as TDRs.\nAs Raj said most of these have taken the form of 9 to 12 months interest only deferrals.\nWithin the CRE portfolio we're still seeing overall good rent collections in the office market.\nDepending upon the geography we're seeing 90% or so in the New York market, 97% in Florida.\nSo we think the office collection rate is still running very well.\nMulti-family collections are running 90% in New York and about 96% in Florida and for our larger retail loans we're seeing -- sort of low 90% rates in the retail space.\nLittle bit more on what I mentioned earlier on hotel occupancy in the Hospitality segment.\nAll of our properties in Florida are now open.\nAnd two of the three properties that we have in New York are open.\nIn Florida, we're continuing to see improvement in occupancy.\nWe saw about a 46% average occupancy rate for the quarter.\nDecember is obviously a stronger travel month in Florida and we're coming into the better part of the season.\nIn December, we saw occupancy rates in some areas as high as the 60% range.\nBut generally we saw upper 40s to low 50s.\nSo the Hotel segment is gradually showing some improvement there.\nA little bit more detail about what we're seeing in the franchise space and in the fitness space.\nSo as we've said before when we look at concepts where there's significant drive through delivery capability those tend to be doing well.\nThings like pizza, chicken other more popular QSR concepts are doing very well.\nMany are posting now double-digit same-store sales increases.\nIn-dining concepts are obviously still struggling a bit and that's where we see some softness.\nCertain segments are a little bit divided depending upon whether those concepts in certain locations have delivery type economic models or whether they're in malls or things like that.\nThose are a little bit up and down.\nBut overall we're seeing improvement within the franchise area.\nFitness has taken some steps forward, since our last call.\nAt this point all of our stores are open with the exception of those that are in California, particularly those around the Los Angeles area.\nSo basically 90% of our stores are open at this point.\nThey're not all operating in a 100% level, but this is the highest rate of openings that we have seen since the pandemic started.\nSo with the exception of just California, at this point of 280 stores that we have 90% of them are open.\nSo that gives you I think a good sense of what we're seeing in the restaurant and the fitness area.\nSo I'll start with everybody's favorite subject, CECL and the reserve.\nOverall the provision for credit losses for the quarter was a net credit or recovery of $1.6 million compared to a provision of $29.2 million last quarter.\nThat $1.6 million consisted of a $1.2 million provision related to funded loans and a recovery of $2.9 million related to unfunded commitments.\nThe reserve, the ACL declined from 1.15% to 1.08% of loans this quarter primarily because of charge-off, which is exactly what we would expect to happen under CECL, less charge-offs are taken the reserve would come down.\nSlide 9 through 11 of the supplemental deck provides some details on changes in the reserve and the composition of the provision and the allowance.\nCharge-offs totaled $18.8 million for the quarter, which reduced the reserve.\n$13.8 million of this related to the writedown to market of some loans that we sold during the quarter or that were moved to held for sale right at quarter end and those were sold in January.\nA $34.1 million and all of the rest of the stuff that ran through the provision, the $34.1 million decrease in the reserve and provision related to the improvement in the economic forecast.\nOffsetting that was a $32.8 million increase related to increases in some specific reserves and that risk rating migration.\nWe had an $11.4 million reduction in the amount of qualitative overlays.\nThis is exactly what we would expect.\nWe expect that qualitative overlay to come down as more facts are known about individual borrowers and more that gets captured in the quantitative modeling.\nAnd then we also had an increase of $15.2 million related to more conservative modeling assumptions that we've made around behavior of certain residential borrowers that had been on payment deferral so all of that going in opposite directions kind of netted down to that provision of basically zero for the quarter.\nThe decrease in the reserve percentage also reflects the fact that Ginnie Mae EBO mortgages are a larger component of total loans and those carry basically no reserve.\nSome of the key economic forecast assumptions and I'll remind you this is a really high level look.\nThe models are really -- processing literally hundreds if not thousands of regional and other economic data points.\nBut our forecast is for national unemployment at about 6.7% for the first quarter of '21, remaining stable through 2021 and then trending down to 5.4% by the end of 2022.\nReal GDP growth reaching 4.1% in 2021 and 4.7% by the end of 2022 and S&P 500 Index remain relatively stable around 3,500 and stabilizing Fed funds rate staying at or near zero into 2023.\nThe franchise finance portfolio continues to carry the highest reserve level at 6.6%, followed by CRE at 1.5% and C&I at 1.3%.\nThe reserve on the residential portfolio remained relatively stable quarter-over-quarter.\nReductions resulting from the improved economic forecast were offset by changes in modeling assumptions.\nAs to risk rating migration on slides 23 through 26 in the deck, we have some detail around this not surprisingly as we continue to move through the cycle and get more detailed information about borrowers.\nWe did see some additional downward migration this quarter although as Raj pointed out the pace of this has slowed considerably as we would expect and we hope to see some positive tailwinds as the economy continues to improve as we move through 2021 as we're expecting it to.\nIn terms of migration to substandard accrual, the largest categories were in CRE and that would be in the hotel, multi-family New York and retail segments and we downgraded some of the cruise line credits this quarter.\nOverall, in franchise the level of criticized and classified assets actually declined this quarter.\nBut we did see some fitness concepts move from special mention to substandard.\nNon-performing loans increased by about $44 million this quarter, the largest increases being in multi-family.\nResidential, as we had some loans come off of deferral and failed to resume a regular payment schedule and a little bit of franchise finance in the fitness segment.\nAs expected, we continue to see recovery in the fair value mark on the investment portfolio this quarter.\nThe portfolio is now in a net unrealized gain position of $85.6 million and we expect no credit losses related to any of the securities in that portfolio.\nConsistent with the guidance we provided last quarter, the NIM increased by 1 basis point this quarter to 2.33%.\nThe yield on earning assets declined by 12 basis points and this was -- there's still pressure on asset yields, but this was a much lower -- a smaller decline than we had experienced the quarter before.\nSo that's good to see.\nObviously, this is just due to run off of higher yielding older assets that were put on in a higher prevailing rate environment.\nCost of deposits declined by 14 basis points quarter-over-quarter.\nAnd as Tom pointed out, I'll remind you that almost $800 million of those time deposits are scheduled to mature and price down in Q1.\nWe did adjust our variable compensation accruals by $6.6 million as operating results in the back half of the year.\nWe're far better than we had initially expected.\nI would call that a first world problem.\nGlad to see those revenues up allowing us to do a little more for our employees in the way of variable compensation.\nA $2.2 million accrual for some roll over vacation time that we made the decision to allow our employees due to the COVID pandemic and the difficulty people have had using their vacation time.\nAnd we also had an increase in an accrual related to some RSU and PSU awards that resulted from the increase in the stock price, another first world problem.\nSo that's kind of what went on in compensation expense.\nA little bit of guidance looking forward to 2021, I will preface my remarks by saying this is maybe the most challenging environment in which I've ever had to forecast what was going to happen over the course of the coming year.\nSo all of this guidance is predicated on a lot of assumptions about the economy, interest rates, tax rates, the competitive environment, the regulatory environment and any of that could change.\nBut as of now what we see is mid-single digit loan growth more of that concentrated in the back half of the year.\nAs Raj said, we don't expect much in the first quarter.\nAnd that's excluding run-off of PPP loans by the way that mid-single digits excluding that run off of PPP loans.\nAgain mid-single digit a little bit higher than loan growth, mid-single digit deposit growth but double-digit mid-teens non-interest DDA growth as we continue to remix that portfolio and let those higher cost rate sensitive customers run off and grow non-interest DDA.\nWe expect the NIM to increase for the year and we would expect that PPP forgiveness to be largely a first quarter 2021 event so the NIM in the first quarter will get a lift from PPP forgiveness.\nI think there's about $11 million worth of unrecognized fees still remaining to flow through that will come through in the first and maybe some in the second quarter.\nThe provisions, so under CECL in theory, the provision should be related only to new loan production and charge-offs should increase -- should reduce the reserves.\nAnd if the world didn't change that's what would happen.\nWe have not attempted to forecast changes in the economic forecast but if the economic forecast doesn't change the provision for the year should be modest and it would be higher in the second half of the year as loan growth picks up and any charge-offs taken should reduce the allowance and we would expect net charge-offs to exceed the provision for the year and the reserves to come down.\nIf our prognostication about the economy is true, we would expect over time if we return to an environment similar to what we were in right before the time we adopted CECL, we would expect the reserve to return back to those levels.\nNon-interest income for next year, we do expect to see some increase in deposit service charge and commercial card revenue materialize in 2021 and for lease financing income to stabilize after some decline in the first quarter.\nExpenses, overall, in the aggregate we would expect probably a mid-single digit increase and that's going to come from two areas.\nOne is comp, part of that is just a natural normal merit increases and inflationary salary increases, which we think will resume.\nWe actually hope will resume in 2021 as the as the economy recovers.\nBut we do expect it to remain below 2019 levels.\nAnd we also expect technology-related costs to increase as we continue to invest in some important initiatives that Raj alluded to.\nTax rate, we would expect to be around 25% excluding discrete items, if there's no change in the corporate tax rate.\nThe other -- the one other thing that I will point out to you, we had about 3 million dividend equivalent rights outstanding that expire in the first quarter of 2021.\nAnd that'll add $0.02 to $0.03 per quarter to EPS.\nSo I just want to make you're aware of that.\nThere's so much information to give you these days that these calls end up taking way too much time in the first half.\nI see a line already.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Today's discussion is being broadcast on our website at atimetals.com.\nParticipating in the call today are Bob Wetherbee, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Donald Newman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nFor today's call, we will not display or advance slides as Bob and Don speak.\nTheir comments will focus on highlights and key messages.\nThe slides provide additional color and details on our results and outlook.\nThey are available on our website at atimetals.com.\nIt's an understatement to say that 2020 has been a challenging year for all of us, especially those who serve the commercial aerospace market.\nDespite these headwinds, the relentless ATI team continues to rise to the challenge, guided by the leadership priorities we established at the outset of the pandemic.\nFirst, how we're taking control of what we can control, thus accelerating cost savings and strengthening our position.\nSecond, our strong balance sheet puts us in an excellent position to weather storms ahead as well as to fuel our growth.\nSo first, where we are today.\nOur customer connectivity continues to give us the insights to assess market dynamics in the moment.\nFrom this, we gain conviction to make critical decisions, aligning our cost structures and inventory levels with changing demand expectations.\nWe've acted thoughtfully and with urgency to reshape ATI for 2021 and beyond.\nAs a result of these proactive efforts, our third quarter financial results significantly exceeded our previous guidance.\nWe accelerated benefits from our cost savings initiatives through aggressive implementation.\nThis included capacity up, gold dark and quiet facility islands reduced our fixed costs, minimized variable costs with execution on our restructuring programs, eliminated costs to align with demand declines, reduced overhead.\nWe've intensely reviewed every administrative and nonproduction related expense continuing only what was critical.\nOverall, we've significantly variabilized our cost structure.\nCosts historically viewed as fixed are now turned on and off in sync with demand, which gives us tremendous control over our costs.\nThis will be a lasting impact of the actions we've taken during the crisis.\nThrough it off, our people have been extraordinary.\nFirst and foremost, they're keeping each other safe, while efficiently and consistently delivering critical materials and components to our customers.\nThe frequent production adjustments we made in response to demand shifts and end market forecasts have not been easy for them.\nGrowing levels and shift schedules have fluctuated as a result.\nI sincerely appreciate the entire team's effort and dedication and personal economic sacrifices.\nTheir continued actions demonstrate a shared commitment to ATI's future success.\nThe deliberate actions we've taken and will continue to take are crucial to our ability to emerge a stronger company as the economy recovers.\nLooking ahead, we're confident demand will eventually recover.\nWe expect these difficult times to continue for several quarters to come, but we do believe we're reaching the bottom with some signs of upcoming stability.\nSecondly, let's talk about our balance sheet and the solid position it puts us in.\nWe've worked diligently to ensure ample liquidity levels and a manageable debt maturity schedule.\nOur strong balance sheet gives us confidence to manage through the COVID crisis and fuel our future growth.\nWe're fueling growth in three ways: first, based on customer commitments, we're investing capital to enable strategic share gains and new business awards that we'll start to see in 2021.\nNext, organically expanding our presence in adjacent high-value markets, where our material science expertise is valued.\nAnd finally, when the time and economics are right, we'll pursue acquisitions to rapidly build out scale, expand capabilities and capture profitable core market opportunities.\nAs we accomplish our growth goals, we'll intensify our presence in aerospace and defense, materials and components.\nWe'll continue leveraging our material science capabilities and advanced process technologies to generate aerospace like margins in adjacent markets along the way.\nLooking forward, we're confident that the demand for commercial aerospace products will recover.\nWe see it as growth deferred, not lost.\nNo matter what form you believe the coming economic recovery will take, it could be a leak, could be a U, it could be L-shaped.\nWhen you're at the bottom, it's difficult to predict when you'll reach the other side.\nBut we know we'll get there.\nWe're positioning ATI to emerge stronger, leaner and more efficient, no matter how the recovery comes.\nThere are some examples of how I believe we're doing just that.\nWe're expanding our presence in growth markets like defense.\nWe have solid positions in adjacent markets that are likely to recover faster than commercial aerospace and can generate aerospace-like profitability.\nLastly, our efforts to lower costs and streamline our manufacturing footprint while deploying growth capital will pay dividends for the long term.\nBroadly speaking, and not surprisingly, our Q3 sales across most markets were negatively impacted by the ongoing pandemic and resulting economic downturn.\nDefense remains a notable positive exception.\nA little more color on our view of what we expect going forward.\nLet's start with commercial aerospace.\nBoth jet engine and airframe continued to decline significantly versus the prior year.\nAggregate year-over-year sales were down 60% in the third quarter, driven by factors we're all familiar with: quarantines, travel restrictions and low 737 MAX production.\nAggressive jet engine customer inventory destocking in the near term will better align future production levels with demand.\nFourth quarter jet engine product sales will remain relatively weak as quarantines began to slowly recover.\nSpecialty materials will likely lag for an additional couple of quarters.\nAPI sales into airframe applications will remain subdued for the balance of 2020 and likely throughout 2021 as the impact of announced future wide-body production rate reductions work their way through the supply chain.\nIn 2021, ATI will benefit from engine market share gains and new airframe business.\nThe positive impact from these wins will increase over time as aerospace industry volumes recover.\nOur second core market, defense, remains a source of strength.\nExcluding titanium armor, ATI's diversified defense sales were up more than 20% year-over-year, led by naval nuclear and military aerospace growth.\nTitanium armor plate sales were down significantly due to timing for both a domestic and an international program.\nWe're investing resources to accelerate growth in the defense market, leveraging our material science capabilities and advanced process technologies to develop and produce materials and components to both power and protect.\nNear term, we expect continued growth in the fourth quarter and into 2021.\nNext, let's talk about my thoughts on three important adjacent end markets.\nThird quarter sales were down significantly in the energy and medical markets and up in electronics.\nWhen it comes to energy's oil and gas submarket, we saw a lack of end-customer demand and a resulting inventory glut, reducing exploration and downstream processing activities worldwide.\nWe expect this market to remain weak in the fourth quarter.\nA bright spot within energy is the specialty energy submarket, including solution control, nuclear and renewables.\nThese sales grew year-over-year.\nAnd we expect the specialty energy market to continue to outperform the larger hydrocarbon-based markets in the fourth quarter, mainly driven by large international pollution control projects.\nOur medical market is principally comprised of biomedical implants and MRI materials.\nSales versus prior year were lower to customers in both categories, mainly due to the challenges presented by COVID.\nPatients postponed elective surgeries and hospitals limited facility access to equipment suppliers.\nLooking ahead, we believe medical sales will accelerate as patients regain confidence to reenter their medical facilities, either due to an effective COVID vaccine or disease treatment protocols.\nFinally, electronic sales moved higher year-over-year.\nThis is mainly due to ongoing consumer goods production in support of new product launches and year-end holiday sales.\nWe anticipate modest growth trends to continue in the fourth quarter.\nI'll spend the next few minutes sharing highlights in three key areas: one, our better-than-expected third quarter financial performance; two, our strong balance sheet and cash position; and three, a look at our Q4 and 2021 expectation.\nFrom a performance standpoint, the adjusted earnings per share loss of $0.38 per share in Q3 is significantly better than our previous guidance of a loss of between $0.62 and $0.72 per share.\nOur Q3 performance reflects accelerated cost reductions and an improved mix in portions of our business.\nFirst and foremost, we are managing decisively.\nWe are making the most of external demand despite market headwinds, and we're controlling what we can, our costs and capital deployment.\nConsider this, our third quarter revenue dropped by more than 40% versus prior year, including a 60% decline in our high-value commercial aerospace business.\nThe revenue drop was largely due to market factors that were not within our control.\nWhen market declines became clear earlier this year, we responded quickly, focusing on cost containment.\nBenefits of those efforts can be seen in our Q3 results.\nDespite the 40% drop in revenue, we posted a 25% year-over-year decremental margin in Q3.\nThat's a meaningful improvement from the 28% decremental margins captured in Q2, clear improvement resulting from quick action.\nOur cost actions are having meaningful impact and they're accelerating.\nAs Bob described it, we have significantly variabilized our cost structure.\nCosts once considered fixed are now variable.\nThis means we are better prepared to deal with future demand fluctuation.\nAlso keep in mind that structural cost savings will accelerate profitability in the recovery, expanding margins and increasing our cash conversion.\nLooking beyond the income statement, our efforts to preserve free cash flow are producing results as well.\nWe expect to be free cash flow positive in 2020.\nThis is made possible through capital spending discipline and our ability to convert working capital into cash.\nThey took quick actions to protect cash in the near term while maintaining our ability to grow and be recovery ready.\nWe ended the quarter with approximately $950 million of total liquidity, including $572 million of cash in the bank.\nOur debt maturity profile also adds strength to our financial position.\nOur next meaningful debt maturity does not occur until 2023, three fiscal years away.\nWe are focusing on three key levers to drive cash generation: cost structures, inventory levels and capex.\nExpect to see continued focus on these three areas in 2021 as we adapt our business to fit dynamic end market demand.\nAt the same time, we'll continue to protect our strong balance sheet.\nThese actions will enable us to manage through the down cycle and capitalize on opportunities in the coming up-cycle.\nIn terms of outlook, looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate increasing demand stabilization in commercial aerospace.\nThis starts with jet engine OEMs working to better align production and demand levels.\nAirframe OEM inventory destocking is expected to persist in the fourth quarter.\nBeyond aerospace, some industrial markets are seeing modest recovery.\nOthers, namely oil and gas, will likely remain at low levels.\nAs a result, we expect a fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share loss in the range of $0.36 to $0.44 per share, similar to our third quarter's adjusted EPS.\nMoving to our free cash flow guidance.\nOur consistent efforts to generate and preserve cash have produced tangible results.\nWe reduced managed working capital by $115 million in the third quarter in the midst of the steep economic decline.\nWe expect to further reduce inventory in Q4.\nJust as the team quickly pivoted to cost reductions, we managed our capex spending to better match demand.\nTo that end, we're again lowering our capital spending target for the full year.\nOur updated capex forecast range is $125 million to $135 million, about 60% of the original 2020 projections.\nWe are raising our full year 2020 free cash flow expectations to a range of $135 million to $150 million before pension contribution.\nWe're able to do this because of the successful achievements in working capital, capex and cost structures, a great accomplishment in the midst of a very challenging environment.\nLooking beyond the fourth quarter, we will stay diligent to preserve or even improve on the gains that we made in 2020.\nFirst, we believe that working capital represents an opportunity for further cash flow improvement.\nAt the end of the third quarter, managed working capital was approximately 50% of revenue.\nThis compares to 30% at the end of 2019.\nWe understand what it takes to get back to those 2019 levels, and we plan to make further improvements in 2021.\nNext, we'll continue to keep a close eye on our capital spending.\nWe'll balance the need to fund growth and improve manufacturing efficiency with ongoing lower demand levels.\nFinally, we will stay disciplined on costs.\nWe will carefully preserve our structural reductions and minimize additions as volumes return to the business.\nThe way we operate today is fundamentally different than how we used to work.\nWe will strive to maintain the hard-fought gains.\nYour points were right on.\nIt's been a real team effort in a very uncertain time and much appreciate the contributions of everyone who's part of ATI, our customers and our suppliers.\nOur comments today focused on what matters most to our shareholders and to us.\nThese priorities are at the core of how we lead on a daily basis.\nFirst, we're managing decisively in times of great market uncertainty.\nThat includes quickly and effectively adjusting our cost structures and inventories to match demand, and we're keeping our people safe.\nSecondly, we're preserving cash and maintaining liquidity.\nWe're preserving our ability to deploy cash accretively for our shareholders.\nWe'll be recovery ready, capitalizing on industry volume growth as well as our strategic share gains and new business awards.\nFinally, we're working with our customers, new and long standing, who value our material science capabilities and advanced process technologies.\nOur goal is to be integral to their success, helping them grow, solving even greater challenges together, in so doing, earning an ever-increasing share of their business.\nWe're taking the actions necessary to emerge from this crisis a stronger, leaner and more focused ATI.\nScott, back to you.\nOperator, we are ready for the first question.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm joined by our; Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; Vice Chairman, Chris O'Herlihy; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen.\nDuring today's call, we will discuss ITW's first quarter 2020 financial results as well as the impact of the global pandemic on our business and our strategy for managing through it.\nStating the obvious, a lot has changed relative to the environment we operated in for most of the first quarter.\nI will provide some brief commentary on our Q1 performance, and then we will transition to our pandemic strategy.\nWe talk often about the fact that our decentralized entrepreneurial culture is a key element of ITW's secret sauce.\nIt is core to who we are as a company, and it is never more valuable than during times of significant and in this case, rapid change.\nThe proactive teamwork, ingenuity and selflessness of our people and quickly adapting to rapidly changing conditions and tackling new challenges that seemingly arise daily at the moment is ITW at its finest.\nThe fact that the ITW team has responded exactly as we expected they would doesn't make it any less extraordinary.\nNow on to first quarter results, total revenue declined 9% year on year with organic revenue down 6.6%, currency at 1.5% headwind, a negative 1% impact from divestitures and 40 basis points of PLS.\nThe majority of the organic revenue decline occurred in the last two weeks of March where we saw organic revenue down more than 20%.\nBy geography, North America was down 5% and Europe was down 7%, China was down 24% for the quarter, but appears to have bottomed in February and was flat year on year in April.\nIn the face of a challenging demand environment, we continue to execute well on the elements within our control.\nDespite a 9% decline in revenues, operating margin was flat at 23.6%, five of our seven segments expanded margins in the quarter due largely to benefits from enterprise initiatives which contributed 120 basis points to operating margin at the enterprise level.\nAfter tax return on invested capital is 27% and free cash flow was $554 million with a conversion rate of 98% of net income.\nNow let's shift gears and talk about how we will manage ITW through the global pandemic.\nDespite the unusual and in some cases unprecedented challenges of the moment, we continue to execute at a high level and with our usual degree of focus and discipline across the company.\nAs a result of all the work we have done over the last seven years in executing our enterprise strategy and the progress we have made on the path to our full potential performance, ITW is today in a position of significant strength in dealing with the effects of the global pandemic.\nToday's ITW is centered on our powerful and proprietary business model and our people are better trained and more skilled at executing it than ever before in the history of our company.\nITW is 80/20 front to back methodology and the laser light focus that drives on the relative handful of critical performance, difference makers, and every one of our businesses has served the company extremely well in times of both opportunity and challenge for a long time now.\nI have no doubt that this unique ITW skill will be a significant asset to us as we work our way through the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath.\nIn addition, as I mentioned earlier, we are very fortunate to have a decentralized operating structure and an entrepreneurial culture that has been developed, nurtured, and protected over many years.\nOur people think and act like owners.\nThey are accountable and they deliver.\nThey are deeply trained in our business model, our strategy and our values and I assure you that even in an unprecedented times such as these, none of them are waiting around to be told what to do.\nIn addition, in today's ITW, we have worked hard in shaping our portfolio and driving consistent high quality execution across every business in it, both to position the company to deliver consistent upper tier long term earnings growth, when global conditions are favorable and to build in a margin cushion and level of diversification, that makes us highly resilient during most periods when they are not.\nAnd it follows from there that the robust free cash flow we generate through our strong margin profile, and the unique attributes of our business model, combined with our very, disciplined capital allocation strategy, gives us an extremely strong balance sheet and Tier 1 credit ratings.\nSo with these elements is our foundation, our strategy for managing through the pandemic and its aftermath is to focus, on the following four priorities.\nFirst, to protect the health and support the well being of our ITW colleagues, second, to continue to serve our customers with excellence, third, to maintain financial strength, liquidity and strategic optionality and fourth, to leverage ITW strengths to position the company to fully participate, in the recovery.\nChris will give you some additional color on priorities one and two.\nMichael will cover priority three and I will come back and cover priority four.\nThis is a challenging time for all of us, as the world continues to grapple with the effects of a global pandemic.\nAt this point, I'm sure that every one of us has been impacted by this situation, in ways that were unimaginable just a few months ago.\nAnd ITW as a company and the community is certainly being affected.\nHaving said that, and Scott reference, or divisional leaders think and act like owners, are able to react quickly and take the necessary actions to protect our people and serve our customers, which is a particular advantage of the company, in times of significant challenge.\nLet's move to slide six.\nThe actions were taken to protect the health and support, the well being of our colleagues.\nWe developed and deployed a number of practices to minimize exposure.\nAnd prevent the spread of COVID-19 and keep our colleagues safe.\nWe have followed CDC, WHO, and local government guidelines in doing so.\nOut ITW colleagues have redesigned production processes to ensure proper social distancing practices, adjusted shift schedules and assignments that have colleagues who have child care needs, due to school closings and implemented aggressive new water and sanitation practices, to minimize infection risk.\nWe're also providing full compensation to employees, who have been quarantined.\nIn addition, our strategic sourcing team is heavily engaged in helping our businesses, by coordinating the procurement of personal protective equipment, to ensure all our employees receive the protection they need.\nI'm pleased to say, that as a result of our containment efforts, to this point we've largely been able to restrict infections to single cases, in a minority of our locations, which is a testament to the actions our colleagues have taken to implement sound sanitation practices and social distancing and to protect one another, to the best of their abilities.\nTurning to slide seven, let's shipped to another important stakeholder group and how we continue to serve our customers with excellence.\nTo support our customers, our teams have worked diligently to keep our factories open and operating safely.\nIn areas around the world where governments have issued shelter in place orders, the vast majority of ITW businesses have been designated as critical or essential businesses.\nAnd as such, they're needed to really an open and operational.\nIn some cases, it's because our products directly impact, the COVID-19 response effort.\nFor example, our welding equipment is used to manufacture hospital beds or structural products are utilized to build temporary medical facilities, or test and measurement products test medical and laboratory equipment.\nOur Polymers & Fluids products sanitize workplaces.\nAnd our food service equipment is used to feed people in hospitals.\nIn other cases, our businesses are designated as critical, because they play a vital role in serving and supporting industries.\nThey're essential to the physical and economic health of our communities.\nAlthough, some facilities are subject to mandatory shutdowns, roughly 95% of our global manufacturing capacity is currently available to be deployed to serve our customers.\nThe same is true for our service networks, particularly in food equipment and test and measurement, which we continue to keep fully available in order to ensure that we can help keep essential businesses and healthcare facilities in operation.\nIn both cases, across all segments, we continue to maintain best-in-class performance for product and service quality and the availability.\nFinally, we're rigorously managing our supplier base to both mitigate near-term supply risk for critical raw materials and components and ensure that we are positioned to win in a wide range recovery scenarios going forward.\nWell, that's the primary objective of our enterprise strategy, an important byproduct, if you will, a lot of work done over the last seven years is that ITW is in a position of considerable financial strength to deal with highly disruptive events, such as this global pandemic.\nIn many ways, ITW was built for times like this.\nAnd through the pandemic, we will manage the company to maintain our financial strength, liquidity and strategic optionality so that we can leverage our strong financial foundation and resilient profitability profile to position the company for maximum participation in the recovery.\nITW has more than enough financial strength and resilient -- resilience to withstand this kind of shock to the system, that the global economy is under experience over the next several months.\nWe are prepared for it.\nWe'll get through it.\nAnd we'll come out the other side strongly positioned for the recovery.\nAs we sit here today, one month into the quarter, we're estimating the Q2 revenues will be down 30% to 40% on a year-over-year basis.\nObviously, there's a fair amount of uncertainty around how May and June actually play out but that is our current view.\nAs you would expect, given that most of our automotive OEM customers in North America and Western Europe have been essentially shut down since mid-March, and are only beginning to restart production in early to mid-May.\nOur automotive OEM business will be the hardest hit with revenues potentially down 60% to 70% year-over-year.\nAnd abrupt decline of this magnitude in the quarter is pretty unprecedented.\nAs difficult as it may look, if it plays out this way, we expect that ITW will still make operating profit in the $200 million to $400 million range, generate free cash flow of more than $500 million and end the Q2 with cash on hand of about $1.5 billion.\nKnowing that we have the financial strength to withstand whatever comes our way over the next few months, our number one priority becomes positioning to play offense in the recovery.\nAnd this is an area where our strong margin profile really helps us.\nWhether the pace of recovery is fast or slow, V shaped or U shaped, over the next few quarters, it doesn't really impact us that much.\nUnder very fast paced recovery, we end up down 15% for the full year, and margins are 19% to 21%.\nThey're much slower recovery, revenues are down 25%.\nYet, our margins are still a very strong 17% to 19%.\nThis is against a backdrop, where most of the companies that our divisions compete with came into the pandemic, with margins at half of ours or less.\nAs a result, a number of them may have to retrench in a major way in order to get through the epidemic, potentially creating some significant share gain opportunities for us in the recovery.\nWith our margin cushion, we are concerned with how quickly demand is going to recover in Q3 or Q4.\nWe can be fairly certain that it will be incrementally better than Q2.\nBut beyond that, it really doesn't affect us a whole lot, which allows us to think long-term and positioned for maximum participation in the recovery, making sure that we are in a strong position to fully support our customers, as their businesses begin to re accelerate, and that we are in an equally strong position to take share from competitors, who can't, is the central imperative of our pandemic response planning for every one of our divisions.\nWe will, of course, need to manage our businesses smartly across our portfolio and make some meaningful capacity and cost structure adjustments in businesses, where we expect prolonged recovery periods, or maybe even permanent demand impacts from the pandemic.\nBut as we always do, we will leave those decisions in the hands of our divisional leaders as they are in the best position to assess the pace and slope of the cut of the recovery in each of their respective businesses.\nTurning to slide 11.\nThe financial benefits of our enterprise strategy, combined with the work done to optimize our capital efficiency, capital structure and capital allocation over the years, has put ITW in a very strong position going into this crisis.\nAt quarter end, we have more than $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand.\nAt the end of Q1 and it's still the case.\nAs of today, we have essentially no short-term debt.\nAnd we have not issued any commercial paper.\nWhy you might ask?\nSimply put, because we don't need to cash.\nWe have a $2.5 billion undrawn credit facility available to us, if needed in the future bring our total liquidity to about $4 billion as we sit here today.\nOur net leverage is only 1.7 times and our next maturity is pretty small, $350 million and not until September 2021.\nHigh quality of earnings and strong free cash flow are hallmarks of ITW.\nAs you know, we consistently generate significantly more cash than we need for internal purposes.\nAnd our annual conversion rate from net income is consistently above 100%.\nWe expect that to continue to be the case, as we manage our way through the pandemic.\nAs evidenced by Tier 1 credit ratings that are the highest in our peer group, we continue to have excellent access to credit markets in the event that we needed.\nDuring this time of market volatility, it's also worth mentioning that our pension plans, have remained in great shape.\nOver the years, we have consistently funded and de risked our plans.\nAnd as we sit here today, our largest U.S. plan is funded at 104%.\nTurning to slide 12.\nSo how do we think about and adjust our capital allocation approach during the pandemic?\nFirst, with regard to the dividend.\nWe recognize the importance of ITW's dividend to our long term shareholders.\nWe have a long history, with more than 56 years of growing the dividend.\nAnd we are part of a small group of so-called dividend aristocrats, and one of about 18 companies that has increased its dividend for more than 50 years.\nAnd we view the dividend as a critical component of ITW's total shareholder return model.\nSince 2012, we have increased the annualized dividend from $1.52 per share to currently $4.28 per share, a cumulative annual growth rate of 16%.\nSimply put, we remain strongly committed to our dividend and as we sit here today, we do not see a scenario where we would have to reduce the dividend.\nIn terms of strategic optionality, we are clearly in a position of strength, with ample balance sheet capacity.\nAnd we're certainly open to the possibility that opportunities might emerge as a result of the pandemic.\nIt could be in the form of more reasonable valuation opportunities for assets that we were already interested in, as well as some unique opportunities with quality companies that may not have the financial strength to weather the pandemic.\nGiven our financial strength and ample capacity, we will be in a strong position to react to any high quality strategic opportunities that may emerge.\nWe will continue to fully fund all internal investment and capex projects that meet our criteria, like we always have, but the number will likely come down in terms of aggregate spend in the near term, simply due to the fact that we don't need any capacity expansion projects for the next several quarters.\nFinally, I think, it comes as no surprise to anyone that we have suspended share repurchases until end markets stabilize and the recovery path becomes clearer.\nAnd as a priority four, which is all about leveraging our strengths to make sure that every one of our businesses are strongly positioned to fully participate in the recovery.\nIn short, we are going to be there to serve every bit of our customers' needs as their businesses begin to reaccelerate and be well prepared to capture any share gain opportunities that may come our way.\nFood equipment had a good quarter with organic growth up 2% year-over-year despite a tough comp of 5% organic growth last year.\nThe service business was solid up 4% in the quarter.\nEquipment growth of 1% reflects double-digit growth in retail and modest decline in institutional and restaurants against tough year-over-year comps for both of those.\nOperating margin expanded 90 basis points to 27.5% with enterprise initiatives, the main contributor.\nTest and measurement in electronics had a very strong quarter with test and measurement up 6% with 13% growth in our Instron business.\nThe segment also experienced a meaningful pickup in demand from semiconductor customers.\nElectronics was up 2%.\nMargin was the highlight as the team expanded operating margins 330 basis points to a record, 28.1% the highest in the company this quarter with strong contributions from enterprise initiatives and volume leverage.\nAlso in the quarter, we divested in electronics business with 2019 revenues of approximately $60 million.\nIn the face of an unprecedented demand contraction in Q2, as Michael commented earlier, we will still generate operating income in the hundreds of million dollars and generate over $500 million in free cash flow.\nWe will manage discretionary expenses prudently, but we don't need to start cutting muscle immediately.\nAnd we certainly want to avoid doing so, before we have some level of indication as to the shape and slope of the recovery in each of our businesses.\nWith this principle in mind, to this point, we are providing full compensation and benefits support to all ITW colleagues around the world.\nAnd we're going to do our best to sustain that level of support for all of our people through at least the end of Q2.\nWe are doing it because we are in a position to support our people at a time of great personal and family stress and uncertainty.\nAnd we think that it's the right thing to do.\nBut we're also doing it to protect the significant investment we have made in training and developing great ITW people and great ITW leaders over the past seven years.\nAs Michael mentioned, it is likely that we will need to make some staffing adjustments to align with prolonged or permanently lower demand in some of our businesses as a result of the pandemic.\nSo we are committed to being there for all of our people during the worst of this, and we will take the time to make whatever longer-term adjustments need to be made thoughtfully.\nThe second principle is that we're going to lean into the upside by remaining invested in structure to capture incremental demand.\nGiven the profitability of our core businesses in the strength of our financial position, what's the bigger risk for ITW, carrying more cost and it turns out we need for a few months or cutting too much and not being able to fully serve the needs of our customers and take share from our competitors as the recovery accelerates.\nObviously, we believe short sheet and the upside potential of the recovery would be the far bigger mistake for ITW.\nAnd we're going to plan and execute our recovery strategies accordingly.\nThe third principle is that we're going to leverage the strength of ITW to protect investment in areas of strategic importance to the execution of our long-term strategy.\nWe're early in our planning around all these areas.\nBut as one example, prior to the pandemic, we invested two plus years in our strategic sales excellence initiative that included significant investments in new sales and sales leadership talent.\nWe have the financial capacity to protect these types of long-term strategic investments.\nAnd doing so is worth a lot more over the long-term to the company, there are a few extra detrimental margin points in the short-term.\nThat being said, decremental margins should likely be in our normal 35% to 40% range in Q4.\nBetween now and then, we're going to focus on making sure ITW is in a strong position to fully participate in the recovery.\nTurning to slide 14, this is just a reminder that our long-term strategic priorities remain unchanged that we are committed to achieving and sustaining ITW potential performance, and continuing on our quest to firmly establish ITW as one of the world's best performing, highest quality, and most respected industrial companies.\nNow let's move on to slide 15 to wrap things up.\nAs of right now, there's no way to know how severe this crisis will be, how long it will last, or how quickly our customers and then markets will recover.\nWhat I do know is that the strength and resilience of ITW's business model and our people put us in about a stronger position as an industrial manufacturing company can be in, to deal with that whatever will unfold over the coming weeks and months.\nI have every confidence that ITW will rise to the challenges we always have over the course of our 108-year history.\nOur strong financial position and margin profile give us the ability to make strategic moves now to position the company to fully participate across a range of recovery scenarios, and to come out the other side ready to continue on our path to ITW full potential performance.\nAs a reminder, please see the appendix in today's slide deck for the usual segment detail for the first quarter.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These beliefs are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which may be beyond our control, including those detailed in our periodic SEC filings.\nPlease note that the company's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements.\nHe will provide an update on our strategy and highlights from the last quarter.\nAnd Karen Holcom, senior vice president and chief financial officer, who will walk us through our earnings performance.\nThere will be an opportunity for Q&A at the end of the call.\nFor those participating, please limit your remarks to one question and one follow-up, if necessary.\nOur team delivered another strong performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2022.\nFor the second consecutive quarter, we delivered net sales growth of 17%, and we maintained our gross profit margin at 41.7%, consistent with the first quarter.\nAnd compared to last year, we increased diluted earnings per share by 22%.\nDespite the cost challenges, we were able to convert our sales growth into operating profit and net income by effectively leveraging operating expenses.\nThe world remains complicated.\nAlthough our demand environment is strong, costs continue to be volatile, and we are continuously dealing with the ongoing pressures resulting from the global component shortages.\nIn spite of this, our team continues to execute well, and this is reflected in our performance.\nBoth ABL and Spaces are performing admirably.\nOur decisions to prioritize shipments by investing in electrical components and transportation are resulting in higher sales and operating profits, albeit at slightly lower margins.\nNow, I want to move to talk to our progress at both ABL and Spaces.\nFirst, in ABL, I'm happy to report that some things are returning to the way they used to be.\nIn March, we hosted our first in-person sales conference in three years, NEXT '22.\nIt was great to be back together with our independent sales network, who have performed exceptionally through the ups and downs of the last two years.\nWe have the best agents in the industry, and it was a great opportunity to talk about our strategic vision for Acuity Brands Lighting, share many new products, and engage our agency partners around our EarthLIGHT initiative.\nThis was the first time that many of our associates and agents had seen each other in person since the pandemic started.\nWhile we have been incredibly productive working virtually with our channel, it was great to spend some quality time together in person.\nIt was hard not to be struck by the levels of energy and enthusiasm throughout the event and the consistency of the feedback from our agents.\nThey said, \"Acuity is delivering\".\nOur investments in service have allowed us to prioritize delivering for our customers when others have been unable to.\nAt the same time, our investments in product vitality have allowed us to continue to create compelling new products that are both innovative and market-moving.\nAs I said last quarter, we have done this by focusing on three main areas.\nFirst, by focusing on strategic supplier relationships, the current environment has reminded us all that it really matters who you do business with.\nBecause we are the largest lighting company, we have certain advantages over our direct competitors.\nBut those same components are also used by larger industries.\nConsequently, we are making investments in people, time, and resources.\nWe have recruited a new head of strategic sourcing for ABL.\nWe are working with our key suppliers on effective planning and allocation management, and we are investing in inventory.\nSecond, by empowering our teams to prioritize access and speed over cost on available components, we have been able to ensure continuity of supply across many of our existing product lines, while also supporting our ongoing product vitality efforts across our product portfolio.\nFinally, as I said last quarter, our engineering teams continue their Herculean efforts to redesign products to the available components.\nAt the same time, these teams have also managed to introduce around 220 new, or significantly upgraded, lighting and lighting control products over the last two years.\nWe expect the challenges around access to and costs of components to continue into the foreseeable future.\nOur strategy around product vitality and the dexterity of our engineering teams inflecting to the changing requirements of the component shortages have been a significant part of why we are leading in this market, and we expect to continue these efforts.\nAnother highlight of the NEXT conference was our focus on EarthLIGHT.\nEarthLIGHT is an important part of our strategy.\nOur product vitality efforts are not just about improving the functionality of our products.\nIt is also about redesigning products to reduce customer energy consumption, reducing packaging and waste, and improving transportation efficiency.\nThis quarter, we announced a new initiative that brings together both technology and sustainability to significantly reduce paper use by introducing scannable QR code instructions across our products.\nAt NEXT, we also expanded our community outreach by packing a thousand bags of food for a local Atlanta organization together with our agents.\nIt was one of the highlights of the event.\nNow, moving to the Intelligence Spaces Group, Spaces had another solid quarter of growth.\nIn both Distech and Atrius, we have a strong product roadmap to make Spaces smarter, safer, and greener.\nDistech continues to win in the building controls market against significant competition.\nThrough the ECLYPSE Controller products, Distech is at the forefront of the technology curve with a presence in key markets and recognized leadership built on open-protocol technology.\nIn the last quarter, Distech won projects across North America and Canada and saw significant project wins in key verticals, including in education, commercial infrastructure, and in data centers.\nDistech is now a key supplier to two of the largest cloud providers.\nWe also continue to develop the Atrius platform, including progress on Atrius Building Insights, and we expect to expand the portfolio over time.\nWe continue to add talent to this team.\nFinally, I want to update you on our capital allocation.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain the same.\nWe expect to continue to prioritize investments for growth in our current businesses, to invest in acquisitions, to maintain our dividend, and to allocate capital to share repurchases when there is an opportunity to create permanent value for our shareholders.\nThis quarter, the board of directors authorized additional capacity for share repurchases to increase our remaining authorization from 3 million to 5 million shares.\nSince May of 2020, we have repurchased approximately 13% of our shares outstanding.\nI would also like to announce the appointment of Sachin Sankpal, our senior vice president of growth and transformation.\nSach joins us to manage our technology organization, to deploy our better, smarter, faster company operating system, and to lead the integration efforts for future acquisitions.\nSach comes to us with distinguished experience at leading companies, including Trimble and Honeywell.\nWe're excited to have Sach on our team.\nEach quarter, we are faced with new challenges, and our team continues to deliver.\nOur continued focus on service and product vitality is allowing us to take advantage of the strong demand environment.\nI am so impressed by their flexibility and ability to drive results.\nWe delivered strong performance in the second quarter of 2022.\nWe grew net sales.\nWe managed margins effectively despite a volatile cost environment.\nAnd we leveraged our operating expenses.\nNet sales were $909 million, an increase of 17% compared to the prior year.\nThis performance was driven by our focus on service levels and product vitality, a continued recovery in the end markets of both of our business segments, and the benefits of recent price increases and acquisitions.\nGross profit was $379 million, an increase of $43 million or 13% over the prior year.\nThis improvement was driven by revenue growth and by offsetting the significant increase in input costs through price increases and product and productivity improvements.\nGross profit as a percent of sales was 41.7%, a decrease of 170 basis points from 43.4% in the prior year, but flat sequentially from the first quarter of 2022.\nI will talk more about the current cost environment later on in the call.\nReported operating profit was $102 million, an increase of $11 million or 12% over the prior year.\nReported operating profit margin was 11.3% of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, a decrease of 40 basis points over the prior year.\nAdjusted operating profit was $123 million, an increase of $14 million or 13% over the prior year.\nAdjusted operating profit margin was 13.5% of net sales, a decrease of 50 basis points against the prior year.\nAdjusted operating profit margin was lower than the prior year, as the decline in gross profit margins was partially offset by leveraging operating expenses.\nFinally, we saw continued improvement in diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2022.\nDiluted earnings per share of $2.13 increased $0.39 or 22% over the prior year.\nAnd adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.57 increased $0.45 or 21% over the prior year.\nOur share repurchase program favorably impacted adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.06.\nNow, moving on to our segments.\nDuring the quarter, our Lighting and Lighting Controls segment saw sales increase, 17% to $863 million over the prior year.\nThis was driven by the improvements within our independent sales network, which grew approximately 12%, and an increase of 5% in our direct sales network.\nAdditionally, sales in the corporate account channel increased approximately 105% over the prior year.\nRecall that last year, customers had paused their renovations due to the pandemic.\nThat activity has now restarted as you can see from the growth this quarter.\nWe also had growth in our other channel of 83% over the prior year, due primarily to the acquisition of OSRAM.\nSales in the retail channel declined approximately 2% in the current quarter.\nThis was due to some of our inventory being delayed in transit or held up in the ports, resulting in longer lead times than we anticipated.\nWe should start to see growth in this channel in the upcoming quarters.\nABL's operating profit for the second quarter of 2022 was $117 million, an increase of 14% versus the prior year, with operating margin declining 30 basis points to 13.5%.\nAdjusted operating profit of $127 million improved 13% versus the prior year, with adjusted operating profit margin declining 50 basis points to 14.7%.\nABL has demonstrated the ability to grow sales while leveraging our operating expenses.\nMoving on to the results for our Intelligent Spaces Group.\nFor the second quarter of 2022, sales in Spaces increased approximately 16% to $50 million, reflecting growth in both the Distech and Atrius.\nSpaces operating profit in the second quarter of 2022 increased approximately $400,000 to $1.2 million.\nAdjusted operating profit of $6 million increased approximately $1 million versus the prior year as a result of the strong sales growth and continued investment in the business.\nOur business model continues to be highly productive, generating $127 million of net cash flow from operating activities in the first half of fiscal 2022.\nThis was a decrease of $85 million compared to the prior year due primarily to an increased investment in working capital primarily related to inventory.\nInventory days are up over the end of our fiscal year, with approximately half of the increase due to increased lead times on source finished goods and, to a slightly lesser extent, increased purchases of electronic components.\nWe are managing our inventory levels to support our growth, as well as insulate our production facilities from inconsistent supply availability.\nWe also invested $24 million or 1.3% of net sales and capital expenditures during the first six months of fiscal 2022.\nFinally, we have continued to repurchase shares in the second quarter.\nAs a result, since May of 2020, we have bought back approximately 13% of our company shares at an average price of approximately $120 per share.\nI would now like to spend a few minutes focusing on the remainder of the year.\nAs Neil stated, we expect the current environment to continue for the foreseeable future with strong demand, while access and cost of components will remain a challenge.\nOur focus throughout will continue to be on growing sales and leveraging our operating expenses.\nIn relation to the recent instability in Europe, we have no direct sales exposure either to Russia or Ukraine.\nHowever, the conflict does add to the existing supply chain pressures.\nAdditionally, we are experiencing increases in transportation costs, driven by expected increases in oil prices.\nIn the last 15 months, we have strategically introduced six price increases in addition to driving product and productivity improvements.\nBefore I hand you over to the operator, I want to leave you with our key takeaways.\nWe have continued to demonstrate strong sales growth and effective management of gross margins in a volatile cost environment.\nWe've leveraged our operating expenses.\nAnd finally, we have continued to allocate capital

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:As the operator indicated, please limit your Q&A participation to one question.\nThis will help maximize participation during our time together.\nWe appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials and hope that you and your families continue to be safe and healthy.\nI want to begin by saying that our performance in the first quarter was a very promising start to the year.\nDemand in our markets continues to improve and our team executed well as evidenced by our financial results.\nAdjusted EBITDA, which excludes the gain on sale from our reclaimed quarry in California, was $244 million, up 22% compared to last year.\nThis strong growth was driven in part by a 3% increase in aggregate shipments.\nDespite weather impacts across Texas and parts of the Southeast in February, we experienced a pickup in shipments and March proved to be a strong month.\nResidential starts continue to accelerate and highway starts also increased due to improved lettings in the third and fourth quarters of last year.\nWe've experienced an increase in both the number of jobs and the shipping speed in the heavy nonresidential space which is also the most aggregate intensive.\nAnd finally, some of the jobs that had been postponed last year have started.\nWith year-over-year improvement across our footprint pricing was the second driver of our EBITDA growth.\nFreight-adjusted aggregates pricing increased by 2% in the quarter.\nAdjusted for mix, the increase was 1.3%.\nThis was as expected since we were shipping work that have been bid in the middle of the pandemic when there was uncertainty and a lack of demand visibility.\nAs our 2021 price increases gain traction, we will see pricing improvement throughout the year.\nThe third driver of EBITDA growth and the one most within our control was our exceptional cost performance in the quarter.\nAggregate total cost of sales per ton was 2% lower than last year's first quarter.\nAnd cash cost of sales per ton declined by 3%.\nCost control like this is an accomplishment and requires considerable discipline from our operators.\nThe team focused hard on operational execution.\nAnd as a result, all of our operating parameters in the quarries improved year-over-year.\nWe were pleased with the meaningful impact from our four strategic disciplines, which will continue to mature.\nThe most compelling metric, continues to be our strong unit margin gains across the footprint.\nAggregates, cash gross profit per ton, increased by 9%.\nThis demonstrates the attractive operational earnings power of our aggregates business, when demand is combined with strong execution on our four strategic disciplines.\nOverall, our operating results this quarter, helped drive a 90 basis point improvement in our return on invested capital.\nSuzanne will provide further comments on this and other aspects of our financial performance.\nLet's now turn to our view of the end markets and then we'll cover how, that influence our outlook for the full year.\nBroadly speaking, the demand environment improved considerably over the last few months.\nConstruction starts, as measured by Dodge, got better along with other leading indicators, like the Dodge Momentum Index and ABI.\nConstruction employment levels continue to improve as well.\nResidential construction remains the strongest end market.\nThere is pent-up demand for houses and new subdivisions are being built with more to come.\nThe market fundamentals of low interest rates and reduced supply are still in place, which foreshadows continued growth.\nHousing starts are growing faster in Vulcan-served markets.\nThe outlook for our nonresidential end markets remains limited.\nHowever, our quote activity has increased and leading indicators are improving, which suggest that a turnaround is happening.\nThe strongest nonresidential sector relates to e-commerce and technology and encompasses data centers, warehouses and distribution facilities.\nAccording to Dodge, 90% of the growth in this sector will occur in Vulcan-served markets.\nMajority of non-res starts currently fits within this category, but we believe, a strong residential market combined with an increasingly open economy will drive additional demand in other nonresidential sectors.\nWith respect to highways, state budgets and lettings are progressing as anticipated.\nWe are seeing the improvement in lettings from the second half of 2020, now turning to shipments.\nThe COVID-19 relief funds have provided a backstop for any loss transportation revenues for highways.\nOur country's leadership continues to work on an infrastructure package.\nBoth parties have proposed substantial increases in highway funding and this is a priority for both the Democrats and the Republicans.\nTo summarize, our view of end markets, demand is improving.\nWe see evidence of this both on the ground with our customers and in the data from leading indicators.\nAs a result, we've upgraded our aggregates volume guidance for 2021 to a range of 1% to 4% growth compared to 2020.\nExcluding the gain on the sale of the California property, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA of between $1.38 billion and $1.46 billion.\nAs we look forward to consider opportunities, we have three paths to growth, with higher returns.\nThose paths are organic growth, M&A and greenfields.\nI'll take each in turn.\nFirst, organic growth is a critical part of any strategy, because it offers the most attractive and compelling value proposition on a risk-adjusted basis.\nWe have the best geographic footprint in the industry and the best operators in the industry but we are not satisfied.\nOur four strategic disciplines are designed to accelerate this organic growth strategy.\nAnd the benefits are clear as we grow our unit profitability.\nSecond, we regularly review an active list of M&A targets.\nLast year the M&A market basically shut down.\nBut it's reopened this year.\nWe have a long history of making both large and small acquisitions when they are a good strategic fit.\nSince 2014, we've completed more than two dozen value-enhancing acquisitions in some of the fastest-growing markets in the country.\nAnd finally, we had a long and successful history of developing and opening new aggregate locations.\nThis allows us to pinpoint the location of aggregates reserves in growth quarters where there is no acquisition opportunity.\nAdditional benefits include more control over timing of capital investment and not paying a premium for the assets.\nWe like having a balance between organic and inorganic growth.\nIt provides a high degree of flexibility and is an important part of our capital allocation process and our ability to increase our return on invested capital.\nI'd like to start by highlighting four key areas to consider this quarter.\nOur aggregates unit profitability expansion, return on invested capital, balance sheet strength and the California land sale.\nOur aggregates gross profit per ton increased by 12% to $4.82.\nWe believe this is important because improving the operational profitability of existing locations generally comes with limited capital investment as compared to other growth engines.\nWhen the improvements are both sustainable and widespread across the footprint, significant value is created.\nOur strategic disciplines are making an impact and we have a good track record of execution.\nOver the past three years our compound annual growth rate for gross profit per ton was 7%.\nThe second key area is return on invested capital.\nAs Tom mentioned, the 90 basis point improvement in the quarter pushed our return to 14.8% for the trailing 12 months ended March 31.\nWhile a higher returns profile is always good, the way in which the improvement is achieved is also important.\nAs an example, the first quarter's ROIC gain was comprised of a 1% increase in invested capital and a 7% increase in adjusted EBITDA.\nThis further highlights the importance of the unit profitability discussed earlier.\nOver the past three years, our trailing 12 months ROIC has improved by 280 basis points, driven by a 4% compound annual growth rate in invested capital and an 11% compound annual growth rate in adjusted EBITDA.\nThe third area is the balance sheet.\nOur balance sheet strength has created significant optionality and flexibility as we consider our capital allocation priorities, our balanced approach to growth and shareholder returns.\nOur net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 1.4 times, and we have nearly $900 million of cash on the balance sheet.\nOur debt has a weighted average maturity of 15 years, with no significant maturities in the near-term.\nAnd as always, we will continue to operate the business for the long term.\nWe will not rush decisions to invest, just because extra capital is available.\nThe last of the four key areas, I wanted to highlight, was the sale of the reclaimed quarry in Southern California.\nThe sale generated $182 million of net proceeds and a pre-tax gain of $115 million.\nOne of the strengths of our aggregates-focused business are the multiple opportunities to create value, and the life cycle of this quarry demonstrates that well.\nNow so far on the call, we focused entirely on the aggregates business.\nSo let's shift briefly to non-aggregates.\nGross profit in those segments collectively was $5.6 million in the quarter or $2 million less than last year.\nThe severe weather mentioned earlier affected both asphalt volumes in Alabama, Tennessee and Texas, and concrete volumes in Virginia.\nWith respect to the cost of diesel, it really wasn't much of a factor in the quarter, because the unit price of diesel was relatively unchanged from last year's first quarter.\nFor the full year, we now anticipate that the cost of diesel fuel will be a headwind of approximately $25 million, reflecting higher prices since the start of the year.\nThe last time we spoke with you we expected that our effective tax rate for 2021 would be 21%.\nWe now expect the full year rate to be between 23% and 24%, following a 27% rate in the first quarter.\nThe higher rate in Q1 and the revised expectation for the full year resulted from Alabama's recent change in the law, which modified the methodology by which a company apportions income to the state.\nThis change had the effect of reducing our ability to fully utilize certain net operating loss carry-forwards in Alabama.\nAnd as a result, we recorded a $14 million charge in the first quarter.\nWe will continue to operate Vulcan for the long-term.\nThis means, staying focused on our strong local execution, driving unit margin expansion, maintaining a strong financial position and improving our returns.\nSummary: ",

Matt Mandino, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Kaminski, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bill Hollinger, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Thad Johnson, Senior Vice President and Treasurer.\nWe hope your holidays were enjoyable and safe for you and your families.\nWe finished 2020 strong, producing fourth quarter results that include remarkable net order growth and gross margin expansion.\nAs we continue to rotate into a high-quality mix of communities, effectively manage our costs and reduce our amortized interest, we are generating significantly higher margins, and our balanced approach to optimizing price and pace in this robust demand environment is providing further support.\nWe begin 2021 with momentum with our backlog value up over 60% year-over-year and the potential to generate as much as $6 billion in housing revenues this year as we focus on building our scale.\nWe are poised for profitable returns-focused growth, given the composition of our backlog, a strong lineup of community openings and our leaner, more efficient cost structure, all contributing to an expected double-digit operating margin this year.\nAs for the details of the quarter, we generated total revenues of $1.2 billion, and diluted earnings per share of $1.12.\nWhile our deliveries and revenues were down year-over-year, this was expected, reflecting the COVID-related disruption in our second quarter net orders and housing starts.\nHaving said this, we earn more on a per unit basis with a housing gross margin of 21%, excluding inventory related charges, up 110 basis points year-over-year.\nThe strength of our gross margin was the key factor driving improvement in your operating income per unit to over $44,000, a sequential increase of $7,000 per home.\nOur balance sheet is in excellent shape and we are clearly in a solid position [Indecipherable] expansion of our scale.\nInvesting in land acquisition and development remains our top priority for deploying the substantial operating cash flow we are generating.\nIn the fourth quarter, we increased our land investments by over 60% year-over-year to $650 million.\nWith disciplined execution, we grew our lot position by 7,000 lots since the third quarter to end the year with over 67,000 lots owned and controlled.\nOur lot position is well-diversified both across and within our regions, with our own lots representing 3.8 years of supplies and a higher level of option lots now comprising 40% of our total.\nWe own all of the lots that we need for the sizable increase in delivery volume anticipated for 2021 and owner control all of the lots we need for further delivery growth in 2022.\nIn addition to investing in our future, we continue to focus on increasing shareholder return with another substantial increase in our quarterly cash dividend implemented in the fourth quarter.\nThis is the second consecutive year we have meaningfully increased our dividend which is now six times its level from two years ago.\nOur goal with respect to expanding our scale is to increase our market position in each of our served markets.\nWhile we expect our growth to come primarily from our existing markets we're also selectively entering new markets.\nSeattle is a good illustration of our organic approach to growth.\nWe began with a small start-up operation, less than three years ago, which turned profitable by the end of year two.\nThis division is now on a path to more than double its profit this year and contribute more significantly to our overall performance.\nWe are encouraged by the success we've had in Seattle and we are extending our market strategy in the Carolinas, an area that we already know well.\nWith the improved execution in our Raleigh business over the past couple of years we have now reentered Charlotte, with a similar start-up approach.\nCharlotte is a top 10 homebuilding market and we hired an industry veteran with deep roots and an extensive network to lead this effort, which has allowed us to move quickly on three land deals.\nWe expect first deliveries in Charlotte in 2022.\nOur top priority is to expand our community count and we successfully opened 38 new communities in the fourth quarter, including 4 communities that opened ahead of schedule.\nAs of '21, we expect a low point in our ending community count to occur in the first quarter with sequential growth in each quarter thereafter, resulting in year-over-year community count expansion in our third and fourth quarters.\nLooking beyond 2021, we are well-positioned with the lots we own and control to sustain its growth sequentially throughout 2022 and we are committed to growing our community count a minimum of 10% next year; a target that we believe is realistic, given our balance sheet, cash-flow, level of profitability and the infrastructure already in place.\nOur monthly absorption pace per community accelerated to 5.6 net orders during the fourth quarter representing a year-over-year increase of 51%.\nWe achieved this higher pace, even as we increased prices in over 90% of our communities, balancing pace and price in each community to optimize our assets and returns.\nOur absorption pace has consistently ranked among the highest in the industry for many years.\nWe believe our success is driven by choice and personalization, delivered at an affordable price point, which are the cornerstones of our Built-to-Order model.\nGiven the increased focus that investors have had with respect to affordability, in the past few months, let me spend a moment sharing our thoughts on this point.\nOur long-standing approach to product positioning is to target the median household income in each submarket, and to remain flexible in adjusting our products offerings, through higher density and slightly smaller footprint to stay close to the median income levels.\nBy doing so, we believe we make homeownership attainable for the largest demand segments, the millennials and Gen Z. Our divisions are executing well on our product strategy, enabling us to generate solid margin at our targeted absorption rates with our average selling price in nearly every division, below the median new home price and in many cases, below the median resale price as well.\nThis last point is particularly resonant, as resale is our largest competitor.\nGiven these dynamics, we believe that our homes remain affordable.\nThe prices continue to rise, we are well-positioned.\nDuring the buyer pause of late 2018, and early 2019, when in fact they're both rising home prices, and rising interest rates hindered affordability, we proactively took steps to reposition our product offerings.\nWe quickly entered in smaller square footage plans from our product series as modeled.\nWe expanded the choices available to our buyers across the square footage band, and lowered the specification levels for standard features in most of our communities.\nTogether, these steps reduce the starting base price in many of our communities, thereby broadening our affordability.\nToday, we continue to offer these smaller square footage plans, with nearly 60% of our communities offering plans below 1,500 square feet.\nMoving just a little off the footage plans, above 75% of our community offer plans that are below 1,600 square feet.\nFloor plans in this 1,500 to 1,600 foot range are well suited for millennials.\nIn addition to offering more choice in the size of our floor plan, the flexibility in our Built-to-Order model, whether an extra bedroom with a full bathroom, a Home Office or a den provides options that meet the needs of today's buyers.\nWith respect to the macro environment, as I've already mentioned, housing market conditions remain robust, as the pandemic has helped to fuel demand for homeownership.\nThe existing single-family home inventory has been, and continues to decline, now sitting at just 2.3 months supply and below that level in many of our markets, particularly at our price points.\nThis limited level of resale inventory and an underproduction of new homes over the last decade, together with favorable demographic trends, especially with respect to first time buyers, should continue to drive demand for the foreseeable future.\nWe believe this last point is very favorable for us given our experience in serving first time buyers, who accounted for 61% of our delivery in the fourth quarter, an increase of eight percentage points year-over-year.\nAt the time of our last earnings call in September, our net orders were on 32% for the first three weeks of our fourth quarter.\nDemand remained strong throughout the quarter, resulting in year-over-year net order growth of 42% to nearly 4,000 homes.\nWhile we experienced some seasonality in the quarter, it was negligible as November's order activity held close to October's levels, which is atypical, illustrating the depths of demand for our homes.\nGeographically, our strength extended across our footprint with healthy year-over-year growth in each of our four regions.\nSimilar to the trends we experienced in the third quarter, the underlying buyer data for our orders in the fourth quarter remain favorable.\nMillennial buyers continue to lead our buyer cohorts, representing 57% of our net orders, increasing six percentage points year-over-year.\nIn addition, buyers continue to demonstrate a preference for Built-to-Order homes, which represented over 90% of our net orders, compared to just under, 70% in the prior-year period.\nNet order growth in the fourth quarter drove a 50% year-over-year increase in our net order value, which in turn fueled the expansion of our backlog value to $3 billion, an increase of 63% year-over year on roughly 7,800 units.\nGiven this higher backlog, we are confident in our increased revenue expectations for this year.\nWe accelerate our pace and home starts in the fourth quarter by 40% year-over-year and that's continued to do so in the first quarter, as we line our starts to net orders.\nGiven our strong net order trends throughout the fourth quarter, our backlog continues to be more heavily weighted to the early stages of construction, either un-started or a foundation with those two buckets comprising roughly 55% of our backlog, as compared to about 44%, in the year-ago quarter.\nThis will affect our backlog conversion, relative to historical first quarter levels.\nAlthough, we are expecting a sequential increase in deliveries, in our first quarter, for the first time in my KB Home career.\nAs the net orders in the first quarter of 2021, they are up 44% for the first six weeks over the comparable prior year period.\nDemand remains solid through the holidays and into the New Year.\nAs a result, we expect our note order growth to moderate by the end of the quarter from its current level.\nOn the mortgage side, our joint venture KBHS Home Loans, wrapped up another very productive year.\nThe growth in the JV's capture rate to 81% in the fourth quarter produced a 20% year-over-year increase in its income, despite the lower deliveries in the quarter, reflecting a more profitable business.\nThe JV is steadily increasing its contribution to our overall performance and for the full year, generated year-over-year income growth of over 70% to $21 million.\nIn closing, we finished 2020 strong and we are poised for a tremendous 2021, and the resumption of our growth into a larger more profitable company.\nWhile we remain very mindful that the pandemic is not over, and that it retains the potential to disrupt our business until it's brought under control, we are also confident in the strength of our position.\nWe will expand our scale with our considerable backlog, together with continued robust market conditions contributing to the potential for as much as $6 billion in revenues in 2021.\nWe have multiple factors supporting our higher gross margin this year, including the composition of our backlog, overhead leverage from a higher revenue, effective cost management and lower amortized interest, as well as margin enhancements specific to our Built-to-Order model, such as lot premium and studio revenue.\nAs a result, we're expecting our operating margin to hit double digits, thereby driving our projected return on equity to above 17% compared to roughly 12% in 2020.\nSimply put, we are in the strongest position we have been in over a decade with an experienced dedicated team, solid balance sheet, the healthy lot position, the cash flow to invest in community count growth and a business model that generates high customer satisfaction and has demonstrated appeal to homebuyers.\nWe are excited about 2021 and look forward to sharing our results as the year unfolds.\nI will now cover highlights of our financial performance for the 2020 fourth quarter as well as provide our 2021 first quarter and full year outlook.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we continued to produce sequential improvement in our key profitability and credit metrics and generated outstanding growth in our net orders, which contributed to a significant year-over-year increase in backlog value to its highest level in 15 years.\nIn the fourth quarter, our housing revenues of $1.19 billion were down 23% from a year ago, reflecting a decrease in homes delivered that was partially offset by a 5% increase in the overall average selling price of those homes.\nThe lower delivery volume was due to the negative impact, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and public health control measures had on our second quarter net orders and housing starts.\nLooking ahead to the 2021 first quarter, we expect to generate housing revenues in a range of $1.14 billion to $1.22 billion.\nFor the 2021 full year, we are forecasting housing revenues in a range of $5.5 billion to $6 billion, up $450 million at the midpoint as compared to our prior guidance.\nHaving ended our 2020 fiscal year with a backlog value of approximately $3 billion, we believe we are well-positioned to achieve this topline performance.\nIn the fourth quarter, our overall average selling price of homes delivered increased to approximately $414,000.\nFor the 2021 first quarter, we are projecting an average selling price of approximately $390,000 due to a regional mix shift of homes delivered.\nWe believe our overall average selling price for the 2021 full year will be in the range of $400,000 to $410,000.\nHomebuilding operating income for the fourth quarter totaled $115.7 million compared to $162.5 million for the year earlier quarter.\nThe current quarter included inventory related charges of $11.7 million versus $4.1 million a year ago.\nOur homebuilding operating income margin was 9.7% down 80 basis points from the 2019 fourth quarter.\nExcluding inventory related charges, our operating margin was 10.7% for both periods as the gross margin improvement in the current year quarter was entirely offset by an increase in our SG&A expense ratio that reflected reduced operating leverage from lower housing revenues.\nFor the 2021 first quarter, we anticipate our homebuilding operating income margin, excluding the impact of any inventory related charges will be in the range of 9% to 9.3%.\nFor the 2021 full year, we expect this metric to be in the range of 10.4% to 11%, which represents a year-over-year improvement of 230 basis points at the midpoint.\nOur 2020 fourth quarter housing gross profit margin improved 40 basis points to 20%.\nExcluding inventory related charges, our gross margin for the quarter increased by 110 basis points to 21% from 19.9% for the prior year quarter.\nThis improvement primarily reflected the impact of higher selling prices, shifts in the geographic and community mix of homes delivered and lower amortization of previously capitalized interest.\nAssuming no inventory related charges, we are forecasting a housing gross profit margin for the 2021 first quarter in a range of 20% to 20.3%, up more than 200 basis points as compared to the prior year period.\nWe expect our 2021 full year gross margin, excluding inventory related charges to be in the range of 20.5% to 21.1% with margins of 20% or above in each quarter.\nOur selling, general and administrative expense ratio of 10.3% for the fourth quarter was up 120 basis points from a year ago, mainly due to the unfavorable impact of decreased operating leverage from lower housing revenues, partly offset by the effects of our ongoing focus on reducing overhead costs.\nWe are forecasting our 2021 first quarter SG&A expense ratio to be in the range of 10.8% to 11.2% as we continue to prioritize containing overhead costs and expect to realize favorable leverage impacts from an anticipated year-over-year increase in housing revenues.\nWe expect that our 2021 full year SG&A expense ratio will be approximately 9.9% to 10.3%.\nOur income tax expense of $20 million for the fourth quarter, which was favorably impacted by $8.6 million of federal energy tax credits represented an effective tax rate of approximately 16%.\nWe currently expect our effective tax rate for both the 2021 first quarter and full year to be approximately 24%.\nIn December, federal legislation was enacted which, among other things, extended the availability of energy tax credits for building energy efficient homes through December 31, 2021.\nWith our industry leadership and sustainable home building and energy efficiency, the extension of the tax credits will favorably impact of 2021 effective tax rate and is reflected in our first quarter and full year estimates.\nOverall, we reported net income of $106.1 million or $1.12 per diluted share for the fourth quarter compared to $123.2 million or $1.31 per diluted share for the prior year period.\nFor the 2020 full year, our net income of $296.2 million or $3.13 per diluted share rose 10% compared to 2019.\nTurning now to community count, our fourth quarter average was 234 -- of 234 was down, 8%, from 253 in the corresponding 2019 quarter, primarily due to accelerated close-outs in the second half of the year, driven by strong net order activity in both the third and fourth quarters.\nWe ended the year with 236 communities, down 6% from a year ago with approximately half of this decline, due to a reduction in the number of communities that were previously classified as land held for future development.\nWe expect our community count to decrease sequentially in the first quarter to what we believe will be the low point for 2021 as close-outs resulting from expected continued strong net orders outpace openings for the period.\nOn a year-over-year basis, we anticipate our 2021 first quarter average community count will be down by a low double-digit percentage.\nWe expect a quarter end community count to increase sequentially starting in the second quarter and continuing through the remainder of the year.\nWe anticipate ending the year with a mid to high single-digit percentage increase in our community count, supporting additional topline growth in 2022.\nAs Jeff mentioned, our goal is to drive an increase in community count of at least 10% in 2022 to support further market share gains and growth in housing revenues.\nDuring the fourth quarter, to drive future community openings, we invested $651 million in land and land development with $376 million or 58% of the total representing land acquisitions.\nIn 2020, we invested nearly $1.7 billion in land acquisition development and generated $311 million of net operating cash flow.\nAt year-end, total liquidity was approximately $1.5 billion including $788 million of available capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\nOur debt-to-capital ratio was 39.6% at year end and we expect further improvement in 2021 given our anticipated earnings growth.\nWe expect to generate significant cash flow in the current year to fund levels of land investment sufficient to support our targeted 2021 and 2022 growth in community count and housing revenues.\nOur year-end stockholders' equity was $2.67 billion as compared to $2.38 billion at the end of the prior year, and our book value per share increased by nearly 10% to $29.09.\nGiven our current community profile and backlog, along with expected continued strength in the housing market, we are very confident in our ability to significantly improve our profitability, credit and return metrics in 2021.\nDuring the year, we plan to further execute on the principles of our returns-focused growth strategy, with an emphasis on significantly increasing our returns by expanding our community count and top line, while continuing to improve our operating margin.\nIn summary, using the midpoints of our guidance ranges, we expect a 39% year-over-year increase in housing revenues and significant expansion of our operating margin to 10.7%, driven by improvements in both gross margin and our SG&A expense ratio.\nThese anticipated scale and margin improvements, should drive our return on equity to above 17%, up over 500 basis points year-over-year.\nThese expected results reflect our view that our continued emphasis on a returns focused growth strategy will enable us to further enhance long-term stockholder value.\nDevin, please open the lines.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC.\nAlso on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nA reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website.\nToday, I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy.\nGreg Hill then will discuss our operations and John Riley will cover our financial results.\nWith COP26 beginning this Sunday, it is appropriate to address the energy transition.\nClimate change is the greatest scientific undertaking of the 21st century.\nThe world has two challenges to grow our global energy supply by about 20% in the next 20 years and to reach net zero emissions by 2050.\nThe International Energy Agency published its latest World Energy Outlook earlier this month, which provides four scenarios to shed light on these challenges.\nIt is important to remember that these are scenarios not forecast to help guide policymakers and business leaders in their decision making.\nIn all four scenarios, oil and gas will still be needed in the decades to come.\nSignificantly more investment will be required to meet the world's growing energy needs, much more in renewables and much more in oil and gas.\nOur reasonable estimate for global oil and gas investment from these IEA scenarios is at least $400 billion each year over the next 10 years.\nLast year, that number was $300 billion.\nThis year's estimate is $340 billion.\nTo ensure a successful an orderly energy transition, we need to have climate literacy, energy literacy and economic literacy.\nOur strategy is to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and sustain cash flow growth.\nWhile delivering industry-leading environmental social and governance, performance and disclosure by investing only in high-return, low cost opportunities, we have built a differentiated and focused portfolio that is balanced between short cycle and long cycle assets.\nOur cash engines are the Bakken, the Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia, where we have competitively advantaged assets and operating capabilities.\nGuyana is our growth engine and is on track to become a significant cash engine in the coming years, as multiple phases of low-cost oil developments come online.\nAlso, by adding a third rig in the Bakken in September and completing the turnaround and expansion of the Tioga Gas Plant, the Bakken is expected to generate significant free cash flow in the years ahead.\nBy successfully executing our strategy, our company is positioned to deliver strong and durable cash flow growth through the end of the decade.\nBased upon the most recent sell side consensus estimates, our cash flow is estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 42% between 2020 and 2023, which is 50% above our peers and puts us in the top 5% of the S&P 500.\nAs our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we will first prioritize debt reduction and then cash returns to shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases.\nWe have continued to maintain financial strength as well as managing for risk.\nAs of September the 30th, we had $2.4 billion of cash on the balance sheet.\nIn July, we prepaid half of our $1 billion term loan maturing in March 2023 and we plan to repay the remaining $500 million in 2022.\nThis debt reduction combined with the start up of lease of Phase 2 early next year, is expected to drive our debt to EBITDAX ratio under 2% and also enable us to consider increasing cash returns to shareholders.\nIn August, we completed the sale of our interest in Denmark for total consideration of $150 million effective January 1, 2021, and received $375 million in proceeds from Hess Midstream's buyback of Class B units from its sponsors Hess Corporation and Global Infrastructure Partners.\nEarlier this month, our company also received net proceeds of $108 million from the public offering of Hess-owned Class A shares of Hess Midstream.\nThe Denmark sale and these Midstream monetizations brought material value forward and further strengthened our cash and liquidity position.\nKey to our long-term strategy is Guyana, one of the industry's best investments.\nOn the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, we announced the 19th and 20th of significant discoveries during the third quarter at Whiptail and Pinktail.\nAnd on October 7th, we announced the 21st significant discovery on the block at Cataback.\nThese discoveries will underpin our Q, our future low cost oil development.\nWe see the potential for at least six FPSOs on the Stabroek Block producing more than $1 million gross barrels of oil per day in 2027, and up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources on the block.\nOn October 7th, we increased the gross discovered recoverable resource estimate for the block to approximately 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent, up from the previous estimate of more than 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent.\nAnd we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining.\nIn terms of our current Guyana developments, gross production from the lease of Phase 1 complex average 124,000 barrels of oil per day in the third quarter.\nThe lease of Phase 2 development is on track for start-up in early 2022 with a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day and the leasing Unity FPSO arrived in Guyana on Monday.\nOur third development on the Stabroek Block at the Payara field is on track to achieve first oil in 2024 also with a gross capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day.\nOur three-sanctioned oil developments have a breakeven Brent oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel.\nThe plan of development for our fourth development on the block at Yellowtail was recently submitted to the Government of Guyana for approval.\nPending government approvals, the project is envisioned to have a gross capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day with first oil in 2025.\nWe are proud to be recognized as an industry leader in our environmental, social and governance performance and disclosure.\nEarlier this month, our company received a AAA rating in the MSCI ESG ratings for 2021 after earning A ratings for the previous 10 consecutive years.\nThe AAA rating digit makes Hess as a leader in managing industry specific ESG risks relative to peers and reflects our strong management practices to reduce carbon emissions as well as our top quartile performance in areas such as biodiversity and land use, reduction of air and water emissions and waste, and making a positive impact on the communities where we operate.\nIn summary, we remain focused on executing our strategy and achieving strong operational and ESG performance.\nOur company is uniquely positioned to deliver cash flow growth over the next decade.\nThat is not only industry leading, but which we believe will rank among the best in the S&P 500.\nAfter our term loan is paid off and our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we will prioritize return of capital to our shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases.\nIn the third quarter, we continued to deliver strong operational performance, meeting our production targets despite extended hurricane-related downtime in the Gulf of Mexico and safely executing a major turnaround at our Tioga Gas Plant in North Dakota.\nCompanywide net production averaged 265,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya in line with our guidance.\nIn the fourth quarter and for the full year 2021, we expect companywide net production to average approximately 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya.\nTurning to the Bakken, third quarter net production averaged 148,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.\nThis was above our guidance of approximately 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and primarily reflected strong execution of the Tioga Gas Plant turnaround and expansion, no small task in a COVID environment that required strict adherence to extensive safety protocols to keep more than 650 workers safe.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect Bakken net production to average between 155,000 and 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.\nFor the full year 2021, we forecast our Bakken net production to average approximately 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared to our previous guidance range of 155,000 to 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.\nThis guidance reflects an increase in NGL prices, which reduces volumes under our percentage of proceeds contracts, but significantly increases this year's earnings and cash flow.\nIn the third quarter, we drilled 18 wells and brought 19 new wells online.\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect to drill approximately 19 wells and to bring approximately 18 new wells online.\nAnd for the full year 2021, we continue to expect to drill approximately 65 wells and to bring approximately 50 new wells online.\nIn terms of drilling and completion costs, although we have experienced some cost inflation, we are maintaining our full year average forecast of $5.8 million per well in 2021.\nSince February, we've been operating two rigs.\nBut given the improvement in oil prices and our robust inventory of high return drilling locations, we added a third rig in September.\nMoving to a three-year three rig program will allow us to grow cash flow and production better optimize our in basin infrastructure and drive further reductions in our unit cash costs.\nNow moving to the offshore.\nIn the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, third quarter net production averaged 32,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared to our guidance range of 35,000 to 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.\nOur results reflected an extended period of recovery following Hurricane Ida, which caused power outages at transportation and processing facilities downstream of our platforms.\nProduction was restored at all of our facilities by the end of September.\nIn the fourth quarter, we forecast Gulf of Mexico net production to average between 40,000 and 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.\nFor the full year 2021, our forecast for Gulf of Mexico net production remains approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.\nIn Southeast Asia, net production in the third quarter was 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in line with our guidance of 50, 000 to 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting the impact of planned maintenance shutdowns and lower nominations due to COVID.\nFourth quarter net production is forecast to average approximately 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and our full year 2021 net production forecast remains at approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.\nNow turning to Guyana.\nIn the third quarter, gross production from Liza Phase 1 averaged 124,000 barrels of oil per day or 32,000 barrels of oil per day net to Hess.\nReplacement of the flash gas compression system on the Liza Destiny with a modified design is planned for the fourth quarter and production optimization work is now planned to take place in the first quarter of 2022.\nThese two projects are expected to result in higher production capacity and reliability.\nNet production from Liza Phase 1 is forecast to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2021.\nLiza Phase 2 development will utilize the 220,000 barrels of oil per day Unity FPSO, which arrived in Guyana Monday evening.\nNext steps will be more in line installation and umbilical and riser hook up.\nFirst oil remains on track for first quarter 2022.\nTurning to our third development at Payara, the Prosperity FPSO hull entered the Keppel yard in Singapore on August 1st.\nTopside fabrication of dynamic and development drilling are underway.\nThe overall project is approximately 60% complete.\nThe Prosperity will have a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day, and is on track to achieve first oil in 2024.\nAs for our fourth development at Yellowtail earlier this month, the joint venture submitted a plan of development to the Government of Guyana, pending government approvals and project sanctioning.\nThe Yellowtail project will utilize an FPSO with a gross capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day.\nFirst oil is targeted for 2025.\nAs John mentioned, we announced three discoveries since July.\nIn July, we announced that the Whiptail 1 and 2 wells encountered 246 feet and 167 feet of high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoirs respectively.\nThis discovery is located approximately four miles southeast of well 1 and 3 miles west of the Yellowtail.\nIn September, we announced that the Pinktail 1 well located approximately 22 miles southeast of Liza 1 encountered 220 feet of high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoirs.\nAnd finally earlier this month, we announced a discovery of Cataback located approximately 4 miles east of Turbot 1.\nThe well encountered 203 feet of high quality hydrocarbon bearing reservoirs, of which approximately 102 feet was oil bearing.\nThese discoveries further underpin future developments and contributed to the increase of estimated gross discovered recoverable resources on the Stabroek Block to approximately 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent.\nExploration and appraisal activities in the fourth quarter will include drilling [Indecipherable] exploration well located approximately 11 miles northwest of Liza 1.\nThis well as a significant step out tests that will target deeper Campanian and Santonian aged reservoirs.\nAppraisal activities in the fourth quarter will include drill-stem tests at Longtail 2 and Whiptail 2 as well as drilling the Tripletail 2 well.\nIn closing, we have once again demonstrated strong execution and delivery and are well positioned to deliver significant value to our shareholders.\nIn my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2021.\nWe had net income of $115 million in the third quarter of 2021, compared with a net loss of $73 million in the second quarter of 2021.\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, we had net income of $86 million in the third quarter of 2021, compared to net income of $74 million in the second quarter of 2021.\nThird quarter earnings include an after-tax gain of $29 million from the sale of our interest in Denmark.\nOn an adjusted basis, E&P had net income of $149 million in the third quarter of 2021, compared to net income of $122 million in the previous quarter.\nThe changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the third quarter and second quarter of 2021 were as follows.\nHigher realized crude oil NGL and natural gas selling prices increased earnings by $110 million.\nLower sales volumes reduced earnings by $147 million.\nLower DD&A expense increased earnings by $37 million.\nLower cash costs increased earnings by $14 million.\nLower exploration expenses increased earnings by $10 million.\nAll other items increased earnings by $3 million.\nFor an overall increase in third quarter earnings of $27 million.\nSales volumes in the third quarter were lower than the second quarter, primarily due to hurricane-related downtime in the Gulf of Mexico, planned maintenance downtime and lower nominations in Malaysia and lower sales in the Bakken, resulting from the planned Tioga gas plant maintenance turnaround.\nIn Guyana, we sold three 1 million barrel cargoes of oil in the third quarter, up from two 1 million barrel cargoes of oil sold in the second quarter.\nFor the third quarter, our E&P sales volumes were under lifted compared with production by approximately 175,000 barrels, which had an insignificant impact on our after-tax results for the quarter.\nThe Midstream segment had net income of $61 million in the third quarter of 2021, compared with $76 million in the prior quarter.\nThird quarter results included costs related to the Tioga Gas Plant maintenance turnaround that was safely and successfully completed.\nMidstream EBITDA before noncontrolling interest amounted to $203 million in the third quarter of 2021, compared with $229 million in the previous quarter.\nTurning to our financial position at quarter-end excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $2.41 billion and total liquidity was $6 billion, including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.1 billion.\nDuring the third quarter, we received net proceeds of $375 million from the sale of $15.6 million Hess-owned Class B units of Hess Midstream and proceeds of approximately $130 million from the sale of our interest in Denmark.\nIn July, we prepaid $500 million of our $1 billion term loan and we plan to repay the remaining $500 million in 2022.\nIn October, we received net proceeds of approximately $108 million from the public offering of 4.3 million Hess-owned Class A shares of Hess Midstream.\nOur ownership in Hess Midstream on a consolidated basis is approximately 44% compared with 46% prior to these two recent transactions.\nIn the third quarter, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $631 million, compared with $659 million in the second quarter.\nIn the third quarter, net cash provided by operating activities after changes in operating assets and liabilities was $615 million, compared with $785 million in the second quarter.\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities during the third quarter decreased.\nNet cash provided by operating activities by $16 million compared with an increase of $126 million in the second quarter.\nNow turning to guidance.\nFirst for E&P, our E&P cash costs were $12.76 per barrel of oil equivalent including Libya and $13.45 per barrel of oil equivalent excluding Libya in the third quarter of 2021.\nWe project E&P cash cost excluding Libya to be in the range of $12 to $12.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter and $11.75 to $12 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year, compared to previous full year guidance of $11 to $12 per barrel of oil equivalent.\nThe updated guidance reflects the impact of higher realized selling prices in 2021, which significantly improved cash flow, but reduced volumes received under percentage of proceeds contracts and increased production taxes in the Bakken.\nDD&A expense was $11.77 per barrel of oil equivalent including Libya and $12.38 per barrel of oil equivalent excluding Libya in the third quarter.\nDD&A expense excluding Libya is forecast to be in the range of $13 to $13.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter and the full year is expected to be in the range of $12.50 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent.\nThis results in projected total E&P unit operating costs excluding Libya to be in the range of $25 to $26 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter and $24.25 to $25 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2021.\nExploration expenses excluding dry hole costs are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $160 million for the full year, which is at the lower end of our previous full year guidance of $160 million to $170 million.\nThe Midstream tariff is projected to be approximately $295 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $1.95 billion for the full year.\nE&P income tax expense excluding Libya is expected to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million for the fourth quarter and the full year is expected to be in the range of $135 to $140 million, which is up from previous guidance of $125 million to $135 million, reflecting higher commodity prices.\nWe expect non-cash option premium amortization will be approximately $65 million for the fourth quarter.\nFor the year 2022, we have purchased WTI collars for 90,000 barrels of oil per day with the floor price of $60 per barrel and a ceiling price of $90 per barrel.\nWe have also entered into Brent collars for 60,000 barrels of oil per day with a floor price of $65 per barrel and a ceiling price of $95 per barrel.\nThe cost of this 2022 hedge program is $161 million, which will be amortized ratably over 2022.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we expect to sell two 1 million barrel cargoes of oil from Guyana.\nOur E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $650 million in the fourth quarter.\nFull year guidance remains unchanged at approximately $1.9 billion.\nFor Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be approximately $70 million for the fourth quarter and the full year is projected to be approximately $280 million, which is at the midpoint of our previous guidance of $275 million to $285 million.\nTurning to corporate, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the fourth quarter and the full year is expected to be in the range of $125 million to $130 million, which is down from our previous guidance of $130 million to $140 million.\nInterest expense is estimated to be in the range of $90 millon to $95 million for the fourth quarter and the full year is expected to be in the range of $375 million to $380 million, compared to our previous guidance of approximately $380 million.\nThis concludes my remarks.\nWe will be happy to answer any questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:With the pandemic conditions to evolve, we remain cautiously optimistic and vigilant as the vaccination efforts continue in the face of uncertainty associated with the emerging variants.\nI am proud of our response over the last year and our ability to adapt to what has been a very challenging time for everyone, and I continue to pray each day for everyone affected.\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding foreign currency impact, increased 24.2% for the quarter and 24.5% for the year.\nWhile earnings are off to a very strong start for the first half of the year, it's important to bear in mind that they are largely supported by a low benefit ratio associated with the pandemic conditions as well as a better-than-expected return on alternative investments.\nAt the same time, sales improved year-over-year for the first time during the pandemic in the second quarter in both the United States and Japan.\nAs part of our strategy, we strive to be where people want to purchase insurance.\nThat applies to both Japan and the United States.\nFace-to-face sales are still the most effective way for us to convey the financial protection only Aflac products provide.\nHowever, the pandemic has clearly demonstrated the need for virtual means.\nIn other words, non-face-to-face sales that help us reach potential customers and provide them with the protection that they need.\nWe have continued to invest in tools from a distribution in both countries and to integrate these investments into our operation.\nRecognizing the uncertain nature of recovery from the pandemic, we expect a stronger second half of the year in both countries, especially if the communities and businesses continue to open up, which would allow more face-to-face interactions.\nI'm addressing our employees in a way that is similar to how I talk to my family, keeping them informed with the medical community by bringing doctors in but also by encouraging them to get COVID-19 vaccinations as I want people to avoid being sick or even worse, becoming a casualty of the virus or variant.\nLooking at our operations in Japan, in the second quarter, Aflac Japan generated solid financial growth results as reflected in its profit margin of 26.5%.\nThis was above the outlook range provided at the 2020 Financial Analyst Briefing.\nAflac Japan also reported strong premium persistency of 94.7%.\nSales improved year-over-year, generating an increase of 38.4% for the quarter and 15.7% for the first six months.\nThese results reflect easier comps, improved pandemic conditions and a boost from the first quarter launch of our new medical product.\nWhile sales in the first half of 2021 are at approximately 65% of 2019 levels, we continue to navigate evolving pandemic conditions in Japan.\nThe states of emergency have been in the targeted areas, especially Tokyo and Okinawa.\nHowever, cases have begun increasing in Tokyo and Osaka metropolitan area, and we expect the Japanese government to make a determination soon to expand the declaration of the state of emergency to three other prefectures surrounding Tokyo and Osaka.\nBut most importantly, these states of emergencies are less restricted and limited in scope and do not represent lockdowns as experienced in other countries.\nJapan, post-resumption of proactive sales starting in April, is contributing toward a gradual improvement in Aflac's cancer insurance sales, and we continue to work to strengthen the strategic alliance to create a sustained cycle of growth for both companies.\nIn June, for example, Aflac and Japan Post Holding, Japan Post Company and Japan Post Insurance, reached agreements to further the strategic alliance in a matter consistent with Japan Post Group's five-year medium-term management plan, which was announced in May.\nWhile we do not expect this to have an immediate impact on sales recovery, it will further position our company for long-term growth as we respond to customers' needs, provide customer-centric services and create shared value of resolving societal and local community issues.\nTurning to Aflac U.S., we saw a strong profit margin of 24.4 -- 25.4% and very strong premium persistency of 80.1%.\nAs expected, we also saw sequential sales improvement and more opportunities for face-to-face activities.\nAs a result of softer sales a year earlier and more face-to-face opportunities, sales increased 64.1% for the quarter and are at a 73% of the first half of the 2019 levels.\nIn the U.S., small businesses are still in a recovery mode, which we expect to continue through 2021.\nAt the same time, larger businesses remain primarily focused on returning employees to the worksite.\nAs I stated earlier, we will focus on being able to sell and service customers, whether in-person or virtually.\nIn addition, we continue to build out the U.S. product portfolio with previously acquired businesses, Aflac Network Dental and Vision and Premier Life and Disability.\nWhile these acquisitions have a modest near-term impact on the top line, they better position Aflac for future long-term success in the U.S. Meanwhile, strong persistency, underwriting profits and investment income continue to drive strong pre-tax margins in the United States as they do in Japan.\nAs always, we place significant importance on continuing to achieve strong capital ratios in the U.S. and in Japan on behalf of our policyholders and investors.\nWe remain committed to prudent liquidity and capital management.\nWe treasure our 38-year track record of dividend growth and remain committed to extending it, supported by the strength of the capital and the cash flows.\nAt the same time, we will continue to tactically repurchase shares, focus on integrating the growth investments that we've made in our platform.\nWe are well positioned as we work toward achieving long-term growth, while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policyholders.\nBy doing so, we look to emerge from this period in a continued position of strength and leadership and look forward to sharing more about the strategic and financial priorities at our financial analyst briefing on November 16, 2021.\nSo now I turn the program over to Fred.\nI'm going to focus my comments on activities to restore our production platform and progress on growth strategies.\nBeginning with Aflac Japan, we are focused on three areas in building back to pre-pandemic levels of production: product development, online or digital assisted sales and specific sales efforts within the Japan Post platform.\nWith respect to product development, we continue to see positive reception to our revised medical product, EVER Prime.\nMedical product sales for the first half of the year are up roughly 48% over the same period in 2020 and have approached pre-pandemic levels down only 4% from the 2019 period.\nWe are gaining back market share in this highly competitive medical market.\nEarlier this year, we launched our first short-term insurance product under a newly formed subsidiary called SUDACHI.\nThe product is a small amount, substandard medical product targeting customers who do not qualify for traditional medical coverage.\nIn the second quarter, we have registered close to 600 agencies with SUDACHI and issued about 230 policies.\nWe are in the very early stages of this initiative, but over time, we anticipate adding additional short-term health and income support products.\nWe are in the process of developing a new care product aimed at supplemental elderly care coverage provided by the Government of Japan.\nWe will provide strategic context and timing around this product in the coming months, but we believe this product line will mature into a meaningful driver of future third sector sales, with an aging population and in anticipation of a continued shift in financial burden from the government to individuals.\nTurning to distribution, we have technology in place to allow agents to pivot from face-to-face to virtual sales.\nOn March 26, we launched a national advertising campaign promoting this capability.\nIn the second quarter, we have processed over 14,000 online applications as compared to nearly 8,000 in the first quarter.\nOn Japan Post, proposal activity has increased month-to-month as sales training and promotion permeates the 20,000 branches that sell our insurance.\nThrough the month of June, Aflac Japan has conducted over 35,000 training sessions with Japan Post sales agents nationwide, along with providing contact information on nearly 700,000 existing cancer policyholders to inform on the latest coverage advantages.\nActivities in the third quarter include visits with regional office managers in the JP system and post office visits to reinforce the sales process.\nTurning to the U.S., our group voluntary platform continues to respond well with sales exceeding 2019 pre-pandemic levels.\nOverall, sales recovery is focused on restoring our agent-driven small business franchise hurt by the pandemic.\nCritical areas of investment include recruiting, converting recruits to weekly producers and product development.\nIn terms of recruiting, we have refocused our efforts in the past year on broker recruiting, with new appointments exceeding pre-pandemic levels.\nAppointing small business brokers takes time to convert into production but is critical to expanding our reach and gaining traction in the dental and vision markets.\nIndividual agent recruiting remains under pressure, and we are running at 70% of weekly producers we enjoyed pre-pandemic.\nAgent recruiting is impacted by onboarding and training under COVID restrictions, tight labor markets and employment subsidy programs, all of which we expect to subside later in the year.\nOur Network Dental product is approved in 43 states and Vision in 42 states, with more states coming online later in the year.\nWe are completing national training programs and have about 50% of trained agents who have quoted on our new dental and vision product offerings.\nIt's early, however, we continue to see our volume building each month, and over 50% of our dental and vision cases include voluntary benefit sales.\nWe believe this supports our strategic intent to increase access in new accounts and deepen relationships in our existing accounts.\nAs I said last quarter, our 2021 dental and vision strategy can be summed up as a year of launch, learn and adjust.\nOur Premier Life and Disability platform continues to support their key client relationships and are building a pipeline of quoted business.\nOur service model remains exceptional.\nAnd since closing, we have not lost any notable accounts and have seen early interest among some of our larger voluntary benefit clients.\nThis awarded business would not have been possible without our recently acquired group capabilities.\nWith respect to our e-commerce initiative, Aflac Direct, we offer critical illness, accident and cancer and are now approved in 45 states, including California.\nAs a reminder, this platform is focused on reaching customers outside the traditional work site.\nLike most digital sales platforms, we enjoy higher conversion rates when a digital lead is handed to a licensed call center agent.\nCurrently, most of our leads are funneled to third-party call center platforms, and we are actively building out an Aflac licensed call center.\nOur digital platform overall is experiencing a 16% conversion rate on qualified leads and generally consistent with many digital D2C insurance platforms.\nOur consumer market strategy also includes digital distribution and product partnerships, and while early in development, are designed to expand access to protection products and increase traffic to our site.\nThrough six months in 2021, these three platforms, new platforms, have combined for 5% of sales as they are in the early building and development stages.\nWe continue to forecast a strong second half based on increased activity and expect these three growth initiatives will contribute upwards of 15% to sales in the second half of 2021.\nAflac Global Investments announced last week, an investment partnership with Denham Capital.\nAflac has made a $2 billion multiyear general account commitment to launch a new debt platform focused on investing in the senior secured debt of sustainable infrastructure projects.\nAflac will hold a 24.9% minority interest in a newly created entity Denham Sustainable Infrastructure.\nWe are also making a $100 million commitment to Denham Equity Fund, focused on sustainable infrastructure investments.\nWe are pleased to partner with Denham, a recognized and leading investment firm, in the sustainable infrastructure markets.\nUnder Eric's leadership, this transaction furthers our strategy of partnering with external managers.\nWe seek alliances with firms that maintain strong track records in specialized asset classes that play an important role in our portfolio.\nWe then leverage our capital to take a minority stake to further maximize the potential benefits.\nWhen combined with our recent Sound Point capital investment, we advance our ESG efforts by investing in sustainable infrastructure and distressed communities across the U.S. I'll now pass on to Max to discuss our financial performance in more detail.\nLet me begin my comments with a review of our Q2 performance, with a focus on our core capital and earnings drivers have developed.\nFor the second quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased 24.2% to $1.59.\nThe slightly weaker yen-dollar exchange rate did not have a significant impact on adjusted earnings per diluted share.\nThis strong performance for the quarter was largely driven by lower claims utilization due to the pandemic, especially in the U.S. In addition, variable investment income ran $112 million above our long-term return expectations.\nAdjusted book value per share, including foreign currency translation gains and losses, grew 20.5%.\nAnd the adjusted ROE, excluding foreign currency impact, was a strong 17%, which is a significant spread to our cost of capital.\nStarting with our Japan segment, total earned premium for the quarter declined 3.8%, reflecting the impact of first sector policies reaching paid-up status, while earned premium for our third sector products was down 2.3% due to recent low sales volumes.\nJapan's total benefit ratio came in at 66.9% for the quarter, down 290 basis points year-over-year.\nAnd the third sector benefit ratio was 56.5%, down 305 basis points year-over-year.\nWe experienced a slightly higher-than-normal IBNR release in our third sector block as experience continues to come in favorable relative to initial reserving.\nThis quarter, the IBNR release was primarily due to pandemic conditions, constraining utilization since second quarter of 2020 and year-to-date.\nAlthough claims activity have begun to rebound, it remains below longer-term normalized levels.\nAuto claim reporting lags require up to a year to mature the data.\nAnd now with more than a year's worth of pandemic data, our estimates are more refined, which has led to increased IBNR releases.\nPersistency was down 10 basis points, yet remained strong at 94.7%.\nOur adjusted expense ratio in Japan was 20.8%, up 80 basis points year-over-year.\nWe continue our technology-related investments to convert Aflac Japan to a paperless company, which also includes higher system maintenance expenses.\nAdditional telework expenses also added to the higher expense ratio in the quarter.\nAdjusted net investment income increased 27.4% in yen terms, primarily driven by favorable returns on our growing alternatives portfolio and lower hedge costs, partially offset by lower reinvestment yield on our fixed rate portfolio.\nThe pre-tax margin for Japan in the quarter was 26.5%, up 450 basis points year-over-year, which was a very favorable result for the quarter.\nThis quarter's strong financial results leads us to expect the full year benefit ratio for Japan to be at the lower end of the 3-year guidance range of 68.5% to 71% given at Fab.\nAnd the pre-tax margin to be at the higher end of the 20.5% to 22.5% range.\nTurning to U.S. results, net earned premium was down 3.4% due to weaker sales results.\nPersistency improved 180 basis points to 80.1%.\n63 basis points of the elevated persistency in both the second quarter of this year and the prior year can be explained by emergency orders.\nSo there was no net impact for the quarter year-over-year.\n80 basis points of improved persistency in the quarter is attributed to lower sales, as first year lapse rates are roughly twice total in-force lapse rates.\nAnother 30 basis points of improved persistency is due to conservation efforts, and the remainder largely comes from improved experience.\nOur total benefit ratio came in lower than expected at 43.5% or 80 basis points lower than Q2 2020, which, itself, was heavily impacted by the initial pandemic.\nLower claims utilization impact our estimates for incurred claims as data matures over the course of the year.\nAs our data matures, we increased our reliance on raw data, and with a year of pandemic data behind us, we reduced our IBNR to reflect the lower utilization.\nThis quarter, IBNR releases amounted to 5.6 percentage points impact on the benefit ratio, which leads to an underlying benefit ratio, excluding IBNR releases, of 49.1%.\nWe expect the benefit ratio to increase gradually throughout the remainder of the year, with the resumption of normal activity in our communities and by our policyholders.\nFor the full year, we now expect our benefit ratio to be in the range of 45% to 48% versus our original guidance of 48% to 51%.\nOur expense ratio in the U.S. was 36.9%, up 160 basis points year-over-year but with a lot of moving parts.\nWeaker sales performance negatively impacts revenue, however, the impact to our expense ratio is offset by lower DAC and commission expense.\nHigher advertising spend increased the expense ratio by 60 basis points.\nOur continued buildout of growth initiatives, group life and disability, network dental and vision and direct to consumer contributed to a 170 basis point increase to the ratio.\nThese strategic growth investments are largely offset by our efforts to lower core operating expenses as we strive toward being the low-cost producer in the voluntary benefits space.\nNet-net, despite a lot of moving parts, Q2 expenses are tracking according to plan.\nIn the quarter, we also incurred $5.5 million of integration and transition expenses not included in adjusted earnings associated with recent acquisitions.\nAdjusted net investment income in the U.S. was up 9.9%, mainly driven by favorable variable investment income in the quarter.\nProfitability in the U.S. segment was very strong with a pre-tax margin of 25.4%, with a low benefit ratio as the core driver.\nWith the first half now in the books, we are increasing our pre-tax margin expectation for the full year.\nInitial expectations were for us to be toward the low end of 16% to 19%.\nWe now expect to end up slightly above the range indicated at fab.\nIn our Corporate segment, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $76 million, as adjusted net investment income was $45 million lower than last year due to low interest rates at the short end of the yield curve and amortization of certain tax credit investments, which amounted to $30 million this quarter held at the corporate level.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, we recognized a negative impact to corporate NII, but this is offset by a lower effective tax rate for the enterprise.\nThis results in a level of reported volatility to our Corporate segment, but the economic returns on these investments are above our cost of equity capital.\nTo date, these investments are performing well and in line with expectations.\nOur capital position remains strong, and we ended the quarter with an SMR above 900% in Japan and an RBC of approximately 600% in Aflac Columbus.\nUnencumbered holding company liquidity stood at $4.4 billion, which was $2 billion above our minimum balance, excluding the $400 million proceeds from the sustainability bond that we issued in March that reinforced our ESG initiatives and believe that sustainable investments are also good long-term investments.\nLeverage, which includes our sustainability bond, remains at a comfortable 22.8%, in the middle of our leverage corridor of 20% to 25%.\nIn the quarter, we repurchased $500 million of our own stock and paid dividends of $223 million, offering good relative IRR on these capital deployments.\nWe will continue to be flexible and tactical in how we manage the balance sheet and deploy capital to drive the strong risk-adjusted ROE, with a meaningful spread to our cost of capital.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to David to begin the Q&A.\n[Operator Instructions] Andrea, we will take our first question, please.\nSummary: ",
