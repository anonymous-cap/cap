    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Total revenue was approximately $1.5 billion, representing a 7.5% decline versus last year, which exceeded our expectation and reflects continued sequential improvement.\nAs anticipated, our Aviation segment remains the primary driver behind the revenue decrease.\nOn both the GAAP and an adjusted basis, earnings grew by a 160% or more year-over-year.\nGAAP continuing earnings per share grew to a $1.10 per share or $1.01 per share on an adjusted basis.\nAdjusted EBITDA margins expanded more than 400 basis points to 8.3% compared to last year.\nAnchoring these results was elevated demand for higher margin Work Orders for virus protection as well as our EnhancedClean services which are longer term in nature.\nEffective labor management continued to be a lever for profitability.\nAs you may remember, the majority of our contracts are performance based, so any efficiencies we find in staffing as occupancy drops or schools are in a hybrid situation [Phonetic] in order to our benefit.\nThis is the advantage of having a flexible labor model.\nEarl, will discuss our segments in more detail, but overall, our industry group drivers are similar to what we saw during the balance of last year.\nNot surprisingly our Aviation and Technical Solutions segments were challenged by the pandemic due to decreased global travel and limited site access for retrofit projects and educational facilities.\nEducation as the segment though grew top and bottom line during the quarter, which shows how well our team has adapted operationally to the hybrid learning system and Business & Industry and Technology & Manufacturing are still strong outperformers.\nWe've been able to offset COVID related revenue compression with higher margin Work Orders, EnhancedClean contracts and labor management.\nWe're now almost at the one-year mark since the start of the pandemic and I've just summarized our fourth consecutive quarter of strong results.\nThis sustained performance suggests that we have reached a level of consistency in our results and stabilization across our client portfolio.\nLet me now provide some thoughts on where we believe the operating environment is headed, especially in light of our full year guidance.\nBefore I dive into what momentum to normalcy looks like in 2021, I want to underscore that normalcy does not imply less vigilance around virus protection.\nOver the past several months, there have been countless news and scientific journals reminding us that COVID-19 and its after effects will continue to linger over the foreseeable future.\nMany believe it will be a permanent fact of life with people getting regularly vaccinated similar to how we handle flu vaccinations.\nWe are so enthusiastic that vaccine rollouts are under way across the country.\nMost importantly, the vaccines will save lives, but the rollouts will also lead to momentum back to work, school, travel and attending entertainment venues.\nHowever vaccine rollouts have not been uniformed on a state by state basis nor have stayed policies on masking, public gatherings and other factors that impact infections and new cases.\nThese factors as well as the ongoing discovery of new variants highlight how societies need to respond to COVID-19 on an elevated level, will not end in the near-term.\nThis is why it's so critical for us to partner with our clients and assess their evolving needs and engage our expert advisory panel.\nIn B&I, the vaccines will spur momentum back to work, which for us means a return of more traditional janitorial work as well as the continuation of disinfecting given higher occupancy.\nCurrently, average occupancy across the country is approximately 15%.\nWe anticipate this could increase to 25% by Labor Day and grow to 50% plus through calendar year-end.\nAs clients begin to plan their returns, they are focusing on building trust in their facilities through health and safety protocols, rigor around cleaning, disinfecting and especially physical spacing will be incorporated into their plans.\nFor this reason, we do not anticipate a near-term reduction space utilization across commercial real estate, especially with Class A buildings and blue-chip clients.\nFor a sector like education, we believe the hybrid models will be in effect for at least the rest of the school year.\nSoon, if not already, institutions will start planning for the fall 2021 semester with a push for more in-person learning in the K through 12 segment and higher ed.\nHow this unfolds could vary by region.\nWe should have a better line of sight when we speak to you after Q2 earnings.\nAnd I'm sure as vaccine adoption continues to expand, there's probably no sector more poised for a robust volume recovery than Aviation.\nWe are definitely hearing about pent-up demand for personal travel and minimally a modest return of business travel.\nFor ABM, our business portfolio consists of both airlines and airports.\nAs airports were opened during the pandemic, operations in areas like terminal cleaning, transportation and shuttle service enabled us to mitigate reduced volumes on the airline side.\nAnd ultimately, this diversification helped us breakeven last year, which was a major achievement.\nOn the airline side, current travel volumes are approximately 50% of pre-COVID levels.\nAssuming vaccine rollouts gain traction, we believe we could see that grow moderately by year-end.\nAs both airlines and airports see increased traffic, the need for disinfection, virus protection and EnhancedClean will grow.\nOn an enterprise level, we conducted a Pulse Survey of approximately 200 clients last month that largely aligned to our own full year expectations.\nMost respondents are expecting their facilities to more fully reopen and their companies to be endorsing reoccupancy in varying forms by September and they plan to continue taking multiple measures to protect spaces against COVID-19 as they reopen primarily in the areas of surface and air disinfection.\nAnd even with the increase in flexible work schedules and work from home protocols, the vast majority of our clients say that they expect the total amount of space utilization to remain largely the same.\nNow, the size of our survey, it's just a subset of our client base, but it supports what we are hearing more broadly as we communicate with our customers on their future plans.\nIt also speaks to our confidence in providing full year guidance today.\nFor fiscal 2021, we are introducing full year guidance of earnings per diluted share of $2.85 to $3.10 or $3.00 to $3.25 on an adjusted basis.\nOur outlook for adjusted EBITDA margins is 6.6% to 7%, which compares to 6% last year.\nWe also expect to return to growth by the second half of this year and consistent demand for high margin Work Orders and EnhancedClean services through year-end.\nWe also anticipate retaining most of our labor arbitrage through year-end.\nOur success will not translate to complacency.\nBased on how the pandemic has changed our trajectory, we have been capitalizing on our momentum to elevate our brand and business.\nAt the end of February, we launched ABM's first national TV commercial.\nIt was a celebratory moment for the entire firm and we could not be proud of.\nIf you've not seen it on CNBC or Bloomberg TV, you can find it on our IR website today.\nAs we discussed last year, we are going to be investing in our clients, team members, and infrastructure.\nWe're focused on providing technology and data analytics capabilities to enhance client and team member experiences.\nWe are also prioritizing areas like talent development to further empower our people and create even more consequential relationships with our clients.\nWe are committed to building upon our strong culture and fostering a community of belonging where team members feel connected, valued, and inspired.\nThis reinforces our mission and vision as an organization and will have significant long-term commercial outcomes for us.\nInternal initiatives such as our culture and inclusion council are dedicated to driving meaningful social change and cultivating an inclusive environment for everyone at ABM and we are taking active steps to turn this vision into reality.\nI'm excited to share that we have entered into partnerships with organizations that are focused on building a more equitable society.\nABM has made a commitment to support the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Funds, the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, the Afterschool Alliance, and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.\nWe are partnering with these organizations in an effort to make a difference in the areas of advocacy and civil rights, basic human needs, education, and workforce development.\nWe were just starting to discuss the coronavirus and its impact on the economy.\nAt that time I reiterated how our diversified portfolio coupled with our nimble operating model or hallmarks of our long-term success over the past 110 years.\nOur results over the past 12 months has proven this beyond a doubt and with our solid liquidity and leverage, we are better positioned than ever to pursue growth and profitability that will unlock even greater shareholder value.\nThe dedication of the ABM team continues to fuel our performance quarter-after-quarter.\nWe have a culture like no other in our industry.\nI'm proud that our results have been the greatest proof point of our resilience, agility and excellence.\nToday marks my 100th day at ABM and my early impressions about the organization's drive to collaborate and execute have only grown.\nAs I continue to evaluate and assess our business needs, my main area of focus will be on helping to determine the appropriate enablers for both strategic growth and continuous improvement.\nAs I will discuss in more detail shortly, our strong results over the past several quarters coupled with our leadership position in the marketplace provides us with great opportunity to invest in our future growth potential.\nI look forward to finalizing our thoughts on areas such as our internal investment strategy and sharing with all of you over the course of the year.\nNow onto the results.\nRevenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, a decrease of 7.5% compared to last year.\nThe decrease in revenue reflects the continued impact COVID-19 has had across our business segments.\nAs a reminder, the pandemic had not yet impacted operations significantly until our second quarter last year and as such this quarter reflects the full year-over-year impact.\nPartially offsetting this revenue decline was the ongoing demand for higher margin disinfection related Work Orders and EnhancedClean services.\nWork Orders were particularly strong within our Business & Industry and Technology & Manufacturing industry groups.\nOn a GAAP basis, our income from continuing operations was $74.6 million or $1.10 per diluted share compared to $27.9 million or $0.41 last year.\nIn addition to our strong operational performance, the increase versus last year was driven by favorable development in prior year self-insurance adjustments.\nWe saw an $11.4 million benefit this year compared to $6.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.\nAdditionally, we saw our second consecutive quarter of current year positive insurance trend recording a benefit of approximately $3 million.\nOn an adjusted basis, income from continuing operations for the quarter increased to $68.3 million or $1.01 per diluted share compared to $26.2 million or $0.39 last year.\nOur GAAP and adjusted earnings growth versus last year continued to be driven by significant increases in higher margin Work Orders and EnhancedClean services.\nAs our clients have incorporated health and hygiene services such as disinfection into their operation at higher levels, we continue to experience higher margin as a result of direct labor efficiencies, as our operators proactively manage the deployment of labor commensurate with COVID-19 related revenue decline.\nAdditionally, results also reflect one less working day, which amounted to labor expense savings of approximately $6 million.\nOther items such as corporate discretionary expense, amortization, and interest were also lower compared to last year.\nThese results were partially offset by our planned infrastructure and organizational investment in areas such as IT.\nHowever, I want to note that our investment spend for the quarter was approximately $4 million, which was lower than originally anticipated.\nDuring the quarter, we generated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $124 million for a margin rate of 8.3% compared to $68.8 million or 4.3% last year.\nI will now discuss our segment results.\nAs I referenced earlier, these results reflect the ongoing impact of COVID-19, which has resulted in revenue compression across our services.\nAs Scott discussed, our diversified segment structure has been a strength for us during the pandemic and each segment has been impacted by the pandemic in different ways, both positively and negatively.\nIn most cases though with perhaps the exception of Technical Solutions, our segment results reflect some combination of a mix shift toward higher Work Orders and EnhancedClean services.\nLabor modulation on lower service demand as well as operational investments in areas such as EnhancedClean.\nB&I revenue was $809.4 million, which was down just $11.5 million or 1.4% versus last year.\nThe parking and sports and entertainment businesses were the predominant drivers of the revenue decline due to the ongoing pandemic.\nAlmost entirely offsetting this decline was increased demand for higher margin Work Orders and EnhancedClean services at our national accounts and certain client in corporate sectors such as financial institutions.\nOperating profit for the quarter reflected this more favorable mix of business resulting an $85.7 million or a margin of 10.6% compared to last year's $38.2 million and 4.7% respectively.\nTechnology & Manufacturing remains one of our most resilient segments.\nT&M produced solid results for the quarter as it has since the beginning of the pandemic.\nThe segment reported revenue of $249.2 million, an increase of 6.5% versus last year with an operating profit of $26.9 million or a margin rate of 10.8%.\nWork orders and EnhancedClean services drove demand for T&M particularly within the industrial manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and high-tech sectors.\nWe also experienced growth with our logistic clients as we supported them during the peak holiday season.\nOur Education segment grew revenues of $209.4 million with operating profit of $21.5 million or 10.2% margin.\nWe believe these results reflect some stabilization as schools have continued the hybrid learning model that has been in effect since the back half of last year.\nPerformance was primarily attributable to direct labor management due to modified staffing levels and other expense savings as well as demand for disinfection and COVID related Work Orders.\nLooking ahead, we anticipate some reinstitution of a traditional selling season in 2021, which did not really exist last year due to the pandemic.\nWe continue to monitor how schools are going to evolve their approach to teaching in the current environment particularly as vaccination rollouts progress.\nAviation reported revenue of approximately $143 million with operating profit of $3.2 million.\nAs anticipated, this segment remain most impacted by COVID-19 and its effect on global travel.\nThe quarter saw a modest sequential increase in travel due to the holiday, but also reverted quickly due to lockdowns in areas such as the UK.\nWe continue to operate according to flight and passenger demand, providing higher tech services such as electrostatic spraying as we managed variable costs and expenses on a real time basis to match demand.\nFinally, Technical Solutions reported revenue of $113 million versus $142 million last year.\nThis decline was driven by site access issues as clients such as an education continue to limit traffic into their facilities in order to protect administrative staff, teachers and students.\nHowever backlog remains healthy above $150 million and we remain focused on churning through these projects as soon as possible.\nOperating profit was $6 million or 5.3% on a margin basis.\nTurning to cash and liquidity.\nWe reported positive cash flow during the first quarter despite this traditionally being a cash flow negative period.\nThis even includes the deferral of approximately $31 million in payroll taxes from the CARES Act.\nWe generated more than $45 million in cash flow from operations and free cash flow of approximately $39 million for the quarter.\nOur strong performance enabled us to end this quarter with total debt including standby letters of credit of $851 million and a bank adjusted leverage ratio of 1.8 times.\nAdditionally, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $378 million.\nGiven the consistency of our leverage and cash position over the last several quarters, we believe we have reached a point of stability both operationally and financially.\nAs a result, we are evaluating our capital allocation priorities.\nIn addition to organic investments in our business, we are also exploring the M&A market for potential targets to drive growth and build on our current momentum.\nWhile remaining cognizant of our reentry into M&A, we will also consider share repurchases opportunistically.\nWe currently have approximately $145 million remaining in our authorized share repurchase program and we'll balance any potential activity with our M&A efforts to ensure maximum flexibility.\nDuring the quarter we paid our 219th consecutive quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per common share for a total distribution of $12.7 million to shareholders.\nNow turning to our guidance outlook.\nWe are introducing a fiscal 2021 GAAP guidance outlook range of $2.85 to $3.10 and on an adjusted basis $3.00 to $3.25 per share.\nScott shared with you some great context from an operating perspective that supports our guidance.\nSo let me now provide some additional assumptions behind our guidance.\nGiven our performance during the first quarter, we believe revenue will continue to improve sequentially with a return to growth in the back half of the year.\nAnd as growth improves and turn positive we will have to staff back up accordingly.\nTherefore there may be a partial reduction in the level of labor efficiencies we have experienced over the past year, but make no mistake, we do expect to retain a portion of these savings based on new opportunities and labor management practices we have adopted during COVID.\nAnd as it relates to higher margin Work Orders and EnhancedClean services, we do not anticipate a material slowdown in demand for the balance of the fiscal year.\nWe expect our investments to pick up throughout the remainder of the year as we support the strategic initiatives namely in our IT transformation.\nOn a year-over-year basis, we do expect an increase in corporate expenses for the year although timing may vary from quarter-to-quarter as you saw in the first quarter.\nAdditionally, as a reminder, we undertook furlough and expense reduction efforts during the third quarter of last year.\nAnd as such, expect to see year-over-year increase in expenses as we have resumed a portion of those expenditures.\nWe are still in the planning and design phase of our technology roadmap and we will update you as we finalize our plans.\nI'd also like to remind everyone that we will see an extra working day in Q2 and one less working day in Q3.\nEach working day should represent approximately $6 million of labor expense similar to Q1.\nWe continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 30% for 2021.\nThis tax rate does not include discrete tax items such as the work opportunity tax credit and the tax impact of stock-based compensation awards.\nAt the end of December, WOTC was formally extended by Congress through 2025 and current estimate suggest a $5 million or $0.07 impact on 2020.\nAnd finally, while we are not guiding to free cash flow, until we can finalize the impact of our tech transformation on capital expenditures.\nI want to express my enthusiasm for the strong start to the year.\nGiven our strong cash flow performance to-date, we believe we'll be able to achieve a range above our historical $175 million to $200 million and look forward to updating you as we finalize our longer-term plan.\nIn closing, we're excited about our performance for the quarter as well as our outlook for the year and we look forward to updating you on our continued progress next quarter.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:As we all know COVID-19 pandemic as lasted in some of the most difficult times for so many people around the globe, and we continue to pray for all those affected.\nI'd like to share my appreciation for our employees and sales force in Japan and the United States for their tireless work in helping our policyholders and communities impacted by the pandemic.\nDuring this difficult time, it's important to note, that we remain focused on doing what we do best, that is providing protection products to help consumers when they need it most.\nFinancially, backlog continues to be impacted by the pandemic, but remain strong in terms of capital and liquidity.\nIn addition, our investments are high-quality diversified and they are among the highest return on capital and lowest cost of capital in the industry.\nAmid the challenges of COVID-19, this quarter was also significantly impacted by the release of favorable US tax regulations related to the utilization of foreign tax credits.\nYou'll recall that our Japanese subsidiary is taxed as a US domestic company for US tax purposes.\nIn the quarter, we recognized a cumulative year-to-date benefit from these regulations of $202 million or $0.28 per share compared to our previous run rate.\nMax will provide additional details.\nTurning to our operations starting with Aflac Japan, the effects of COVID-19 continues noticeably impacted our results, as seen in the third quarter, with sales decreasing 32%.\nWe continue to have around 50% of the workforce working from home in Japan and in September, traffic coming into the shops remained at 70% of pre-pandemic levels.\nWhile these sales results represent sequential improvements relative to the last quarter, the effects of the reduced face-to-face activities are evident and we continue to promote virtual sales.\n2020 as also ushered in a change on the Japanese political front.\nPrime Minister, Abe, was Japan's longest serving Prime Minister and a source of political stability with nearly eight years in office.\nMr. Suga, was a core member of Abe's administration leadership team, serving as the Chief Cabinet Secretary.\nWe believe Mr. Suga's administration will carry on skilled leader skill.\nThis will continue to promote a good business environment in Japan and emphasize policies and terms of the response to the COVID-19 and economic policies.\nPrime Minister Suga is accelerating efforts to move toward -- to move forward with regulatory reforms for a post-pandemic world, promoting digital transformation.\nIn that respect, I'm pleased that flagged Japan's paperless initiatives is well under way and Fred will share more.\nTurning to Aflac US.\nThe effects of COVID-19 continued to noticeably impact our results in this segment as well, largely due to the reduced face-to-face activity, third quarter sales were down 35.7%.\nIn the US, we continue to feel the impact of temporary business closures and lack of access to the work side, especially among our career agents who have historically relied upon face-to-face meetings to engage our small business owners and their employees.\nAt the same time, the fourth quarter, typically when we see strong results and the broker driven group market, which is generally been more resilient to face-to-face to not face-to-face conditions.\nAs a result, we remain cautiously optimistic for modest sequential sales improvement for Aflac US in the fourth quarter compared to the second and third quarter, contingent upon the pace of the economic recovery.\nWe are also on track to close our acquisition of Zurich Group business benefits soon, which allows us to extend our distribution reach and appeal to brokers and large employers, while having little effect on the fourth quarter, the acquisition positions us more expanded capacity as we look forward to 2021.\nTo place Aflac in a position of strength, we know that we must balance investing in growth with an eye toward reducing expenses in the long run.\nAs such, we took an opportunity to offer a very generous voluntary separation package to eligible employees who expressed an interest.\nAs a result we have achieved an approximate 9% reduction in our US and corporate workforce with expected one-time expenses of $45 million in the fourth quarter.\nYou'll recall that the US benefit ratio was significantly affected by policyholders limited visits to the doctor.\nWith this in mind, we lost the US initiatives early in the third quarter to remind policyholders of the value of their wellness benefits attached to their products.\nThe wellness benefits pays on certain routine doctor, dentist and hospitalizations visits.\nIn addition, we made sure that it pays a benefit for COVID-19 testing.\nThe wellness initiative has been a success.\nWe are glad we emphasized this important aspect of our policies as it reinforces how we are there for the policyholder when they need us most.\nThis wellness campaign and the voluntary separation programs are a couple of near term headwinds to the profit margin.\nHowever, we expect that they will serve us well as we enter 2021.\nTo conclude our operational discussion, as I've said before, we want to be where the people want to purchase insurance.\nThat applies to both Japan and the US.\nIn the past, this is meeting face-to-face with individuals to understand their situation, propose a solution and closed the sale.\nHowever, the pandemic clearly demonstrates the need for virtual means.\nIn other words, non-face-to-face sales to reach potential customers and provide them with the protection that they need.\nTherefore we have accelerated investments to enhance the tools available to our distribution in both countries.\nAs always, we are committed to prudent liquidity and capital management.\nThis includes maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of the policyholders in both the US and Japan and a tactical approach to capital allocation.\nIt goes without saying that we treasure our record of dividend growth.\nWith the fourth quarter declaration 2020 will mark the 38th consecutive year of dividend increases.\nOur dividend track record is supported by the strength of our capital and cash flows.\nAt the same time we have remained tactical in our approach to share repurchase, buying back $400 million of our shares in the third quarter.\nWe have also focused on integrating the growth investments that we have made in our platform.\nBy doing so, we look to emerge from this period of continued position of strength and leadership.\nAs always, we are working to achieve our earnings per share objective, while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policyholders.\nWe look forward to going into greater detail on our strategic growth plans and efforts to drive efficiency at the Financial Analyst Briefing Conference Call in a few weeks.\nSo now, I'd like to turn the program over to Fred.\nI'm going to touch briefly on conditions in the third quarter, and how we're navigating the pandemic.\nI'll also provide an update on key initiatives in Japan and the US to include our approach to managing expenses.\nThere are currently approximately 97,000 COVID-19 cases and 1,730 deaths in all of Japan.\nThrough the third quarter Aflac Japan COVID-19 impact totaled 1,750 unique claimants with incurred claims totaling approximately JPY550 million in the quarter and JPY760 million year-to-date.\nIn short, we are tracking well below our stress assumptions with no measurable impact from COVID-19 claims.\nHowever, reduced sales and delaying the promotion of the new cancer rider and refreshed medical product are contributing to revenue pressure.\nThis pressure is offset somewhat by favorable persistency.\nCOVID related expenses in the quarter totaled JPY1.7 billion, which included the rollout of virtual distribution tools, employee teller working equipment and distribution support.\nIn the US, the dynamics are understandably more complex.\nCOVID-19 case levels in the US now exceed 8.5 million with deaths nearing 230,000.\nThrough the end of the third quarter, COVID-19 claimants in the US totaled 12,800 with incurred claims of approximately $23 million in the quarter and year-to-date approximately $57 million.\nWe are closely monitoring the recent surge in infections, but continue to see the rate of hospitalization, length of stay in the hospital and transition to ICU traveling below our expectations.\nWe believe this is attributed to advancements in treatment and the nature of the work site which is generally younger and healthier population of policyholders.\nAs Dan noted in his comments, we launched an initiative early in the third quarter to remain policyholders of their wellness benefits, which drove increased utilization.\nThis effort involved connecting with 2.7 million accident and hospital policyholders through a combination of email and direct mail in the month of August.\nThis impacted our benefit ratio in the period, but is designed to reinforce the value proposition of our products.\nWe have thus far seen limited impact persistency, however, we believe this is partially attributed to state executive orders requiring premium grace periods.\nThese executive orders are still in place in 13 states as of the end of the quarter.\nIn those states where the executive orders have expired, we have reduced pressure on lapse rates through proactive outreach to policyholders and employers, actively converting policyholders from payroll deduction to direct bill and notifying policyholders of the wellness benefits.\nTurning to key operating initiatives in both Japan and the US, we are balancing investments in growth, while addressing our expense structure.\nA material driver of elevated expense ratios in Japan and the US is weakness in revenue.\nThus, the need for a balanced approach.\nBeginning with Japan, we are set to promote a simplified cancer rider in the fourth quarter in launching our refreshed medical product in the first quarter of 2021.\nRolled out in late October, we have the technology in place to pivot from face-to-face to virtual sales and an entirely digital customer experience.\nWe continue with direct mail campaigns aided by data analytics that serve to enhance the close rate.\nWe expect the combination of product development, a recovery in pandemic conditions and our alliance with Japan Post to be important growth drivers as we make our way through 2021.\nWe view the pandemic as a call to action on accelerating investment in our digital roadmap and related process improvement.\nOn our second quarter call, I noted, our paperless initiative across all operations in Japan.\nThis is a three year, and roughly JPY10 billion investment with approximately JPY2 billion spent in the third quarter, along with another JPY3.6 billion estimated spend in the fourth quarter.\nWhile elevating our 2020 expenses, this effort will reduce the production and circulation of 80 million pieces of paper per year with run rate savings in the range of JPY3 billion annually.\nAs we move to the fourth quarter, we have budgeted an increase in general, administration expenses over our third quarter of approximately JPY6 billion.\nThis includes 50% of our 2020 annual advertising spend, concentrated in the quarter to raise new product awareness as well as a stepped up level of investment in the paperless initiative.\nWe are effectively accelerating investments in our digital platform into 2020 and 2021.\nTurning to the US, the build out of network, dental and vision remains on track.\nWe have successfully filed our new network products in 48 states with approvals received in 37 states.\nWe are up and running with sales in 10 states and expect to ramp this up as we move into 2021.\nOur consumer markets platform remains on track with hospital accident and cancer product filings expected to be completed in early 2021.\nWe also plan to include life insurance in 2021, recognizing that is a natural product to sell digitally empowered by the Aflac brand.\nFinally, we will soon close on our Zurich Benefits acquisition having successfully completed the required regulatory approvals, along with efforts to improve overall persistency, these are the three largest incremental drivers to earn premium growth in the coming years.\nAnticipating further pressure on near term earned premium as we move into 2021, we are addressing expenses in the US with a sense of urgency.\nWe are addressing expenses across two horizons.\nHorizon one is near term focused and includes a series of actions in 2020 designed to take out approximately $100 million of annualized run rate expenses as we enter 2021.\nThis includes both the US platform and corporate expenses.\nEarly in the fourth quarter, we completed a voluntary separation plan for eligible employees, which will result in a 9% reduction to our US workforce.\nWe expect to record a one-time separation expense of approximately $45 million in the fourth quarter and we will realize annualized run rate savings in the $45 million to $50 million range.\nHorizon two expense initiatives elevate near term expenses until such time the investment is complete.\nLegacy platforms are decommissioned and business processes are adjusted.\nThe most significant investment is in our group business in migration off an old administrative platform to a new platform.\nIn addition, we are completing a broader digital roadmap, which includes approximately $25 million of accelerated investment in 2020.\nMuch of that investment coming in the fourth quarter.\nAs I noted, we need to balance these expense initiatives with investment in growth.\nWe have adopted a buy-to-build acquisition strategy.\nWhile a tactical and prudent use of excess capital, this is not an inexpensive effort in the early years.\nThese build efforts include dental and vision, direct to consumer and Group benefits and taken together impacted our expense ratio in the third quarter by 110 basis points, and are expected to impact the fourth quarter by approximately 160 basis points.\nI'll conclude my comments with investment conditions.\nOur global investment team remains focused on asset quality, monitoring economic conditions and sourcing new investment opportunities in a low interest rate environment.\nOur firm view is that we will experience a check mark-shaped recovery, meaning a slow road to recovery with pockets of volatility along the way.\nOur actions prior to the pandemic tactically improved the risk profile of our portfolio combined with some additional derisking earlier this year has served us well with only modest losses on the sale of securities, impairments and loss reserve increases.\nThese actions have also positioned the portfolio defensively, should we see a second surge in the virus impact economic conditions.\nWe continue to watch closely our middle market loan and transitional real estate portfolios.\nWhile we have seen credit rating downgrades, our middle market loan portfolio is more resilient to consisting a first-lien loans to high quality borrowers backed by strong equity sponsors.\nIn the case of transitional real estate, our portfolio is also consisting of only first-lien positions and is diversified with strong loans to value.\nWe continue to explore ways to optimize currency hedging.\nOverall no material change, but we are further refining our approach to managing the unhedged dollars in Japan.\nThese unhedged dollars provide diversification and income benefits as well as lowering our enterprise exposure to the Yen.\nAs we look toward 2021, we will reset 2020 hedges on our floating rate portfolio and currency hedges at materially lower rates.\nWhile we do not see this impacting net investment income to any great degree, you will see line item impacts to Japan's net investment income, hedge costs and corporate investment income.\nWrapping up my comments, we are not backing off critical investments to drive long-term growth and efficiency in the face of what we believe to be temporary weakness in sales results and earned premium.\nWe will provide further detail around this when we meet for our Annual Financial Investor Conference in the coming weeks and we will talk about the details of investments and when we expect them to turn the corner to having a positive impact on growth in profits.\nI'll now pass on to Max to discuss financial performance in more detail.\nLet me begin my comments with a review of our third quarter performance with a focus on how our core capital and earnings drivers have developed.\nFor the third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 19.8% to $1.39 with no significant impact from FX in the quarter.\nAdjusted book value per share including foreign currency translation gains and losses grew 17.4% and the adjusted ROE excluding foreign currency impact was a strong 16.8%, a material spread to our cost of capital.\nThis quarter was significantly impacted by the release of favorable US tax regulations related to the utilization of foreign tax credits.\nAs a reminder, our Japanese subsidiary is taxed as a US domestic company for US tax purposes.\nIn the quarter, we recognized a cumulative year-to-date benefit from these regulations, which lowered our tax rate on adjusted earnings for the quarter to 4.1%, a benefit of $0.28 versus our previous run rate.\nOur tax rate for the quarter further benefited from tax credits in our solar and historic rehabilitation investments which lowered our tax expense by approximately $20 million more than in a normal quarter.\nIn addition, variable investment income came in $6 million above our long-term return expectations and together these two items boosted current quarter earnings per share by about $0.03.\nWhen I go-forward basis, and under the current US corporate tax regime, we would expect our go-forward tax rate on adjusted earnings to be approximately 20%.\nTurning to our Japan segment.\nTotal earned premium for the quarter declined 3.3%, reflecting mainly first sector policies pay up impacts while earned premium put a third sector product was down 1.7%.\nJapan's revenue trends should be considered in light of impact on paid-up policies.\nFor example, year-over-year, earned premium was down 3.3% in the quarter while policies in force was down -- were down a little less than 1%.\nThis disconnect masks the strength of persistency, which has been rising during the pandemic.\nIn short, expenses related to managing our inforce tend to hold steady despite the drop in reported earned premium putting pressure on our expense ratio.\nJapan's total benefit ratio came in at 71.3% for the quarter, up 130 basis points year-over-year and the third sector benefit ratio was 61.7%, up 170 basis points year-over-year.\nThe main driver for the increase was lower lapses associated with policyholders updating their coverage.\nGiven the current lower new business activity, this naturally pushes up our benefit ratio due to lower reserve releases, decreases back amortization and improves reported persistency.\nWe did experience all of this in the third quarter, manifested by our persistency improving by 80 basis points year-over-year.\nThe IBNR was also less favorable this quarter.\nWe've seen a drop in paid claims during the pandemic, more so in our medical coverages.\nOur IBNR estimate has only partially reflected this drop given there is not much data to base an adjustment on.\nWe continue to monitor experience and we'll adjust our paid data as it gets more complete.\nIn addition, for our cancer claims that are more than three years old, we extended the completion of claims which led to a smaller release in IBNR compared to 2019.\nOur expense ratio in Japan was 21.7%, up 110 basis points year-over-year.\nOur paperless initiative kicked in at a higher gear as we digitize our operations and drive efficiencies throughout the value chain to a future state with significantly reduced paper usage.\nOverall, when considering COVID related spend, promotional spend and digital and paperless initiatives, we anticipate expense ratios in Japan to remain elevated in the 22% range for the remainder of 2020.\nNet investment income declined 0.2% in yen terms, despite the higher variable investment income, as our yen denominated portfolio generated lower yields, due to lower coal income in this quarter.\nThe pre-tax margin for Japan in the quarter was 19.4% impacted by both the higher benefit ratio as well as a higher expense ratio in the quarter.\nTurning to US results.\nEarned premium was down 2.6% due to weaker sales results.\nPremium persistency improved 80 basis points to 78.8% as our efforts to retain accounts in key premium in-force show early positive results.\nAs Fred mentioned, there are still 13 states with premium grace periods in place at the end of Q3.\nSo we are monitoring these developments closely.\nOur total benefit ratio came in at 48.3%, which was 80 basis points lower than Q3 2019.\nWe have seen a normalization of claims activity across our portfolio compared to the second quarter.\nIn order to improve customer experience and persistency, we conducted an extensive policyholder communication campaign highlighting the embedded wellness benefit in our accident product and we encouraged policyholders to utilize this benefit.\nWe estimate this initiative drove incremental claims of approximately $14 million and impacted our benefit ratio in the range of 100 basis points over what we would normally expect.\nBut we believe our efforts will add value for the customer and improve their experience along with improved long-term persistency.\nOur expense ratio in the US was 37.3%, up 130 basis points year-over-year.\nThe inclusion of Argus added 80 basis points in the quarter and a decline in revenues, roughly explains the residual year-over-year impact.\nThe impact from declining revenues has become more pronounced on our ratios in this quarter relative to prior quarters.\nWe anticipate expense ratios in the US to remain elevated in the 39% range for the full year 2020, driven by near term weakness in revenue, uptick in seasonal business activity and expected inclusion of the Zurich Group Benefits acquisition.\nNet investment income in the US was down 4.4%, due to a 14 basis points contraction in portfolio yield year-over-year.\nProfitability in the US segment remains healthy at 20.5% with a low benefit ratio as the core driver.\nIn our corporate segment, amortized hedge income contributed $22 million on a pre-tax basis to the quarter's earnings with an ending notional position of $5 billion.\nOur capital position remains strong and we ended the quarter with an SMR north of 900% in Japan and an RBC of approximately 700% in Aflac Columbus.\nOur RBC is temporarily boosted by delaying statutory subsidiary dividends to Q4.\nWe still expect to end the year with an RBC in the range of 550% to 600%.\nHolding company liquidity stood at $3.8 billion, $1.8 billion above our minimum balance.\nThis is down compared to earlier in the year, but reflects our decisions to delay regular Q3 subsidiary dividends to Q4.\nOn an annual basis we expect uninterrupted dividend flows to continue from our subsidiaries.\nLeverage improved to a comfortable 22.9% due to the increase in shareholders' equity driven by the release of the tax valuation allowance of $1.4 billion.\nWhile we remain cautious in terms of monitoring the pandemic, we have comfort in the strength of our capital ratios, excess capital, statutory earnings and dividend capacity and our ability to navigate any current and future stress brought on by the pandemic or associated economic conditions.\nIn the quarter, we repurchased $400 million of our own stock and paid dividends of $192 million.\nWe will continue to be flexible and tactical in how we manage the balance sheet and deploy capital in order to drive a strong risk adjusted return on equity with a meaningful spread to our cost of capital.\nBut first let me ask you to please limit yourself to one initial question followed by related follow-up question to allow other participants an opportunity to ask a question.\nAdrian we'll now take the first question.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I appreciate you all joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal 2021 results.\nIn particular, more than two-thirds of our people are essential workers, and they have continued to come to work every day, enabling us to continue to deliver for our customers.\nI'm very proud of our entire team.\nRegarding the business, as we indicated last quarter, overall, we have seen our commercial volumes stabilize and continued strong performance out of our government business.\nWhile we remain in a difficult and uncertain environment, we are encouraged by the stabilization, as well as the positive developments regarding the vaccines, which not only will protect our people, but should also ultimately lead to more travel and a recovery in our commercial markets.\nWith that, turning to the quarter, our sales decreased 28% year-over-year from $561 million to $404 million, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 52% from $0.64 per share to $0.31 per share.\nOur sales to commercial customers decreased 48%, and our sales to government and defense customers increased 13%.\nFor the quarter, sales to government and defense customers were 52% of our total sales.\nOur Aviation Services segment grew 6% sequentially from our first quarter.\nThis was a result of increased volume in our MRO business, which is seasonally higher in Q1 over -- Q2 over Q1, as well as the continued strength of our government business.\nOur commercial parts volumes overall were relatively stable throughout the quarter and remained above the lows we saw in April and May.\nThat said, I am particularly encouraged by our margin improvement progress.\nOver the last several quarters, we have reduced our footprint across the enterprise, decreased our indirect and overhead spending, exited or restructured several underperforming contracts and divested a loss-making non-core business.\nYou are now starting to see the results of these actions in our adjusted operating margins, which improved meaningfully from 2.5% to 4% sequentially on stable revenue.\nWith respect to cash, we generated $28 million from operating activities from continuing operations and also reduced our accounts receivable financing program by nearly $7 million, further improving our already strong balance sheet position and putting our net leverage below 1 times EBITDA.\nWe also continue to add significant new business that positions us for growth going forward.\nOur CFM56 partnership with Fortress solidifies a source of supply to meet growing demand for used serviceable material on the -5B and the -7B engine variants.\nWe expect demand for USM to increase across the board as we emerge from the pandemic and to be particularly strong for these engine platforms.\nAlso, our follow-on contract from the Navy to support the C-40 aircraft recognizes our performance over the last five years and provides for an expanded statement of work over the next five years.\nIt's worth noting that this was the first time that this contract was awarded to an incumbent, which speaks to the high-quality of our service.\nAdditionally, our 10-year agreement with Honeywell to be its sole authorized service center for 737 MAX Electronic Bleed Air System components positions us to support MAX operators worldwide when that aircraft to return to service.\nThese new contracts, along with others we have announced over the last several months, such as the Unison expansion and extension, represent nearly $1.7 billion in total contract value captured so far this fiscal year.\nThis demonstrates the unique value of our Aviation Services offerings, and these business wins will help accelerate our recovery coming out of the downturn.\nOur sales in the quarter of $403.6 million were down 28% or $157.3 million year-over-year, driven by the impacts of the pandemic on commercial passenger flying activity.\nSequentially, Aviation Services sales were up 5.9% or $21.4 million, while sales in Expeditionary Services were down 50% or $18.6 million.\nThe sequential decline in Expeditionary Services was driven by two factors.\nFirst, the exit of the composites business was completed at the end of Q1, and this business generated $7 million of revenue in Q1 and zero in the current quarter.\nSecond, as previously discussed, mobility had a particularly strong Q1 due to elevated shipments of pallets.\nWithin Aviation Services, our government and defense business was up 19% or $30 million year-over-year, reflecting strong performance on existing contracts.\nIn the quarter, as well as in Q1, our program to deliver two C-40 aircraft to the U.S. Marine Corps generated strong revenue due to elevated activity on the program.\nGross profit margin in the quarter increased to 17.2% from 15.3% in the prior year quarter, driven by the CARES Act payroll support.\nOn a sequential basis, gross profit margin was up 12 -- was up from 12.1% in our first quarter, reflecting the actions we have taken to reduce our indirect costs and to exit underperforming contracts and product lines.\nSG&A expenses were $43.4 million for the quarter.\nOn an adjusted basis, SG&A was $38 million or 9.4% of sales, down $13 million from the prior year quarter, reflecting the reduction of our overhead cost structure.\nOf this improvement, approximately $3.2 million was the result of temporary reductions in compensation and benefits, which we restored beginning on December 1.\nAs an update on our previous disclosure, we have been in settlement discussions with the Department of Justice regarding an investigation of airlift under the False Claims Act.\nDuring the quarter, we recorded $6 million of additional accrual and discontinued operation, which brings our total reserve for this matter to $8 million based on our latest settlement offer.\nWe generated $27.6 million of cash in our operating activities from continuing operations for the quarter.\nThis is net of a use of cash of $6.8 million as we continue to reduce the size of our accounts receivable financing program.\nExcluding the accounts receivable financing program, cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $34.4 million.\nInventory decreased $12.7 million during the quarter.\nOur net debt at quarter end was $112.1 million, down $37 million from $149.3 million at the end of Q1.\nOur balance sheet and liquidity remain strong with net leverage of 0.95 times adjusted EBITDA, unrestricted cash of $110 million and unused capacity under our revolver of approximately $390 million.\nAs such, we're well positioned to fund what we expect to be unique opportunities to grow our business over the coming quarters.\nOverall, we are pleased with our results given the current environment and also pleased with the progress we have made in improving our operating efficiency.\nAs I mentioned, for many reasons, we are encouraged by the multiple vaccines coming to market and the plans for distribution.\nAs the vaccines are distributed and case numbers decline, we expect travel restrictions to be lifted and people to start flying again.\nUntil then, we expect to be in a relatively stable revenue environment, and we will continue to focus on driving cash flow, as well as continued margin improvement.\nWe will also remain focused on capturing new business, I am confident that our strong balance sheet, combined with the airlines' increasing desire for our lower-cost value-added services, will lead to even more growth opportunities.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Both of these documents are available in the Investor Relations section of applied.com.\nIn addition, the conference call will use non-GAAP financial measures, which are subject to the qualifications referenced in those documents.\nOn behalf of our entire team at Applied, we hope you and your families are healthy, safe and managing well.\nI'll start today with a business update, including how we continue to respond to the pandemic as well as progress with various internal initiatives and color on the external environment.\nDave will follow with a summary of our financials and some specifics on our first quarter and outlook, and then I'll close with some final thoughts.\nInto early fiscal 2021, we're seeing a modest recovery gain momentum and are executing well.\nI'm encouraged by the start to the year and believe we are in a solid position to build off this positive momentum as we move forward.\nOur operations are functioning productively.\nOur supply chain and inventory levels are in a good position and we are responding effectively to customers' increasing requirements as an initial demand recovery appears to be under way.\nThroughout the past several quarters, we have quickly adapted to the evolving environment, including implementing new processes and ways to support our customer needs.\nA key part of our message to all our stakeholders during these evolving times is how Applied is stronger today than in prior cycles.\nThis includes benefits from our expanded offerings, greater technical focus and a more diversified end market mix.\nWe've also strengthened our marketing and sales efforts to showcase our comprehensive and leading technical offering and to further develop our cross-selling opportunity.\nWe are increasingly critical to our customers as maintenance, production and efficiency requirements begin to ramp across their core operational infrastructure.\nThese elements are providing near-term sales support and leave us increasingly constructive on our growth potential going forward.\nIn addition, investments in systems, talent, analytics and operational processes in recent years are yielding additional benefits in the current environment.\nWe quickly aligned our cost structure and once again are demonstrating our operational discipline and the resilience of our operating model.\nThis is highlighted by better-than-expected decremental margins in the quarter as well as ongoing strengthening of our balance sheet following strong cash generation performance and a nearly 30% reduction in net debt levels over the prior year.\nOur capabilities and company-specific opportunities, combined with the improving outlook, positions us to be a growth leader with increasing earnings power entering the next phase of recovery in the industrial economy.\nThis is demonstrated by our recent tuck-in acquisition of Advanced Control Solutions earlier this month.\nACS represents the next step in expanding our automation offering, which is further differentiating our value proposition, diversifying our end market mix and enhancing our growth profile to include next-generation industrial solutions.\nAs it relates to the broader demand environment, underlying trends remain below prior year levels during our first quarter as business activity continued to adjust to the ongoing pandemic.\nThat said, customer order activity improved sequentially through the quarter, and we continue to gain traction with our internal growth initiatives.\nAs a result, the year-over-year organic sales decline of 13.4% in the quarter improved notably from the 18.4% decline last quarter.\nYear-over-year organic sales declines improved each month and sequential trends in daily sales rates seasonally strong.\nWe're starting to see greater maintenance activity and break/fix requirements with customers increasing access to their facilities and expanding equipment utilization as production gradually ramps back up, including at smaller local accounts.\nFeedback from our sales leaders suggest order sizes are increasing, customer inventory levels are being replenished and maintenance projects are getting authorized as businesses increase activity and new safety protocols support a productive path forward.\nIn addition, we saw several industry verticals return back to growth during the quarter with 10 of our top 30 verticals up year-over-year versus only two last quarter.\nAreas such as Food & Beverage, Aggregates, Technology, Chemicals and Transportation were all showing positive momentum.\nAnd while weakness remains greatest across heavy industries, such as Machinery, Metals and Oil & Gas.\nDemand within these verticals appears to be stabilizing and improving slightly.\nWe view these dynamics as a positive sign for the industrial economy and demand for our critical products and solutions.\nThat said, the pace of end market improvement remains gradual and at times inconsistent.\nOrganic sales through our first 18 business days of October are down by mid-teens percent over the prior year.\nWe saw some easing in sales early in the month following a strong end to our fiscal first quarter.\nSales trends have improved each week in October, with order momentum increasing sequentially across both our segments month-to-date.\nHowever, it's important to note that visibility remains limited ahead of the seasonally slower winter months as customers continue to manage through an uncertain macro and pandemic outlook near term.\nAdditionally, customer purchasing discipline can be more restrained around any given election cycle.\nAs we've shown in recent quarters, we know how to manage and execute in this still uncertain business environment and will remain prudent in our cost focus and capital deployment near-term while focusing on our self-help growth opportunities.\nOverall, we're seeing signs that reinforce our view that the worst is behind us, and a recovery is starting to gain traction.\nThis bodes well for when we enter the seasonally stronger second half of our fiscal year as comparisons become easier and we continue to execute on our internal growth initiatives.\nBefore I begin, I will remind everyone that a supplemental investor deck recapping key financial performance and discussion points is available on our investor site for your additional reference.\nTo provide more detail on our first quarter, consolidated sales decreased 12.7% over the prior year quarter.\nAcquisitions contributed 1.1% growth, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 0.4%.\nNetting these factors, sales decreased 13.4% on an organic basis with a like number of selling days year-over-year.\nTurning to sales performance by segment, as highlighted on slides six and seven.\nSales in our Service Center segment declined 14.9% year-over-year or 14.4% on organic basis.\nThe decline reflects the ongoing impact from COVID-19, including reduced industrial production activity and customer facility restrictions which continues to impact MRO demand across our service center network.\nHowever, the 14% organic decline year-over-year represents an improvement from the 21% decline during last quarter.\nIn addition, average daily sales rates were up more than 4% sequentially and above the normal seasonal progression.\nAs Neil highlighted, we saw greater maintenance activity in break/fix demand.\nMore customers are providing access into their facilities and releasing working capital spending following a slow pace during the summer months.\nYear-over-year declines remain greatest within Metals, Oil & Gas and Machinery end markets but were balanced by underlying improvement within Food & Beverage, Pulp & Paper, Aggregates, Forestry and Chemical Industries as well as ongoing growth in our Australian operations.\nWithin our Fluid Power & Flow Control segment, sales decreased 7.4% over the prior year quarter with our August 2019 acquisition of Olympus Controls, contributing 3.8 points of growth on roughly half a quarter of remaining inorganic contribution.\nOn an organic basis, segment sales declined 11.2%, reflecting lower demand across Industrial, Off-Highway Mobile and process-related end markets.\nThis was partially offset by sales growth within Technology, Life Sciences, Food & Beverage and Chemical end markets during the quarter as well as ongoing traction with our cross-selling initiatives and firm sales activity across our emerging automation platform.\nMoving to margin performance.\nAs highlighted on Page eight of the deck, gross margin of 28.9% declined approximately 50 basis points year-over-year or 40 basis points when excluding noncash LIFO expense of $1.1 million in the quarter and $0.4 million in the prior year quarter.\nYear-over-year declines primarily reflect unfavorable mix tied to sales declines across our local service center accounts, albeit more modest relative to last quarter as well as more subdued pricing opportunities given the softer demand environment.\nThat said, on a sequential basis, gross margins improved 13 basis points or 17 basis points when excluding LIFO expense, and we're slightly ahead of our expectations.\nWhile we expect some of the volume-driven year-over-year headwinds to persist near term, we remain focused on driving annual gross margin expansion as demand levels normalize, reflecting benefits from our systems investments, the positive contribution of expansionary products, strategic growth driven by our technical service-oriented solutions and initiatives to expand business across our local customer base.\nIn addition, we are starting to see a slightly greater level of supplier price increase announcements, which, combined with firming demand, could provide some positive momentum for pricing contribution and margin expansion into the second half of our fiscal year.\nTurning to our operating cost.\nSelling, distribution and administrative expenses declined 13.4% year-over-year or approximately 15% when excluding incremental operating costs associated with our Olympus Controls acquisition.\nBoth of these figures exclude $1.5 million of nonroutine cost in the prior year quarter.\nThe year-over-year decline reflects the ongoing benefit from various actions we've taken in recent quarters to align expenses with lower demand.\nThis includes a mix of both structural and temporary cost actions as we continue to assess the environment.\nAnd while we have begun to roll back some of the temporary actions, our team continues to demonstrate great discipline in controlling costs and identifying internal opportunities.\nCombined with improving sales trends during the quarter, we reported a 9.5% decremental margin on operating income during our recent fiscal first quarter, which exceeded our expectations and highlights the adaptability and durability of our operating model.\nGoing forward, we will remain prudent and disciplined in maintaining our cost structure as we continue to gradually roll off temporary cost actions to align with our recent performance, a more constructive outlook and our growth initiatives.\nEBITDA in the quarter was $67.6 million, down 13.6% compared to adjusted EBITDA of $78.2 million in the prior year quarter while EBITDA margin was 9%, down a modest 10 basis points over the prior year despite the double-digit sales decline.\nWe reported net income of $34.8 million or $0.89 per share, down from adjusted net income of $39.9 million or $1.02 per share in the prior year quarter.\nMoving to our cash flow performance and liquidity.\nDuring the first quarter, cash generated from operating activities was $81.8 million while free cash flow was $78.2 million or approximately 225% of net income.\nThis was up from $50 million and $45 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year quarter, and represents record first quarter cash generation.\nThe strong cash performance during the quarter reflects ongoing contribution from our working capital initiatives as well as the countercyclical cash profile of our business model.\nGiven the strong cash flow performance in the quarter, we ended September with over $271 million of cash on hand with approximately 75% of that unrestricted U.S. held cash.\nOf note, this is after utilizing $62 million of cash during the quarter to pay down debt.\nWe have now paid down over $200 million of debt since early 2018, including over $80 million the past year.\nOur net debt is down nearly 30% over the prior year, and net leverage stood at 2.1 times adjusted EBITDA at quarter end, below the prior year quarter level of 2.3 times and the prior year level of 2.6 times.\nAdditionally, our revolver remained undrawn with approximately $250 million of capacity and an additional $250 million Accordion option.\nCombined with incremental capacity on our uncommitted private shelf facility, our liquidity is ample and our balance sheet is strong entering what appears to be an emerging recovery.\nThis provides flexibility to fund incremental working capital requirements in coming quarters as customer demand continues to improve as well as opportunistically pursue strategic M&A aligned with our growth initiatives.\nOur M&A focus near-term remains on smaller bolt-on targets that align with our growth priorities, including additional automation and fluid power opportunities.\nTransitioning now to our outlook.\nVisibility remains limited on how customers will proceed with operations into the seasonally slower winter months.\nThat said, to provide some directional views near term based on month-to-day trends in October and assuming normal sequential patterns in daily sales rates for the balance of the quarter, we would expect fiscal second quarter 2021 sales to decline 13% to 14% organically on a year-over-year basis.\nThis includes an assumption of low-teen organic declines in both our Service Center segment and Fluid Power & Flow Control segment.\nAgain, this direction is meant to provide a starting framework on how second quarter sales could shape up if trends follow normal seasonality over the next two months.\nIf customers reduce underlying production activity, or extend these plant shutdowns, this could drive organic declines that are greater than the 13% to 14% assumption.\nOn the other hand, if we see ongoing improvement in underlying industrial activity and further traction with our internal growth initiatives, organic declines could be better than the 13% to 14% assumption.\nIn addition, we expect our recent acquisition of ACS to contribute approximately $6 million in sales during our fiscal second quarter.\nBased on the 13% to 14% organic sales decline, we believe a low double-digit to low-teen decremental margin is an appropriate benchmark to use for our second quarter.\nThis assumes gross margin to be relatively stable sequentially to first quarter levels as well as the ongoing gradual rollback of temporary cost actions.\nAs indicated, we will continue to take a mindful and balanced approach to our operating costs going forward, including ongoing focus on internal opportunities and margin initiatives, which we expect to provide balance into our cost trajectory moving forward.\nWe are encouraged by our cost and margin execution year-to-date which are providing the flexibility to further roll back temporary cost actions as we take an offensive approach to an emerging recovery and our strategic growth targets.\nWe also note an effective tax rate of 23% to 25% is still an appropriate assumption near term.\nLastly, from a cash flow perspective, we would expect moderation from first quarter levels sequentially for the balance of the year, given potential greater working capital requirements as we look to support growth and the recovery as the year plays out.\nWe remain confident in our cash generation potential over the cycle and reiterate our normalized annual free cash target of at least 100% of net income.\nOverall, I'm encouraged by how we started the year.\nOur entire team has shown tremendous resiliency over the past several quarters which is driving improved performance into early fiscal 2021 and positions us to respond and capitalize on the recovery as it continues to unfold.\nWe have proven the durability of our business model, strengthened our balance sheet and optimized our cost structure.\nWe are leveraging our unique and differentiated industry position to be an industrial growth leader into the emerging recovery and in years to come.\nAll of this is reflected in our first quarter results and provides further evidence of the positive path we're on.\nFrom our industry-leading technical MRO capabilities to our Engineered Solutions focus, multichannel cross-selling opportunity and expanding automation platform.\nWe have multiple catalysts to expand our market potential and accelerate share gains in coming years, all while driving additional margin expansion.\nThis is integrated into our long-term targets of $4.5 billion in sales and 11% EBITDA margins, which are well within our capability and provide the framework for accelerating earnings power and stakeholder returns long term.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO.\nThe Company closed the third quarter with record sales of $2,323 million and record GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.12 and $1.09 respectively.\nSales were up 11% in US dollars and up 10% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of 2019.\nSales in the third quarter increased by 9% organically.\nAnd sequentially, sales were up 17% in US dollars and 15% in local currencies and organically.\nBreaking down sales into our two segments, the interconnect business, which comprised 96% of our sales was up 11% in US dollars and 10% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year.\nOur cable business, which comprised 4% of our sales, was up 2% in US dollars and 5% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year.\nAdam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.\nOperating income was $476 million in the third quarter of 2020.\nOperating margins were 20.5%, which was up a very strong 250 basis points sequentially and up 80 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2019.\nThe strong sequential improvement in margins reflected a healthy conversion on the higher sales levels, as well as an expected significant reduction in the impact of COVID-related costs.\nThe year-over-year improvement in operating margin reflected a strong conversion on the higher sales levels.\nFrom a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 22.4% in the third quarter of 2020, which increased from 21.7% in the third quarter of 2019 and 20% in the third quarter -- sorry, in the second quarter of 2020.\nIn the cable segment, margins were 10.7%, which increased from 10.2% in the third quarter of 2019 and 9.4% in the second quarter of 2020.\nGiven the unprecedented challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are extremely proud of this quarter's performance.\nOur team's ability to manage through all of the impacts of this crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the Company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high performance action-oriented culture and which has enabled us to capitalize on opportunities and maximize profitability in an uncertain market environment.\nInterest expense for the quarter was $28 million, which was down from $30 million in the third quarter of last year.\nThe Company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2020, including excess tax benefit of $11 million associated with stock option exercises during the quarter, was 22.1% compared to 24.5% in the third quarter of 2019.\nExcluding the excess tax benefit just mentioned, the Company's adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5% for both the third quarter of 2020 and 2019.\nAdjusted net income of $336 million was 14% of sales in the third quarter of 2020, another confirmation of the strength of the Company's financial performance.\nOn a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share increased by 22% to $1.12 in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $0.92 in the third quarter of 2019.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 15% to $1.09 in the third quarter of 2020 from $0.95 in the third quarter of 2019.\nOrders for the quarter were $2,275 million, which was up 9% compared to the third quarter of 2019 and up 15% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.98 to 1.\nThe Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash.\nCash flow from operations was a strong $398 million in the third quarter or 119% of adjusted net income.\nOur free cash flow was $330 million or 98% of adjusted net income.\nFrom a working capital standpoint, inventory and accounts receivable and accounts payable were $1.4 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.1 billion respectively at the end of September.\nAnd inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 79, 72 and 61 days respectively.\nAll improved from the second quarter levels and all within our normal range.\nDuring the third quarter, our cash flow from operations of $398 million, along with the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $104 million, were used primarily to repurchase 1.9 million shares of the Company's stock for $202 million or an average price of $108, fund dividend payments of $75 million, fund net capital expenditures of $68 million, fund acquisitions of $50 million and fund net purchases of short-term investments of $9 million.\nThis increase is effective for payments beginning in January of 2021.\nAt September 30, cash and short-term investments were $1.5 billion, a majority of which is held outside of the US.\nTotal debt at September 30 was $3.8 billion with no maturities before the third quarter of 2021.\nAnd net debt at September 30 was $2.4 billion.\nTotal cash on hand plus the remaining availability under our credit facilities was $4 billion at the end of the quarter.\nAnd third quarter EBITDA was $568 million and our pro forma net leverage ratio was 1.2 times.\nAnd first and foremost, I hope that all of you on the call here today, together with your family, your friends and your colleagues, are staying safe and healthy throughout the pandemic.\nAs Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the third quarter, and most importantly, discuss the trends and progress across our served markets.\nI'll then make a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year of 2020.\nWith respect to the third quarter, amid what has been clearly an unprecedented and volatile year, I'm truly proud that we at Amphenol achieved record sales and adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter, realizing levels significantly above our guidance that we issued just 90 days ago.\nSales reached $2,323 million, an increase from prior year of 11% in US dollars, 10% in local currencies and 9% organically.\nThis strong growth was driven by increases in mobile devices, IT-datacom, industrial, military, broadband and the automotive markets, and was offset partially by declines in the commercial air and mobile networks markets.\nWe are particularly proud to have achieved a very robust 17% sequential growth from the second quarter, which was significantly higher than our original expectations.\nAs Craig mentioned, the Company booked $2,275 million in orders, and that represented a book-to-bill of 0.98 to 1.\nNow, despite experiencing some continued operational challenges related to the pandemic, we generated excellent operating margins of 20.5% in the third quarter, and this was a full 250 basis point increase from our second quarter levels.\nJust want to say that the Company's financial position remains extremely strong with our operating cash flow of $398 million, and that was particularly notable given the stronger-than-expected sequential growth from the second quarter.\nAnd we continue to leverage that financial strength to return capital to our shareholders, both through our repurchase last quarter of 1.9 million shares of the Company's stock as well as the Board of Directors' approval of a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend that we are announcing today.\nI'm extremely proud of the Amphenol team.\nNo question in my mind that the record results this quarter clearly demonstrate the true value of the agility, the discipline and the drive of our entrepreneurial organization.\nNow, turning to the trends across our served markets, I would just comment that as we've seen this year so far, Amphenol's balanced and broad end market diversification is a uniquely valuable asset, especially in times of heightened economic uncertainty.\nAs many of our markets began to recover in the third quarter, we were able to quickly capitalize on the growth opportunities in those markets, while still retaining our broad exposure to new opportunities and new technology developments across all areas of the electronics industry.\nThe military market represented 12% of our sales in the third quarter.\nSales in this market increased by 6% from prior year, driven in particular by growth in military vehicles, naval, space, communications and airframe applications.\nSequentially, our sales increased by a strong 30% as we recovered from the impact of production restrictions that hit certain of our facilities related to government measures implemented in the second quarter to control the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLooking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to increase slightly from these levels.\nAnd for the full year 2020, we expect a low-single digit increase in sales from prior year.\nThis full year performance reflects our leading market position and strong execution, offset in part by the impact of the pandemic-related production restrictions we experienced in the first half of 2020.\nI'm very proud of our team working in the military market around the world.\nThey have maintained a singular focus on ensuring that our defense industry customers have uninterrupted access to our leading high technology interconnect products, which are critical to our customers' equipment.\nWe are encouraged both by the accelerating adoption of electronics in these systems, together with the overall favorable defense spending environment.\nThe investments that we've made over the last several years in both new technologies and the capabilities to produce them at volume have positioned us very strongly to be able to capitalize on these trends for many years to come.\nThe commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the third quarter.\nSales were down by 40%, a very significant level, as the commercial aircraft market once again experienced unprecedented declines in demand for new aircraft due to the pandemic-related disruptions to the global travel industry.\nSequentially, our sales were a bit better than expected, rising 4% from the second quarter.\nAs we look ahead, though, we expect the commercial air market to continue to be negatively impacted by the significant reduction in demand for air travel, which is occurring around the world.\nAccordingly, we expect an approximately 20% sequential reduction in our sales to this market in the fourth quarter.\nAnd for the full year 2020, we expect a roughly 35% decline from prior year due to the unprecedented demand disruptions that our customers are experiencing.\nIt's no question that these are difficult times for the entire travel industry and that that's having a serious impact on the market for commercial airplanes in the near term.\nNevertheless, our team remains committed to leveraging the Company's strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems integrated into those airplanes.\nAnd we remain well positioned when this market eventually does return to growth.\nThe industrial market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter.\nAnd our sales to the industrial market exceeded our expectations, increasing by 21% in US dollars and 18% organically, a very strong performance.\nThis robust growth was driven especially by the instrumentation, medical, industrial battery, heavy equipment, alternative energy and rail mass transit segments, really a broad base of growth that we saw in the industrial market.\nAlthough we had expected sales to be modestly lower than the second quarter, we actually realized 11% sequential growth here in the third quarter, a very strong performance.\nLooking into the fourth quarter, we expect a modest decline from these third quarter sales levels.\nNevertheless, for the full year 2020, we expect a low-double digit increase in sales from 2019 levels, an outstanding performance given the overall market environment.\nI'm truly proud of our team working in the industrial market.\nWhether enabling the growth in volumes of a wide array of medical equipment, managing through significant increases in demand for semiconductor capital equipment or executing on unprecedented demand for next-generation batteries, our global organization has reacted quickly to ensure that our customers around the world are fully supported, regardless of the many operational challenges that have arisen throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs we look toward the long term, I'm confident that our performance through this crisis has positioned us very strongly for the future.\nAnd importantly, we continue to drive our leading development of next-generation interconnect, sensor and antenna products in support of our customers in the industrial market, who in turn are accelerating their adoption of next-generation technologies.\nThe automotive market represented 17% of our sales in the third quarter.\nAfter a truly challenging second quarter during which the global automotive industry was deeply impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we were very pleased to have seen a very strong recovery here in the third quarter with results much better than we had originally anticipated coming into the quarter.\nOur team's outstanding execution led to an increase in sales from prior year by 4% in US dollars and 1% organically, well ahead of our expectations.\nSequentially, our sales increased by truly significant 78% from the second quarter as our team was able to execute quickly on a recovery in demand from automotive customers in all regions.\nLooking now into the fourth quarter, we expect automotive sales to further increase in the mid-single digits from these levels.\nFor the full year 2020, we expect a low-double digit reduction in sales, which does reflect the severe and sudden pandemic-related downturn in demand from automotive OEMs that we saw in the first half.\nI'm extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market, who has clearly demonstrated both agility and resiliency in realizing these strong sequential growth levels.\nIn fact, our performance through this crisis makes me even more confident in our long-term prospects in the automotive market.\nWe've continued to expand our range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products, both organically and through acquisitions, all with the goal of enabling a wide array of onboard electronics across a diversified range of vehicles made by auto manufacturers around the world.\nThis consistent strategy will no doubt continue to benefit us as the automotive market recovers.\nThe mobile devices market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter.\nAnd our sales to mobile device customers increased by a stronger-than-expected 25% from prior year, driven in particular by increased sales of products incorporated into laptops, tablets and wearables, and this was offset in part by slightly lower year-over-year sales to smartphones.\nSequentially, our sales increased by a much stronger-than-expected 37%.\nAnd this was driven by higher sales across all the products that we serve.\nLooking to the fourth quarter, we expect a slight increase from these already strong third quarter levels.\nAnd for the full year, we anticipate sales to grow in the low-double digits from 2019.\nAnd I would just note that this is well above our original expectations as we came into the year before we were hit with the pandemic.\nWhile mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile markets, our outstanding agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise here in the fourth quarter or beyond.\nOur leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, and this positions us well for the long term.\nThe mobile networks market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter.\nAnd sales decreased as we had expected from prior year by 19% in US dollars and 21% organically, driven by lower sales to wireless operators, as well as some continued impact from the US government restrictions on certain Chinese entities that we have previously discussed.\nLooking into the fourth quarter, we expect a further seasonal sales reduction of approximately 25% related to both OEMs and service providers.\nAnd for the full year, we expect a high-teens reduction in sales, which reflects the impact of the US government restrictions as well as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRegardless of the near-term challenges in the mobile networks market, we're confident in the Company's long-term position in this important and exciting industry.\nOur team continues to work aggressively to expand our opportunity with next-generation equipment and networks.\nAs customers ramp up investment of these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers around the world.\nThe information technology and data communications market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter.\nSales in the third quarter were once again much better than we had anticipated, rising from prior year by a very strong 24% in US dollars and 21% organically.\nAnd this growth was really driven from increased demand for data traffic that continued to prompt both our OEM and service provider customers to increase their demand across virtually all segments of the IT-datacom market.\nSequentially, sales were down by less-than-expected 10% from our extremely strong second quarter.\nAs we look toward the fourth quarter, we expect a mid-teens sequential decline from these very strong third quarter levels.\nAnd for the full year 2020, we expect sales to increase in the low-teens, reflecting the significant upside in demand we experienced in both the second and third quarters, offset in part by the pandemic-related disruptions we saw in the first quarter.\nOur team working in support of the IT-datacom market has clearly distinguished themselves this year, reacting quickly to capitalize on unprecedented demand for our industry-leading high-speed and power products.\nAt the same time, we've not slowed down our efforts to further develop our broad range of industry-leading interconnect products in support of data communications networks around the world.\nIndeed, we remain very encouraged by the Company's strong technology position in the global IT-datacom market.\nOur customers continue to drive their equipment to ever-higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power.\nIn turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT-datacom.\nThe broadband market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter.\nSales increased by 5% from prior year, driven by stronger demand for home installation-related equipment from broadband operators.\nOn a sequential basis, sales increased by a stronger-than-expected 13% as our customers continued to upgrade their networks in support of the increased demand for high-speed data.\nWe expect sales in the fourth quarter to moderate from these levels on typical end-of-the-year seasonality.\nAnd for the full year 2020, we expect sales to be roughly flat with prior year.\nAnd this reflects the pandemic-related disruptions we experienced in certain geographies, offset by increased investments by our customers in support of higher bandwidth demand.\nNow, turning to our outlook for the future, while our performance in the third quarter was very strong, there still remain significant uncertainties in the global market related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which does appear to be worsening in some regions of the world.\nAssuming no new material disruptions from the pandemic, as well as constant exchange rates, for the 4th quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2,160 million to $2,200 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.98 to $1.00.\nThis represents both sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth versus prior year of flat to up 2%.\nOur fourth quarter guidance also represents an expectation for full-year sales of $8,333 million to $8,373 million and full year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.59 to $3.61.\nThis outlook represents sales growth versus prior year of 1% to 2% and an adjusted diluted earnings per share decline of 3% to 4%.\nThe expected decline in our earnings relates directly to the significant cost and disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic that the Company faced particularly during the first half of 2020.\nNow, let me just say that I'm extremely pleased by Amphenol's performance in the third quarter, especially our team's achievement of these new quarterly records in both sales and earnings.\nMost importantly, I remain very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability.\nI just want to assure you that our entire organization remains committed to fighting hard to secure the Company's financial performance, all while dedicating ourselves wholeheartedly to protecting the safety and health of each of our employees around the world.\nAnd with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Today's discussion is being broadcast on our website.\nParticipating in today's call are Bob Wetherbee, Board Chair, President and CEO; and Don Newman, Senior Vice President and CFO.\nBob and Don will focus on our second quarter highlights and key messages, but may refer to certain slides within their remarks.\nThese slides are available on our website.\nThey provide additional color and details on our results and outlook.\nHere we are over a year since the world went into lockdown as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSo much has changed in the last four quarters, and it's easy to focus on the more challenging aspects of this period.\nAt the same time, it's important to remember that we also changed some things, those within our control for the better.\nLike many, we quickly innovated within our digital technology infrastructure to thrive on remote collaboration.\nTechnology allowed us to streamline our processes and work more efficiently overall.\nWe'll continue to drive these improvements utilizing new skills and tools to provide more flexibility to our employees and create better connections with our customers, and we'll capture the associated structural cost savings.\nI'm pleased to see millions of people returning to the skies for the summer travel season.\nEvery day seems to bring another sign of recovery in airframe and jet engine demand.\nThe current economic reawakening and everything from travel to consumer goods to energy is real.\nDespite lingering pandemic-related uncertainties, I'm confident the desire to travel is significant and growing worldwide.\nUltimately, that drives the sustained lengthy backlog for any airliner programs.\nAt ATI, we're ready to produce what our customers need.\nWith that as a backdrop, we generated second quarter financial results that showcase the improving trends in our end markets.\nAt the same time, they reflect the negative impact of the recently concluded strike by the United Steelworkers at our Specialty Rolled Products or SRP business.\nExcluding the $40 million cost attributed to the strike and a small improvement in our restructuring reserves, we lost $0.12 per share in the second quarter.\nDespite the earnings loss, the aerospace recovery is readily apparent beneath the headline numbers.\nOur jet engine product revenues were up over 20% compared to the first quarter 2021.\nThe High Performance Materials & Components segment, or HPMC, saw its margins improve by more than 200 basis points sequentially and nearly 300 basis points year-over-year.\nVery good news that Don will cover in more depth in a few minutes.\nAs we discussed on the first quarter earnings call in April, we were incredibly disappointed that the union leadership chose to call a strike at our major SRP operating locations.\nOur robust continuity plans allowed us to maintain operations during the strike.\nThe new 4-year labor agreement was ratified on July 13.\nMany represented employees returned to their positions within a week of ratification.\nWe're safely and efficiently ramping up operations to their prior production levels.\nWe're on track and expect to be back to full production capabilities in September.\nI've been asked many times by many people inside and outside of ATI, some form of the question, was the strike worth it?\nClearly, we would have preferred to continue negotiating to reach an agreement without a work stoppage.\nA competitive cost structure for this business is imperative.\nLeft unresolved, we'd be facing rapidly escalating healthcare costs that were on a trajectory to double every seven years.\nProduct pricing can increase fast enough to offset that level of healthcare inflation.\nThe SRP business would have fallen behind its competition.\nWe were compelled to act now to find a solution.\nUnder this contract, annual healthcare cost inflation will be capped at 3.5%.\nThe represented employees are responsible to take any necessary actions required to cover annual overage amounts.\nThe SRP business is now appropriately focused on getting back to full speed, providing our customers with the materials and components they need.\nTo close out my comments related to the SRP business, I have two pieces of good news to share.\nFirst, the transformation initiative to exit standard stainless sheet products is on track and will be completed by year-end 2021 as planned.\nWe're making excellent progress on consolidating our footprint.\nSecond, we recently signed a long-term agreement with JSW Steel USA to toll convert a significant percentage of their Ohio-produced carbon steel slabs through our hot rolling and processing facility in Pennsylvania.\nThis multiyear agreement provides a meaningful opportunity to increase our asset utilization and cash flow.\nWe're happy to partner with JSW to bring the exceptional quality and gauge control of our world-class HRPF to their customers.\nWe're currently ramping up production.\nCongratulations to the operating team for setting a production record for carbon steel toll conversion volume in the month of June, even in the midst of the strike at this facility.\nSo what are we seeing in our key end markets?\nWell, for the first time in several quarters, the news is encouraging across most of our portfolio.\nThis removes the strike impact from the comparison.\nI believe this provides the most realistic view of our underlying performance and the true market demand.\nUsing that context, sales increased sequentially in each of our major end markets with the exception of electronics, which is being compared to record results in Q1.\nOn a year-to-year basis, we grew sales in most of our key end markets, most notably Energy, up 60%; and Defense, up 22%.\nWe continue to gain momentum in our largest key market, commercial jet engines.\nThis is principally driven by the recovery of narrowbody platforms, particularly engine programs used on the A320 and A321 aircraft families.\nAs we said on the last few calls, the demand recovery began in our Forgings business where lead times are six to nine months ahead of engine production.\nDue to the market recovery and our recent share gains, our Forgings revenue exceeded both the prior year and the prior quarter levels.\nWe expect this positive growth trend to continue and expand as increased production rates on the 737 MAX become a larger part of our order book.\nThe return to growth in Jet Engine Specialty Materials has lagged Forgings, largely due to pockets of stranded inventory throughout the supply chain.\nAs expected, this inventory is depleting, albeit at an uneven pace, according to customer and product form.\nIn the second quarter, sales of our Specialty Materials like Rene 65 for LEAP engines grew significantly compared to the first quarter, but were still below prior year.\nWe anticipate demand for materials to continue to increase for narrowbody engines, but lag for widebody engines.\nThis uneven pull, coupled with any remaining channel inventory will make for a somewhat choppy growth trajectory quarter-to-quarter for the balance of the year.\nRounding out commercial aerospace, the airframe market continues to be soft.\nThis is largely due to the much discussed sluggish demand for widebody aircraft due to subdued international travel and stranded supply chain inventory.\nWe expect this trend to continue throughout 2021 and possibly into early 2022 as the industry awaits the catalyst for increased widebody production rates.\nOur newly won European OEM Airframe business begins production in the second half of 2021, initially at low levels.\nThis will partially offset the anticipated destocking pressure at our primary domestic airframe customer.\nAs I mentioned earlier, Defense continues to be a growth market for ATI.\nOur broad materials portfolio serves customers with a wide range of demanding applications, ensuring we can be successful under almost any defense budget or economic backdrop.\nOur second quarter growth was driven by naval nuclear applications and rotorcraft products to support increased demand for U.S. navy ships and heavy-lift helicopters.\nWe expect our Defense business to continue to grow and are seeing titanium armor plate demand return in the second half of 2021, in support of a new U.K. armored vehicle program.\nTurning to the Energy markets.\nWe experienced significant growth, largely in our specialty energy portfolio.\nThese increases primarily supported land-based gas turbine production in Asia where energy demand is increasing.\nSales to civilian nuclear customers added to this growth.\nLooking ahead, we see continued improvements in Energy markets as the world slowly reopens from pandemic lockdowns and economic growth drives increasing energy needs.\nWrapping up the market's discussions, results were mixed in our two smaller differentiated markets.\nWe saw the expected return to growth in medical applications as hospitals perform more elective surgeries and diagnostic testing procedures.\nBoth our MRI and Implant Materials sales increased sequentially.\nWe expect demand to improve modestly over the coming quarters, led by MRI.\nIn the Electronics market, sales decreased from record levels in the first quarter of 2021, but grew year-over-year.\nSales of ATI's specialty alloy powders increased versus both prior periods.\nWe expect demand to remain strong for these products for the balance of 2021.\nI'd like to cover several areas, including our Q2 financial performance, our balance sheet and our outlook.\nOn a reported basis, ATI lost $0.39 per share in the second quarter.\nExcluding $40 million of costs associated with the strike and a small favorable true-up to our restructuring reserves, the company lost $0.12 per share in the second quarter.\nTo get a true sense of our performance, you have to go beyond the headlines.\nAs we told you on the last two earnings calls, the commercial aerospace recovery, particularly in jet engines, is gaining momentum and becoming more broad-based within our business.\nThis is readily apparent in our HPMC segment results where jet engines account for more than 40% of overall segment revenues.\nAs Bob shared, jet engine revenues increased by more than 20% sequentially for ATI as a whole and for HPMC.\nVolumes in our Forgings business continue to expand, building on growth in the prior two quarters.\nUnderlying demand for our Specialty Materials accelerated meaningfully for the first time since the pandemic began.\nIn addition to jet engines, revenues in each of HPMC's key end markets grew versus the first quarter, led by specialty energy, including materials for land-based gas turbines produced in Asia.\nAs a result of our profitable jet engine growth and increased asset utilization, HPMC EBITDA margins increased by 220 basis points compared to the first quarter and nearly 300 basis points versus the second quarter of 2020.\nWe anticipate third quarter growth across HPMC's key end markets, most notably jet engine and specialty energy and further utilization benefits from increasing production rates across our network.\nWe expect robust incremental margins over the coming quarters as profitable jet engine revenues increased and structural cost improvements executed throughout 2020 are maintained.\nQ2 financial results were clearly impacted by the 105-day strike in the SRP business.\nIt should be noted that while we removed strike-related costs from segment earnings, segment revenues also declined nearly $140 million versus the first quarter due to plant outages and resulting production declines.\nNo adjustments were made for these revenue headwinds.\nDespite the short-term impacts to 2021 performance, we achieved the needed long-term cost structure changes that will help SRP compete more effectively in the specialty materials marketplace.\nSticking with the AA&S segment, our Precision Rolled Strip business in Asia continues to operate at robust levels with revenues in line with its record-setting first quarter, well above prior year.\nEarnings from this business were below first quarter levels due to unfavorable mix.\nEarnings from our SA&C business were below the first quarter and prior year, largely due to unfavorable mix and the elevated production costs.\nLooking ahead in the AA&S segment, we expect the SRP business to begin to recover in August.\nAs a result of the strike continuing throughout most of July and the inefficiencies associated with the production reramp, we anticipate approximately $25 million of additional third quarter costs.\nWe expect the Asian Precision Rolled Strip business to produce solid results in what is generally its strongest seasonal quarter as device manufacturers prepare for the year-end holiday season.\nOur SA&C business will likely have marginally lower sequential earnings due to its traditional third quarter preventive maintenance outages.\nIt's worth noting that second quarter corporate costs and closed company expenses were elevated compared to prior year and prior quarter.\nCorporate costs were above prior year largely due to incentive compensation accruals and higher than the prior quarter, mainly due to foreign exchange losses.\nClosed company expenses were above first quarter and prior year, primarily due to nonrepeating benefits in both prior periods.\nAs we've discussed over the past several quarters, our decisive 2020 cost actions continue to benefit the business.\nThey serve to limit decremental margins while year-over-year revenues declined.\nWe fully expect them to benefit the bottom line when revenues return to year-over-year growth.\nThe HPMC segment's second quarter results offer a preview of what is expected in future quarters.\nWhile HPMC revenues were flat versus prior year, earnings grew 30%.\nWe achieved this earnings growth largely as a result of increasing production rates at many segment facilities coupled with streamlined cost structures.\nHowever, we still have room to improve.\nSome facilities such as our nickel powder operations at Bakers, North Carolina, continue to operate on limited schedules due to low demand levels.\nWhile others still produce large quantities of lower-margin transactional products as commercial aerospace markets recover.\nNow let's move to the balance sheet and liquidity.\nAs has been the case throughout the pandemic, we've taken actions to improve our debt profile and have prioritized our balance sheet to ensure an ample cushion to weather any storm.\nDespite the recent strike, we ended the quarter with roughly $830 million of total liquidity, including at least $475 million of cash.\nOur second quarter managed working capital levels increased, partially from elevated inventories in our SRP business due to strike-related inefficiencies.\nAccounts receivable and accounts payable balances also contributed to the second quarter's higher working capital levels.\nWe continue to focus on inventory velocity as we ramp production.\nWe expect working capital levels as a percent of sales to improve significantly in the second half of the year.\nLooking ahead, we anticipate contributing up to $50 million to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan in the third quarter to improve our funding status and long-term leverage profile.\nThe deposit is above and beyond minimum contribution requirements, but it is consistent with our intent to reduce our pension exposure.\nAdditionally, we'll continue to actively manage our debt maturity profile in the coming quarters.\nAs I said earlier, we expect our Jet Engine business to continue to improve, led by growth in Specialty Materials and our ongoing cost structure benefits.\nIn the AA&S segment, we anticipate higher sequential SRP volumes.\nWe'll also see increased maintenance and production costs due to a temporary production outage related to our transformation efforts.\nOur SA&C business will be negatively impacted sequentially by its traditional summer maintenance outages, creating lower revenues and higher expenses versus the second quarter.\nWe expect earnings from our Asian Precision Rolled Strip business to increase sequentially due to higher electronics volumes.\nAs a result of the new USW labor agreement, we reduced our contractual funding requirements for post-retirement medical benefits.\nThis will result in a onetime noncash pre-tax gain of approximately $65 million in our third quarter results.\nThis benefit and associated $15 million tax charge will be excluded from our adjusted earnings.\nIn aggregate, we expect third quarter adjusted earnings to be between breakeven and a loss of $0.08 per share, excluding strike-related costs and the $65 million post-retirement medical accounting gain.\nHPMC segment gains will likely be partially offset by AA&S segment maintenance outages and production expense headwinds.\nWhile we are not able to accurately predict fourth quarter results due to lingering uncertainties in the aerospace production ramp, we expect adjusted earnings to return to profitability in Q4 and continue to improve in 2022.\nFinally, due to the negative strike-related earnings impact, we now anticipate full year free cash flow to be at breakeven to slightly positive levels.\nWe'll work diligently to offset the strike cash impact, continuing to be disciplined on capital spending and aggressively seeking working capital improvements throughout the back half of the year.\nI'm

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:A few orders of business before we proceed.\nWe are providing to the SEC our 10-Q report today.\nThere has been some delays on the part of the SEC.\nBut we will get that done today.\nThey deal with the quarter and they deal with our strategic growth initiatives.\nSo if you're all online, you will see them scrolling across your screen.\nIf you are on audio, telephone only, you can see such slides by going to our website.\nThere is an icon on the very front page that allows you to see those slides.\nOur usual cautionary reminder, which we will do before beginning.\nSuch factors include weather conditions, changes in regulatory policies, competitive pressures and other risks that are identified in the Company's SEC reports and filings.\nSuch information will not necessarily be updated by the Company.\nIn today's call, we will first be starting with our Chief Financial Officer.\nDavid Johnson, who will review the quarter and the nine months followed by Mr. Eric Wintemute, Chairman and CEO of the Company who will talk about our strategic growth initiatives.\nWe also have Mr. Bob Trogele present to answer any questions you may have.\nGoing forward, we intend to keep you apprised on how we are doing against these targets, just as I do with respect to matters that are key to investors, understanding our business performance such as inventory and borrowing capacity.\nWith regard to our public filing, as Bill mentioned, our 10-Q document for the three and nine months ended September 30th, 2020 is presently in queue to be filed today.\nI do understand that the agency that assists us with our filing has a large number of documents in the queue at this time.\nEverything I am covering here is included in more detail in that document.\nAs we have noted in previous calls, the Company is fortunate to participate in industries that are considered part of critical infrastructure in all countries in which we operate.\nAs a result, our customers and our suppliers have all operated more or less without disruption during the pandemic.\nThis has continued through the third quarter.\nHaving said that, the pandemic has impacted us in a few ways, including our ability to present new sales and marketing ideas such as new products face to face with customers in the field.\nWe have also seen customer buying patterns that appear to have been moderated in the face of pandemic-related uncertainties.\nOn the other hand, the same restrictions have caused us to spend less on operating expenses.\nThese marketplace changes have been challenging to manage.\nHowever, we have succeeded in maintaining a profitable performance throughout this difficult period.\nWith regard to our financial performance for the three months ended September 30th, 2020, the Company's net sales decreased by 6% to $117 million as compared to sales of $125 million this time last year.\nWithin that overall decline, our US sales were down about $7.5 million and our international sales were flat.\nInternational sales accounted for 43% of net -- of total net sales as compared to 41% of net sales this time last year.\nThe main factors driving our third quarter sales performance are as follows.\nIn our US crop market, sales were affected by reduced cotton acres, which according to USDA statistics, are down about 11% or 1.5 million acres in 2020.\nAcres were impacted by cotton commodity prices that are down, driving growers to plant alternative crops.\nOur market performance has also been impacted by extreme drought conditions in West Texas and frequent hurricanes in the Southeast USA, both affecting grower ability to apply our products.\nOn a plus note, we saw a stronger than expected demand for our fumigant products, which are sold into the potato markets.\nThe better than expected performance is attributed to cautious reopening on schools and restaurants across the United States.\nIn our domestic non-crop market, there were small quarter-over-quarter changes with some decline on our pest strip products which are used in bars and restaurants that were impacted by pandemic restrictions.\nWith regard to international sales, which were overall flat, there were really three factors.\nFirst, we had a very strong performance in Mexico, Central America and Australia.\nBy contrast, our Brazilian sales were down in real terms as a result of reduced insect pressure and challenges getting in front of customers because of pandemic restrictions.\nIn addition sales translated from local currency to US dollars were further negatively impacted by a decline in local currency exchange rates quarter-over-quarter.\nFinally, whereas we saw Mocap and Nemacur sales lower in Europe, both products recorded significant sales increases in other parts of the world.\nAs you can see from the table, the US crop market was where we recorded reduced sales.\nThis is pretty much in line with other market participants that have reported Q3 results.\nOur international business increased as a percentage of consolidated net sales and our comparatively low exposure to foreign currency rate movements was a strength for the quarter.\nWith regard to the nine-month performance, the various market dynamics described for the quarter are broadly the same.\nOur US crop business was impacted by reduced cotton acres and by growers making cautious decisions with regard to input as the pandemic gradually revealed its impacts.\nAs an offset, we have done a bit better than expected with fumigants as schools and restaurants reopened.\nAnd in addition, we've had the benefit of sales of products acquired in the fall of 2019.\nOur non-crop business in mosquito control has been a little lower than we hoped given the storm intensity impacting our main markets, mainly due to vector control districts using existing inventory.\nFinally, our international sales have performed well, given the challenges with currency devaluation in some of our key markets.\nMoving now to cover our gross profit performance.\nFor both the quarter and the year-to-date, the trends are fairly similar.\nIn our US crop business the drop in gross profit was driven by our lower sales of cotton products and partially offset by strong fumigant sales.\nIn non-crop, the impact of reduced sales of Dibrom and pest strips were negative for the quarter and was somewhat offset by strong sales in our horticultural business which has slightly lower margins.\nDuring the quarter, we also recorded higher royalty income on our Envance technology business.\nFor the international business, the decline in foreign exchange rates was offset entirely in the three-month period and to a lesser degree in the nine-month period by strong performances in Central America, Australia and Mexico.\nAs a result of these various dynamics, gross margin performance in the quarter reduced from 38% to 37% and for the nine-month period from 39% to 38%.\nFor the quarter, our manufacturing performance was strong with factory operating cost well controlled and activity improved as compared to 2019.\nGenerally speaking, over the long term our net factory costs amount to about 2.5% of net sales, reflecting some latent capacity in our plants should the need arise.\nThis kind of available capacity is necessary to help manage our production planning effectively.\nIn the third quarter our factories cost approximately 2.4% of sales as compared to 2% this time last year.\nThe third quarter is typically a strong manufacturing period for the Company.\nFor the first nine months, the net factory costs amounted to 1.6% as compared to 2.4% of net sales for the same period of 2019.\nFor the three months ended September 30th, 2020, our operating expenses decreased as compared to the same period of the prior year.\nThe underlying performance is greater than its parent from the published statements because in 2019 we benefited from an adjustment to earn out liabilities on past acquisition.\nThat benefit did not recur this year.\nOn the other hand, we did record a benefit of approximately $1 million during the third quarter because we completed an update to our environmental risk assessment related to the Brazilian business we acquired at the start of 2019 which led to a decrease in our liability in this regard.\nAs we have reported for prior periods this year, our operating expenses were reduced because travel and entertainment costs were lower as a result of pandemic restrictions in all jurisdictions in which we operate.\nOur costs were also reduced because of the translation effect caused by devaluation of currencies that are important for the Company, including the Mexican, Brazilian and Australian currencies.\nWith regard to the nine-month period ended September 30th, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019, our overall expenses have reduced.\nThe reported reduction actually understates the real improvement because in 2019 we benefited from adjustments to earn out liabilities related to past acquisitions in the amount of $3.5 million that did not recur this year.\nAs a result, our underlying costs are down approximately $5.5 million or 5% for the nine months.\nThe drivers of the reduced costs are similar to the quarter.\nWe have spent less on travel and entertainment because of pandemic restrictions.\nBoth short and long-term incentive compensation is tied to financial performance and has reduced in 2020 compared to 2019.\nFinally, operating expenses incurred in currencies other than the US dollar are reduced as a result of the devaluation of those currencies I have already mentioned.\nI've mentioned adverse exchange rate movements in three key currencies for the from the Company's perspective.\nI want to put some color on that comment.\nIf we had used the 2019 exchange rates for both the three and nine-month periods of 2020, our reported net sales would have increased for the three months by $3 million and for the nine months by $7 million.\nWhen looking at gross margin, we would have recorded additional gross margin of $700,000 in the three-month period and $1.7 million year-to-date.\nNotwithstanding these impacts we have been effective at putting in place some natural hedges.\nThat is that the majority of our operating expenses for the businesses in territory are also in local currency.\nThat mitigates the impact on sales and gross margin leaving relatively immaterial differences at the bottom line resulting from translation exposure.\nThe Company experienced some significant transactional related exposures during the first quarter of the year.\nThis has reduced as exchange rates have settled at new levels during the second and third quarters.\nDuring the third quarter, we recorded lower interest expense than this time last year.\nOur average debt was lower than the prior year and we got a benefit from reduced borrowing rates in the US.\nIn the nine-month period, our average debt was a little higher than the prior year, but we gained the benefit for the lower federal base rate resulting in significantly lower interest expense.\nFinally, our effective tax rate continues to decline in comparison to the prior year as we are having a stronger international performance in jurisdictions with lower rates this year as compared to last year.\nIn the three-month period, we earned $0.10 per share as compared to $0.11 per share in the same period of the prior year.\nFor the nine-month period, we earned $0.25 per diluted share as compared to $0.34 per share last year.\nFrom my perspective, the operating and financial focus of the Company remains as follows.\nWe continue to follow a disciplined approach in planning our factory activities balancing overhead recovery with demand forecasts and inventory levels.\nAt the end of September 2020, our inventories were at $176 million as compared to $186 million this time last year.\nDuring the intervening periods we have made acquisitions and added inventory as a result.\nThe underlying period-over-period improvement in our base inventory before the impact of recent acquisitions amounted to approximately $14 million or 7.5%.\nWe are highly focused on our balance sheet as we navigate through this pandemic period and having lower inventories at this point of the year is pleasing to report.\nAs we look at the final quarter of the year and our target for December 31st, 2020 inventory, Eric will comment in a moment about acquisitions that we closed in the first and second week of the final quarter of this year.\nAs a consequence, our inventory forecast will now be amended to incorporate these new businesses.\nIn previous conference calls, we expected to end in the region of $145 million.\nGiven our latest operations planning assessment, we are expecting that our underlying inventory will increase a little from our prior forecast.\nIn addition, the new acquisitions that Eric will mention in a moment are expected to add approximately $15 million at December 31st, 2020.\nAccordingly, our latest forecast is to end the year at approximately $160 million to $165 million, effectively flat with 2019, but including the addition of inventory from recent acquisitions.\nOur business has a distinct annual cycle and we continue to experience expansion -- and we routinely experience expansion in working capital in the first part of the year and a reversal in the second part.\nDuring 2020 we, like most businesses, have been highly focused on working capital and its impact on debt levels.\nDuring the period of the year when we typically expand working capital, we have contained the increase to only $5 million as compared to adding $49 million in the same period of 2019.\nThis careful management of working capital is driving the improved cash generated from our operating activities.\nIn the first nine months of 2020 we have generated $19 million from operations as compared to using $21 million in the first nine months of 2019.\nComparatively that amounts to a positive change of $40 million period-over-period.\nAt September 30th, 2020 net indebtedness ended at $149 million as compared to $165 million this time last year.\nDuring the last year, in addition to paying down $16 million in debt, we have funded more than $27 million in investments, including fixed assets, product acquisitions and technology investments from the cash generated from operations.\nThese investments are focused on developing our consolidated business for the future.\nWith regard to liquidity at the end of the third quarter, availability under our credit line was $45 million, which compares to $30 million at the same point in 2019.\nIn summary, for the third quarter and for the nine-month period though our sales were down, selling prices and gross margins in each territory remained good.\nWe are seeing a stronger international performance than this year and the mix of US sales, generally higher gross margin, and international sales, generally lower gross margin, is tending to bring the average down slightly.\nOur factory performance improved compared to 2019 and our expenses for operating costs, interest and tax are all lower in 2020 than in the comparable periods of the prior year.\nFrom a balance sheet and cash perspective, we are doing very well, managing working capital and our debt is lower than this time last year, notwithstanding our investments in long-term growth of our business.\nFinally, availability under our credit line has improved.\nWith that I will hand over to Eric.\nMany of our investors have expressed an interest in our strategic direction and longer-term prospects, particularly in light of our increased emphasis on technology innovation.\nIn that spirit then, rather than getting into the weeds on market conditions over the past reporting periods, I would like to look forward to where we hope to be in the next three to five years.\nWe have three primary growth platforms within our business, our core business, our green product lines, and our precision application technology led by SIMPAS.\nThere are synergies between these platforms.\nFor example, SIMPAS is a market access tool for both core products and green solutions such as Agrinos biologicals.\nAlso there is some overlap between these platforms.\nBut for directional purposes, it is useful to take each platform in order.\nOur core business consists largely of our synthetic chemistries.\nUsing 2019 numbers as a reference, let's build a model using a baseline of annual sales of $468 million.\nWe have grown our core business in three ways; first, organically, that is through additional market penetration; second through our new product pipeline, that is making new formulations or getting new users for what we already have; and third, through acquisitions.\nIf we were to grow at a rate of only 2% per year, we should be at $507 million by year three and $527 million by year five in organic growth.\nLet's add to that our new product pipeline.\nWe regularly introduce several new products per year.\nFor example, in 2020 alone, we launched five new formulations.\nAs these new products get traction and we continue adding new introductions, we expect that we will add another $37 million by year three and $109 million by year five.\nThe core business plus new pipeline products puts us at $544 million by year three and $636 million by year five.\nBut now let's add acquisitions.\nIt's hard to predict the acquisition market, but I can say that it is extremely active today.\nAs you may have read, we just completed two acquisitions; Agrinos, a biologicals company that I will talk about further in a moment and AgNova, an Australian company that gives us greater critical mass and market access in Australia and the surrounding region.\nIf out of conservatism, we cut that number in half to $20 million per year and extrapolate it forward, we find that our incremental acquisition growth that put us at $60 million by year three and $100 million by year five.\nThe core business plus new product pipeline acquisitions puts us at a three-year top line target of $604 million and a five-year target of $736 million.\nNow let's turn to our green solutions platform.\nBefore we get back to the model, I would like to bring you current on a recent acquisition.\nIn early October, we acquired the shares of Agrinos, Inc. and its sister companies at a very favorable price as they were being sold in an auction by the Norwegian parent in a liquidation process.\nAgrinos makes and markets unique blends of biological products into many markets and operates three factories.\nThe first located in Oregon ferments [Phonetic] a 22-species consortium of bacteria into an end-use product that enhances soil health and plant growth by, for example, increasing nitrogen update.\nThe second located in Mexico produces a microbially enhanced tightened base product that tightens a calciferous substance comes from shells of shrimps that are locally grown that has similar applications.\nThe third located in India producers biologicals for that region, including sales to the Government of India.\nWith this investment, we have created a biologicals team to manage these green product offering globally.\nThat effort will also include our management of the advanced TyraTech business.\nSo, let's get back to the model.\nNow, admittedly some of the green solution businesses are already included in our core business.\nFor purposes of this discussion, we will focus on the incremental addition.\nThrough the end of the third quarter of 2020, we had already been on track to sell approximately $22 million in green products this year, including biologicals, bio-nutritional products through both our domestic and international businesses and essential oil products through Envance which are the active ingredients in Procter & Gamble's Zevo line of consumer products.\nLet's use that number as a baseline for our green products platform.\nAnd as mentioned, we are already in the consumer pest control space through the P&G's Zevo product line and we are expanding our essential oil product line into other areas, including lawn and garden, crop and public and animal health.\nWe expect that with the addition of Agrinos, the growth of our other biologicals and the expansion of Envance/TyraTech we should see incremental revenues in year three of $48 million and in year five of $118 million.\nLet's take our prior graph of core, including product pipeline and acquisitions and now add green products.\nThat would take us to about $70 million in year three and $140 million in year five.\nNow for the third platform, namely precision application.\nWe have been reporting regularly about our SIMPAS technology which we believe is at leading edge of prescriptive application systems.\nWe know of no other system that enables a grower to take an agronomist's prescription for multiple crop inputs based upon field conditions and prior-yield results and apply those products variably in multiple rose automatically in one path.\nFurther with our Ultimus technology, we can trance product from factory to field and as important, we can measure precisely what was used in any given application.\nAnd now, we are enhancing this technology to permit seed treatment at time of plant.\nAfter seeing positive results from field trials by growers in many states, a number of our peers are performing their own tests with the goal of making their products available in smart cartridges through SIMPAS.\nThat said, some investors are asking that we give them a better idea of where SIMPAS could be in three to five years.\nIn order to answer the question, we will consider the following elements; first, revenues from our existing portfolio of products, and I'm talking about increased users which would be dramatically enhanced by applied prescriptively; second, revenues from the sale of active ingredients, licensed from other basic producers to be sold under RNA; third, royalties from third parties for marketing their products through our smart cartridges under their name; and fourth, a share in the growers' incremental yield benefit.\nUsing conservative estimates of market penetration and domestic markets only, we are targeting top line contribution on the order of $35 million in year three and $131 million in year five.\nIn addition, we are confident that SIMPAS will be well received outside the US and are already planning to host SIMPAS field trials in Brazil in 2021.\nAlso, these figures do not include the potential for additional revenues from our seed treatment innovation.\nIn other words, these are conservative, domestic, in-furrow SIMPAS targets only.\nLet's put all of the platforms together.\nIf we add Core plus Green plus SIMPAS we are in the neighborhood of $687 million in year three and $985 million in year five at the top line which is roughly double where we are today.\nThere are many moving parts of the equation.\nWe will continue to control the things that are within our control.\nFor example, exercising strict discipline on managing working capital and operating expenses.\nFurther, we are committed to maximizing our consolidated profit margin.\nWhile our expansion into distribution within international markets has tended to lower our gross margin percentage, we expect that the introduction of newer technologies across these markets will create an updraft on profitability.\nIn future calls,I will be updating you on how we are progressing against those targets.\nFinally, let me pull our focus to the present and the near term.\n2020 has been an unprecedented year for this industry.\nIn spite of the pandemic, weather effects and farm economy as David mentioned, we have kept pace with Q3 of 2019 in terms of profitability, even with modestly lower sales.\nLooking forward into the fourth quarter, we are already seeing greater optimism in the domestic agricultural sector, hurt in part by rising crop commodity prices for corn and soybeans and cotton which would tend to contribute to improved grower profitability.\nIn the Midwest with less crop rotation and more continuous corn over corn planting, we are beginning to see a resurgence of soil insect pressure.\nIn addition, demand for our soil fumigant products continues to rise.\nBased upon these trends and current sales activity, we are encouraged by our prospects for the balance of this year and into the 2021 season.\nWe'll now take any questions you may have.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Please note that the financial results to be presented in this commentary are preliminary.\nThese and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors and the MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings.\nLexington's business provides us the exposure to a critical growth area in the alternative asset business, and we cannot be happier with this new partnership.\nWe will cover on this transaction in a few minutes.\nI'll start by reviewing this year's milestones.\nThen Matt will go through our financial results for the quarter and the fiscal year, as well as spend some time discussing today's important transaction in greater detail.\nThroughout Franklin Templeton history we have invested in our business to build a truly diversified and resilient organization that performs across market cycles with a commitment to serving our clients, employees and shareholders.\nThe results that we announced today represent the first full fiscal year since we closed the Legg Mason acquisition, a transformational transaction that created a more balanced business across asset classes, client mix and geographies.\nWe are pleased to report that the strategic and financial benefits from our acquisition of Legg Mason exceeded our goals, and we have added important growth opportunities.\nWe have maintained our culture while invigorating collaboration and innovation across the firm.\nThrough the hard work and dedication of our employees we've successfully brought two firms together to maximize our collective potential, one that successfully combines the attributes of global strength with boutique specialization.\nWe've made strong progress, and yet in so many ways, we're just getting started.\nTurning to investment performance, there's been an improvement in performance across a broad base of investment strategies.\nThrough September, 71%, 69%, 72% and 77% of strategy composites outperformed their respective benchmarks across the four key time periods.\nDuring the year, we focused on updating our global distribution efforts by enhancing our generalist, specialist model, reshaping client coverage and deepening relationships in each sales region, particularly with the largest global financial institutions.\nFiscal year long-term inflows doubled to $365 billion from the prior year, notably, the U.S., which is our largest sales region with over $1.1 trillion in AUM was net flow positive for the year.\nIn terms of notable organic growth, we saw positive net flows in our core growth areas, including alternatives, SMAs, wealth management and ESG-specific strategies.\nWe executed important acquisitions to further grow and diversify our business in alternative assets, customization and distribution of investment strategies.\nIn terms of other accomplishments, our alternative asset strategies, an important area of focus for us, generated positive net flows in each quarter during the year and grew by 19% from the prior year to $145 billion in AUM with contributions from a diverse group of strategies, including real estate infrastructure, private debt and hedge funds.\nSeveral years ago, we announced our intention to create a full suite of alternative strategies and we've been very deliberate in building our capabilities.\nIn 2018, the acquisition of Benefit Street Partners brought us a leading alternative credit manager.\nIn 2020, we added a world-class real estate manager with Clarion Partners.\nThis focus on alternative led us to today's announcement of the acquisition of Lexington Partners, a leader in secondary private equity and co-investments.\nWe now have top tier specialist investment managers in all of the key alternative categories, with Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners, Franklin Venture Partners, K2 and now Lexington Partners.\nSpecifically with the Lexington Partners transaction I'm excited that Franklin will be partnering with such an outstanding firm that is led by an experienced and talented team, immediately bringing a scale and capabilities in an interactive and growing global market.\nThere will be no changes to the team or its independent investment management process, and they will continue to operate autonomously as Lexington Partners.\nUpon the close of this transaction, we expect our alternative AUM to approach approximately $200 billion and over $1 billion in revenue, excluding performance fees.\nMatt will review the additional details of the transaction shortly.\nAnother core growth area is our separately managed account business.\nWe are a top three provider in SMAs with $125 billion in assets under management, which is one of the fastest growing segments in retail.\nOur SMA business grew by 22% in AUM year-over-year and generated positive net flows in each quarter during the fiscal year.\nOur recently announced acquisition of O'Shaughnessy Asset Management and its Custom Indexing Platform, Canvas, will take our existing strength in SMAs to the next level, enhancing our tax management factor-based and ESG customization capabilities.\nCanvas was launched in late 2019 and has seen strong growth since its inception and now represents $1.9 billion of the firm's total AUM of $6.3 billion as of September 30.\nThe transaction will bring compelling benefits to the clients that both companies serve across multiple channels.\nThere's no question that investors are more focused on ESG goals than ever before.\nIncreasingly, there are three dimensions to ESG that investors consider; ESG factors as understood risks in a portfolio, how ESG contributes to overall returns, and the overall impact of ESG considerations to society and the environment.\nAs an active manager approximately 95% of our AUM represents strategies that consider ESG factors as part of the investment process and ESG specific strategies representing over $200 billion in AUM were net flow positive in each quarter this fiscal year.\nAll this being said, none of our accomplishments this past year would be possible if it weren't for our employees.\nWe're extremely fortunate to have such dedicated colleagues who are focused on achieving investment excellence, fostering enduring relationships and delivering superior service to our broad range of investors around the globe.\nFourth quarter long-term net outflows were $9.9 million, which were partially offset by the acquisition of Diamond Hill's high yield focused U.S. corporate credit mutual funds, which added $3.5 billion in AUM and closed in July.\nThis quarter included the previously disclosed $5.4 billion 529 plan redemption, which included $4.7 billion of long-term assets and $2 billion fixed income, institutional redemption that have minimal impact to revenue and $800 million of fixed income outflows from the non-management fee, earning India credit funds that are in the process of liquidation.\nReinvested dividends were $2.3 billion in this quarter.\n1% higher average assets under the management of $1.55 trillion compared to the prior quarter, plus $69 million of performance fees generated $1.66 billion in adjusted revenue for the fourth quarter.\nInvestment management fees, excluding performance fees was 3% higher compared to the prior quarter.\nAdjusted operating expenses of $1.01 billion for the quarter were 3% lower due to lower compensation and lower G&A as a result of last quarter's upfront closed-end fund expenses.\nThis led to an 80% increase in adjusted operating income of $647 million and an adjusted operating margin of 39%.\nFourth quarter adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 31% to $645 million, or $1.26 per share.\nThese results include favorable discrete tax items of $135 million or $0.30 per share for the quarter.\nTurning to 2021 fiscal year financial results, which benefited from favorable market conditions and a full year of Legg Mason versus two months last year.\nFor the full year, adjusted revenues were $6.32 billion and adjusted operating expenses were $3.94 billion, an increase of 63% and 65% respectively.\nThis led to fiscal year adjusted operating income of $2.38 billion, which was 60% higher compared to the prior year.\nOur adjusted operating margin was 37.7%.\nCompared to the prior year, fiscal year adjusted net income increased 46% to $1.92 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 43% to $3.74 per share, which included the impact of favorable discrete tax items of $175 million or $0.34 per share for the full year.\nAs planned, we have achieved a run rate of 85% of our targeted merger-related cost synergies of $300 million this year.\nWe anticipate that 100% of these synergies will be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2022.\nAs a reminder, none of these cost efficiencies involved our specialist investment managers or our investment teams.\nMoving on to capital management, we believe our strong balance sheet continues to provide us with financial and strategic flexibility to evolve our business.\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, we returned $782 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nDuring the year, we also pre-financed a large portion of legacy Legg Mason debt with lower cost of debt, reflecting our credit profile.\nSpecifically, we issued $850 million of 1.6% senior notes due 2030 and $350 million, 2.95% notes due 2051.\nWe redeemed $250 million of 6.38% Legg Mason Junior subordinated notes due 2056 on March 15, 2021, and $500 million of 5.45% Legg Mason Junior subordinated notes due 2056 on September 15 2021.\nWe ended the quarter with $6.93 billion of cash and investments.\nWe will continue to prioritize our dividend and intend to repurchase enough shares to at least offset our employee equity grants.\nThe remainder of our capacity will focus on continued investments in our business and acquisitions to further diversify and increase our sources of cash flow, while positioning our firm for new growth opportunities as the industry continues to evolve.\nAs outlined in the transaction summary document, Lexington Partners is a global leader in secondary private equity and co-investments with current fee based AUM of $34 billion.\nSince its founding in 1994, Lexington has raised over $55 billion in aggregate capital commitments and currently has a team of 135 employees across eight global offices.\nIt is expected to generate revenue of approximately $350 million and EBITDA of approximately $150 million in 2022.\nWith this acquisition, we now have strong and complementary capabilities in alternative credit, real estate, hedge fund solutions and PE related activities.\nGiven the overall size and growth of private equity and the likelihood of further private market expansion, having a specialist investment manager tied to this sector alternative assets is a logical step in the diversification of our business.\nFurthermore, providing access to diversified versions of high returning investments will continue to increase in importance to meet savings and retirement goals of our broad group of clients.\nThis could also be important in both our multi-asset solutions business and the continued development of our customization capabilities.\nAs Jenny mentioned earlier, this transaction takes us one important step further in creating a larger and more diversified alternative asset business that will result in pro forma fiscal year 2022 alternative asset AUM of approximately $200 billion, producing approximately $1 billion in annual management fee revenue, excluding performance fees at a margin of approximately 40%.\nWe intend to continue adding complementary business in both wealth management and asset management, including asset class and geographic expansion.\nThis will be both organic investment through allocating capital into our existing specialist investment managers and via acquisitions.\nGiven our global reach, financial flexibility, business model and experience in execution, we're able to attract highly talented teams and partnerships, looking for a combination of independence, support and collaboration on a global and local scale to create new growth opportunities in what is a very large and expanding segment of the asset management industry.\nTurning to financial terms of the transaction, we're acquiring 100% Lexington Partners for $1 billion in cash at closing plus a further $750 million in cash over the next three years.\nWe have also structured this transaction to ensure continuity and strong alignment of interest with Lexington's clients, partners and employees over the long-term.\nConsistent with this, we will be simultaneously issuing grants equal to 25% of Lexington to employees of Lexington, subject to five year vesting and establishing a performance based cash retention pool of $338 million to be paid over the next five years.\nThe transaction is expected to close by the end of our fiscal second quarter, subject to customary approvals.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon them.\nWe refer you to B&G Foods' most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact our company's future operating results and financial condition.\nBruce will then discuss our financial results for the third quarter, as well as expectations for 2021.\nThe company's performance in the third quarter was strong.\nBase business net sales, which excludes Crisco, grew at plus 9.2% versus the same period two years ago, accelerating from plus 7% in Q2.\nWith the addition of Crisco, our Q3 2021 net sales are ahead of last year's COVID period.\nBruce will talk categories and brands later, but we are generally seeing strength across the portfolio.\nMost of our key categories performed well when compared to 2019's pre-pandemic third quarter results.\nNet sales of Green Giant and spices & seasonings were up double digits compared to 2019.\nNet sales of Ortega and Las Palmas are two leading Mexican food brands, were up high single digits compared to 2019.\nOur baking brands also had a strong performance for the quarter compared to 2019, led by Crisco, Clabber Girl, Baker's Joy, etcetera.\nWhile demand was strong, resulting in elevated sales.\nWe are also managing through many of the same challenges to supply chain and costs that have plagued the industry.\nInflation in full year 2021 is in the mid single digits, with the second half increasing to a double digit increase across the portfolio.\nAs discussed last call, inflation on Crisco is significantly higher than the base portfolio, given the major increases in soybean and canola oil.\nWe have responded with significant price increases, where appropriate raising list prices and or optimizing trade to directly offset higher input costs.\nWhile we did accurately to identify and address inflationary pressures, the majority of our price increases are effective in the second half, with the largest increase on Crisco effective at the end of September.\nWe project continued inflationary pressure into first half 2022 and we'll price to recover year-over-year cost increases.\nAdditionally, we're driving aggressive cost optimization efforts to offset continued inflation.\nFrom a supply standpoint, we continue to deal with shortages in packaging materials, freight delays and contract manufacturing capacity.\nHowever, overall customer service levels are improving in recent weeks, aided by lifting allocations on Green Giant SKU with the new crop pack.\nOur goal is to manage our business to stable steady margins.\nFor the current portfolio, the goal is roughly an 18% adjusted EBITDA margin, with pricing and productivity actions recovering cost pressures on margins.\nLonger term, our goal is to improve to a 20% adjusted EBITDA margin with a creative M&A, efficiencies and some base business organic growth.\nIn the near term, inflation will make that more challenging, but we believe that is the right target for this business.\nDuring the third quarter, we successfully completed the integration of Crisco.\nAnd I want to congratulate our team for a smooth transition.\nCrisco is our second largest acquisition, and we are happy with the performance year to date under our ownership, despite some volatility in commodity prices.\nIn August, we also announced that we reached an agreement to sell our Portland, Maine manufacturing facility.\nWe expect the sale to close during Q1 2022.\nWhile shutting a factory is never an easy decision, it became clear the 100 year old Portland facility had reached the end of its useful life and was no longer cost competitive.\nThe site will become the future home of the Roux Institute at Northeastern University, which is a great outcome for the Portland community.\nWe also continue to make investments in our existing facilities, including a new high tech automated line in the Ankeny, Iowa spices and seasonings facility, as well as new lines that are Hurlock, Maryland and Yadkinville North Carolina facilities to increase our capacity for Ortega Taco Sauces and Taco Shells respectively.\nSo finally, after four months in the business, I wanted to share the key priorities and choices that we -- the B&G team are laser focused on.\nFirst, managing B&G Foods effectively through the current inflationary and pricing environment; second, improving organic growth performance beyond COVID recovery; third, focusing on brands and categories where we have the capabilities, scale and right to win in terms of both resources and structure; fourth, making disciplined acquisitions that are creative to our portfolio; and with our core expertise in centre store dry distribution;, and fifth, accelerating cost savings and productivity efforts to eliminate non value added costs and strengthen margins, so more to come on those in future calls and discussions, including specific plans and updates.\nAs Casey mentioned, we had a strong financial performance during our third quarter, despite a very challenging operating environment.\nNet sales continue to be elevated and are tracking closely to the initial set of assumptions that we used to create our annual budget for fiscal 2021.\nSimilar to our plan for the year, we are showing an acceleration in net sales growth, as we go through the year when compared to last year, and our pre pandemic 2019 numbers.\nAs we continue to work our way through the balance of the year, we are approaching a period that we expect to be more similar to last year still not quite normal, with more Americans eating at home more frequently than they did pre-pandemic, but also no longer laughing the height of the pantry loading that coincided with the early days of the pandemic.\nThe result is that, after adjusting for the impact of Crisco, and the impact of an extra week in last year's third quarter, we not only have a net sales increase compared to 2018.\nBut we also have sales trends that are much more similar to those during last year's COVID-19 enhanced third quarter.\nSeparately, but not entirely unrelated industrywide supply chain challenges, and input cost inflation has served to catch some of the upside that we would otherwise be seeing as a result of this robust demand.\nFor some of our brands, this means that sales could be higher, absent out of stocks for certain items.\nFor many of our brands, we have the sales, but margins are challenged relative to what we typically expect from a portfolio.\nInput cost across our portfolio generally continue to be up mid-single digits for most products with extreme cases for certain products like soybean, and canola oils, transportation, and napkins which are all up double digits.\nAnd like virtually everybody in the food manufacturing industry, we are aggressively increasing price where appropriate, plus cutting costs were possible to protect profitability and ensure the long term viability of our margin structure.\nNow, for the third quarter 2021 highlights.\nWe reported net sales of $515 million adjusted EBITDA before COVID-19 expenses of $96.4 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $96.2 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share $0.55.\nAdjusted EBITDA both before and after COVID-19 expenses, as a percentage of net sales was 18.7%.\nNet sales of $550 million was up $19.2 million, or 3.9% from Q3 2020, up $108.7 million, or 26.7% from pre-pandemic 2019.\nCrisco which we acquired in December 2020 generated $71.2 million of net sales in Q3 2021 ahead of our forecast for the quarter, and well ahead of our understanding of 2018 net sales for the same time period under prior ownership.\nBased business net sales, which primarily excludes Crisco decreased by $52.1 million, or 10.5%, in the third quarter of 2021, when compared to the third quarter of 2020.\nAs a reminder, when comparing to our previous performance in our base portfolio Q3 2020 not only included COVID-19 enhanced sales, but also the benefit of an extra week due the timing of our 53rd week in 2020, which we estimate benefited net sales for the third quarter of 2020 by approximately $35 million.\nThe negative comparisons to 2020 are driven by a decline of $68.5 million in unit volume, which is offset in part by $14.5 million benefit from an increase net pricing, inclusive of list price increases trade spend optimization, and a little bit of mix.\nForeign exchange added $1.9 million of benefit.\nOn a year-to-date basis, the cumulative benefit of net pricing index is approximately $27.3 million.\nBase business net sales, which primarily excludes Crisco were up 9.2% compared to 2019, representing a two-year compound annual growth rate of 4.5% over our pre-pandemic net sales.\nOur base business net sales growth in the third quarter of this year represents continued sequential acceleration in growth versus 2019, relative to our performance in this year's first and second quarters.\nWe generated adjusted EBITDA of $96.2 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $8.4 million or 8.1% when compared to the prior year period, but an increase of $10 million, or 11.5% compared to 2019.\nThe decrease in adjusted EBITDA versus Q3 2020 was largely driven by the reduction in base business volumes coupled with increases in input costs, including materially higher costs for raw materials, factory labor and other costs, transportation and warehouse spending, and one fewer reporting week.\nThese costs were offset in part by locking in prices through short term supply chain contracts, advanced commodities purchase agreements, implementing cost savings initiatives, coupled with lowest price increases, trade spend optimization and the addition of Crisco to the portfolio.\nAdjusted diluted per share was $0.55 in Q3 2021 compared to $0.74 per share in Q3, 2020 and $0.54 per share in Q3 2019.\nThe majority of our key brands had declined the net sales when comparing Q3 2021 to Q3 2020.\nHowever, approximately two-thirds of the decline resulted from one fewer recording week of net sales in Q3 2021 versus Q3 2020.\nThe majority of our brands had substantial increases in net sales when comparing Q3 2021 to Q3 2019.\nIn some cases, for brands like Ortega, and our spices and seasonings business, which were up compared to 2019 the upside was kept by limitations on production.\nIn other cases, for brands like back to nature and New York style, supply chain constraints resulted in declines in net sales when compared to prior years.\nNet sales of Ortega were $37.6 million in the third quarter of 2021 represent an increase of $1.6 million or 4.2% compared to the third quarter of 2020 and an increase of $2.6 million or 7.3% when compared to the third quarter of 2019.\nIf we had unlimited manufacturing capacity, net sales growth for Ortega would have been even higher.\nDemand for Ortego taco sauce, taco shells, taco seasonings and salsa remain very strong.\nAnd as Casey said previously, this is a category and a brand that we will continue to invest in and where we believe that our recently added capacity for sauce, Shells and seasonings will lead to increased performance in 2022.\nNet sales of Las Palmas were $9.1 million in the third quarter of 2021, representing an increase of $2.5 million or 37.1%, when compared to the third quarter of 2020, and an increase of point $6 million, or 7.3%, when compared to the third quarter of 2019.\nLast year Las Palmas was an early harbinger of the industry wide supply chain lows that we continue to see today.\nAnd as you may recall, that last year at this time, we were unable to fully meet demand for a tomato sauces.\nOur Las Palmas issues have fortunately been resolved this year, which helps to account for the large increase versus Q3 2020.\nSpices & Seasonings continues to be one of the leading drivers of our portfolio.\nNet sales of our spices and seasonings including our legacy brands such as accent and Dash, and the brands that we acquired in 2016, such as Tones and Weber were approximately $92.9 million, a little bit less than 20% of our total company net sales for the quarter.\nNet sales of spices & seasonings were down by approximately $14 million or 13.1% compared to Q3 2020.\nThe shortfall is driven primarily by capacity constraints, as demand outran our supply and manufacturing capacity.\nWhile this phenomenon is getting better, and we expect will be alleviated in part by some additional capacity that we have coming on in the fourth quarter of this year or in early 2022, we are also lapping a massive quarter for spices & seasonings in last year's third quarter.\nWhen comparing Q3 2019, net sales of spices & seasonings were quite strong and increased by approximately $10.3 million or 12.5%.\nWe are now largely through the 2021 pack season, and fully caught off on supply for Green Giant.\nThe result is an acceleration of performance beginning in the second half of the third quarter and continuing today.\nGreen Giant generated net sales of $141.2 million in the third quarter of 2021, which well down $17 million or 10.7% when compared to Q3 2020 is up $20.9 million or 17.4% when compared to Q3 2019.\nAssuming a healthy holiday season in November and December, we expect continued strength for Green Giant net sales through the fourth quarter of this year.\nAmong our other large brands, Maple Grove Farms, which generated $20.2 million in net sales for the quarter was down $0.5 million or 2.4% compared to Q3 2020 and up $2.7 million or 15.3% compared to Q3 2019.\nSimilarly, Cream of Wheat, which generated $15.2 million in net sales for the quarter was down $1.2 million or 7.4% from Q3 2020, but up $1.2 million or 8.5% compared to Q3 2019.\nWe generated $105.7 million in gross profit for the third quarter of 2021 or 20.5% of net sales.\nExcluding the negative impact of a $14.1 million accrual for the estimated present value of a multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liability that we expect to incur upon the closing of our Portland manufacturing facility and $2.8 million of acquisition, divestiture related in non-recurring expenses, including cost of goods sold during the third quarter of 2021, gross profit would have been $122.6 million or 23.8% of net sales.\nGross profit was $136 million for the third quarter of 2020 or 27.4% of net sales, excluding the impact of $0.1 million of acquisition divestiture-related and non-recurring expenses, included in cost of goods sold during the third quarter of 2020, gross profit would have been $136.1 million or 27.5% of net sales.\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, gross profit was negatively impacted by higher than expected input cost inflation, including materially increased costs for raw materials, factory expenses and transportation.\nWe have attempted to mitigate the impact of inflation on gross profits by locking in prices for short-term supply contracts and advanced commodities purchases agreements, and by implementing cost savings measures.\nAs discussed earlier on the call, we also executed list price increases and reduced trade promotions for certain products.\nThe short term result is that margins have been pressed -- impressed relative.\nSo we expect business to generate in the short-term.\nAnd while this trend may continue into our fourth quarter and early 2022, we do expect our efforts to return to business to its historic margin profile over time.\nSelling general and administrative expenses were $46.4 million for the quarter or 9% of net sales.\nThis compares to $43.4 million, or 8.8% for the prior year, and $38.1 million or 9.4% in the third quarter of 2019.\nThe dollar increase in SG&A compared to a year ago levels is almost entirely driven by a $3.5 million increase in warehousing costs coupled with $3.3 million incremental acquisition related and non-recurring expenses, which primarily relate to the acquisition and integration of the Crisco brand and the sale of our Portland facility.\nThe increase in warehousing costs was primarily driven by the Crisco acquisition and customer finds relative to COVID-19 shortages and delays.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we generated $96.4 million in adjusted EBIT DA before COVID-19 expenses, and $96.2 million in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2021.\nThis compared to adjusted EBITDA of $104.6 million in Q3, 2020, and $86.2 million in Q3 2018.\nInterest expense for the quarter was $26.6 million, compared to $26.4 million in the third quarter last year.\nThe primary driver of the increase in interest expense was the acquisition of Crisco, which, as you may recall, was financed in its entirety with a combination of revolver draw and incremental term loans.\nThe revolver currently costs us a little less than 2% in interest, and the term loans a little less than two or three quarters percent.\nDepreciation and amortization are also up year-over-year driven primarily by Crisco.\nDepreciation expense was $15.3 million in the third quarter of 2021, compared to $10.9 million in last year's third quarter.\nAmortization expense was $5.4 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to $4.7 million in last year's third quarter.\nWe are tracking to an effective tax rate of approximately 26% to 26.5% for the year, with taxes a little higher and this year's third quarter, due to some discrete tax items at an effective rate of 26.8% for the quarter compared to 24.7% in last year's third quarter.\nWe generated $0.55 in adjusted diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of 2021 compared to $0.74 per share in Q3, 2020 and $0.54 per share in Q3 2018.\nWe remain encouraged by these trends.\nAnd while adjusted EBITDA margins will remain challenge this year due to higher than expected input cost inflation, including increased cost of raw materials, factory costs, transportation and warehouse costs, we also expect to generate adjusted EBITDA of $358 million to $365 million for the year.\nAlso similar to what we discussed last quarter, we expect the following for full year 2021.\nInterest expense of $105 million to $110 million, including cash interest of $100 million to $105 million, depreciation expense of $60 million to $65 million, amortization expense of $21 million to $22 million, and an effective tax rate of approximately 26% to 26.5%.\nAs I said at the beginning of the call, we had a fairly strong quarter despite lapping elevated COVID-19 demand and an extra week in Q3 2020.\nWe remain on track to deliver the mid to high single digit growth against 2019 that we set as a target for the year, and we continue to implement pricing actions to offset inflation in the portfolio.\nThis concludes our remarks.\nAnd now we would like to begin the Q&A portion of our call.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Today, we will review the third quarter of 2020 and with me on the phone today are Norman Schwartz, our Chief Executive Officer; Ilan Daskal, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Andy Last, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Annette Tumolo, President of the Life Science Group; and Dara Wright, President of the Clinical Diagnostics Group.\nOur actual results may differ materially from these plans and expectations and the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown.\nWe cannot be certain that Bio-Rad's responses to the pandemic will be successful that the demand for Bio-Rad's COVID-19-related products is sustainable or that Bio-Rad will be able to meet this demand.\nOur remarks today will also include references to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted income per share, which are financial measures that are not defined under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\nI'll now turn over the call back to Ilan Daskal, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nNow, before I begin the detailed quarterly discussion, I would like to ask Andy Last, our Chief Operating Officer, to provide an update on Bio-Rad's operations in light of the current pandemic-related environment that we are experiencing globally.\nSo I'd like to take a few minutes to review our current state of operations around the world.\nBefore I begin, we would like to recognize our employees globally who have continued to work above and beyond to serve our customers during the pandemic.\nWe truly appreciate the hard work and dedication across our organization.\nAs a reminder, we have three key areas of focus as we continue to manage through this challenging period, the ongoing safety of our employees, continuing manufacturing operations to ensure product supply and support of our customers, and making sure we make progress on our core strategies.\nWe have now established routine practices around the world to improve employee safety.\nWe have adapted our policies and approaches to local conditions and requirements and are very pleased with the productivity we have been able to achieve.\nWork from home continues where required and for those in our facilities, we are continuing to implement broad safety procedures and we continue to experience minimized case numbers.\nIn the US, we have now implemented a fast turnaround testing solution for suspected cases using a Droplet Digital PCR test and can rapidly deliver results back to an employee.\nThis has enabled us to avoid significant work downtime, summing to over a full-year productivity equivalent so far.\nIn manufacturing, our operations teams continue to be flexible and meeting the demand shifts driven by the pandemic.\nWe have flexed well to meet the high demand for our PCR products which increased in Q3 and we have scaled back where needed, mainly for our Diagnostics products.\nWe are now past the majority of the initial scale-up issues we encountered with supply chain disruption early in the pandemic and believe we are well-positioned to meet future needs.\nLastly, we continue to work on our core initiatives and strategies, in particular in R&D, where we now have all our labs operational.\nNow I would like to review the results of the third quarter.\nNet sales for the third quarter of 2020 were $647.3 million, which is a 15.5% increase on a reported basis versus $560.6 million in Q3 of 2019.\nOn a currency neutral basis, sales increased 14.9%.\nOn a geographic basis, we experienced currency neutral growth across all three regions.\nWe saw a strong demand for products associated with COVID-19 testing and related research.\nHowever, we saw lower demand in the rest of our business.\nOverall in Q3, we have seen a gradual improvement in demand for both our Life Science and Diagnostics products in all regions as compared to Q2.\nGenerally, we are seeing most academic and Diagnostics Labs now running between 70% and 90% capacity and slowly continuing to improve.\nBiopharma labs are broadly running at a slightly higher capacity rate of 80% to 90% and we continue to monitor the situation closely.\nWe estimate that COVID-19-related sales were about $98 million in the quarter.\nSales of the Life Science Group in the third quarter of 2020 were $324 million compared to $215.7 million in Q3 of 2019, which is a 50.2% increase on a reported basis and a 48.8% increase on a currency neutral basis.\nThe majority of the year-over-year growth in the third quarter was driven by our core PCR products, Droplet Digital PCR, and Process Media.\nBoth core PCR and Droplet Digital PCR products revenue increases were largely COVID-19-related.\nProcess Media, which can fluctuate on a quarterly basis saw strong double-digit year-over-year growth in the quarter over the same quarter last year.\nExcluding Process Media sales, the Life Science business grew 53% on a currency neutral basis versus Q3 of 2019.\nGrowth in the overall Life Science segment was offset by continued softness in the academic research demand as these labs around the globe were operating below capacity.\nWe expect a continued gradual increase in lab utilization and are carefully monitoring the situation.\nOn a geographic basis, Life Science currency neutral year-over-year sales grew across all regions.\nWe continue to be encouraged by our Droplet Digital PCR business, which is becoming more broadly adopted in wastewater testing as the gold standard.\nDroplet Digital PCR is now being used at the Environmental Protection Agency, The Water Research Foundation and more than two dozen labs globally for wastewater testing, including the state of Michigan, which is establishing a standardized and co-ordinated network of COVID-19 monitoring systems across the states.\nIn addition, last month we launched two new PCR systems, the CFX Opus 96 and the CFX Opus 384, which strengthens our global response and contribution to the fight against the pandemic.\nWith the launch of the CFX Opus systems, Bio-Rad also introduced access to a cloud-based instrument connectivity, data management, and analysis platform.\nThese new PCR systems, along with our Droplet Digital PCR offering provides a complete solution for our customers.\nSales of Clinical Diagnostics products in the third quarter were $322.2 million compared to $341.8 million in Q3 of 2019, which is a 5.7% decline on a reported basis and a 5.9% decline on a currency neutral basis.\nOn a sequential basis, we experienced improved performance across all regions and product lines and we believe this reflects the recovery of routine testing trends.\nDuring the third quarter, strength in our quality controls products was offset by weakness across the rest of the Diagnostics portfolio.\nAlthough clinical labs have seen a significant negative impact by the pandemic, we are now experiencing a gradual recovery from the trough of Q2 and expect incremental recovery until the end of the year.\nWe will be closely monitoring the potential impact of the recent pandemic resurgence.\nOn a geographic basis, the Diagnostics Group posted declines across all regions.\nThe reported gross margin for the third quarter of 2020 was 56.7% on a GAAP basis and compares to 54.8% in Q3 of 2019.\nThe current gross margin benefited mainly from better product mix, higher manufacturing utilization, and lower service cost, tempered somewhat by higher logistics costs.\nAmortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.8 million compared to $3.9 million in Q3 of 2019.\nSG&A expenses for Q3 of 2020 were $198.2 million or 30.6% of sales compared to $201.6 million or 36% in Q3 of 2019.\nWe continue with cost saving initiatives to reduce our SG&A.\nTotal amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.3 million versus $1.9 million in Q3 of 2019.\nResearch and development expense in Q3 was $59.5 million or 9.2% of sales compared to $47.9 million or 8.6% of sales in Q3 of 2019.\nQ3 operating income was $109.6 million or 16.9% of sales compared to $57.5 million or 10.2% of sales in Q3 of 2019.\nLooking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $1,580 million of income to the reported results, and is substantially related to holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG.\nAlso during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in a net expense of $5.5 million compared to $2.1 million of expense last year.\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.9% compared to 22.8% in Q3 of 2019.\nReported net income for the third quarter was $1,315 million and diluted earnings per share were $43.64.\nThis is an increase from last year and is again substantially related to the changes in the valuation of Sartorius Holdings.\nMoving on to the non-GAAP results.\nLooking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income.\nLooking at the non-GAAP results for the third quarter, in cost of goods sold, we have excluded $4.8 million of amortization of purchased intangibles and a small restructuring benefits.\nThese exclusions moved the gross margin for the third quarter of 2020 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 57.5% versus 56% in Q3 of 2019.\nNon-GAAP SG&A in the third quarter of 2020 was 29.4% versus 35.5% in Q3 of 2019.\nIn SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization of purchased intangibles of $2.3 million, legal related expenses of $6 million and restructuring and acquisition-related benefits of less than $1 million.\nNon-GAAP R&D expense in the third quarter of 2020 was 9.2% versus 8.5% in Q3 of 2019.\nIn R&D, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded negligible restructuring benefits.\nThe cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 16.9% on a GAAP basis to 18.8% on a non-GAAP basis.\nThese non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 of 2019 of 12%.\nWe have also excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius Equity Holdings of 1,580 million and a small loss associated with venture investments.\nThe non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.5% compared to 25.5% in Q3 of 2019.\nThe lower rate this quarter was primarily driven by a change in our geographic mix of earnings and the taxation of our foreign earnings.\nWe now estimate the full year tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 24%.\nAnd finally, non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2020 was $90.3 million or $3 diluted earnings per share compared to $48.6 million and $1.61 per share in Q3 of 2019.\nMoving on to the balance sheet.\nTotal cash and short-term investments at the end of Q3 were $1,160 million, an increase of $123 million from the end of Q2 of 2020.\nDuring the third quarter, our inventory increased by about $12 million from the second quarter of 2020.\nThe increase of inventory in Q3 of 2020 was driven by the continued expectation of higher demand for COVID-19 related products.\nWe expect inventory levels to come down over the next two quarters to three quarters.\nWe plan to use the cash on hand to repay the $425 million of outstanding senior notes in December.\nIn addition, the market value of our holdings in Sartorius AG has increased, which technically may deem us as an investment company under the 1940 Investment Company Act.\nWhile we are working on the resolution, our access to the capital markets may be restricted.\nWe feel that we have adequate resources to effectively run our business in the near term.\nDuring the third quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our stock, we had a total of $273 million available for potential share buybacks.\nFor the third quarter of 2020, net cash generated from operating activities was $135.7 million, which compares to $99.8 million in Q3 of 2019.\nThe adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2020 was 22.9% of sales.\nThe adjusted EBITDA in Q3 of 2019 was 17%.\nNet capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2020 were $20 million and depreciation and amortization for the third quarter was $33.7 million.\nWe project that the full-year capex spend will likely be between $80 million and $90 million.\nMoving on to the guidance.\nWe continue to be uncertain about the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, although we do assume a gradual return to pre-pandemic activity levels and business mix.\nWith that in mind, we currently believe that the full year 2020 year-over-year currency-neutral sales to be up 5.9% to 6.3%.\nWe estimate 27% to 28% currency-neutral revenue growth for Life Science and estimate about 7% currency-neutral revenue decline for the Diagnostics Group in 2020.\nThis assumes that the fourth quarter will see a gradual improvement in non-COVID-19 related product sales and a smaller relative benefit of COVID-19 related product sales versus Q3.\nFull year non-GAAP gross margin is projected to be between 56.5% and 57%.\nR&D is around 9%.\nFull year GAAP operating margin between 16% and 16.5% and full-year adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 21% and 21.5%.\nOur significantly higher operating profit over the last year was driven by discretionary cost control measures and better product mix.\nAs our operations begin to return back to normal, we expect a gradual reversal of these benefits that we experienced in 2020.\nLastly, due to the uncertain nature of the current pandemic we will not host an Investor Day this year and instead look to host it in 2021 when business activity normalizes.\nWith that said, in December, we plan on updating you with our revenue growth and margin targets.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Our discussion today includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, which provide additional information we believe is helpful to our investors.\nThese measures have been reconciled to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC regulations.\nPlease consider the risks and uncertainties that are mentioned in today's call and are described in our periodic filings with the SEC.\nBarnes Group delivered a very good quarter to begin 2021, with the recovery we had anticipated to occur later in the year starting a little earlier than expected.\nStrong order intake continuing sequential revenue growth now for the third consecutive quarter and better than expected earnings performance add confidence to our view that the second half of the year will show meaningful recovery progress.\nFor the first quarter, organic sales were down 10% compared to a year ago as a result of lower volumes at Aerospace.\nHowever, our Industrial segment generated high single-digit organic growth, which was better than our February expectation given solid orders and sales in March.\nWhile we previously envision business improving as the year progressed, now with the stronger momentum exiting the first quarter, we have increased our outlook for the year.\nEarnings per share were $0.38, down 46% from last year's adjusted $0.71, so firmly exceeding the high end of our February expectation.\nMoving now to a discussion of end market dynamics, beginning with Industrial.\nOur Industrial segment had a strong first quarter, with each of our SBUs generating year-over-year organic sales and revenue growth.\nFor the segment, orders were up 25% organically, with a book to bill of approximately 1.1 times.\nSequential orders were up 7% further exemplifying the momentum we're seeing.\nOn a macro level, manufacturing PMIs in the US and eurozone remain particularly robust.\nChina, while a bit softer, remains an expansion territory.\nAnd despite the semiconductor issue that's impacting automotive bills, IHS still predicts 2021 global production to be up 12% over last year.\nWithin the segment, our Molding Solutions business had strong orders across all brands, up 35% organically.\nOur larger end markets, automotive, medical, packaging and personal care, each saw in excess of 25% orders growth, some well above that.\nSequentially, orders improved high single digits, marking the fourth quarter in a row of sequential growth.\nOrganic sales were up mid-single digits, while sequential sales were up low single digits.\nBook-to-bill was approximately 1.1 times.\nBacklog, which is predominantly our longer cycle mold systems, grew by approximately 25% year-over-year and low double digits from the fourth quarter of 2020.\nThere is definitely a lot to like about the activity of Molding Solutions and the business has been recently adding more talent to the sales and marketing team with a clear focus on driving long-term growth and margin expansion.\nWhile near-term investments in such talent coupled with our innovation and digital initiatives, that I discussed last quarter, will hinder short-term margins.\nWe expect long-term performance to benefit [Phonetic].\nOur 2021 expectation for Molding Solutions has improved, as we now forecast organic sales growth to be in the low teens.\nMoving to Force & Motion Control.\nOrganic orders were up low double digits with organic sales up high single digits.\nFMC via sheet metal forming end market is seeing the benefit of its automotive customers push to electric and hybrid vehicles.\nYear-over-year orders are up across each of our primary geographic markets, North America, Europe and China.\nLikewise, we're seeing good demand in our general industrial end markets, particularly heavy-duty truck and industrial equipment.\nOur FMC sales growth expectation has likewise increased, as we now anticipate organic sales to be up in the mid-teens for 2021.\nEngineered Components generated organic orders growth in excess of 25% and organic revenue growth in the low double digits.\nSequentially, we saw a modest growth in orders and sales, constrained somewhat by the automotive semiconductor concern.\nAs a result of this issue, we estimate a first quarter impact of approximately $1 million, with the second quarter impact likely to be in the range of $4 million to $5 million before recovering in the second half.\nGeneral industrial markets remain very healthy.\nOur 2021 outlook has increased for this business as well with organic sales now forecast to be up mid-teens.\nMoving to Automation, we continue to see sequential performance in both orders and sales, up low teens and high-single digits, respectively.\nOn a year-over-year basis, organic sales were up high single digits and organic revenues up mid-teens.\nA very good quarter of growth and execution from the Automation team.\nDemand for our end-of-arm tooling solutions in automotive, medical and pharma and industrial automation applications remain good, as has been the trend now for a few quarters.\nWe now expect 2021 to deliver total growth of 20%, with organic growth in the mid-teens, again, better than our February expectation.\nOverall, for the Industrial segment, we see 2021 organic growth in the mid-teens, with operating margins of approximately 13%.\nMoving now to Aerospace.\nOur Aerospace business experienced continuing impact from the pandemic as OEM sales were down 32% from the prior year and aftermarket sales were down 48%, not surprising as commercial aviation remain significantly disrupted.\nHowever, we still believe that the bottom is behind us and that we're slowly recovering.\nCase in point for the third quarter in a row, we have seen total Aerospace sequential sales improve.\nIn the first quarter, the sequential improvement was driven by our MRO business.\nOur expectations for the Aerospace industry overall has not changed.\nWe continue to believe that OEM production levels for narrow bodies will show modest improvement, while wide bodies will remain pressured.\nWe did see a second consecutive quarter of good orders and OEM book-to-bill was approximately 1.5 times.\nIn the aftermarket, industry challenges of lower aircraft utilization, weakened airline profitability and government imposed travel restrictions all remain.\nRecovery will depend on the pace and effectiveness of vaccinations.\nDomestic travel activity will proceed any improvement in international travel.\nWe continue to expect aftermarket activity to gradually improve beginning in the second half of 2021.\nIn the meantime, the Aerospace team continues to execute on several items to best position our business for recovery.\nFor example, in the first few months of the year, we completed an extension of our West Chester, Ohio facility, expanding our capabilities, received supplier recognitions from Boeing and Rolls-Royce and announced a significant B-2 Bomber Exhaust System Contract award from Northrop Grumman.\nOur 2021 expectation as for OEM sales to be up mid-single digits over 2020 and spare parts down in the mid-teens, both are unchanged from our prior view.\nOur forecast for MRO is slightly improved, now down low single digits versus our prior view of been down mid-single digits.\nSegment operating margin is anticipated to be approximately 13%.\nJulie is a proven leader with significant experience, leading the financial operations of global businesses.\nHer extensive background and proven strategic leadership in corporate finance, financial planning and analysis, mergers and acquisitions, and risk management will help us advance our long-term profitable growth strategy.\nIn closing, we're off to a good start in 2021.\nFavorable macroeconomic indicators and our solid orders generation provide us with a high degree of confidence in our improved outlook for the year.\nHowever, that's not to say there aren't challenges that remain, so our teams are proactively implementing risk mitigation plans.\nAs we move forward, we'll continue to add the necessary talent and skill sets to enable us to drive growth and improve profitability.\nThose efforts will be supported by our organic investments in innovation, digitalization and strategic marketing.\nOur focus remains squarely on controlling our own destiny and positioning the Company to prosper as global markets recover.\nLet me begin with highlights of our first quarter results on Slide 4 of our supplement.\nFirst quarter sales were $302 million, down 9% from the prior year period with organic sales declining 10% as ongoing impacts from the pandemic offset our Aerospace end markets.\nThe divested Seeger business had a negative impact of 2% on sales, while FX had a positive impact of 3%.\nOperating income was $32.4 million versus $49.3 million a year ago.\nCompared to last year's adjusted operating income of $51.7 million, the first quarter was down 37% and operating margin of 10.7%, decreased 490 bps from last year's adjusted 15.6%.\nIt's important to keep in mind that this result was not unexpected.\nThe first quarter of last year saw Aerospace aftermarket performance -- saw record Aerospace aftermarket performance, which generated very strong margins.\nInterest expense was $3.9 million, a decrease of $400,000 as a result of lower average borrowings, offset in part by a higher average interest rate.\nFor the quarter, our effective tax rate was 28.1%, lower than last year's 31.5% tax rate.\nThe decrease is largely due to the absence of tax expense related to the completed sale of the Seeger business and the reduction of the statutory tax rate at one of our international operations, both of which occurred in the first quarter of 2020.\nOffsetting these items is the impact of the global intangible low taxed income tax or GILTI tax on foreign earnings in the first quarter of 2021.\nNet income was $19.4 million or $0.38 per diluted share, compared to $29.7 million or $0.58 per diluted share a year ago.\nOn an adjusted basis, net income per share was down 46% from last year's $0.71.\nLast year's first quarter adjusted net income per diluted share excluded $0.13 of Seeger divestiture adjustments.\nTurning to our segment performance, beginning with Industrial.\nFirst quarter sales were $220 million, up 10% from a year ago.\nOrganic sales increased 8%.\nThe foregone sales from the Seeger divestiture had a negative impact of 3%, while favorable FX primarily driven by the euro to US dollar exchange increased sales by 5%.\nRelative to the fourth quarter of 2020, sequential sales were up 5%.\nSo good news on the revenue front with three sequential quarters of improvement and a positive year-over-year result.\nIndustrial's operating profit for the first quarter was $21.3 million versus $17.9 million in the prior year period.\nOperating profit increased from the contribution of higher volumes and productivity improvements.\nThese were offset in part by higher personnel costs, including incentive compensation.\nLast year we saw a reduction in the quarter for incentive comp, while this year sees an uptick based on performance expectations for 2021.\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes $2.4 million of Seeger divestiture adjustments last year, first quarter operating income was up 5% from last year's $20.3 million.\nCompared to a year ago, adjusted operating margin was down 50 bps from 10.2%.\nOne of the contributing factors is the additional investments being borne by the Industrial segment.\nAs Patrick mentioned, these investments squarely put a focus on our long-term growth strategy.\nWhile our end markets and businesses within Industrial showing -- are showing signs of the solid recovery, there are some supply chain concerns related to raw material availability and inflation, as well as increased freight costs.\nWith respect to raw materials, we've seen instances where certain customers have extended the time horizons of their order commitments, looking to ensure availability of supply and acknowledging the longer lead times required for some materials.\nIn the first quarter, we experienced approximately $1 million of combined freight and material inflation in the Industrial segment.\nFor the full year, we expect an impact of about $6 million, which is built into our outlook.\nOur teams are working on [Phonetic] these issues, looking to decrease the risk exposure and to take actions to offset the inflation where appropriate.\nMoving to Aerospace, sales were $82 million for the first quarter, down 38% from last year.\nOperating profit of $11.1 million was down 65%, primarily driven by the lower sales volume.\nOperating margin was 13.6%, versus a strong 23.9% a year ago.\nYou may recall, last year's margin was a high watermark, driven by the contributions of the aftermarket.\nAerospace OEM backlog ended the quarter at $600 million, up 5% from the fourth quarter and we expect to ship 45% of this backlog over the next 12 months.\nFirst quarter cash provided by operating activities was $36 million, a decrease of $12 million versus a year ago, free cash flow was $28 million, versus $35 million last year, and capital expenditures of $8 million were down about $4 million from a year ago.\nRegarding the balance sheet, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as defined by our credit agreement, was 3.1 times at quarter end, essentially flat to the prior quarter result.\nThe Company is in full compliance with all covenants of our credit agreements and maintains adequate liquidity to fund operations.\nWhile we anticipated the leverage ratio to peak with our first quarter 2021 results, we performed better than expected with the stronger financial results of the first quarter.\nWe see leverage further declining from this point absent any acquisition activity.\nOur first quarter average diluted shares outstanding was 51 million shares.\nWe now expect to resume some share repurchase activity to offset equity compensation dilution, with respect to incremental share repurchases that will depend on a number of factors related to capital deployment and growth opportunities that are available to us.\nTurning to Slide 5 of our supplement, let's discuss our updated financial outlook for 2021.\nWe now expect organic sales to be up 10% to 12% for the year, an increase from our prior view of up 6% to 8%, driven by stronger industrial growth.\nFX is expected to have a 2% favorable impact on sales, while divested revenue -- divested Seeger revenues will have a small negative impact.\nOperating margin is forecasted to be approximately 13%.\nAt this point, we're not anticipating significant residual restructuring charges to come through, so no forecasted adjustments to 2021 net income.\nEPS is expected to be in the range of $1.78 to $1.98, up 9% to 21% from 2020's adjusted earnings of $1.64, that expectation is an increase from our prior view of $1.65 to $1.90, and we expect the first half of the year to contribute approximately 43% of 2021's earnings.\nA few other outlook items.\nInterest expense is anticipated to be approximately $16 million, while other expense is forecasted at [Phonetic] $8 million, both a bit better than our prior view.\nWe now expect capex to be approximately $50 million, down $5 million, average diluted shares of 51 million and cash conversion of over 100% are consistent with our prior outlook.\nAnd lastly, we forecast a full year tax rate of approximately 30%.\nHowever, we continue to analyze potential tax planning strategies to manage and reduce our overall tax cost.\nTo close, a very good start to 2021, supported by healthy orders for both segments.\nWith our focus on driving growth across the organization, we'll continue to invest in the business through capital expenditures and the funding of key strategic initiatives.\nWe believe that these investments will help us accelerate the recovery in our financial performance.\nLeverage remains very manageable and should improve from this point, so the balance sheet can accommodate our approach.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Before we begin, I'd like to recognize all Church & Dwight employees around the world for their continued dedication to keeping our Company going during the pandemic, especially our supply chain and R&D teams as we overcame raw material shortages in Q1 as a result of the Texas freeze.\nNow, let's talk about the results.\nQ1 was another exceptional quarter.\nReported sales growth was 6.3%, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.83, and that's $0.03 better than our outlook.\nOrganic sales grew 4.9%, driven by higher consumption.\nE-commerce shows no signs of slowing.\nIn Q1, our online sales increased by 54% year-over-year and as a percentage of total sales were 14.8% in Q1 compared to 10.2% in Q1 of 2020.\nWe continue to expect online sales for the full year to be 15% as a percentage of total sales.\nVaccinations will significantly influence consumer behavior.\nThe U.S. is slowly opening up, which means consumers are more mobile.\n60% of vaccinated consumers are optimistic that they will return to a normal or new normal as we are seeing the first signs that consumers are willing to spend more time in stores based on a study by IRI.\nIn contrast, many countries outside the U.S. continue to experience lockdowns.\nAs described in the release, we have been facing shortages of raw materials due to the Texas freeze.\nRaw material and transportation costs spiked higher in February and were exacerbated by the Texas freeze.\nWe expect the tight supply and higher input cost to continue for the balance of the year.\nTo mitigate the cost increases, we have announced price increases in laundry and across our international portfolio, and we have reduced couponing and promotional spending.\nRick will discuss this further in a couple of minutes.\nAt our Analyst Day in January, we outlined which categories and brands we expected to stay elevated throughout 2021, recover from COVID lows, decline from COVID highs and which ones would remain steady.\nOverall, our full-year thinking has not changed.\nTo name a few categories, demand for vitamins, laundry additives and cat litter are expected to remain elevated in 2021.\nCondoms, dry shampoo, power flossers and women's grooming are expected to deliver year-over-year growth as society opens up and consumers have greater mobility.\nBaking soda, pregnancy test kits and oral analgesics are expected to decline from COVID highs.\nOf the 16 categories in which we compete, 8 grew consumption in Q1, in some cases, on top of big consumption gains in Q1 of 2020.\nOf those 8 categories, 5 saw a double-digit growth, gummy vitamins, toothache, battery-powered toothbrush, pregnancy test kits and women's electric grooming.\nHousehold categories, such as laundry detergent and baking soda were down in the quarter and unable to comp the huge COVID-19 sales spikes seen in Q1 2020.\nLooking at market shares in Q1, 8 out of our 13 power brands met or gained share within our U.S. Consumer Domestic business, which grew organic sales 5.1%.\nI'll comment on a few of the brands right now.\nConsumers have made health and wellness a priority.\nVITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins saw great consumption growth in Q1, up 24% with the help of the new launches described in the release.\nIt appears that new consumers are coming into the category and they're staying.\nOne survey showed that consumers who are new to the category had a 90% repeat rate.\nWATERPIK grew consumption 15% in Q1 as it continues to recover from COVID lows and benefit from the heightened consumer focus on health and wellness.\nWATERPIK is also benefiting from dental offices returning to pre-COVID patient levels.\nWe expect the frequency of our lunch 'n learn program to return to normal levels in the second half of this year.\nWhile BATISTE remains impacted by social distancing, consumption was up 6%, and we achieved a record high quarterly balance share of 39%, behind our International Women's Day campaign.\nNow, I want to talk about the International division.\nDespite European lockdowns, our International business came through with 3.2% organic growth in the quarter, primarily driven by strong growth in our Global Markets Group.\nAsia continues to be a strong growth engine for us.\nWATERPIK, FEMFRESH and ARM & HAMMER led the growth for the International division in the quarter.\nOur Specialty Products business delivered a positive quarter with 6% growth, primarily due to higher pricing.\nMilk prices were stable in Q1 and are projected to increase later in the year due to higher demand.\nNow, turning to New Products.\nInnovative new products will continue to attract consumers.\nIn the household products portfolio, we are introducing OXICLEAN Laundry and Home Sanitizer.\nIt is the first and only sanitizing laundry additives that boost stain fighting and eliminates 99.9% of bacteria and viruses.\nThe product is also designed for cleaning throughout the house and on a variety of surfaces.\nIn the personal care portfolio, VITAFUSION launched Elderberry gummies, Super Immune gummies and POWER ZINC gummies to capitalize on increased consumer interest in immunity.\nWATERPIK launched WATERPIK ION, a water flosser which is 30% smaller and contains a long-lasting lithium ion battery and is specifically designed for smaller bathroom spaces.\nTo capitalize on its earlier success, WATERPIK SONIC-FUSION, the world's first flossing toothbrush, was upgraded to SONIC-FUSION 2.0 with two brush head sizes and two brush speeds.\nAnd finally, FLAWLESS is taking advantage of the at-home beauty and self-care trends with a facial cleanser system, a shower wand for a full-body spa-like experience and at-home manicure and pedicure solutions.\nNow, let's turn to the outlook.\nWe're off to a good start in Q1.\nWe continue to expect full year adjusted earnings per share growth of 6% to 8%, which is in line with our Evergreen target, despite the heightened input cost.\nGiven our expectations, for consumer consumption, we have raised our full year outlook for reported sales growth from 4.5% to now 5% to 6%.\nOrganic sales growth expectations were raised from 3% to 4% to 5%.\nAnd if you look at consumption trends through the middle of April, 14 of our 16 categories were up in consumption year-over-year.\nNow, in conclusion, I'd like to remind everyone of the many reasons to have confidence in Church & Dwight.\nOur track record shows that we are positioned to do well in both good and bad times and in uncertain economic times such as now.\nCategories in which we play are essential to consumers.\nWe have a balance sheet of value and -- pardon me, we have a balance of value and premium products.\nOur power brands are number one or number two in their categories.\nAnd we have low exposure to private label.\nAnd with a strong balance sheet, we continue to be open to acquiring TSR-accretive businesses.\nNext up is Rick to give us details on Q1.\nWe'll start with EPS.\nFirst quarter adjusted EPS, which excludes the positive earn-out adjustment, was $0.83, flat to prior year.\nAnd as we discussed in previous calls, the quarterly earn-out adjustment will continue until Q4, which is the conclusion of the earn-out period.\n$0.83 was better than our $0.80 outlook, primarily due to continued increase in consumer demand for many of our products.\nReported revenue was up 6.3%.\nOrganic sales were up 4.9%, driven by a volume increase of 3.1% and a positive price mix of 1.8%.\nNow, let's review the segments.\nOrganic sales increased by 5.1% due to the higher volume and positive price mix.\nOverall, growth was led VITAFUSION, L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins, WATERPIK oral care products, FLAWLESS beauty products, ARM & HAMMER clumping cat litter and KABOOM bathroom cleaners as well as VIVISCAL hair thinning products.\nConsumer International delivered 3.2% organic growth due to higher volume, partially offset by lower price and product mix.\nThis was a great result despite European writedowns.\nFor our SPD business, organic sales increased 6% due to higher pricing, partially offset by lower volume.\nMilk prices have remained stable month-to-month and are projected to rise as 2021 moves forward.\nNow turning to gross margin.\nOur first quarter gross margin was 44.5%, a 120 basis-point decrease from a year ago.\nGross margin drag was impacted by 350 basis points of higher manufacturing costs, primarily related to commodities, distribution, tariffs and COVID impacts.\nCommodities, which were exacerbated due to the Texas freeze were a 90 basis-point drag on margin.\nTariff costs negatively impacted gross margin by 40 basis points.\nThese costs were partially offset by a plus 190 basis points from price/volume mix and a positive 170 basis points from productivity programs as well as a 10 basis-point positive impact from favorable currency.\nAs a reminder, our outlook for the quarter on gross margin was down 50 basis points.\nThe entire variance was related to the spike in commodities and tight transportation market.\nThe good news is for the back half of the year, we expect margin expansion behind the pricing and promotional actions we laid out in the release as well as we start to lap some of the higher inflation and tariffs that we experienced in the back half of 2020.\nMarketing was up $2.3 million year-over-year as we invested behind our brand.\nMarketing expense as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points to 8%.\nFor SG&A, Q1 adjusted SG&A increased 60 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to acquisition-related intangible amortization.\nWe also had higher investments within IT and R&D as well as some transition costs from the ZICAM acquisition.\nOther expense all-in was $11.6 million, a $3.6 million decline due to lower interest expense from lower interest rates.\nAnd for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 24.2% compared to 23.2% in 2020, an increase of 100 basis points, primarily driven by lower stock option exercises.\nAnd now to cash.\nFor the first three months of 2021, cash from operating activities decreased 57% to $100 million due to higher cash earnings, which was offset by an increase in working capital.\nInventory is higher to support increase in sales as we continue to improve customer fill levels.\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses decreased due to the timing of payments.\nAs of March 31st, cash on hand was $128 million.\nOur full year capex plan continues to be approximately $180 million as we continue to expand manufacturing and distribution capacity, primarily focused on laundry, litter and vitamins.\nFor Q2, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 4.5%, organic sales growth of approximately 4% and gross margin contraction of 350 basis points as higher input costs continue and we lap artificially low promotional levels from a year ago.\nAdjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.69 per share, a 10% decrease from last year's adjusted Q2 EPS.\nAs you read in the release, we did a voluntary recall of selected products within our vitamin business.\nWe expect the earnings per share impact in Q2 to be approximately $0.04 for the quarter and we are seeking reimbursement by insurance.\nAnd now for the full year outlook.\nWe now expect full year 2021 reported sales growth to be 5% to 6%, which is above our previous 4.5% outlook.\nWe're also raising our full year organic sales growth to approximately 4% to 5%, up from the previous outlook of 3%.\nTurning to gross margin.\nWe now expect full year gross margin to be flat for the year, primarily due to the impact of higher raw material and transportation costs and the Texas freeze in March.\nWe had previously expected gross margin expansion of 50 basis points for the year.\nAnd recently, we have seen a large increase in raw materials and transportation costs.\nWe're absorbing $90 million of incremental costs for the full year.\nHigher sales, reductions in promotions and price increases across all three of our divisions represented about one-third of our portfolio, offset a large part of the cost increases.\nAs a reminder, we price to protect gross profit dollars, not necessarily margin.\nOur full year tax rate expectations are now 22%, higher versus our last expectations due to lower stock option exercises.\nThis is a $0.02 headwind versus our previous full year outlook.\nAdjusted earnings per share expectations continue to be in the range of $0.03 to $3.06, a 6% to 8% increase year-over-year.\nOur cash from operations outlook continues to be $1 billion, while we continue to pursue accretive acquisitions.\nAs you heard from Matt, the Company is off to a great start, and we expect 2021 to be another strong year.\nAnd with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:They will be joined by Scott Oaksmith, Senior Vice President, Real Estate & Finance.\nWe're glad you could join us and hope you are all well.\nOur company, like the hotel industry overall, continues to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which is far from over.\nThe response of our franchisees, their hotel staff and Choice associates has been remarkable.\nDespite the pandemic, I'm pleased to report that Choice Hotels has continued to drive results that significantly outperform the industry in the third quarter.\nSystemwide domestic RevPAR outperformed the industry by nearly 20 percentage points, declining only 28.8% from the third quarter of 2019.\nAll of our limited service brands had significant RevPAR index gains against their local competitors.\nWe continued to grow our effective royalty rate, a reflection of the continuously improving value proposition to our franchisees.\nAnd we grew our total system size, especially in our more revenue intense, upscale, mid-scale and extended-stay segments.\nWe attribute this success to Choice's key differentiators, including our diversified brand portfolio, the geographic footprint of our domestic system, the profile of our core customer and our franchise-focused business model.\nThese core strengths have positioned us well to capture the shifts in consumer demand that occurred over the last eight months.\nWe believe that the strategy of growing our limited service brands in the right segments and the right locations will allow us to continue to increase our share of travel demand over the long term.\nAnd now that we're entering the ninth month of the pandemic, we are beginning to see trends emerge that are likely to have a long-term impact on the travel industry.\nLet me begin with the trend of remote work and virtual learning.\nThe significant investment in remote access technology by businesses, schools and consumers is creating more options in where and when traditional activities take place.\nIn a post-pandemic world, this may afford Americans even more flexibility in their schedules to travel for leisure.\nFor the last several years, we've seen a trend in leisure travel demand spreading more evenly throughout the month of the year, which we attribute in part to school schedules shifting over the years as well as the increase in baby boomers retiring and having more time and disposable income to travel.\nMore employees can now work from anywhere with an Internet connection, while their children attend virtual schooling.\nFor the past two months, we saw continued leisure demand extending into weekdays.\nA second trend is the increase in road trips.\nwhich we're benefiting from with our high concentration of hotels in drive-to markets.\nConsumers' appetite for road trips has only accelerated since the onset of the pandemic as Americans are showing a clear preference for trips that are closer to home.\nDestinations that may have been overlooked before the onset of COVID-19 are getting fresh consideration.\nWith over 4,000 domestic hotels located within a mile of an interstate exit, our hotels are well positioned to serve travelers as they hit the open road.\nAnd with over 2,000 domestic hotels near beaches and national parks, our hotels are also located in the right markets to capture growing demand from travelers who increasingly are looking to rediscover the great American outdoors.\nAnother emerging trend is the economic disruption brought on by the pandemic and its effect on consumers as the recovery takes place.\nWe believe that in uncertain times, as in previous down cycles, consumers will be looking for more moderately priced limited service hotel offerings, presenting an opportunity for our portfolio to capture this demand.\nAnother anticipated economic effect of the pandemic is higher relocation rates.\nAs people shift jobs and industries, demand for longer-term hotel stays rises, a trend we believe will benefit our brands, particularly those in the moderately priced extended-stay segment.\nAnd finally, there are signs that consumers' risk tolerance is climbing, even before a vaccine is available.\nAccording to a recent survey, the perception of travel safety is up, and Americans likelihood to take a domestic leisure trip and stay in a hotel during the next six months is the highest since mid-March.\nAs a result of these trends, we've seen a rise in our weekday occupancy quarter-over-quarter, on top of the existing base of weekend leisure demand we've historically enjoyed.\nIn fact, our weekday RevPAR index is up eight percentage points year-over-year in the third quarter.\nOur year-over-year RevPAR change continued to improve month-over-month in the third quarter.\nAt this time, we remain optimistic that we will see sequential month-over-month improvements related to our year-over-year RevPAR change.\nOur loyalty program has remained a key driver of our business throughout the pandemic enhancing our ability to drive franchisees top line revenue.\nWe particularly benefited from Choice Privileges Diamond Elite members, our best customers, who contributed an even higher percentage of overall revenue year-to-date versus last year.\nWe expect this bedrock of loyalty business to deliver even higher value going forward as more Americans return to travel and enrollments in our award-winning Choice Privileges loyalty program continues to climb.\nOur long-term strategy of growing the right brands in the right segments in the right markets allow Choice brand hotels to continue to outperform the competition.\nThroughout the third quarter, we generated significant month-over-month increases in our proprietary revenue contribution to our hotels.\nMore specifically, our website contribution increased by 400 basis points and our loyalty contribution increased by 120 basis points quarter-over-quarter.\nThis has helped drive RevPAR index share gains versus our local competitors across all location types as reported by STR.\nFor the past 34 weeks through October 31, we observed significant RevPAR share gains against the competition.\nIn the third quarter, all of our select service brands achieved material RevPAR index gains versus their local competitors, with each of our upscale and extended-stay brands experiencing share gains of over 10 percentage points.\nI'll now provide a brief update on our segments.\nOur upscale portfolio once again achieved impressive year-over-year growth in the third quarter, where we increased our domestic upscale room count by 33%.\nThe Ascend Hotel Collection is the industry's first and largest soft brand.\nNow with nearly 300 hotels around the globe and fast approaching its 200th domestic location, Ascend Hotels achieved the following performance in the third quarter: RevPAR change outperformance by over 26 percentage points versus the upscale segment; RevPAR share gains against local competitors of nearly 19 percentage points; and average daily rate index gains of approximately nine percentage points.\nIn fact, for the past six months, Ascend has significantly outperformed the upscale soft brands as well as the segment as a whole in terms of year-over-year RevPAR change.\nOur extended-stay hotels are purpose-built for long-term guests.\nChoice Hotels brands in this cycle-resilient segment continue to outperform in this unprecedented environment, and our portfolio of over 420 extended-stay hotels grew 6% year-over-year in the third quarter.\nOur WoodSpring Suites brand achieved an average occupancy rate of 77% in the third quarter, and the brand's monthly occupancy levels have remained north of 75% since the last week of June.\nOur Suburban extended-stay brand experienced year-over-year occupancy gains in the third quarter, further enhancing the brand's attractiveness to developers looking for a smart, extended-stay conversion opportunity.\nAt the same time, our MainStay Suites mid-scale extended-stay brand gained more than 16 percentage points in RevPAR index versus its local competitors in the third quarter.\nWe remain optimistic about the growth potential of our extended-stay portfolio whose pipeline increased by 9% year-over-year in the third quarter.\nYear-to-date through September, Choice has awarded over 40 extended-stay franchise agreements, demonstrating sustained interest in both new construction and conversion opportunities during a challenging time for the industry.\nI'd now like to turn to our mid-scale segment, whose brands represent 2/3 of our total domestic portfolio and over half of the franchise agreements executed year-to-date.\nAll of our select-service mid-scale brands achieved year-over-year RevPAR index and average daily rate index gains versus their local competitors through the third quarter.\nThe Comfort brand captured RevPAR share gains of over seven percentage points versus local competitors in the third quarter.\nAnd Clarion Pointe, a conversion brand extension of Clarion that launched less than two years ago, recently opened its 20th hotel in the U.S. and now has over 50 hotels open or in the pipeline, demonstrating its strong growth as the brand continues its coast-to-coast expansion.\nDemand for Choice's brands continues despite the challenging environment, aided by our strong value proposition and recent outperformance.\nDevelopers choose our brands as they seek to boost the value of their hotels.\nWe have a conversion brand to fit most developers' price points which has driven our development growth through past downturns.\nYear-to-date, through the end of September, we have awarded over 230 new domestic franchise agreements, nearly 70% of which were for conversion hotels.\nIn the third quarter alone, we executed over 80 domestic agreements, of which nearly 3/4 were for conversions and over 40% of which were executed in the month of September.\nWe have a long history of enhancing the diversity of our ownership base through our one-of-a-kind emerging markets development team, which helps underrepresented individuals such as minority and veteran entrepreneurs enter the rewarding business of hotel franchising.\nNearly 70% of our hotels have minority ownership.\nDespite the pandemic, we have awarded and financially supported 17 franchise contracts with black and Hispanic entrepreneurs year-to-date.\nMost recently, we entered into the largest minority-owned multiunit franchise agreement in the program's history.\nOur long-standing commitment to diversity and further details regarding our efforts to improve the communities we serve will be outlined in our forthcoming ESG report.\nWhile this year's challenges have been unique, the cyclical nature of our industry is known.\nIt's something our experienced and disciplined management team, many of whom have led the company through previous down cycles, planned for.\nOur resilient franchisee base also has deep experience leading their small businesses through down cycles, and they are at the center of everything we do.\nOver the course of the pandemic, we have supported our franchisees in a number of ways.\nFirst, by reducing costs through extending brand program deadlines, implementing cost savings, operational initiatives, reducing certain fixed fees, implementing a tailored fee deferral program and modifying brand standards.\nSecond, by capturing business through our global sales efforts aimed at first responders and other essential travel; a multichannel, multi-brand marketing campaign; and tailored promotional programs.\nFinally, by leveraging hygiene and infection prevention experts like Ecolab in launching our Commitment to Clean initiative, helping to make sure their hotels are clean and safe.\nWe also have been advocating and will continue to advocate with policymakers for additional relief measures aimed at assisting small businesses to provide targeted help for the travel industry.\nSpecifically, we've been urging enactment of a second draw loan program for existing Paycheck Protection Program borrowers, greater accommodation and more streamlining for borrowers to obtain forgiveness and liability protections for hotel owners who comply with health and safety protocols during the pandemic.\nWe've also called for additional stimulus to support American discretionary spending, including in areas such as travel.\nIn closing, Choice Hotels is positioned to emerge from these trying times stronger just as we have before in our 80-year history.\nOur proven portfolio of well-segmented brands, geographic footprint, and asset-light business model position us well to benefit from current consumer trends as they continue to evolve.\nI'll now invite our CFO to provide his update.\nI hope that you and your families are well and healthy.\nToday, I'd like to provide additional insights around our third quarter performance, update you on our balance sheet and liquidity, as well as our approach to capital allocation, and finally, share our thoughts on the outlook for the road ahead.\nLet's now take a closer look at our results.\nFor the third quarter of 2020, total revenues, excluding marketing and reservation system fees, were $103.6 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $74.9 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of over 72% and adjusted earnings per share were $0.66.\nOur domestic systemwide RevPAR for the third quarter outperformed the overall industry by nearly 20 percentage points, declining only 28.8% from the same quarter of 2019.\nIn addition, our results exceeded the primary chain scale segments in which we compete as reported by STR by six percentage points.\nWe've long focused our brand strategy on driving growth across the higher value and more revenue intense upscale, extended-stay and mid-scale segments, and it's paying off.\nIn the third quarter, all three segments achieved year-over-year RevPAR outperformance against their respective industry chain scales and gains versus their local competitors.\nSpecifically, the RevPAR change of our upscale portfolio exceeded that of the overall segment by 14 percentage points, and our upscale portfolio outperformed its local competitive set by over nine percentage points.\nWith average domestic systemwide occupancy rates of 74%, our extended-stay portfolio outperformed the industry's RevPAR change by an impressive 40 percentage points beating its local competitive set by 14 percentage points.\nAnd finally, RevPAR change for our mid-scale portfolio exceeded the segment by nearly eight percentage points.\nThis RevPAR outperformance is the result of both continued occupancy gains and our franchisees' ability to maintain rate.\nOur domestic systemwide occupancy rate has seen improvements since the trough of 28% that occurred back in early April.\nSince the week of June 21 through late October, our average weekly occupancy rates have consistently exceeded 50%.\nIn addition, we continue to see gains in our average daily rate index, which was up 1.7 percentage points against local competitors in the third quarter.\nThese experts have been advising our franchisees on the best use of tools to maximize their pricing strategies and provide sophisticated market intelligence and channel management.\nDespite the challenging environment, we expanded our system size, growing the number of domestic hotels by 0.7% and rooms by 1.9% year-over-year.\nAcross our more revenue intense brands in the upscale, extended-stay and mid-scale segments, we experienced even greater growth, increasing the number of hotels by 2.1% and rooms by 3.4% year-over-year.\nWe're especially pleased that Comfort, our flagship brand, continue to experience positive unit and rooms growth in the third quarter following its brand transformation.\nComfort's development success, amid unprecedented circumstances, is perhaps the clearest endorsement of the brand's value proposition.\nComfort now represents nearly 1/3 of our total domestic pipeline, which will fuel revenue intense growth for years to come.\nIn addition, the brand's conversion pipeline increased by nearly 50% in the third quarter year-over-year.\nWe are particularly pleased with the company's performance-related to our effective royalty rate, which is driven by the attractive value proposition we provide to our franchisees, their continued desire to be affiliated with our strong brands and our current pipeline.\nOur royalty rate remains a significant driver of our revenue growth.\nThe company's domestic effective royalty rate increased seven basis points year-over-year to 4.91% in the third quarter and has increased nine basis points year-to-date compared to the prior year.\nWe expect to observe continued growth of this lever for the remainder of the year as owners seek a shelter of a large proven franchisor that delivers strong top line results to their hotels and helps them maximize their return on investment.\nI'd now like to say a few words about our balance sheet and capital allocation strategy.\nThroughout the third quarter, we continue to focus on reducing discretionary costs, exercising discipline around capital allocation and effectively allocating resources to drive top line outperformance, all of which allowed us to improve our cash position and further bolster our liquidity.\nIn fact, we reduced our net debt by approximately $50 million during the third quarter and are proud to report cash flow from operations of $70 million for the nine months ended September 30, over $68 million of which was generated in the third quarter alone.\nOur cash and liquidity profile remains exceptionally strong.\nAt the end of the third quarter, the company had over $790 million in cash and available borrowing capacity through our revolving credit facility.\nWe remain on track to achieve our previously announced SG&A cost savings of nearly 25% in 2020 and expect to maintain a run rate of SG&A cost savings of approximately 15% in 2021 and beyond.\nThe decisions we have made to better align our cost structure in the post-pandemic environment position us well to capitalize on opportunities as travel demand recovers, while allowing us to continue to invest for the long term.\nOur capital allocation approach, defined by prudence and discipline, remains key to our success.\nChoice's first priority in this area has always been to increase organic growth by strategically investing back into the business, and that won't change.\nWe are confident that our capacity and cash flows will allow us to not only weather the storm but also increase the organic growth of our business by strategically investing in growing our brands and system size, executing our technology road map and delivering proprietary franchisee-facing tools that help drive top line revenues.\nBased on our demonstrated track record of success in organic growth, we believe these internal investments will drive attractive returns for years to come.\nWe will continue to evaluate other investments in capital return opportunities in the context of developing market conditions and our overall capital allocation strategy on a go-forward basis.\nBefore closing, I'd like to offer some thoughts on what lies ahead.\nThe ultimate and precise impact of the pandemic on our business for the remainder of 2020 and beyond remains largely unknown, as is the exact trajectory of our industry's recovery.\nWhile we are not issuing formal guidance today, we currently expect that the impact of COVID-19 on the company's year-over-year RevPAR change will be less significant for the fourth quarter versus the third quarter of this year.\nOur sentiment is based on the following.\nFirst, we are observing continued resilience of leisure demand and continue to drive relative outperformance versus the industry.\nSecond, despite entering fall when demand is historically lower, we are pleased that our fourth quarter domestic RevPAR change has continued the pattern of sequential quarterly improvement through the week of October 24.\nIn fact, we expect our October 2020 RevPAR to decline by approximately 25% from the same period of 2019.\nThe final reason we are optimistic is the nature of the current environment.\nUnlike the Great Recession, which was caused by underlying fundamental economic problems, the current economic downturn is tied to the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, which we believe could contribute to a faster recovery.\nWe will continue to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 across the business, and we'll provide further updates in February during our next earnings call.\nIn closing, we are optimistic that Choice Hotels is well positioned to succeed for the remainder of 2020 and beyond.\nWe continue to benefit from our resilient, primarily asset-light, franchise-focused business model, which has historically delivered stable returns throughout economic cycles and provided a degree of cushion from market risks.\nWhile we are not immune to the pressures faced by the industry, we believe that our long-term focus and prudent, disciplined capital allocation strategy will allow us to continue to capitalize on opportunities during the recovery.\nAt this time, Pat and I would be happy to answer any questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Slides for today's call are posted on our website, and we invite you to follow along.\nParticipants are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these statements, which reflect management's opinions only as of today, April 29, 2020.\nInformation on potential factors and risks that could affect our actual results of operations is included in our SEC filings.\nThe company undertakes no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to the statements made in today's call other than through filings made concerning this reporting period.\nIn addition, today's discussion will include references to non-GAAP measures.\nClean Harbors believes that such information provides an additional measurement and consistent historical comparison of its performance.\nStarting on Slide 3.\nBefore discussing our Q1 results, I'd like to address the coronavirus pandemic and how we're responding to it.\nObviously, the outbreak has created a healthcare crisis and caused economic disruption around the globe, and I hope that all of you and your families are staying safe.\nHere at Clean Harbors, the safety of our employees is part of our culture and the top priority during this pandemic.\nAs an essential services provider with teams on the frontlines of the COVID-19 crisis, we have instituted rigorous safety protocols and work closely with suppliers to make certain we have the necessary equipment to protect our employees.\nDuring the crisis, our workforce has remained out in the field and at our plants, supporting our customers' needs across North America.\nThe workforce representing critical administrative functions has supported our field teams from home, and the strength of our systems has allowed that transition to be virtually seamless.\nWe expect the virus to impede our business in the second quarter, particularly within Safety-Kleen.\nIn addition to limited driving and business activity across North America, Safety-Kleen also had been affected by the sharp downturn and the value of base oil.\nIn short, we are faced with some difficult near-term market conditions, and we are making -- taking significant actions in response.\nLet me touch on some of those actions.\nStarting with alignment of our cost structure with the demand environment, we are rightsizing our workforce through furloughs and other reductions and implemented a nonbillable hiring and wage freeze, and we restricted all travel.\nWe've also gone back to many of our vendors and suppliers to negotiate for savings or improved payment terms.\nIn addition, we've temporarily shutted half of our rerefining capacity to reflect the current demand for base oil as well as the likelihood of less available used motor oil in Q2 and beyond.\nFrom a liquidity perspective, we drew down $150 million on our revolver to strengthen our balance sheet in the event that crisis worsens.\nWe have reset our net CapEx spend plans for 2020, and we've lowered our expected spend by more than $50 million to preserve capital and support our free cash flow for the year.\nThat said, I believe our strong balance sheet leaves us well-positioned to succeed.\nTurning to Q1 financials on Slide 4.\nRevenues rose 10% from a year ago as both operating segments recorded solid growth.\nAt the same time, our adjusted EBITDA increased to a record $122.6 million, driven by our mix of high-value waste streams and high utilization, augmented by projects and emergency response work.\nOur adjusted EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points to 14.3%.\nLooking at our segment results, beginning on Slide 5.\nEnvironmental Services revenue grew 11% based by contributions from our facilities network and Field Services group and aided by warmer weather nearly all quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA growth of 22% was driven by business mix, disposal volumes, and emergency response revenue.\nEmergency response work totaled $21 million, representing COVID-19 de-con work and a cleanup of a chemical plant fire.\nOur disposal facilities saw impressive volumes this quarter as incinerator utilization increased to 86% and landfill tonnage grew 39%.\nOur average price per pound for incineration in Q1 was up 11%, reflecting the record level of high-margin direct burn streams that we gathered.\nOverall, another terrific quarter for our Environmental Service segment.\nMoving to Slide 6.\nSafety-Kleen revenue was up 8%, primarily by growth in the SK Oil business.\nAdjusted EBITDA and margin improved on lower SK Oil transportation costs and higher rerefining production compared with a year ago when volumes were disrupted by frozen rivers and flooding.\nWithin the SK branch business, core services performed well.\nWhile parts washer services were flat with the prior year, waste ore collection was up slightly to 55 million gallons, blended products accounted for 25% of volume in the quarter, and our direct volume was 7%.\nThe first quarter began with positive signs that IMO 2020 was going to enable us to expand our refining spread as high sulfur fuel oil values had fallen, and base oil prices were up in early January.\nBut the oil shock sparked by the global outbreak of the coronavirus, IMO 2020 has largely been sidelined, and base oil has fallen by $1 a gallon.\nWe entered Q2 with significant pressure on our rerefining spread.\nAnd in this environment, the value of used motor oil is in a charge-for-oil state.\nIn response to the current market conditions, we've significantly raised our charge-for-oil program.\nDriving in the U.S. and Canada needs to normalize before our spread and lubricant demand can rebound.\nAnd we see conditions -- when we see conditions improve, we'll consider reopening our closed rerefineries.\nTurning to Slide 7.\nGiven the current environment, our capital allocation strategy is critical as ever.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we are reducing our planned net CapEx by more than $50 million.\nWe divested two businesses in Western Canada in the first quarter as we continued to steadily shrink our direct exposure to energy.\nSince we began executing our divestiture program several years ago, we've sold seven businesses for approximately $120 million in proceeds.\nIn terms of M&A, we're not likely to be active near term.\nLong term, we believe we'll emerge from this market downturn stronger, both financially and operationally than some of our peers, which will allow us to be opportunistic.\nFor our buyback program, we will likely hold off until we are certain that the domestic economy is on a clear path to recovery.\nIn addition, we'll look to repay the $150 million on the revolver as soon as this crisis shows signs of nearing an end.\nLooking ahead to our segments, although we have seen some cancellations and project delays due to COVID-19, we expect our Environmental Service segment to weather the current downturn well.\nWe expect our decontamination work and growing volumes of infection waste to help offset what would certainly be a larger decline.\nWithin Safety-Kleen, we expect both our branch business and our SK Oil to be hit fairly hard, particularly here in Q2 as stay at home orders greatly reduce vehicle travel and generate less used motor oil.\nOur SK branch business should rebound as shelter-in-place mandates are lifted and low gasoline prices encourage a rebound in driving.\nIn SK Oil, our rerefining spread has contracted with a drop in crude, and we have aggressively increased our charge-for-oil pricing, but volumes are off and near-term demand for base oil has fallen.\nIn summary, our Q1 results demonstrated the strength of our business model, the value of our assets and our frontline role in emergency response.\nOur market leadership, financial liquidity and positive free cash flow will enable us to navigate this global crisis.\nLet me echo Alan's comments about the outstanding work of our team and everyone on the front lines of the crisis.\nThrough the unprecedented events we've experienced in just a few weeks, I think we all have a deeper appreciation for the professionals, especially healthcare workers, who put themselves at risk every day to help those in need.\nTurning to Slide 9 and our income statement.\nAs Alan indicated, we delivered record first quarter results.\nRevenue grew nearly $78 million, while adjusted EBITDA grew by nearly $21 million.\nThis reflects the mix of business we achieved in the quarter, project work and favorable weather.\nFrom a gross profit perspective, we saw a sharp increase in both absolute dollars and on a percentage basis due to higher utilization, pricing, and a favorable comp with prior year.\nOur gross margin increased by 160 basis points from a year ago.\nSG&A expenses were up $14.5 million in the quarter due to the higher revenue, investments in our employees, and some onetime expenses from last year -- onetime items from last year.\nAs we move forward, we are focusing much of our cost reduction efforts in this area to bring expenses in line with our revenue.\nDepreciation and amortization in Q1 was down slightly to $47.5 million.\nWe completed two small bolt-on acquisitions in 2019, while also divesting several businesses.\nFor 2020, we expect depreciation and amortization in the range of $285 million to $295 million, which is a little lower than last year.\nIncome from operations increased 92% to $45.5 million, a first-quarter record, reflecting the combination of our revenue growth and improved gross profit.\nOn a GAAP basis, earnings per share was $0.21 in Q1 versus $0.02 a year ago.\nOur adjusted earnings per share was $0.28.\nTurning to the balance sheet on Slide 10.\nAs Alan mentioned, we drew $150 million on our revolver during the first quarter which increased our cash and short-term marketable securities to $494.3 million at quarter end.\nWe saw reasonable AR collection late in March, which led to a healthy cash balance.\nOur strong liquidity position further protects our company and adds financial flexibility should we need it.\nOur balance sheet remains in good shape.\nCurrent and long-term debt obligations at quarter end rose to $1.7 billion, reflecting the drawdown on our revolver.\nOur weighted average cost of debt is now 4.3% with a healthy mix of fixed and variable debt.\nLeverage on a net debt basis was 2.2x for the trailing 12 months ended March 31.\nLooking at our most recent cash balance from yesterday, our cash remains essentially flat from where we ended Q1.\nThe team has done a nice job maintaining its focus on collections and managing our spend.\nTurning to cash flows on Slide 11.\nCash from operations in Q1 was up slightly at -- to $33.7 million.\nCapEx, net of disposals and the purchase of our headquarters, was $59.9 million, up from a year ago, resulting in adjusted free cash flow in the quarter of a negative $26.2 million, which is consistent with prior year and our expectations.\nFor the year, we are now targeting CapEx, net of disposals and purchase of our headquarters in a range of $140 million to $160 million.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased approximately 300,000 shares of our stock at an average price of $57.41 a share for a total of $17.3 million.\nAs Alan mentioned, we'll be cautious in our approach to buybacks until we see evidence that markets are well into their recovery stage.\nAs Alan also noted, given the uncertain market environment, we would -- we are withdrawing our 2020 guidance.\nWe're hopeful we'll be able to reinstate guidance with our Q2 earnings announcement, provided markets have stabilized.\nIn summary, Q1 was a strong quarter, highlighted by several financial records, including adjusted EBITDA.\nIf it were not for COVID-19, our Q1 results would have positioned us for the fourth straight year of profitable growth.\nWe have taken significant actions in response to the pandemic and are prepared to take additional steps in the event of a prolonged recovery.\nWe are focused on things we can control, carefully -- including carefully managing our costs, and pursuing new waste streams to feed our landfills and incinerators.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Joining me on the call today are Arsen Kitch, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Murphy, Chief Financial Officer.\nFinancial results for the fourth quarter of 2020 were released shortly after today's market close.\nOn a consolidated basis, the company reported net sales for the fourth quarter of $453 million and adjusted EBITDA of $72 million.\nWhich represents growth of approximately 4% and 38%, respectively, over the fourth quarter of last year.\nA few business highlights to mention.\nOur tissue business drove results with both higher sales and production volumes year-over-year to meet volatile demand, which exceeded our expectations.\nOur production in the quarter was similar to our sales.\nOur paperboard business delivered strong performance as well.\nOur backlogs are robust, which contributed to our decision to announce a price increase of $50 per ton across our SBS portfolio, starting on February 2.\nIn the fourth quarter, we used the free cash flows generated to reduce net debt by an additional $58 million.\nOn slide four, as I noted over the previous quarters, we remain focused on our top priorities during COVID, the health and safety of our people and safely operating our assets to service our customers.\nOur efforts and risk mitigation strategies are making a difference in helping to reduce the risk of COVID at our sites.\nOur human resources and manufacturing leadership teams are doing an exceptional job of proactively monitoring the health of our workforce and ensuring that we have the proper staffing levels in place.\nOur people's diligence to date has been key to our success and will continue to be so.\nAs a recognition of the work by our entire team during this challenging time, we paid out a onetime discretionary bonus of $1,000 in November to over 2,800 of our people.\nWe're also strongly encouraging all our people to get the COVID vaccine with a $200 incentive.\nI would like to express my deepest gratitude to our entire team for their extraordinary efforts and perseverance through this challenging time.\nAs we start to see the benefits from a broader vaccine rollout, I want to encourage maintaining high levels of vigilance until COVID is under control and behind us.\nI will now share what we saw for both the tissue and paperboard businesses in the fourth quarter.\nLet's start with our Consumer Products division on slide five.\nAs we had previously noted, at home tissue demand was volatile during the quarter.\nNew waves of the pandemic caused significant spikes in demand mid-November through mid-December.\nWhile we originally anticipated demand at or below levels that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2019, we were reminded of how unpredictable demand can be for essential products during this time.\nMike will expand further on demand patterns in the fourth quarter during his comments.\nOur team and customers are doing a great job working through this volatility, and we benefited from higher-than-anticipated sales and production volumes in the fourth quarter.\nOur industry view remains largely the same, which I'll summarize in a few key points to provide some context.\nFirst, recall that the market for tissue in the U.S. is traditionally 2/3 at-home and 1/3 away-from-home, with limited manufacturing production capability to swing between the 2.\nAs consumers have been more homebound, there has been a shift toward at-home consumption.\nDemand swings have and will continue to be driven by consumer behavior.\nOur expectation is that as COVID vaccines are administered and infection rates decrease, that we will see a shift back to away-from-home consumption, which we expect will negatively impact us as we're primarily focused on the at-home market.\nWith that said, it is unclear if there will be a lasting impact on consumer behavior in a post COVID environment.\nSecond, while it is too early to discern private branded share trends, we continue to note that paper towel demand is tracking ahead of the overall tissue category, while facial demand is lagging.\nPrivate brands have had a good track record of gaining share relative to branded products over the past decade, a trend that we would expect to continue.\nWe will continue to monitor these trends in the coming months and quarters due to the continued uncertainty in consumer demand associated with COVID.\nThird, as we noted in previous quarters, SKU rationalization has occurred, aiding additional production.\nWe believe that lower SKU counts benefit both retailers and manufacturers like us.\nWhile we have seen some customers desiring a recovery of SKUs, we do not anticipate SKU counts to go back to pre-COVID levels in the near to medium term.\nOur tissue results in the fourth quarter were robust.\nWe shipped 13.9 million cases, which was up around 5.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.\nSales were down 4.2% relative to the third quarter of 2020.\nAs we mentioned on our third quarter earnings call, we exited several customers to reduce complexity and improve our network, which impacted the fourth quarter results and is expected to impact first quarter 2021 results as well.\nWe are encouraged by our pipeline of sales for the remainder of 2021.\nAs you recall, we estimate that approximately 2/3 of paperboard demand is derived from products that are more recession-resilient and 1/3 is driven by economically -- by more economically sensitive or discretionary products.\nOur folding carton customers, especially those with concentrations in food or healthcare packaging, continue to see strong demand and our food service customers, especially those with concentrations in quick service restaurants and away-from-home dining, continue to see weaker demand.\nWe are pleased with the market reception of our sustainability focused brands of Nuvo Cup and ReMagine folding carton.\nBoth are playing a meaningful role in our favorable market position.\nWe're encouraged by our solid performance in the quarter and continued strong demand for our products.\nWe made an announcement last week about the natural gas curtailment in Arkansas that caused us to temporarily suspend production in Cypress Bend.\nNatural gas deliveries were curtailed to the point where we could no longer operate.\nWe estimate that the costs associated with the weather event across our paperboard system, including loss production, repairs and spikes in natural gas prices, could impact us in the first quarter by approximately $6 million to $8 million.\nWe continue to experience the same fundamental supply and demand dynamics that led us to announce a $50 per ton price increase in January.\nDemand remains robust and our backlogs have grown since beginning of the year.\nPrice increase implementation has begun, and we expect that it will take several more months to fully implement the increase.\nThe consolidated company summary income statement shows fourth quarter as well as the full year 2020 and 2019.\nIn the fourth quarter, diluted net income per share was $1.34 per share and adjusted EBITDA was $71.6 million and full year diluted net income per share was $4.61 per share, and adjusted EBITDA was $283.2 million.\nThese represent significant increases over the prior periods, which were driven by tissue demand due in large part by consumer COVID-related behavior as well as the benefits from our Shelby investment, favorable raw material pricing and the lack of a major planned outage in our paperboard division.\nThe corresponding segment results are on slide eight.\nOur paperboard business continued its strong adjusted EBITDA performance, while consumer products benefited from significant sales growth and fixed cost leverage associated with production growth and favorable input costs.\nBefore we speak in more detail about our divisional performance, I want to note changes in how we portray our financial bridges.\nPreviously, we have shown the impact of production volume changes and associated fixed cost leverage impact in our cost category.\nWe have modified that approach and are including production volume changes in our volume category.\nWe believe that this change will enable investors to better understand sales changes as we expect to produce similar quantities of product that we sell, which will all be in the volume category.\nThe cost category will better reflect the changes in raw material input pricing and inflation.\nThis sheeting is a service that distorts our sales price of our base paperboard products.\nAdditionally, we have decided to make some accounting changes that will impact our financials starting in 2021, but we want to note them for you today.\nYou can also review these changes and the pro forma impact in our 8-K filing.\nOur bail pulp sales from our Lewiston mill to third parties have been recorded in our tissue business.\nThese sales will now be recorded in our paperboard business.\nBail pulp sales from Lewiston to our tissue operations will be transferred at market price going forward as opposed to cost.\nWe believe this change will better reflect the economics associated with the business.\nWe will still transfer pulp from the Lewiston pulp mill to the Lewiston tissue operations at cost given the located nature of these assets.\nAs a reminder, in the second quarter of 2019, we started our new Shelby, North Carolina paper machine and incurred, as anticipated, start-up costs related to lower production throughput, higher waste and other costs which persisted during the remainder of 2019.\nWe achieved the targeted production rate of our new paper machine in the second quarter of 2020 and we're continuing to capture the benefits associated with the project, including ramping our converting lines, realizing supply chain savings and achieving sales wins and mix improvements.\nWhile we are not providing a specific dollar amount for these costs and benefits, the continued realization of the Shelby investment is an important factor in our performance improvement.\nOur mix continues to improve as Shelby has come online, more than offsetting some year-over-year price impacts.\nWe're benefiting from the volume increases related to the production ramp, which helped to meet elevated demand.\nOverall, lower input costs, improved mix and fixed cost leverage from increased production possibly impacted our tissue business in the fourth quarter of 2020 relative to the fourth quarter of 2019.\nYou can also review a comparison of our fourth quarter 2020 performance relative to third quarter 2020 on slide 17 of the appendix.\nslide 10 contains some additional context on tissue related to the volatility of demand and its impact on our financial performance.\nThe IRI panel data, which is a snapshot of retail sales of tissue measured in dollars depicts what our customers and we have observed from consumer demand patterns, with the line showing changes on a year-over-year basis, while the data in the box shows a quarterly review versus last year.\nAs we exited the third quarter, we anticipated an elevated but stable demand pattern.\nBased on that demand profile, ample inventory levels at our customers, and slowing demand from our customers in October, we expect to see softness in our fourth quarter sales.\nBut the consumer-driven demand spike in mid-November into December, that changed rapidly.\nThis period of volatility, both the October pullback, which we noted on our third quarter earnings call, and strong orders in November and December, are a good reminder that we may not return to a stable order pattern until after COVID-related volatility is behind us, impacting our ability to forecast the business.\nWe added an additional slide in the appendix of the supplemental materials that details the weekly volatility in IRI panel data that our customers and supply chain have experienced.\nOur sales in the fourth quarter were 13.9 million cases, representing a unit decline of 4.2% versus the third quarter and unit growth of 5.3% versus prior year.\nOur production in the quarter was $13.9 million cases or down 9% versus the third quarter and up 2.4% versus prior year.\nProduction levels have benefited from the Shelby ramp and SKU rationalization.\nThe cost leverage from the significant increase in production, along with improved costs in freight and logistics, led to continued strong results year-over-year.\nSlide 11 is a year-over-year adjusted EBITDA comparison for our paperboard business.\nLower pricing, which RISI reported in February 2020, was partly offset by favorable mix.\nThe absence of a planned major outage at our Cypress Bend mill was also a driver of year-over-year improvement.\nOverall, our team ran our operations well in the quarter and continued to deliver strong results.\nYou can review a comparison of our fourth quarter 2020 performance relative to third quarter 2020 performance on slide 18 in the appendix.\nSlide 12 provides a perspective on our first quarter outlook and some other key drivers for full year 2021.\nAs previously discussed, tissue outlook is largely a function of sales demand.\nTissue shipments in January were 4.6 million cases, and our shipments in February are trending to below four million cases.\nAt this pace, we are expecting first quarter shipments to be below levels experienced in the first quarter of 2020, when COVID initially impacted consumer buying patterns, and down versus the fourth quarter of 2020.\nAs we mentioned previously, our paperboard business announced a price increase of $50 a ton across our SBS grades effective February 2.\nGiven the nature of our agreements and discussions with customers, we expect that the benefit of this will be reflected in the next couple of quarters with limited benefit expected in Q1.\nThe unexpected weather-related outage at our Arkansas mill, which caused loss production and repairs as well as natural gas price increases across our paperboard system, is expected to negatively impact the quarter by approximately $6 million to $8 million.\nIf our assumptions are correct, we would anticipate the first quarter adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $51 million to $59 million.\nThis range also assumes that we continue to operate our assets without significant COVID-related disruptions.\nWhile we are not prepared to provide specific annual guidance for 2021 and there are several drivers, assumptions and variables that we would like to address.\nWe are expecting a positive impact from the previously announced SBS price increases.\nWe are anticipating tissue volumes to drop high single to low double-digit percentages.\nThis assumes continued normalization of consumer buying patterns, but is highly dependent upon the course of the pandemic.\nWe are encouraged by our sales pipeline, which we anticipate will have a positive impact on the second part of the year.\nPaperboard volumes are expected to be largely stable.\nWe are expecting higher input costs, including pulp, packaging, energy and freight.\nWhile these variables are difficult to predict today, raw material inputs in total could be a $40 million to $50 million headwind this year, with more than half the total coming from pulp.\nIn our paperboard business, planned major maintenance outages are expected to reduce our earnings for 2021 compared to 2020 by $25 million to $30 million.\nWe have updated this guidance on slide 23, where we broke out the timing by quarter, which reflects our current plan.\nIn light of the Cypress Bend weather event, we're evaluating timing of our outage schedule and may update you in the coming quarters.\nFor the full year 2021, we're also anticipating the following: interest expense between $38 million and $40 million.\nDepreciation is expected to be between $106 million and $110 million.\nCapital expenditures are expected to be between $60 million and $65 million, which is closer to historical trends as we expect to execute against some projects that were delayed in 2020.\nAnd our effective tax rate is expected to be 25% to 26%, and we expect to utilize some of our current tax attributes which amount to $60 million to reduce cash taxes.\nSlide 13 outlines our capital structure.\nWe utilized approximately $50 million of free cash flow to reduce our net debt, including making voluntary prepayments on our term loan, and our liquidity was $250 million at the end of the year.\nWe continue to make strides in reducing our net debt and increasing our financial flexibility as we target a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times, assuming adjusted EBITDA after COVID benefits and with a normal amount of outages.\nBefore wrapping up with our value proposition, I wanted to reflect on some of our key accomplishments in 2020 on slide 14.\nOur team did an outstanding job managing through COVID.\nWe mitigated risks in our facilities with a focus on health and safety and continue to run our assets and serve our customers.\nWe rapidly adjusted to demand volatility to build stronger relationships with customers.\nWe ramped our new Shelby paper machine and are on track to fully ramp the overall site by the end of this year.\nWe delivered outstanding financial results, reduced net debt by $200 million, refinanced our near-term debt maturities and strengthen our balance sheet.\nAt the same time, we went through several leadership transitions, including my promotion to CEO, a hiring of a new CFO and a new leader of our CPD business.\nIt was certainly an interesting year to say the least, and I'm proud that we make this many changes and perform at the levels that we did.\nWe believe we're well positioned heading into 2021 to continue driving an improvement in our business and focusing on our near-term strategy of paying down debt while deleverage -- while developing options for long-term capital allocation.\nI would like to reiterate our value proposition, which we discussed on our previous earnings call and mentioned to investors throughout the quarter.\nWe believe Clearwater Paper is very well positioned across two attractive and complementary businesses.\nOur Consumer Products division is a leader within the growing private branded tissue market.\nFrom our vantage point, we believe the key strengths of this business are the following: first, we have a national footprint with an ability to supply a wide range of product categories and quality tiers.\nWhich is an attractive sales proposition to our customers.\nOur expertise in manufacturing, supply chain and transportation is a key differentiator, especially during challenging times like today.\nSecond, there are long-term trends away from branded products to private brands.\nThese have typically been amplified during recessions.\nPrivate brand tissue share in the U.S. rose to over 30% in 2019, up from 18% in 2011.\nWhile these trends are impressive, we're still a long way from where many European countries are where private brands represent over half of total tissue share.\nLastly, tissue is an economically resilient and a need-based product.\nHistorically, demand has not been negatively impacted by economic uncertainty.\nTurning to our paperboard division.\nWe believe that the key strengths of this business are the following: first, we operated well invested assets with a geographic footprint, enabling us to efficiently service customers on both coasts.\nWe have a diverse customer base, which serves end markets that have largely stable demand.\nSecond, not being vertically integrated enables us to focus on independent customers with unparalleled service and quality commitments.\nThird, we believe the business is well positioned to take advantage of trends toward more sustainable packaging and food service products.\nLastly, our paperboard business has demonstrated an ability to generate good margins and solid cash flows.\nOverall, our large capital investments are behind us, and we're prioritizing cash flows to reduce debt.\nAs we demonstrated in the fourth quarter, with a net debt reduction of approximately $58 million, bringing our net reduction in 2020 to over $200 million.\nWe intend to continue to deleverage by delivering benefits from our Shelby investment, continuing operational improvements, aggressively managing working capital and prudently allocating capital.\nWhile we expect to have lower tissue shipments in the first part of the year, we're making sound strategic moves to support our customers and their success and continue to position our business for success in the long term.\nWe believe that this strategy is the best way to create shareholder value.\nWith an adjusted EBITDA impacted by normal outages and reduced COVID benefits, we do not anticipate achieving our 2.5 leverage target this year.\nWe continually engage with our Board on future capital allocations.\nBeyond deleveraging, we expect to explore a variety of means of creating shareholder value, including: first, internal investments in our operation that improve competitiveness.\nSecond, external investments that deliver synergies and improve our market position; and third, returning capital to our shareholders.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:This is John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer.\nActual results could differ materially from these statements.\nI will provide commentary on our Q4 and full-year performance as well as our 2021 guidance before turning it over to Noel for his thoughts on how we are planning to sustain our growth momentum into 2021.\nWe will then open it up for Q&A.\nAs usual, we request that you limit yourself to one question so that as many people as possible get to ask a question.\nWe finished 2020 in very strong fashion with our highest level of quarterly organic sales growth in over 10 years and our highest annual organic sales growth since the depths of the financial crisis.\nImportantly, we continue to deliver balanced growth, which we think is the key to sustainable strong performance.\nFor both the quarter and the year, we delivered both volume and pricing growth, organic growth in all four of our categories: oral care, personal care, home care, and pet nutrition, and organic sales growth in every division with both emerging markets and developed markets performing well.\nOur strategy to deliver more impactful premium innovation is still in its early stages, but we believe the results are beginning to show.\nImportantly, this growth is driving our income statement.\nWe delivered strong gross margin expansion for both the quarter and the year, which allowed us to deliver profitable growth despite significant investments for future growth and the headwinds from foreign exchange.\nOur net sales grew 7.5% in the quarter.\nOrganic sales growth of 8.5% was driven by 5% organic volume growth and a 3.5% increase in prices.\nThe impact of acquisitions added an additional 100 basis points to volume growth, while foreign exchange was a 2% headwind.\nIn the fourth quarter, our gross profit margin was 61.1% on both a GAAP basis where we were up 100 basis points year over year and a base business basis where we were up 90 basis points.\nFor the fourth quarter, pricing was 130 basis points favorable to gross margin while raw materials were a 320 basis-point headwind driven by increases in the cost of raw materials like fats and oils and the transactional impact from foreign exchange.\nProductivity was a 280 basis-point benefit.\nOn a GAAP basis, our SG&A was up 260 basis points as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter and 100 basis points for the full year.\nOn the base business basis, in the fourth quarter, our SG&A was up 310 basis points on a percent of sales basis.\nThis was primarily driven by a 210 basis-point increase in advertising to sales as we drove strong activation on brand building, innovation, and e-commerce.\nOur SG&A ratio was also impacted by increased logistics costs, primarily in the U.S., and investments behind growth and innovation.\nFor the full year on a base business basis, our SG&A ratio was up 150 basis points driven primarily by a 100 basis-point increase in advertising to sales and increased logistics cost.\nFor the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis, our operating profit was up 4% year over year, while it was up 3% on a base business basis.\nOur earnings per share was flat on a GAAP basis and up 5% on a base business basis.\nFor the full year, our earnings per share growth was 14% on a GAAP basis and 8% on a base business basis.\nWe delivered 18% growth in free cash flow for the full year.\nAs we discussed at the beginning of 2020, we used some of the free cash flow to pay down debt primarily related to the Filorga transaction with the balance used for dividends and share repurchases.\nA few comments on our divisional performance.\nNorth America delivered 10% net sales and 8.5% organic sales growth in the quarter, driven by premium innovation and increased consumption in categories impacted by the COVID pandemic.\nWe also benefited from a rebound in performance by our skin health businesses in the quarter.\nOur e-commerce business in North America finished the year strongly with sales in the fourth quarter more than double last year's sales.\nNorth America saw significant increases in brand support behind the hum by Colgate Electric Brush, the Colgate Optic White Overnight Teeth Whitening pen, our toothpaste business, and Irish Spring.\nLatin American net sales were down low single-digit as double-digit organic sales growth was more than offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange.\nThe strong organic sales growth performance was broad-based as we delivered organic sales growth in every hub for both the quarter and the year.\nOral care innovation has been a key growth driver with Colgate Tartar Control, Luminous White Charcoal, and our Natural Extracts line, all driving incremental growth.\nEurope delivered double-digit net sales growth in the quarter.\nOrganic sales growth of 4.5% was driven by volume growth across all three segments; oral care, personal care, and home care, and in every hub.\nStrong oral care volume growth on the Colgate and elmex brands was accompanied by significant brand-building investment in traditional media and digital.\nWe were also encouraged by a return to organic growth for Filorga where a strong China growth more than offset weakness in the travel retail channel.\nWe delivered 7% net sales and 5% organic sales growth in Asia Pacific led by volume growth across our biggest hubs; Greater China, India, the Philippines, and South Pacific.\nIn India and China, our growth strategies are driving improved toothpaste performance through Colgate Miracle Repair in China, Colgate Vedshakti in India, and our relaunched Colgate Anticavity business across the division.\nOur personal care and home care businesses also benefited from COVID-related demand in the South Pacific region.\nAfrica/Eurasia net sales declined 1.5% due to significant foreign exchange headwinds as the division delivered organic sales growth across all three categories and in every hub.\nToothpaste organic sales growth was led by Colgate Herbal, Colgate Maxfresh, and Colgate Total.\nMeridol also delivered strong growth as we look to gain share in the pharmacy channel.\nHill's finished the year with another quarter of strong net sales and organic sales growth despite continued difficult comparisons.\nOrganic sales growth was again led by the US with e-commerce up significantly.\nBut Europe also delivered double-digit growth.\nEncouragingly, we are seeing a reacceleration in our Prescription Diet business as vet channel traffic continues to improve.\nAnd now for guidance.\nWe expect organic sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% long-term target range.\nUsing current spot rates, we expect foreign exchange to be a low-single-digit benefit for the year, although we expect currencies to remain volatile.\nWe expect net sales to be up 4% to 7%.\nWe expect our gross profit margin to be up year over year in 2021 despite difficult comparisons given our performance in 2020, increases in raw materials, and the continuing uncertainty associated with COVID.\nAdvertising is also expected to be up on a percent of sales basis, although less so than in 2020.\nOur tax rate is expected to be between 23.5% to 24.5% on both the GAAP and base business basis.\nWe point out that our guidance range does not account for any changes in the U.S. corporate tax rates given the recent change in administration.\nOn a GAAP basis, we expect earnings-per-share growth in the low-to-mid single digits.\nOn a base business basis, we expect earnings-per-share growth in the mid-to-high single digits.\nObviously, this is a wider range than what we normally provide, which we think is prudent given what we consider to be a heightened level of uncertainty as we plan out the year.\nThere are several factors that could impact where we fall within this wider range.\nIn the categories where consumption has risen during the pandemic, primarily liquid hand soap, dish soap, and cleaners, we are expecting lower rates of growth or even declines year over year in 2021 depending on the market.\nHowever, we expect overall consumption in these categories to remain elevated versus 2019 levels.\nAlso, particularly in emerging markets, movements in foreign exchange could impact our ability to take pricing.\nWe are optimistic about our pricing plans for 2021 and believe they are appropriate given recent raw material trends, the competitive environment, and foreign exchange.\nRaw materials, we have budgeted for increased raw material costs, but we do highlight that many raw material prices are accelerating faster than anticipated.\nIf this continues, it could put pressure on gross margin expansion depending on our ability to take pricing or drive additional productivity.\nWe've seen a further rise in logistics costs over the past few quarters, particularly in the U.S., but also related to shipping containers in Asia.\nWe expect these costs to remain elevated in the near term but to moderate later in the year.\nLike me, I hope you and your families are safe and healthy and you share some sense of optimism that we can return to a more normal existence over the course of this year.\nStan joined us back in November, as we announced, and obviously, we're deeply excited to have him here.\nHe has hit the ground running already.\nAs I reflected on 2020, I'm so proud of the Colgate people around the world and what they've accomplished.\nOn our first quarter call I discussed three topics related to how we plan to manage through the crisis.\nThese three topics were: staying true to our values and purpose in helping us navigate a very difficult environment; adapting our strategies where necessary and executing with agility; and importantly, managing through the crisis with an eye toward the future.\nOn the first topic, we've implemented programs to keep our employees safe and healthy, while keeping our supply chain and our laboratories up and running and delivering record output from our facilities and our R&D organization.\nNothing is more important than the safety and health of Colgate people, and we will continue in 2021 to keep them as our first priority.\nWe worked with the World Health Organization this year and local hospitals to distribute free health and hygiene products to people all over the world to help stop the spread of COVID and enable people to live healthier lives, programs that Colgate people are deeply proud of.\nIn the second area, we continue to execute on our growth mindset strategy to drive sustainable, profitable growth through more impactful premium innovation, which you'll hear more about at CAGNY, increasing our brand building globally, and executing against our digital transformation.\nAnd as John laid out, we did this all while delivering strong and balanced growth in organic net sales, net sales, operating profit, earnings per share, and free cash flow.\nWe were able to achieve those results despite many operating challenges we confronted and a sizable negative impact from foreign exchange.\nBut most importantly, while we've been delivering on 2020 results, we have been very focused on positioning ourselves for growth in 2021 and beyond by taking advantage of our momentum, ad that was the third topic, managing through this crisis with an eye toward the future.\nSo now I'll provide some thoughts on why I believe what we did last year leaves us well positioned to continue our growth journey in 2021 and beyond.\nThere are three reasons: the first is that as an organization, we have truly changed how we think about growth.\nAs a company with leading brands, we have to be focused on driving category growth, and we can drive this growth in many ways.\nOf course, we can increase the number of people buying our products, we can increase the price that people are willing to pay for our products, and we can increase the frequency of how often people use our products.\nSo we have strengthened existing tools and, importantly, built new capabilities to drive this growth.\nFor example, on Hill's, we're reaching a much larger group of consumers through increased advertising to broaden our reach and improving our digital targeting so we can raise brand awareness and household penetration on what is truly a differentiated brand.\nThink about this as finding the right person with the right message at the right time.\nIt's not just spending more, but spending smarter.\nIn Latin America, we have used revenue growth management tools to drive value with price/mix improvement in a very difficult operating environment.\nFor instance, our share of the premium segment in toothpaste in Brazil has expanded by three points in the last two years, all driven by tactful and strategic revenue growth management.\nAs I discussed at the Barclays Conference, we have disrupted our innovation processes to focus on breakthrough and transformational innovation, which will enable us to increase the frequency of how people use our products and purchase our products.\nSuperior performance, new forms, delivery systems, and innovation for new channels, all allow us to expand our availability to the consumer so they can choose our products more frequently.\nAnd given that Colgate brand has the highest household penetration of any consumer brand in the world, we have a unique ability to leverage our presence into faster growth.\nThe second reason is that we're developing a balanced view of how we deliver profitable growth.\nWe know that in order to deliver a TSR that is in the top tier of our peer group, we can't just grow the top line.\nWe need to deliver profitable growth.\nYou can see this in our 2020 results where we delivered 8% earnings-per-share growth despite negative foreign exchange, while increasing brand building and investing in capabilities across the entire organization.\nWe're doing this by pulling on all the levers: premium innovation, revenue growth management, funding the growth, discipline on overheads, and laser focus on all cost elements throughout the income statement.\nLooking forward, we have to do more than offset the expected increases in raw material costs and logistics and in other areas so that we can continue to invest in the transformation capabilities that we're deploying and that will rely on pairing growth and productivity more effectively.\nThe third reason is that we're making the necessary transformation to our culture to unleash the true potential of Colgate people.\nAs anyone who has come here from the outside can tell you, the desire of Colgate people to win is unmatched.\nIn 2020, we took several steps to accelerate the rate of change to build an organization for future growth.\nTo that end, we made real progress on e-commerce where we have brought in more external talent while upskilling existing talent across the enterprise, launched more online-specific innovation, like the Optic White pen, the Miracle Repair serum, and invested broadly behind enhanced digital capabilities.\nAnd all this paid off in more than 50% online growth in the fourth quarter and we'll exit the year with e-commerce at a double-digit run rate as a percentage of total sales.\nAnd lastly, it's building out the right team.\nYou need to provide the right tools to them, the right technology to digitally transform the organization.\nWe continue to invest in systems to enable this transformation.\nLike our transition SAP S/4HANA that's giving us better system speed, far better reporting, streamlined processes, and simplified transactions.\nWe've developed our cloud capabilities, which is giving us far more agility, speed, and capability building our ability now to develop applications must faster and realize the value of those applications much faster; and with our partners, building support for our data and our analytics journey ahead.\nWe also recently rolled out a new global system with our Colgate Business Planning process.\nYou will remember that was called CBP that will significantly reduce the process time required by providing greater opportunity for our teams to do analytics, particularly in the commercial area and particularly around revenue growth management.\nSo to sum it up, when I look back at 2020 as a year where our company battled through uncertainty to deliver really strong results, I will also look back at a year where we elevated our performance and capabilities and positioned ourselves to deliver sustainable, profitable growth into the future.\nSummary: ",

detail.\nIn the first quarter, we released $1.6 billion of allowance.\nThe release was driven by strong credit performance across all of our businesses and a more favorable economic outlook that includes the $1.9 trillion stimulus package passed in March.\nOur allowance continues to assume that the relationship between economic metrics and credit performance reverts to historical patterns.\nAnd despite the strong credit performance and more favorable economic outlook, we continue to hold significant qualitative factors to account for a number of remaining uncertainties.\nTurning to Slide 5, I'll provide some detail on the allowance coverage by segment.\nAfter the impact of the $1.6 billion allowance release, our coverage levels declined modestly across all segments from the prior quarter and remain well above pre-pandemic levels.\nOur domestic card coverage is now 10.5%, down from 10.8% last quarter.\nOur branded card coverage is 12.1%.\nRecall that the difference between branded and domestic coverage is driven by the law-sharing agreement in our partnership portfolio.\nCoverage in our consumer business declined 38 basis points to 3.6%.\nAnd coverage in our commercial banking business fell 23 basis points to 2%.\nMoving to Slide 6, I'll discuss liquidity.\nYou can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the first quarter was 139%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement.\nOur liquidity reserves from cash, securities, and federal home loan bank capacity ended the quarter at approximately $151 billion.\nThe $7 billion increase in total liquidity is largely attributable to strong inflows of consumer and commercial deposits in the last few weeks of the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 7, I'll discuss our net interest margin.\nNIM declined six basis points in the linked quarter due to a 14-basis-point headwind from having two less days in the quarter, as well as a higher mix of cash.\nThese factors were partially offset by the full quarter effect of deposit pricing actions we took in the fourth quarter and a modest increase in loan yields.\nLastly, turning to Slide 8, I will cover our capital position.\nOur common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.6% at the end of the first quarter, up 90 basis points from the fourth quarter and 260 basis points higher than a year ago.\nWe continue to estimate that our CET1 capital need is around 11%.\nRecall that in January, our board of directors authorized a repurchase plan of up to $7.5 billion of the company's common stock.\nIn the first quarter, we repurchased $400 million of -- $490 million of common stock at an average price of approximately $114 per share.\nBased on the Fed's extension of the trailing four-quarter average earnings rule, our share repurchase capacity will be limited to approximately $1.7 billion in the second quarter.\nThe timing and amount of all future stock repurchase activity will be a function of any regulatory restrictions, stock trading volumes, and our holistic view of our capital position.\nI'll begin on Slide 10 with our credit card business.\nYear over year, credit card loan balances and revenue declined in the first quarter driven by the continuing impacts of the pandemic.\nPurchase volume rebounded compared to the first quarter of 2020.\nAnd the biggest driver of quarterly results was the provision for credit losses, which improved significantly.\nCredit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends, which we show on Slide 11.\nFor the third consecutive quarter, the story of our domestic card business continues to be two sides of the same coin.\nHistorically, high payment rates amplified by the effects of government stimulus continue to put pressure on loan balances.\nAnd on the flip side, the same factors are driving exceptional credit performance.\nLooking first at growth.\nWe continued to see purchase volume rebound from the sharp declines early in the pandemic.\nDomestic card purchase volume for the first quarter was up 8.4% year over year, with growth accelerating in March.\nCompared to the first quarter of 2019, purchase volume is up 17%.\nMost spend categories are now exceeding the pre-pandemic levels we saw in 2019.\nT&E spend is still lagging pre-pandemic levels, but it's catching up.\nT&E purchase volume is growing faster than overall purchase volume.\nThe payment rate, which has risen to a historically high level, continues to put pressure on loan balances, even with the pickup in consumer spending.\nAt the end of the first quarter, domestic card ending loan balances were down $18.5 billion or about 17% year over year.\nExcluding the impact of a partnership portfolio moved to held-for-sale last year, first-quarter ending loans declined about 15% year over year.\nThe year-over-year percentage change in ending loan balances this quarter was approximately the same as it was last quarter.\nStrikingly strong credit was the biggest driver of domestic card financial results in the quarter, just as it has been for the prior two quarters.\nThe domestic card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.54%, a 214-basis-point improvement year over year.\nThe 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 2.24%, 145 basis points better than the prior year.\nFirst-quarter provision for credit losses improved by nearly $4 billion year over year.\nWe had a large allowance release in the first quarter of this year versus a large allowance build in the first quarter last year.\nStrong credit and purchase volume growth were also key drivers of domestic card revenue margin, which was up 229 basis points year over year to 17.2%.\nTotal company marketing was up modestly compared to the first quarter of 2020.\nOur choices in card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends.\nIn the midst of the pandemic, we're finding opportunities to continue to build the business, and we continue to lean into marketing.\nPulling up, our domestic card business is delivering significant value and building momentum.\nSlide 12 summarizes first-quarter results for our consumer banking business.\nAuto growth continued strength in retail deposits and exceptional auto credit are the main themes in the first-quarter consumer banking results.\nDriven by auto, first-quarter ending loans increased 10% year over year in the consumer banking business.\nAverage loans grew 9%.\nAuto originations were up 16% year over year, and up 20% from the linked quarter.\nWe've seen competitive intensity increase through the second half of 2020 and in the first quarter of 2021.\nAnd with most competitors holding excess deposits, we expect that competitive intensity will continue to increase going forward.\nFirst-quarter ending deposits in the consumer banking were up $36.4 billion, or 17% year over year.\nAverage deposits were up 16%.\nOn a linked-quarter basis, ending deposits were up 2% and average deposits were flat.\nElevated consumer savings rates, fueled by continuing government stimulus, are driving year-over-year deposit growth.\nFirst-quarter consumer banking revenue increased 22% from the prior-year quarter, driven by growth in auto loans and retail deposits.\nFirst-quarter provision for credit losses improved by $986 million year over year, driven by an allowance release and lower charge-offs in our auto business.\nCredit results in our auto business are strikingly strong and continue to benefit from historically high auction values and government stimulus.\nYear over year, the first-quarter charge-off rate improved 104 basis points to 0.47%, and the delinquency rate improved 217 basis points to 3.12%.\nA sharp uptick in used car values, coupled with a stimulus-driven surge in customer payments, resulted in a negative net charge-off rate in March.\nWe expect the auto charge-off rate to increase from its unusually low level as auction prices normalize and stimulus impact play out.\nThe consumer banking business continues to deliver resilient growth in auto loans and retail deposits.\nMoving to Slide 13.\nI'll discuss our commercial banking business.\nFirst-quarter ending loan balances were down 9% year over year.\nAverage loans were down 3%.\nIn C&I, we've seen a reduction in commercial line utilization, which peaked early in the pandemic as customers facing elevated uncertainty drew down their lines.\nThat behavior has since diminished.\nIn our commercial real estate business, originations were down, and pay downs increased compared to the first quarter of 2020.\nQuarterly average deposits increased 24% from the first quarter of 2020 and 4% from the linked quarter as middle market and government customers continued to hold elevated levels of liquidity.\nFirst-quarter revenue was up 4% from the prior-year quarter.\nHigher loan and deposit spreads and growth in average deposits were partially offset by lower average loan balances.\nProvision for credit losses improved significantly compared to the first quarter of 2020, driven by a swing from an allowance build to an allowance release and lower net charge-offs.\nFor the first quarter, the commercial banking annualized charge-off rate was nine basis points.\nThe criticized performing loan rate was 9.2%, and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was 0.9%.\nOur commercial banking business is delivering solid performance as we continue to navigate the pandemic and build our commercial capabilities.\nI'll close tonight with some thoughts on our results and our strategic positioning.\nThree key themes are evident in our first-quarter results.\nHigh payment rates continue to put near-term pressure on loan balances and revenue growth, particularly in our domestic card business.\nOn the flip side, strikingly strong credit drove a third consecutive quarter of record earnings per share.\nAnd our investments to transform our technology and transform how we work are paying off.\nOur modern technology is powering our response to the pandemic and putting us in a strong position for opportunities that emerge as sweeping digital change transforms banking.\nPulling way up, we continue to focus on the things that create enduring value when delivered and sustained over the long term, continuing to transform our technology from the ground up, capitalizing on our transformation to drive innovation and growth, generating positive operating leverage, and improving efficiency over time, and managing capital efficiently and effectively, including significant planned capital distribution.\nWe'll now start the Q&A session.\nAs a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question plus a single follow-up.\nAnd if you have follow-up questions after the Q&A session, the investor relations team will be available after the call.\nKeith, please start the Q&A.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We appreciate you joining us today to review our first quarter 2021 results.\nWe announced our financial results for the quarter yesterday.\nAs you saw, our strong financial results indicate we continued growing and operating effectively, serving our customers, identifying and finalizing new investment projects and keeping our employees as safe as possible.\nAs shown on Slide 2, participating with me on the call today are Jeff Householder, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Moriarty, Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Corporate Secretary and Chief Policy and Risk Officer.\nWe also have other members of our management team joining us virtually.\nWe've had a very strong start to 2021 with continued profitable growth initiatives across our business units.\nAs shown on Slide 4, earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.96, an increase of $0.19 or 10.7% compared to our first quarter 2020 earnings per share of $1.77.\nGross margin increased more than $17 million over the first quarter of 2020.\nOur results were driven by growth across the Company.\nWe also experienced increased consumer consumption resulting from weather that more closely resembled normal temperatures.\nSome of the key margin drivers included: pipeline expansion projects; the Hurricane Michael regulatory settlement; organic natural gas distribution customer growth; contributions from Elkton Gas and Western Natural Gas; increased retail propane margins per gallon; and increased business in Marlin Gas Services.\nAs our General Counsel, Jim Moriarty, is fond of saying, we are the beneficiaries of geography.\nWe're fortunate to provide energy delivery services to communities that are experiencing significant growth.\n[Technical Issues] initiatives that signal support for continued expansion of our systems in Florida.\nIn all of our service areas, the demand for natural gas, propane and electricity has never been higher.\nWe continued to see customer additions at a rate that's more than twice the national average.\nIn the past year, our utility distribution and customer count increased by 7.4%.\nGrowth opportunities to serve new customers was the primary driver of our capital investment in the first quarter.\nWe projected capital investments for 2021 at approximately $200 million, and we're on track to achieve that target.\nOur first quarter capital investment totaled just under $49 million.\nEarlier today, our Board of Directors have approved an annualized dividend payment of $1.92 per share, a $0.16 per share or 9.1% dividend increase.\nThe $0.16 per share increase in the annualized dividend closely aligns our five-year earnings growth rate of 9.4% through December 31, 2020, with our five-year dividend growth rate of 9.5%, as shown on Slide 5, including this most recent increase.\nThe Board's decision to raise the dividend reflects the Company's ongoing commitment to dividend growth that is supported by earnings growth, while maintaining a payout ratio that enables our healthy reinvestment of earnings for growth and ensures liquidity to fund operations.\nChesapeake Utilities has paid dividends to its shareholders without interruption for 60 years and has increased its annualized dividend every year since 2004.\nI will add more about our continued growth initiatives and capital investment projects across our business units in just a few minutes.\nTurning to Slide 6, net income from continuing operations for the quarter was $34.5 million compared to $29 million for the same quarter of last year.\nThis represents a growth in net income of $5.5 million or approximately 19%.\nAs I'm sure you all recall, during the fourth quarter of 2019, we exited the natural gas marketing business and recognized gains on the sales associated with that exit.\nThere were some minor lingering impact associated with the sales of this business both in 2020 and also the first quarter of 2021.\nAs a result, I will focus our discussion today largely on continuing operation.\nEPS from continuing operations for the first quarter compared to the first quarter last year grew by $0.19 to $1.96 per share from $1.77, representing growth of just under 11%.\nGrowth initiatives and customer consumption drove the growth rate in net income by 19%, while the earnings per share growth rate of 11% is a result of the significant amount of equity we successfully issued in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 via the ATM program and our various stock plans.\nHigher income was the result of increased performance across the enterprise, as Jeff mentioned earlier, coupled with continued expense management, business efficiencies, and standardization and collaboration across the Company.\nGross margin increased 17.1% compared to the first quarter last year, while operating income grew, because of these impacts, by 22.5%.\nAs Slide 7 also highlights, the growth in operating income was fairly split between the two segments, Regulated Energy and Unregulated Energy, for the quarter.\nThe key drivers of gross margin and expenses for quarter one compared to quarter one of last year are highlighted on Slide 8.\nGross margin net of specific expense attributes grew $0.65 per share after tax.\nHigher earnings for the quarter reflect increased earnings across the business from: first, customer consumption, as Jeff mentioned primarily weather focused, was $0.26 per share; pipeline expansion projects another $0.11 per share; higher retail propane margins per gallon increased margin by $0.06 per share; organic growth in our natural gas distribution operations added $0.04 per share; contributions from recent acquisitions, including Elkton Gas and Western Natural Gas added $0.04 per share; the Hurricane Michael regulatory settlement also added $0.04 per share after associated depreciation and amortization of associated regulatory assets; and margin from Marlin increased by $0.03 per share; lastly, from our Florida GRIP Reliability and Infrastructure Program, we added $0.02 per share.\nThese increases were offset by the absence of property sales that occurred in the first quarter of last year, which represented $0.14 per share and the increased shares we added, that I just referred to, another $0.12 per share.\nGiven our opportunistic equity issuances over the past 12 months to take advantage of our strong equity market position.\nFinally, depreciation, payroll and facilities expenses basically drove our earnings per share down by $0.20 per share because of the growth in our business.\nI would like to spend a few minutes highlighting our capital spending thus far in 2021.\nAs you can see though first on Slide 9, the forecast for 2021 capital expenditures remains at our previously announced guidance of $175 million to $200 million.\nAgain, the investment is concentrated with approximately 80% budgeted in new regulated energy assets.\nYear-to-date, as Jeff mentioned, we've invested just under $49 million in new capital investments.\nSo, what are some of the key 2021 projects?\nThey include our Delmarva Natural Gas Distribution expansion into Somerset County; Eastern Shore's Del-Mar Energy Pathway project, which is well under way; Florida's Western Palm Beach County; Florida expansion; our Florida GRIP program; and other natural gas distribution and transmission system projects.\nIn addition, we have expenditures for natural gas and electric system infrastructure improvement activities, Marlin Gas Services expansion of their CNG transport and their expansion into RNG and LNG, and technology system in support of our business transformation and other strategic initiatives and investments.\nTo support the growth we have experienced and ensure we have the capital capacity to fuel our future growth, we maintain a strong balance sheet with access to sufficient competitively priced capital.\nAs you can see on Slide 10, as of the end of March, total capitalization was $1.4 billion, comprised of: approximately 52% stockholders' equity, which is now $726 million; we had 37% in long-term debt at an average fixed rate of 3.62%; and $156 million in short-term debt under our revolver at an average interest rate of 1.2%.\nOur recent equity issuance moved this further along within our target equity to total capitalization range.\nWe continue to utilize our traditional equity plans this year to issue stock and increase equity beyond our earnings retained and reinvest it in the business.\nChesapeake Utilities current market capitalization is approximately $2 billion.\nAs Beth noted, our capital capacity and the strength of our balance sheet continues to support growth.\nWe're very comfortable that our previously updated capital guidance remains on target.\nSlide 11 is a reminder from earlier earnings calls of the key strategic initiatives that focus our project development and transaction interest.\nAs I noted a moment ago, we continue to experience significant demand for the energy services, provided by our existing business units.\nLet me highlight a few of our major initiatives on Slide 12.\nA significant portion of projected capital investment is devoted to expanding our existing core businesses.\nWe also have several relatively small-scale transmission pipeline projects under development that will potentially increase investment in this area.\nOur propane business continues to grow and we will keep looking for acquisition opportunities in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.\nAnd we see growth at Marlin Gas Services and in the rapidly developing renewable natural gas market that I'll discuss in greater detail in a few moments.\nI'm running [Phonetic] this margin table showing key projects and initiatives, as shown on Slide 13, including pipeline expansion, CNG, RNG transportation, acquisitions and regulatory initiatives.\nKey projects are expected to generate approximately $60 million and $67 million in gross margin for the years 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nPipeline expansions are expected to generate $6.7 million in incremental margin in 2021.\nThe Hurricane Michael proceeding settlement will again generate $11 million in gross margin in 2021, it remains at that level in 2022.\nWe're particularly pleased with the full integration of margin estimates of $5.8 million and $6.1 million for 2021 and 2022, respectively, from the acquisitions of Elkton Gas and Western Natural Gas.\nIn total, the incremental margin growth from these key projects and initiatives represents approximately $14.1 million for 2021 and $7.5 million for 2022.\nAs a reminder, we only include definitive projects in this table once they reach maturity, and do not include organic margin growth from our traditional distribution, customer additions, rate adjustments in our unregulated businesses, etc.\nAccordingly, the RNG transportation margin, for example, will be adjusted as new projects are definitive and announced.\nI realized that we've included a $1 million placeholder for RNG transportation on the slide for a couple of quarters, and have not yet disclosed the extent of anticipated RNG production-related investments.\nThese projects take considerable time to develop, especially related to securing full project financing.\nThat reminds me of the early days of solar and wind project financing.\nHowever, there is positive movement on RNG project financing as interest increases among both financial and strategic participants, and we're hopeful that more details of the projects we're involved in can be made public over the next several weeks.\nAs a final note, the Auburndale Pipeline, $679,000 and Boulden acquisition $3.9 million became fully in service in 2020, so these ongoing mature projects have been removed from this table.\nOver the past several quarters, we've outlined a number of renewable natural gas initiatives.\nTo begin, Slide 14 outlines the types of projects and ownership structures that we are actively assessing.\nLet me provide an update on our progress for several of these initiatives.\nWe continue to work with CleanBay renewables on two utility scale poultry waste, RNG and organic fertilizer production facilities on the Delmarva Peninsula.\nWe previously described our existing agreement with CleanBay to own the gas processing equipment at the Westover Maryland facility, with an option to convert the equipment investment to equity in the total plant.\nLast month, our Board Investment Committee authorized management to negotiate economic and governance terms with CleanBay with Chesapeake's equity participation in the project.\nWe hope to finalize an agreement with CleanBay and other equity providers over the coming weeks, and ensure that the anticipated project in-service date of Q4 2023 remains viable.\nIn addition to the Westover RNG facility, we're in discussions with CleanBay and other potential investors on a second Delmarva RNG facility, which is under development in Sussex County, Delaware.\nSimilar to the Westover plant, the Sussex facility will produce RNG at a utility scale along with organic fertilizer.\nThe property for the Sussex plant has been acquired and most land use permits have been approved.\nUpon completion, the Westover and Sussex plants will be among the largest RNG facilities in the country.\nAs you may recall, we have several additional investments either under contract or in final negotiations associated with the Westover plant.\nThe Marlin Gas Transport agreement is in place, an interconnect agreement with our Eastern Shore Natural Gas transmission pipeline has been finalized, and the interconnect scheduled for construction in conjunction with the in-service date of the Westover plant.\nOur Delmarva distribution business has finalized an agreement for off-take the [Indecipherable] RNG from Westover to purchase non-frac non-fossil RNG molecules for distributions to our -- distribution, excuse me, to our customers.\nIn addition to purchasing RNG from Westover's production, our Delmarva distribution operations will provide conventional gas supply service to Westover to support driving the organic fertilizer produced by the plant.\nIt's a lot of fertilizer and a lot of natural gas.\nWestover will likely become our largest Maryland gas distribution customer.\nEastern Shore Natural Gas Del-Mar Energy Pathway expansion project currently under construction and our related distribution system expansion will bring our pipelines to within 1.5 mile of the Westover plant, and we will extend the distribution system to provide service.\nWe anticipate providing similar Marlin and conventional gas distribution services to the CleanBay Sussex site.\nChesapeake is exploring opportunities to develop renewable electric micro-grids at both the Westover and Sussex RNG sites.\nWe're working with a third party to potentially develop solar photovoltaic generation systems to serve the electric needs of the RNG facilities.\nProperty suitable for solar PV installation is owned respectively by the third party in close proximity to the Westover site, and similarly by Chesapeake close to the Sussex site.\nChesapeake has engaged Southern Company Energy Services and Southern's PowerSecure Company to assist in preliminary design and engineering of the solar PV systems, battery storage, protection protocols for the plants and related facilities to support in renewable electric micro-grid at each facility.\nOn Delmarva, we continue to work with the Bioenergy DevCo Company as they also move forward on development of a poultry waste RNG facility in Sussex County, Delaware.\nThe County Commission has recently approved the Bioenergy DevCo conditional land use permit.\nChesapeake will own and operate the gas processing equipment at the plant site.\nWe've ordered the processor from [Indecipherable], retained an EPC contractor and are in the process of finalizing design on various other components.\nOur investment in the project is estimated at approximately $12 million, with in-service anticipated in late 2022.\nConstruction of our Savannah public compressed natural gas vehicle fueling and Marlin staging [Phonetic] facility continues to proceed on schedule for an October 2021 in service.\nThe station will be the larger CNG fueling facility on the East Coast, with capacity to fuel approximately 185 semi-trucks per day.\nWe've recently held a meeting with representatives of several Georgia-based trucking firms where interest in CNG was high and interest in the potential of providing renewable CNG at that facility was even higher.\nWe're working on several RNG marketers along with exploring opportunities to develop regional CNG production to serve the Savannah station.\nSpeaking of Marlin, we're just wrapping up an eight-month deployment to serve the City of Miami transit bus fleet.\nAt peak, we were fueling 160 CNG buses a day before the permanent pipeline and CNG fueling facilities were put in place.\nMarlin CNG Service enabled early delivery of the buses and an earlier than anticipated significant reduction in diesel emissions.\nMarlin has also taken delivery of its new four-stage compressor unit.\nThe compressor enables Marlin to offer a methane capture service to pipelines and utilities that need to remove a pipeline segment from service to provide maintenance or system integrity work.\nRather than releasing the methane to the atmosphere, Marlin can receive the gas at almost any line pressure, compress it to CNG pressures, and transfer it to a tanker.\nThe gas can then be reintroduced into another point on the pipeline system.\nMarlin also taken delivery of its first four LNG tankers.\nThe increased capacity of LNG transport provides an expanded array of services for customers requiring larger gas quantities.\nAnd finally, we're continuing our fleet conversion at Marlin on diesel fuel to compressed natural gas.\nEight new CNG tractor cabs will be delivered in July.\nI mentioned in our fourth quarter call that we were supporting a hydrogen research project proposed to the Department of Energy by Solar Turbines.\nWe've offered our Eight Flags CHP turbine on Amelia Island as a test site and we're also working with several of our existing industrial customers to identify opportunities for hydrogen blends at their facilities.\nWe're just at the beginning stages of gaining a better understanding of hydrogen use from a safety operations impact, measurement, availability and the effects on downstream customer equipment.\nIt is great to be with you today.\nI would like to begin by providing an update on certain legislative actions in Florida.\nAs shown on Slide 15, the energy pre-emption bill is key legislation that maintains consumer choice toward the ongoing availability and use of natural gas as an affordable, reliable and resilient energy resource.\nNatural gas will be available to meet increasing customer demand.\nIn addition, we sponsored a renewable energy bill, which is cleared both chambers of the Florida Legislature, and is before the governor for signature.\nThis bill defines biogas, renewable natural gas.\nIt supports RNG's use in transportation, electric generation, and injection into gas distribution systems.\nThe bill also authorizes the PSC to approve cost recovery for RNG contracts that exceed market rates under certain conditions.\nWhen signed by the governor, Florida will join a dozen other states that have endorsed the vibrant role of natural gas in meeting the growing energy needs of this nation.\nWe are proud of our governmental affairs team for driving and supporting such important legislation within the state of Florida to ensure natural gas is available to meet customer demand first and foremost, and to provide a mechanism for renewable natural gas via viable part of the natural gas portfolio throughout the state.\nWe're also at various stages in regards to working on similar legislation in our other jurisdictions, and we'll keep you apprised of future activities.\nAs shown on Slide 16, Chesapeake Utilities continues to build on our bedrock commitment to ESG, a focus on environmental stewardship, dedication to social justice, and sound governance principles.\nOur recognition as a top workplace for the ninth consecutive year in the areas we serve, as well as our recognition in the top workplace inaugural awards, speaks volumes about our diverse and inclusive culture, one which continues to promote the growth and development of our employees and the active engagement of our communities.\nStrong corporate governance has been essential to creating long-term value and safeguarding our commitments to all stakeholders.\nOur Board and its committees have adopted guidelines and other policies that have provided a framework for ongoing effective governance.\nActive and informed engagement, which is embedded in our people, beginning with our Board of Directors and extending throughout the Company, could not be more important as we continue together to chart the road ahead.\nStrong corporate governance also includes listening to our stockholders and monitoring the vote results annually.\nBased on this year's results, over 90% of the shares voted were in favor of the proposals presented before them.\nThis demonstrates our stockholders' continuing strong support of the performance of the Company and our future strategy.\nOur responsibility to operate in a safe and environmentally friendly manner furthers our stewardship and facilitates sustainable practices across our organization.\nOur team, with input from the Board of Directors, discusses key risks and mitigating factors identified as part of our comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management program.\nEmbedded within our ERM program, our ESG-related focus areas and emerging risks.\nTurning to Slide 17, in regards to safety, we are committed to providing a safe workplace for employees and to making safety a priority in our interactions with each other, our customers, and the communities we serve.\nThe achievement of superior safety performance is an important strategic initiative, both in the short term and the long term.\nSafety is not only our top priority and our first strategic objective, it is at the center of who we are.\nOne of our latest accomplishments in this regard is the completion of our safety town facility in Dover, Delaware, to provide both hands-on and classroom training for our operations technicians.\nWe are also diligently working on our inaugural Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability report, which will be made available during 2021.\nThere, we will be providing additional information and insights on our long-standing ESG stewardship.\nWe are committed to providing a work environment that values diversity and background, experiences, and skillset of all our employees as highlighted on Slide 18.\nIn continuing our bedrock commitment to equity, diversity and inclusion, our Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, or EDI Council, supports all our employees, embracing and sharing their diverse experiences and backgrounds with the mission to help improve the communities we serve and to make us a better company.\nThe EDI Council is central to who we are and who we want to be, and we will further enhance the collaboration around our workplace culture that is the engine driving our business.\nThe EDI Council was extremely busy in 2020, fostering the rollout of five employee resource groups throughout the Company, as shown on Slide 18.\nWe are excited about what these teams have done in just a short amount of time and look forward to their increasing role as well as the creation of other ERGs.\nThe talent, skills and ideas that these groups have brought to the forefront have been inspiring and provide channels for our employees to feel inclusive and supported by the Company.\nWe work hard every day to also ensure that the communities we serve continue receiving the value and benefits of clean, plentiful, affordable and resilient energy delivery services, so that no one is left behind.\nWe continue to undertake various internal actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including completion of our pipeline replacement program and improved detection technology at our compressor stations.\nWe are also working with our suppliers and contractors to encourage their environmental efforts.\nWe are also excited about the projects under way by our diverse and engaged teams to reduce the carbon footprint of the communities we serve, including conservation programs that promote high efficiency appliances and technical assistance for large volume customers to identify emission reduction opportunities.\nOur commitment remains steadfast to take the steps necessary to deliver energy where and when it is needed while continuing to advance our environmental stewardship.\nOur announced projects in RNG are just the beginning.\nThey are a very clear example of the lowering of the carbon footprint and also ensuring we do our best to ensure a more sustainable future for our local communities.\nWhile we're beginning fiscal year of 2021 with very positive financial performance, as indicated by our earnings-per-share growth, capital investments, key projects and initiatives, and our dividend growth, as you can see on Slides 19 and 20, we're affirming our five-year capital guidance for the period of 2021 to 2025 at $750 million to $1 billion.\nI'm excited that our latest strategic plan update gives us a high degree of confidence that we have significant investment opportunities ahead of us.\nThat confidence in our growth opportunities has enabled us to extend and expand our capital guidance.\nOur 2025 earnings per share guidance range of $6.05 to $6.25 per share represents an average earnings per share growth of approximately 10% from our initiation of guidance at the end of 2017.\nWe believe natural gas is a key component to the country's long-term energy strategy.\nWe also believe that the markets we serve value the energy services we deliver; whether natural gas or propane or electricity, our customers have spoken loudly in this regard.\nAt the same time, we have opportunities given our business mix expertise and strategic approach to capitalize on new renewable energy opportunities that advance us toward a more sustainable future.\nWe're committed to our growth strategy.\nFocused on delivering top quartile performance, including shareholder return, which has exceeded 16% compound annual growth for each period, one, three, five, 10 and 20 years through April 30, 2021.\nOur investment proposition is based upon a commitment to superior performance and we outlined that on Slide 21.\nOur foundation, our financial objectives and targets, as well as the initiatives and strategies we pursue are in support of achieving this level of performance.\nWe take great pride in the work done on the front lines and our ongoing commitment to identifying and delivering innovative solutions for the delivery of clean, reliable and safe energy to our customers.\nAnd we can now address any questions you may have.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Carter's is making good progress, recovering from the market disruption caused by the pandemic.\nWe achieved a record gross profit margin in the quarter with improved price realization and fewer and better promotions.\nWe reduced our spending and inventories below prior year levels.\nWe also strengthened cash flow and liquidity in the quarter and gained market share.\nWith respect to business trends, we got off to a good start in July with sales running more than 90% of prior year sales.\nWe had substantially all of our stores opened heading into the 4th of July weekend and retail sales over that holiday shopping period comped up 7%.\nIn August, we saw sales trend to about 87% of prior year sales as schools delayed reopening.\nWith children starting their school year learning virtually at home, there was less of a need to shop for back-to-school outfits.\nSeptember was the largest month so far this year in sales and earnings contribution.\nSeptember sales ramped up to 95% of prior year sales.\nThat's the best performance we've seen since the pandemic began to impact us in March.\nOur Labor Day holiday sales were the strongest in the past three years, with comparable retail sales up 15% during that shopping period.\nAnd in October, sales are trending over 90% of prior year sales.\nWith respect to product performance, we continue to see good demand for our baby apparel and sleepwear product offerings.\nOur baby apparel and sleepwear contributed about 70% of our total apparel sales.\nWe own five times the share of our nearest competitors in each of these product markets.\nOur playwear sales improved in July as families prepared for the beginning of a new school year.\nSales dipped in August when it became clear that schools would not reopen and then rebounded in September as consumers shopped for cooler weather outfitting.\nWe launched our Little Baby Basics product offering in late June to coincide with the store reopenings.\nThis is the core of our baby product offerings and the best-selling newborn apparel in the United States.\nIt's a high-margin replenishment program and one of our strongest performing launches in recent years.\nReplenishment trends since the launch are much better than last year.\nIn the third quarter, our retail sales improved to 97% of third quarter sales last year.\nThat's the strongest recovery in sales relative to our Wholesale and International segments.\nUnderstandably, the pandemic has accelerated the shift to online purchases.\nWith fewer store visits, we reduced our hours of store operations by over 20% in the quarter.\nOn a per hour basis, our store sales were better than last year.\nThough store traffic was lower, we saw higher conversion rates and higher units purchased per transaction.\nWe believe those better metrics reflect the strength of our product offerings, our compelling value proposition and a high service level provided by our store associates.\nOur stores that historically benefited from tourism, including international guests, saw the largest decline in traffic.\nThese stores only represent about 11% of our U.S. stores, but drove about 40% of the decline in comparable sales in the quarter.\nUntil tourism and cross-border travel resume to pre-pandemic levels, these stores will likely underperform our other stores.\nGiven the mix and level of eCommerce inventories, we were less promotional than last year.\nAnd as a result, we significantly improved price realization and eCommerce profitability in the quarter.\nSimilar to our store experience, online demand from international customers continues to trend lower than last year.\nThe biggest declines in demand were from Brazil, Argentina and Europe.\nHistorically, these were three of our best sources of international demand on our U.S. websites.\nThese markets were particularly hard hit by the pandemic and stronger dollar.\nWe continue to benefit from significant investments made in recent years in our online shopping experience.\nIn the third quarter, our stores fulfilled 24% of our eCommerce orders.\nWe've invested in technology that helps us optimize the profitability and speed of delivering those purchases.\nTo improve the convenience of shopping with us, we now offer same-day pickup and curbside pickup services in over 600 of our stores in the United States.\nThese new omni-channel services are margin accretive relative to shipping from our distribution center to the consumer's home.\nOur omni-channel customers, those who enjoy both the online and in-store experience, are our highest value customers with annual spending more than twice that of our single-channel customer.\nGoing forward, we expect our stores will play an important role supporting our eCommerce customers.\nCurrently, about 85% of our stores in the United States are located in open air centers, which we believe gives us an advantage relative to our mall-based competitors.\nOpen Air centers provide a better, more convenient experience for same-day pickup and curbside pickup of online purchases.\nWe plan to continue opening stores located in more densely populated areas and plan to close stores in more remote and declining centers.\nWe currently plan to open less than 100 co-branded stores over the next five years.\nWe also plan to close about 25% of our stores as leases expire.\nNearly 60% of those closures may occur by the end of next year.\n80% of those closures are planned by the end of 2022.\nThese are generally older, lower margin stores in declining centers and less likely to support our focus on high-value omni-channel customers.\nCarter's is an attractive tenant.\nOur brands are viewed as traffic drivers and bring families with young children into the shopping centers.\nAs other retailers struggle and downsize, new and more attractive real estate opportunities become available to us.\nIt's a buyer's market, and we plan to pursue those better opportunities in better centers that provide convenience for our consumers and a high-return on investment for our shareholders.\nOur Wholesale business also showed good progress recovering from store closures earlier this year.\nSales in the third quarter were about 86% of prior year sales.\nThe operating margin on those sales was better than last year.\nIn the third quarter, we had growth with three of our top-five wholesale customers.\nWe continue to see good growth with our exclusive brands with sales collectively up 10%.\nE-commerce demand for our brands through our wholesale customers was up over 40% in the third quarter, including triple-digit growth rates with some of our exclusive brands.\nThe trend in online demand improved each month in the quarter.\nTogether with our wholesale customers, the online purchases of our brands is up over 50% year-to-date.\nWithin the next few weeks, we expect to achieve a new milestone for our company with annual online purchases of our brands exceeding $1 billion this year.\nOur Carter's brand wholesale sales were down about 25% in the quarter, driven by retailers cautiously planning for second half sales and our decision earlier this year to curtail fall and holiday inventory commitments.\nGenerally speaking, most of our wholesale customers are lean on inventories, seeing better sell-throughs, higher margins and in a chase mode, given better-than-expected demand for our brands.\nGiven the pandemic-related uncertainty in consumer demand, we believe operating with leaner inventories is a better strategy through the balance of this year, even if it comes at the expense of fewer sales.\nOur decision to run lean around inventories may impact second half wholesale sales by as much as $50 million or less than 3% of our total second half sales.\nOne benefit of running leaner on inventories this year is fewer low-margin sales to off-price retailers.\nOur sales to off-price retailers were down 18% in the quarter and down over 50% year-to-date.\nWe use our stores and websites in the United States and Canada to sell through excess inventories which were caused by store closures and related wholesale order cancellations earlier this year.\nAs a result, we offer consumers a compelling value through our stores and websites and avoided losses that would have been incurred, selling the excess inventory to off-price retailers.\nInternational sales in the quarter were about 90% of last year's sales and contributed over 13% of our total company sales, which is comparable to last year.\nThe strength of our International segment is in our direct-to-consumer business, which represented over two-thirds of our international sales in the quarter.\nWe saw high single-digit growth in our retail sales, driven by a nearly 70% increase in eCommerce sales in Canada and Mexico.\nMany of our international wholesale relationships are with several smaller retailers, representing our brands throughout the world.\nThese retailers have historically been a good source of sales and profitability.\nThey've been particularly hard hit by the pandemic, stronger dollar and other local market challenges.\nWe currently expect that sales to these wholesale customers will be the slowest to recover from the global pandemic.\nJust for context, these customers contributed less than 2% of our company's annual sales in 2019.\nWe expect a better recovery with our multinational retailers, including Walmart, Costco and Amazon.\nAmazon is seeing good performance from its expansion of our Simple Joys brand in Europe this past year.\nThat should be a good source of growth for us in the years ahead.\nWith respect to our supply chain, our team did an excellent job working with our suppliers to reduce our exposure to excess inventories.\nInventories at the end of September were down over 10% compared to last year.\nAs we shared with you in July, we're seeing delays in the receipt of products from Asia.\nWe believe those delays were caused by reduced capacity by carriers earlier this year when demand slowed due to store closures.\nThe delays also reflect inadequate capacity to support the surge in demand when stores reopened this summer and the precautions being taken to keep manufacturing and transportation workers protected from the coronavirus.\nThey have been very supportive and recognize that the delays are a function of the market disruption.\nAs we head into the holidays, the flow of products has improved, and we do not expect shipping delays to have a material impact on fourth quarter sales.\nWe're also managing the exposure to freight surcharges imposed by inbound and outbound carriers due to the surge in eCommerce sales and constrained capacity.\nOur best analysis suggests these surcharges may impact fourth quarter earnings by about $2 million.\nWith lower input costs and excess manufacturing capacity in Asia, our supply chain team has negotiated lower product costs for spring 2021.\nDemand for that product offering is planned comparable to last year, and the related shipments began later this quarter.\nIn summary, we're making good progress recovering from the disruption caused by the pandemic.\nWe've endured a historically challenging market this past year with the unprecedented scope and duration of store closures, record unemployment and a highly contagious and deadly virus.\nWe expect the road ahead will be bumpy.\nThat said, we believe we have a strong product offering and good marketing plans as we head into the final weeks of the year.\nNo one knows how long the market disruption will last.\nWhat we do know is that the fundamental strength of our brands and business model should help us continue to weather the storm.\nWe own the largest share of the young children's apparel markets in the United States and Canada with twice the share of our nearest competitors.\nChildren's apparel is a less discretionary purchase.\nWe focus on essential core products bought in multiple quantities on a frequent basis in those early years of a child's life.\nOur average price points are less than $10, providing a great value to consumers in a weaker economic environment.\nWe are the largest supplier of children's apparel to the largest retailers in the United States.\nWe are also the largest young children's apparel specialty retailer with one of the strongest and most profitable eCommerce platforms in children's apparel.\nI'm grateful for their commitment to strengthen our brands and to serve the needs of families with young children.\nOver the next few months, we will refresh our growth plans based on our experiences this year.\nBased on our current estimates, we are planning good growth in sales and earnings next year.\nI'll begin on Page 2 with our GAAP income statement for the third quarter.\nAs Mike noted, our third quarter results were meaningfully better than we had planned.\nNet sales in the quarter were $865 million, down 8% from last year.\nReported operating income was $114 million, an increase of 35%.\nAnd reported earnings per share was $1.85 compared to $1.34 a year ago, representing growth of 38%.\nOur third quarter and year-to-date results for both 2020 and 2019 contained unusual items, which we've detailed on Page 3.\nWe've treated these items as non-GAAP adjustments to our reported results to enable greater comparability.\nMy remarks today will speak to our results on an adjusted basis, which excludes these unusual items.\nMoving to Page 4 and our adjusted P&L for the third quarter.\nNet sales declined 8% to $865 million, which is a meaningful improvement over the 30% decline we saw in the second quarter.\nWe continue to see strong demand online with our U.S. eCommerce business achieving a 17% comp and eCommerce comps in Canada up nearly 60%.\nWhile gross profit dollars declined 5% due to lower sales, gross margin rate improved by 180 basis points versus last year to 44.4%.\nThis represented record quarterly gross margin and was driven by improved price realization and continued progress in reducing excess inventory.\nRoyalty income was roughly comparable to last year at $9 million.\nSpending was very well managed during the quarter.\nAdjusted SG&A declined to $24 million or 8% across a broad range of expense categories.\nAdjusted operating income grew 4% to $120 million and adjusted operating margin expanded 160 basis points to 13.8%, driven by our strong gross margin performance and management of spending.\nBelow line, we had higher net interest expense than last year due to the $500 million in new senior notes which we issued earlier this year.\nWe had other income of approximately $3 million in the quarter, largely foreign currency gains.\nAnd our effective tax rate was about 19% in the quarter, up from about 18% last year.\nAverage share count declined 2%, driven by share repurchases in 2019.\nRecall that we suspended share repurchases earlier this year as part of our liquidity improvement initiatives.\nSo, on the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share grew 5% to $1.96, up from $1.87 last year.\nTurning to Page 5 with some balance sheet and cash flow highlights.\nOur balance sheet and liquidity remained very strong.\nTotal liquidity at the end of the third quarter was nearly $1.6 billion, with over $800 million of cash on hand and virtually all of the borrowing capacity under our $750 million credit facility available to us.\nWith all of the uncertainty of the current environment, we believe that having substantial liquidity, as we clearly do, is a strategic advantage for Carter's.\nAs Mike said, we ended the quarter with inventories 11% lower than the year ago.\nWe believe the quality of our inventory is high overall.\nWe've made good progress in reducing excess inventory, although we're still working through some excess spring product, particularly in our stores.\nWe're currently planning net inventories at the end of the year to be roughly comparable with a year ago.\nOur Q3 accounts receivable balance declined 10% compared to last year, which reflects lower wholesale sales.\nAccounts payable were $473 million at quarter-end compared to $206 million a year ago.\nThis increase reflects the successful extension of payment terms and rent deferrals.\nWe continue to receive strong support from our vendors and landlords as we collectively manage through the disruptions caused by the pandemic.\nLong-term debt was $1 billion, up from $770 million in the third quarter of last year, which reflects our successful senior notes financing transaction in May and lower revolver borrowings.\nIn the third quarter, we repaid $244 million, which represented all of the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility.\nWhen considering our meaningful cash position, net debt at the end of the third quarter was $158 million compared to over $600 million at the end of Q3 last years.\nBased on our current outlook, we believe we will have ample liquidity for the foreseeable future as our business continues to recover from the pandemic.\nDespite year-to-date net income, which is lower than last year, our operating cash flow was very strong at $320 million compared to $73 million last year.\nThis increase reflects improved working capital, including lower inventory and the successful extension of vendor payment terms, which I've described.\nTurning to Page 7 with a summary of our business segment results for the third quarter.\nWhile sales were down, profitability in each of our business segments improved in the third quarter, and our consolidated adjusted operating margin expanded by 160 basis points over last year.\nTurning to Page 8, with third quarter results for our U.S. retail segment.\nTotal segment sales declined 3% compared to last year.\nAs Mike mentioned, we saw good demand over the Fourth of July and Labor Day holiday selling periods.\nFor the quarter, total retail comparable sales declined 3.5%, reflecting strong eCommerce growth of 17% and lower store sales.\nSeptember, which is the largest month of the year in our business, had particularly strong performance, with comparable store sales down only slightly versus last year.\nStore traffic continued to be a challenge for us and the broader industry.\nConsumers are understandably cautious, especially as we see virus counts rising again in many areas of the country.\nOur store traffic in the third quarter exceeded the industry benchmark, which we follow.\nWhile traffic was down, we saw improved conversion and higher transaction values in our stores in the third quarter.\nThe adjusted operating margin of our retail segment improved by 50 basis points to 11.4%, driven by improved price realization, especially online, and our improved inventory position and good control of spending.\nTurning to Page 9.\nConsumers continued to take advantage of our omni-channel capabilities in the third quarter.\nWe've worked to optimize our stores to make it convenient for customers to arrive and quickly pick up their online orders.\nMany customers are also taking advantage of curbside pickup, which is a new capability for us.\nOverall, the synergy and integration between our eCommerce business and our nationwide network of convenient and easy to shop stores continue to grow.\nOn Page 10, all of our recent marketing efforts continue to be highly integrated with our presence on social media.\nIn the third quarter, we built on our leadership position by adding more followers on Instagram and Facebook than our largest peers in children's apparel combined.\nOn Page 11, we had particularly high engagement in September with two specific promotional events.\nWith the pandemic, many families weren't able to take their usual end of summer vacation, around Labor Day.\nRecognizing this, we held the promotion to give away staycation packages to families.\nThis promotion generated the highest ever social engagement for the Carter's brand.\nWe also held a special celebration of the 125th birthday of the OshKosh B'gosh brand, which included the release of Special Limited-edition vintage overalls, in sizes for the entire family.\nThis promotion proved very productive as we sold out of the kid sizes of these special overalls within a few weeks.\nTurning to Page 12.\nAnother family tradition which has gone virtual, is the announcement that a new baby is on the way.\nDuring our Baby Love event in September, we gave away 10,000 Carter's body suits with the message -- \"2021, Looking Bright\", to celebrate the happy news of a new baby set to arrive in 2021.\nMoving to Page 13.\nSince the pandemic began, we've been providing families with ideas for activities, while they spend more time at home.\nWe recently initiated a twice a week email series for parents with toddlers and babies, with new ideas and tips for fall.\nThese communications have continued to deepen our relationships with our customers and reinforce that no brand understands parenthood better than Carter's.\nOn the next page, it seems clear that we will all be living with the reality of social distancing for a while longer.\nLike so many other things, the tradition of kids visiting Santa will be different this year, realizing that we've collaborated with the innovative and popular Cameo platform, in order to deliver personalized virtual messages from Santa to thousands of children for Christmas.\nOn the next several pages, we've included examples of some of our marketing for the holidays.\nMaybe this year, more than most families are looking forward to being together and celebrating the holidays.\nOn Page 15, we've seen strong demand for our holiday products.\nOn Page 16, Carter's is known for our pajamas, especially Christmas PJs, with sizes for everyone in the family.\nOn Page 17, we also have extensive offerings for special outfitting, for dress applications for the holidays.\nAnd this year, on Page 18, we have toys from Skip Hop and Carter's.\nIn the majority of our stores we will introduce special Santa's toy shops for the holiday season.\nMoving to Page 19, with a recap of U.S. wholesale results for the third quarter.\nWhile net sales were lower than last year, our sales were meaningfully better than we had expected.\nThe upside to our forecast was due to several factors.\nWe saw some earlier demand for fall product from several retailers, replenishment demand for Little Baby Basics was strong and the impact of the delay in the arrival of product, which we mentioned on our last call, was less severe than we had forecasted.\nAll of our wholesale customers are investing in and growing their online businesses, which has translated into strong demand for our brands.\nDemand for our exclusive brands at Target, Walmart and Amazon was strong in the third quarter, with combined sales growing 10% over last year.\nOur Skip Hop brand grew nicely in the wholesale channel this quarter.\nWith consumer spending more time at home, Skip Hop's Home Gear, Playtime and Bath Time products have proven very popular.\nAs Mike said, sales of the Carter's brand were down in the quarter, in part due to the fact that in the early days of the pandemic, we proactively canceled a good amount of fall and winter inventory commitments, and given that many customers have understandably chosen to run leaner on inventory in the current environment.\nShipments to the off-price channel declined meaningfully in the third quarter, as we're more effectively using our own retail channels to clear excess inventory.\nU.S. Wholesale adjusted segment income was $67 million in the third quarter compared to $73 million a year ago.\nAdjusted segment margin improved by 140 basis points to 22.3%, reflecting lower inventory-related charges which were partially offset by higher bad debt expense.\nOn Page 20, we launched our core Little Baby Basics collection annually.\nThis year, we did so in late June, which is somewhat later than normal.\nThese products are the everyday essentials that every parent of a newborn needs.\nWe're seeing very strong performance of Little Baby Basics this year.\nWe sell these signature products in multiple channels, including at some of our largest wholesale accounts, such as Kohl's and Macy's.\nPerformance in our own stores on carters.com and in our International business has also been strong.\nBeginning on Page 21, we've included a few slides that highlight our exclusive brands, which are available at Target, Walmart and Amazon.\nThe Just One You brand continues to enjoy good momentum.\nTarget has invested in several digital campaigns highlighting Just One You.\nThese campaigns have increased awareness of the brand among new and existing guests at Target.\nSleepwear for infant and toddlers has been a particularly productive category with plans for continued momentum in the fourth quarter with Christmas pajamas and a broad assortment of sibling dressing products.\nOn Page 22, on the Child of Mine brand at Walmart.\nIn the third quarter, eCommerce sales of Child of Mine more than doubled over last year.\nHere too, investments in brand marketing have driven good productivity and momentum in Child of Mine, which we expect will continue into the holiday selling period.\nFinally, on Page 23, our Simple Joys brand continues to resonate with consumers.\nWe have a strong partnership with Amazon and Simple Joys and Simple Joys has grown to be one of our largest brands.\nWe participated in another successful Prime Day recently, where we posted a significant increase in sales.\nThe Simple Joys assortment has expanded over the past few years and now includes Baby, Toddler and Pajamas up to size-eight as well as shoes and accessories.\nMoving to Page 24 and third quarter results for our International segment.\nInternational net sales declined 10% to $114 million.\nThis decrease was principally driven by lower wholesale shipments to markets outside of North America due in part to the stronger U.S. dollar as well as the disruptions caused by the global pandemic.\nCanada delivered a very good quarter overall, with retail comparable sales growing 7%.\nOnline demand continued to be strong with eCommerce comps up 58%.\nStore comps in Canada were down a bit, but the arrival of colder weather and good back-to-school demand helped boost sales.\nNet sales in our Mexico business were down year-over-year, reflecting a weaker peso and lower wholesale sales.\nWe're making good progress in the retail portion of the business in Mexico.\nOur new larger co-branded stores are performing well; and eCommerce, which we launched late last year, continues to post strong growth.\nInternational adjusted operating margin expanded 270 basis points to 15.8%, driven by strong performance in Canada that was partially offset by a lower contribution from our partners business.\nOn Page 25, we've included a photo of one of our newest stores in Mexico.\nThe store is our sixth larger format co-branded store.\nInitial consumer reaction has been very positive.\nIn Q3, this store has quickly become one of our best-performing locations in Mexico.\nOn Page 26, we've included pictures from the first three stand-alone Carter's stores in Brazil, two in Sao Paulo and one in Rio de Janeiro.\nThese stores are operated by Riachuelo, our exclusive partner in Brazil.\nAs many of you know, we've had a strong following by Brazilian consumers shopping with us in the United States over the years, so establishing a direct presence in this important market is a good step forward.\nEarly reaction from consumers to these new stores has been very positive.\nTurning to Page 27 with our outlook for the balance of the year.\nAs with last quarter and given the ongoing market disruption caused by the pandemic, we're not providing sales and earnings guidance today.\nWe expect that COVID-19 will continue to have a significant impact on our operations in the fourth quarter.\nWe're assuming that store traffic will continue to be lower than last year, and we're mindful of the risk of the resurgence of COVID-19 in key markets in North America.\nWe expect that online demand will continue to be strong in the fourth quarter, and we're planning for continued gross margin expansion.\nWe're tracking several other risks over the balance of the fourth quarter, including the broader macroeconomic environment, including unemployment and consumer confidence, as well as developments related to possible additional economic stimulus, and the upcoming elections.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'll begin by sharing a few thoughts on our business performance and our operations.\nAs mentioned on our last earnings call, we expected sales to improve in the third quarter.\nSales were $113.8 million in the quarter, down 2% in the third quarter of 2019 and up 35% sequentially.\nThird quarter gross margin was 32.4% compared to 32% in the same period in 2019, up 40 basis points and up 80 basis points sequentially from the second quarter of this year.\nThird quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.34, up 17% from $0.29 in the third quarter of last year and up from $0.18 in the second quarter of 2020.\nWe delivered an EBITDA -- an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19%, up 230 basis points from 16.7% in the second quarter of 2020.\nNew business wins were $127 million in the third quarter, and we added seven new customers.\nWe ended the quarter with $132 million in cash and $106 million in debt.\nOperationally, all our plants are running.\nWe continue to experience challenges at our Mexico locations.\nSince last quarter, those facilities have improved from approximately 60% capacity to more in the range of 90%.\nWe are monitoring local changes to COVID-19 restrictions at one of those facilities and at our Ostrava facility in Czech Republic.\nAshish Agrawal is with me for today's call and will take us through the safe harbor statement.\nTo the extent that today's discussion refers to any non-GAAP measures under Regulation G, the required explanations and reconciliations are available in the Investors section of the CTS website.\nI will now turn the discussion back over to our CEO, Kieran O'Sullivan.\nAs we navigate to COVID-19, our employees are supporting and helping the less fortunate in our local communities, something we're very proud of.\nOur employees also continue to demonstrate flexibility and responsiveness throughout our operations to support all customers.\nOur first focus continues to be the safety of our employees and compliance with state and local regulations.\nWe are adapting our business and processes to focus on our priorities, driving profitable growth, strengthening our go-to-market, enhancing our operational capabilities and advancing our leadership talent and culture.\nThe restructuring plan we announced on the last earnings call is progressing to plan and is expected to deliver an annualized earnings per share improvement of $0.22 to $0.26 by the second half of 2022.\nMore importantly, we are focused on returning to growth, targeting 10%, in line with our strategic plan, 5% organic and 5% through strategic acquisitions.\nWe remain focused on our strategic growth investments as part of our planning for 2025.\nGrowing our business and expanding our range of products that sense, connect and move is the priority.\nNew business awards were $127 million for the quarter, the best quarterly performance this year.\nWe added seven new customers in the quarter, four in industrial and one each in defense, medical and telecom.\nIn transportation, we were awarded a large passive safety sensor award for an electric vehicle application in the China market.\nWe also secured multiple OEM accelerated awards with customers in Asia, Europe and a global platform win with a North American OEM.\nThese recent wins are leveraging our inductive technology, which is a key enabler for growth to meet mid- and high-end product requirements.\nWe secured an additional ride height sensing award with the same customer.\nCumulative, EV and hybrid wins this year are approximately $75 million, and we expect further gains.\nLast quarter, we reported our first win with current sensing.\nWe aim to expand this application in other regions.\nIn defense, we were awarded contracts with several Tier one customers for sonar applications.\nMore recently, we developed and secured a new sample order for an ordinance application.\nIn Europe, we seek to gain share by building relationships with new customers.\nWe are leveraging our footprint and capabilities in Denmark and the Czech Republic, where we recently received sample orders with two new defense Tier one customers.\nWith temperature sensing, we secured a small initial order for an application in electric vehicles.\nThe sensor is part of the charging circuit for the battery management system.\nIn the precision frequency product line, we were selected for a design win in a 5G small cell application for systems in multiple countries, and also secured the distribution order.\nWe secured a multiyear design award for a low-power crystal product in a defense application.\nWe continue to advance product innovations.\nOur focus in the transportation market, as we have stated previously, is to develop sensor solutions that are agnostic to the underlying propulsion technology, strengthening our growth in the next decade as hybrid and electric vehicle penetration grows.\nEVs are expected to be less expensive than internal combustion engines in the 2025 time frame as battery costs decline.\n15

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm Susie Lisa, senior vice president of investor relations for CVS Health.\nToday's call is being broadcast on our website where it will be archived for one year.\nCVS Health has delivered another strong quarter and exceeded expectations.\nFor the third quarter in a row, we are raising adjusted earnings per share guidance.\nThroughout 2021, we have made progress executing our strategy to deliver an integrated healthcare experience centered around the consumer.\nWe sustained strong revenue growth in each of our core businesses helped improve health outcomes and reduce costs by broadening access to quality care.\nWe help fight the pandemic and reach millions of consumers with convenient, accessible care in communities across America.\nDuring the third quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 10%.\nThis double-digit growth was led by membership gains in both healthcare benefits and pharmacy services, as well as higher volume in retail.\nWe grew adjusted operating income by 12.5%.\nWe generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.97 and strong cash flow from operations of $5.5 billion.\nGiven these results and our outlook, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $7.90 to $8.\nThis higher guidance reflects the quarter's outperformance and continued positive momentum, which Shawn will discuss shortly.\nThird quarter results again demonstrate that our customers value how we bring together our unique portfolio of assets our deep healthcare expertise and vast consumer touchpoints to meet health needs.\nThere is strong demand for our integrated solutions across the healthcare continuum, including health management programs for chronic conditions, mental health support, pharmacy services, and health and wellness products.\nWe added over 1.3 million new integrated pharmacy and medical members through the 2021 and 2022 selling season.\nMore customers are seeking complementary health services that work together, such as virtual care.\nEarlier this year, CVS Health launched the first national Virtual Primary Care program.\nThis market-leading solution offers a national network of physicians virtually and access to convenient face-to-face care in our MinuteClinic locations when needed, often with 0 co-pay.\nOur program has grown to 30 customer accounts with over 750,000 eligible members as of January 1, 2022.\nThis is an indication of our ability to scale nationally and bring innovative products to the marketplace.\nOur customers recognize the importance of CVS Health Care Solutions and the ease of access we now provide in the community, the home, and virtually.\nOur high customer retention rates and new business wins are a testament to the strength of our business model.\nHealthcare benefits revenue increased 9.5% year over year.\nStrength in government services helped drive an adjusted operating income increase of 2.4% versus prior year despite higher costs related to COVID-19, net of deferred care primarily within our commercial book.\nWe generated sequential membership growth across all three product lines in the quarter: commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid.\nOur medical benefit ratio of 85.8% was above our expectations, driven by COVID-related costs, primarily driven by commercial.\nUnderlying non-COVID costs emerged in line with our expectations.\nWe believe aggregate medical costs will slightly exceed baseline levels for the full year.\nWe produced strong results in our Medicare business and grew membership both sequentially and year over year across all Medicare products.\nThis reflects our strong product portfolio, Stars performance, and reputation for service excellence.\nYear to date, Medicare Advantage membership has grown 9.2%.\nIn 2022, we anticipate we will achieve double-digit growth in individual Medicare and generate strong momentum in dual eligibles.\nOur strong performance in Stars continues, as you saw for 2022, with 87% of our members in Star plans rated four and higher, up from 83% in 2021.\nIn our commercial business, we expect moderate growth in 2022 for national accounts, driven by both increased sales, which are up approximately 50% year over year, and a 95% client retention rate.\nAs we mentioned earlier this year, we are reentering the individual exchanges in eight states as of January 2022.\nEnrollment began on Monday, and we anticipate our co-branded CVS Aetna offering and benefit design focused on consumer choice will result in gains of at least 100,000 new members in 2022.\nTurning to pharmacy services.\nWe delivered third quarter revenue growth of 9.3% and adjusted operating income growth of 9.5% year over year.\nFor the 2022 selling season, we achieved a 98% retention rate.\nWe drove $10.4 billion of growth new business, resulting in $8.9 billion of net new business wins, providing evidence of our market-leading trend management, transparency customer service, and integrated offerings.\nWe continue to be a leader in specialty pharmacy with programs that drive value in the marketplace provide substantive savings to customers and differentiate us as we pay our programs with digital assets.\nWe maintained a strong momentum this quarter with specialty revenue up 8.7% versus prior year.\nOur service excellence and top-tier execution are key areas of differentiation.\nOur retail segment continues to play a critical role as a local health destination for millions of Americans.\nRetail outperformed both expectations and the industry in the third quarter.\nWe delivered 10% revenue growth and 22% adjusted operating income growth year over year.\nPharmacy sales and prescriptions filled both increased 8% year over year, largely driven by COVID-19 vaccine administration and core pharmacy services.\nOur patient satisfaction scores remain high with approximately 90% satisfied with their experience in our CVS Health locations.\nWe continue to support millions of Americans for COVID-19 testing and vaccine administration.\nWe administered 11.6 million COVID-19 vaccines and 8.5 million COVID-19 tests in the quarter.\nSince our program began, we have administered 43 million vaccines and approximately 38 million tests.\nWe also expanded our digital capabilities to provide universal access to CVS Health vaccination records to the millions of adults we have vaccinated.\nThis new capability has driven over 1 million visits per month to vaccination records on cvs.com.\nThis provides another opportunity for us to build deeper engagement with our customers while simplifying and connecting their health experience.\nFront store sales momentum also continued with revenue growth of 13% versus prior year.\nFront store sales were led by consumer demand for COVID-19 home testing kits, as well as cough and cold products, with year-over-year volume increases across most front store categories.\nOur CVS Health retail presence consistently serves as a strong channel for capturing new lives.\nIn fact, this year, 12.5% of new COVID-19 testing customers chose to fill new prescriptions or receive a COVID-19 vaccination with CVS Health.\nFinally, we anticipate a benefit from administering boosters and pediatric doses to eligible consumers will occur largely in the fourth quarter of this year.\nWe continue to make measurable progress with our strategy to deliver a superior customer experience and address the total cost of care.\nWe have focused on several important areas.\nFirst, with our unique portfolio of businesses, we continue to expand our role in care delivery designed around the customer.\nWe are taking a proactive approach to meeting the emerging needs of customers, clients, and communities.\nWe are improving access, lowering costs, and combining local points of care to simplify the consumer health experience.\nWe have one of the country's largest network of physician extenders and are able to deliver care locally with our national footprint.\nWe will continue to drive higher engagement with customers as we evolve the format of select CVS locations, creating community health destinations, and shifting into three distinct models: sites dedicated to offering primary care services, an enhanced version of health hubs with products and services designed for everyday health and wellness needs.\nOur traditional CVS Pharmacy store model that provides prescription services and health and wellness and other convenient retail offerings.\nOur unique combination of businesses and our presence in communities nationwide enable us to meet consumers where they are to enhance their well-being and to be a bigger part of their wellness.\nNext, we are further strengthening the consumer experience through the expansion of digital services and platforms that connect to health services and in-person channels for our more than 35 million unique digital customers.\nFor example, more than 70% of CVS Pharmacy customers are enrolled in our text messaging programs today.\nWithin that group this quarter, adherence outreach drove 10% growth in prescriptions filled.\nGreater adherence leads to improved health outcomes and lower costs.\nIn today's hyper-connected digital consumer-driven world, the demand for omnichannel pharmacy is greater than ever.\nWe continue to modernize our operating systems and enhance the integration of pharmacy model simplifying consumer interactions and driving further engagement with our customers.\nFinally, we continue to invest in our employees as part of our workforce strategy.\nLast quarter, we announced the phased increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour by July 2022.\nWe invested in modernizing our training programs and technology for our frontline and clinical colleagues.\nDespite the tight labor market and anticipation of the higher demand for health services, we strengthened our workforce in every business.\nWe hired a record number of people in the third quarter to advance open enrollment and customer service, as well as enhance technology and clinical capabilities.\nNearly 20,000 pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and nurses recently joined the CVS Health team supporting flu season, as well as COVID-19 vaccinations and testing.\nOur pharmacists and pharmacy technicians are an integral part of our overall workforce strategy.\nWe are committed to investing in our pharmacists, awarding immunization bonuses in the second half of this year.\nWe look forward to sharing more about our strategy to improve access, quality, and customer engagement in investor day on December 9.\nOur commitment to shareholders, customers, and communities remain steadfast.\nHealth equity is critical as the pandemic continues to disproportionately impact certain communities.\nIn addition to targeted vaccine and booster education efforts, we provided 31 million meals this year to people suffering from food insecurity and invested in 2,800 affordable housing units in 30 cities.\nBy helping address the social determinants of health, permanent housing can reduce healthcare costs by 59%.\nJoneigh Khaldun, to build upon our efforts to advance health equity and better support underserved communities, and our increased wages and bonuses support our employees, their families, and their communities.\nFor the third quarter in a row, we executed on and exceeded our plan and raised adjusted earnings per share guidance.\nWe continue to enhance our diverse portfolio of assets to serve the customer.\nWe are guiding to a strong year end, all possible due to the leadership and commitment of our over 300,000 CVS Health colleagues that bring their heart to every moment of our customers' health.\nOur third quarter results reflect a continuation of the strong performance observed in the first half of 2021 and as we exceeded our expectations from both a revenue, cash flow, and adjusted earnings per share basis.\nThese results ensue from our differentiated portfolio of capabilities and keen focus on operational execution.\nThis momentum in our performance enables us once again to raise our outlook for 2021.\nStarting with the enterprise as a whole.\nTotal revenues of $73.8 billion increased 10% year over year with robust growth in all three segments.\nWe reported adjusted operating income of $4.1 billion, a 12.5% increase versus the prior year.\nThis growth in adjusted operating income was also reflected in the strong cash flow generation in the third quarter.\nwith year-to-date cash flow from operations now exceeding $14 billion.\nAdjusted earnings per share of $1.97 represent a nearly 19% year-over-year increase, generated by our adjusted operating income growth and lower interest expense resulting from our ongoing deleveraging efforts.\nMoving to the segments.\nHealthcare benefits revenue increased by 9.5% year over year, driven by sustained growth in our Government Services business, slightly offset by the repeal of the health insurance fee.\nIn the third quarter, we saw Medicaid membership grow sequentially by 67,000 members across multiple geographies.\nMedicare Advantage membership also continued to grow in the quarter, increasing by 42,000 members sequentially and representing year-over-year growth of 9.8%.\nOur Medicare Advantage franchise continues to be a powerful growth engine with Medicare Advantage membership more than doubling since the third quarter of 2015, representing a 15% compound annual growth rate.\nOur attention has now turned to ensuring a successful 2022 annual enrollment period for Medicare, which began on October 1.\nWhile still quite early in that process, we are pleased with what we have seen to date.\nHealthcare benefits adjusted operating income grew modestly year over year but fell below our expectations for the quarter due to higher-than-expected COVID-related medical costs in our commercial business.\nWith the surge in nationwide COVID cases emanating from the Delta variant, we experienced higher-than-expected COVID-related medical costs in August and September.\nThree key factors drove this difference versus our expectations.\nFirst, commercial COVID inpatient admissions in August and September.\nWere in line with the peak levels experienced in January 2021 and were nearly three times the average of the second quarter of 2021.\nSecond, COVID testing costs, which we had expected to moderate during the third quarter, also approached January 2021 levels and were more than 1.5 times the average we experienced in the second quarter.\nIt is critical to recognize the outsized impact of COVID testing on overall claim costs as testing costs represented approximately 35% of gross COVID costs in the quarter.\nAnd finally, while non-COVID deferred care was better than we had forecast, it was not enough to entirely offset these higher COVID costs in commercial.\nThe resultant medical benefit ratio for the quarter of 85.8% was above our forecast and driven almost entirely by the higher-than-expected commercial COVID testing and treatment costs.\nThere are two important aspects of HCB's third quarter performance to note.\nOne, absent these COVID dynamics, underlying performance in our commercial book of business continues to be in line with our expectations.\nTwo, in our government services business, we also saw an increase in COVID treatment and testing costs, but far less pronounced than in commercial.\nThis lower level of increase was fully offset by better-than-expected deferred care.\nAs a result, the overall performance of our Government Services business was in line with expectations.\nWrapping up HCB -- We experienced favorable prior period development in the quarter on both commercial and government products.\nDays claims payable of 51 at the end of the third quarter is three days higher sequentially and two days above prior year.\nWhile influenced by many factors with the anticipated abatement and COVID-related claims in the fourth quarter, we would expect DCP to return to a more typical results in Q4.\nOverall, we remain comfortable with the adequacy of our reserves.\nTurning to pharmacy services.\nOur ability to deliver sustainable, profitable growth remains clear.\n2021 is expected to be the second year of adjusted operating income growth in excess of 10%.\nThis sustained growth has been driven by our track record of delivering industry-leading drug trend on behalf of our clients, our proven industry-leading capabilities, particularly in the specialty pharmacy arena our outstanding customer service, as reflected by our over 98% renewal rate for 2022.\nDuring the third quarter, pharmacy revenues increased by 9.3% year over year, driven by increased pharmacy claims volume, growth in specialty pharmacy, and brand inflation.\nTotal pharmacy membership increased by 1.6 million lives sequentially, primarily reflecting growth in government programs.\nTotal pharmacy claims processed grew nearly 7% above the prior year.\nNearly half of this growth was attributable to net new 2021 business with COVID vaccine administration and new therapy prescriptions also contributing to the year-over-year growth.\nNote that new therapy prescriptions were adversely impacted in the third quarter 2020 due to the pandemic.\nPharmacy adjusted operating income exceeded expectations in the quarter, up more than $150 million or 9.5% year over year.\nThe three major drivers of this increase remain consistent with the second quarter.\nImproved purchasing economics reflecting the products and services of our group purchasing organization launched in the second quarter of 2020; continued strength in our specialty pharmacy business driven by 340B administration and increased pharmacy claims volumes, both of which were partially tempered by ongoing but stable client pricing pressure.\nOur retail business delivered strong results this quarter, again exceeding expectations.\nTotal revenue of just under $25 billion increased by $2.3 billion or 10% year over year.\nThere are two main components to this increase.\nApproximately half or $1.2 billion is attributable to the contributions from the more than 11 million COVID vaccines and over 8 million COVID tests we administered combined with strong front store sales driven by demand for over-the-counter COVID test kits and related treatment categories.\nWith this quarter's results, we are now on pace to deliver about 44 million to 49 million COVID vaccines and 28 million to 33 million COVID tests for full year 2021.\nThe remaining half or 1.1 billion was driven by a combination of sustained pharmacy growth and broad strength in front store trends across a range of categories, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure.\nThis strong revenue growth, combined with a 70-basis-point improvement in adjusted operating margin, produced adjusted operating income that exceeded our forecast and drove a year-over-year increase of $300 million.\nThis adjusted operating income growth driven by COVID testing vaccines and front store sales was partially tempered by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure, business investments, including the minimum wage increase and other performance incentives, and increased staffing to provide expanded levels of service.\nTurning to cash flows and the balance sheet.\nOur liquidity and capital position remained excellent at the end of the third quarter with cash from operations of $5.5 billion for the quarter and $14.3 billion year to date.\nThrough our proactive liability management transaction in August, we paid down $1.1 billion in net long-term debt in the quarter.\nAs of the end of the third quarter 2021, we have repaid a net total of $18.7 billion in long-term debt since the close of the Aetna transaction.\nIn addition, we returned over $650 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend.\nLet me now discuss our updated 2021 guidance.\nThis increase reflects the strong performance in pharmacy services and retail, partially offset by expected COVID pressure in our healthcare benefits business, specifically in the commercial block.\nWe are raising our total revenue outlook to $286.5 billion to $290.3 billion and adjusted operating income outlook to $16.4 billion to $16.6 billion.\nWe are also increasing expected full year cash flow from operations to a range of $13 billion to $13.5 billion.\nNote that this increased cash flow forecast is actually lower than our September year-to-date figure, reflecting expected payments in the fourth quarter that were accrued in 2020, including FICA taxes and increased minimum loss ratio rebates, as well as the timing of receipts and payments between the third and fourth quarters.\nI'll now highlight some key items related to the segments and full year guidance.\nFor the healthcare benefits segment, we are lowering our full year adjusted operating income guidance from $5.25 billion to $5.35 billion to $4.9 billion to $5 billion.\nWe expect the full year medical benefit ratio to be in a range of 84.4% to 85.6% or an increase of 30 basis points from our prior range.\nThis reflects the higher-than-expected commercial COVID medical costs observed in the third quarter and our expectation that these will continue, although at a lower level into the fourth quarter.\nEmerging October operational data indicate that COVID inpatient admissions are tracking at approximately half the levels of September.\nAgain, it is important to remember the degree to which testing costs are driving expenses.\nSo while we expect Q4 testing expenses to be lower than Q3, we do not anticipate they will decline as much as inpatient expense.\nFinally, recall the normal seasonality of the healthcare benefits segment with fourth quarter operating income typically the lowest of the year driven by deductible satisfaction producing the highest quarterly medical costs.\nFor pharmacy services, given the continued strength in the quarter and our visibility to the remainder of the year, we are increasing full year 2021 adjusted operating income guidance to $6.85 billion to $6.94 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 20.5% to 22%.\nWe anticipate that the strength in third quarter pharmacy services results will largely continue into the fourth quarter.\nIn the retail/long-term care segment, we are also increasing our full year 2021 adjusted operating income guidance to $6.98 billion to $7.07 billion.\nAs you consider the fourth quarter, I would note that we currently expect vaccinations to continue, although at a lower rate than the third quarter.\nWe have also contemplated the impact of the CDC's COVID booster recommendations, as well as a modest impact from pediatric vaccinations.\nWe expect testing to decline modestly in comparison with the levels experienced during the third quarter.\nGiven retail's Q3 outperformance and Q4 outlook, we now expect the full year 2021 COVID impact to be neutral.\nThis compares to our prior guidance in August for an overall modest negative net impact.\nAs we closed the third quarter, we are very pleased with the performance of our businesses, which provides us with a strong foundation as we now look ahead to 2022.\nWhile we plan to share more details with you at our upcoming investor day in early December in New York, I want to update you on our thoughts regarding the 2022 outlook.\nWhile there are still many factors to play out, we believe that current analyst estimates for 2022 adjusted earnings per share of approximately $8.20 are within our anticipated initial guidance range.\nAs we discussed last quarter, there are some significant moving pieces to keep in mind in determining an appropriate baseline for 2021.\nSecond, in 2022, we will incur a full year of expense related to our minimum wage increase announced last quarter.\nWe estimate these factors combined represent approximately $0.40 per share.\nUsing the midpoint of our updated 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance range, which is $7.95, these adjustments create a 2021 baseline of $7.55.\nThe other significant factor in considering 2022 performance is the effect that COVID will have on our retail and healthcare benefits businesses.\nFor retail, we expect that COVID-19 vaccine and testing volume, which is expected to generate over $3 billion of revenue in 2021, will decline significantly in 2022 to 30% to 40% of the volume we administered in 2021.\nIn addition, we expect COVID-driven front store sales to decline in 2022.\nFor HCB, we expect to see a significant improvement in results in 2022, as treatment and testing costs decline with COVID cost estimates and improved risk-adjusted revenue reflected in our pricing.\nOverall, we estimate the COVID-driven impact in HCB will largely be offset by the expected decline in COVID-related retail performance.\nIt is important to note that forecasts of future COVID impacts to our business remain extremely difficult and are subject to change as circumstances dictate.\nBeyond these considerations, Other factors affecting our growth for 2022 remain consistent with the commentary we provided last quarter regarding headwinds and tailwinds.\nWith all of this in mind, the current consensus of analyst estimates of approximately $8.20 for adjusted earnings per share would represent about an 8% increase over the 2021 baseline.\nTo conclude, the strong performance of CVS Health in the first half of 2021 continued in the third quarter, producing strong revenue, adjusted operating income, and cash flow results, and we are pleased to again raise our full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance.\nDuring the pandemic, we have solidified our opportunity to become a national leader in healthcare delivery, which at its core, starts and ends with lowering the cost of care, improving access and convenience, ultimately enabling people to live healthier and more fulfilling lives.\nDuring our investor day in a few weeks, we look forward to sharing with you more about our path over the coming years to deliver on this ambition and to position CVS Health to generate sustainable, low double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.\nSummary: ",

financial measures that have not been derived in accordance with GAAP.\ndollargeneral.com under News & Events.\nDespite the challenging operating environment, our team remains steadfast in their dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others by providing affordable, convenient and close to home access to everyday essentials, and I could not be more proud of their efforts.\nThroughout the pandemic, our priority has been the health and safety of our employees and customers, while meeting the critical needs of the communities we serve as an essential retailer.\nProtective equipment dedicated certain store hours for the most vulnerable members of our communities and, most recently, removed barriers for our frontline associates to receive the vaccine.\nIn total, we invested approximately $248 million in response to the pandemic in 2020, including about $167 million in appreciation bonuses for eligible front-line employees to demonstrate our appreciation for their exceptional performance during an incredibly challenging year.\nAt Dollar General, we remain committed to being part of the solution, and believe we are uniquely positioned to continue supporting our customers through our network of more than 17,000 stores located within five miles of approximately 75% of U.S. population.\nAt the same time, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and further position Dollar General for long-term sustainable growth.\nTo that end, we are excited to share an update on some of our plans for 2021.\nFirst, we plan to further the rollout of several value-creating initiatives, including our non-consumables initiative, Fast Track and the completion of our initial rollout of DG Fresh.\nIn addition, while still early, we are very pleased with the results of our pOpshelf stores, which have far exceeded our initial expectations for both sales and gross margin.\nAs a result, we plan to accelerate our pace of new store openings for pOpshelf in 2021 and expect to incorporate this concept into a number of our larger format Dollar General locations as we look to capitalize on the significant growth opportunity we see for this differentiated concept.\nWe are also pleased to highlight key changes to our development strategy, including plans to build on the success of our Dollar General Plus Store or DGP, and the introduction of two new store formats, which we began testing in 2020.\nSimilar to our larger footprint, DGP concept, the first new format has selling space of approximately 8,500 square feet, which compares to about 7,300 square feet of selling space for our traditional store.\nBeginning later this year, this new format along with our DGP concept will become our base prototype for nearly all new stores, replacing both our traditional and higher, cooler count DGTP format, allowing for a more optimized assortment and room to accommodate future growth.\nOur second new format is even larger with approximately 9,500 square selling feet, and will be deployed opportunistically across new store relocation and remodel opportunities.\nNotably, on average, our DGP and new store formats are outperforming the chain on a comp sales basis and have considerably higher sales volumes compared to both the traditional and DGTP store, which bodes well for the future as we look to increase their unit counts in the years ahead.\nFinally, we are pleased to provide an update on a number of our new small box store opportunities we see available in the Continental United States, which represents an increase compared to our prior estimate.\nJeff will discuss these updates in more detail later in the call.\nBut first, let's recap some of the highlights for the fourth quarter and full year.\nThe quarter was once again highlighted by strong growth on both the top and bottom lines.\nWe're pleased that, for the quarter, our three non-consumable categories once again delivered a combined comp sales increase well in excess of our consumable business.\nOf note, this represents our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year comp sales growth in our combined non-consumable categories, which we believe speaks to the strong and sustained momentum in these product categories.\nFrom a monthly cadence perspective, comp sales in December increased in the high-single digit range with similar mid-teens growth in both November and January.\nIn total, fourth quarter net sales increased 17.6% to $8.4 billion, primarily driven by comp sales growth of 12.7%.\nThese results include significant growth in average basket size and units in particular, partially offset by decline in customer traffic.\nAnd while customers continue to consolidate trips, on average, they are spending more with us compared to last year.\nOnce again, this quarter, we increased our market share in highly consumable product sales, as measured by syndicated data, driven by a meaningful increase in both units and dollars.\nImportantly, our data suggests an increase in new customers this quarter as compared to Q4 of 2019.\nThese new customers continue to skew younger, higher income and more ethnically diverse, underscoring the broadening appeal of our value and convenience proposition.\nWe continue to be encouraged by the retention rates of new customers and we are working to drive even higher levels of engagement with more personalized marketing and continued execution of our key initiatives.\nWe're particularly pleased that we delivered significant operating margin expansion, which contributed the fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of $2.62, an increase of 24.8% over the prior year.\nFor the full year, net sales increased 21.6% to $33.7 billion, including net sales growth of 28.1% in our combined non-consumable categories.\nComp sales for the year increased 16.3%, representing our 31st consecutive year of same-store sales growth.\nIn 2020, we celebrated the opening of our 17,000 store and the launch of our newest store concept pOpshelf.\nIn total, we completed a record 2,780 real estate projects during the year, exceeding our initial target of 2,580 projects as we continue to build and strengthen the foundation for future growth.\nFrom a position of strength, we also made targeted investments in other key areas, including the acceleration of certain strategic initiatives to strengthen our competitive position and further differentiate and distance Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape.\nCollectively, our fourth quarter and full year results reflect strong and disciplined execution across many fronts and further validate our belief that we are pursuing the right strategies to enable sustainable growth while creating meaningful long-term shareholder value.\nAs a mature retailer in growth mode, we are also laying the groundwork for future initiatives, which we believe will unlock additional growth opportunities as we move forward.\nWe operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail.\nAnd in an environment where customers continue to seek safe and convenient experiences, we believe our unique store footprint, further enhanced through our multiyear initiatives, provides a distinct competitive advantage and positions us well for continued success.\nOverall, I am proud of our associates and all that we've achieved over the past year.\nWe feel very good about the underlying business and I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.\nNow that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter and full year, let me take you through some of its important financial details.\nUnless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year.\nAll references to earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.\nAs Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit, which was positively impacted in the quarter by a significant increase in sales, including the impact of COVID-19.\nGross profit as a percentage of sales was 32.5% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 77 basis points, which represents our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin rate expansion.\nThis increase was primarily attributable to: a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales, higher initial markups on inventory purchases, a greater proportion of sales coming from non-consumable categories and a reduction in shrink as a percentage of sales.\nThese factors were partially offset by: increased transportation and distribution costs, which were impacted by increased volume, some of which is attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as higher transportation rates and discretionary employee bonus expense for our distribution center and private fleet employees.\nSG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.2%, an increase of 48 basis points.\nThis increase was primarily driven by incremental costs related to COVID-19, including appreciation bonuses paid to our frontline retail employees and health and safety-related expenses as well as increased incentive compensation expense and hurricane-related expenses.\nThese items were partially offset by certain expenses, which were lower as a percentage of sales, including occupancy costs, retail labor and depreciation and amortization.\nMoving down the income statement.\nOperating profit for the fourth quarter increased 21% to $872 million.\nAs a percent of sales, operating profit was 10.4%, an increase of 30 basis points.\nOperating profit in the fourth quarter was positively impacted by COVID-19, primarily through higher sales.\nThe benefit from higher sales was partially offset by approximately $96 million or 110 basis points of incremental investments that we made in response to the pandemic, including approximately $69 million in appreciation bonuses for eligible frontline employees and additional measures taken to further protect our employees and customers.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.7% and compares to 23% in the fourth quarter last year.\nFinally, as Todd noted earlier, earnings per share for the fourth quarter increased 24.8% to $2.62, which contributed to full year earnings per share of $10.62, an increase of 59.9%.\nTurning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remain strong and provide us the financial flexibility to further support our customers and employees during these unprecedented times while continuing to invest for the long term and provide meaningful returns to shareholders.\nMerchandise inventories were $5.2 billion at the end of the year, an increase of 12.2% overall and 6.3% on a per-store basis.\nWhile a lot of stocks remain higher than we would like for certain high-demand products, we continue to make good progress with improving our in-stock position and are pleased with our overall inventory levels.\nIn 2020, we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $3.9 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion or 73.2%.\nTotal capital expenditures for the year were $1 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 4.3 million shares of our common stock for $900 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $87 million.\nWith today's announcement of an incremental share repurchase authorization, we have remaining authorization of approximately $2.4 billion under the repurchase program.\nOur capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged.\nOur first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives.\nWe also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3 times adjusted debt to EBITDA.\nMoving to our financial outlook for 2021.\nWe continue to operate in a time of uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the economy, consumer behavior and our business.\nDespite continued uncertainty, we are providing select annual guidance in an effort to provide the best view we reasonably can, based on what we currently know.\nThat said, there could be a number of potential headwinds and tailwinds this year, which are not incorporated into our guidance as the timing, degree and potential impacts on our business are currently unclear, including, but not limited to: the recently approved government stimulus package; other unknown external factors related to the ongoing health crisis, including its impact on consumer behavior and additional changes to minimum wage rates.\nWith this in mind, we currently expect the following for 2021: net sales in the range of a 2% decline to flat; a same-store sales decline of 4% to 6% but which reflects growth of approximately 10% to 12% on a two-year stack basis; and earnings per share in the range of $8.80 to $9.50, which reflects a compound annual growth rate between 15% and 20% or between 14% and 19% on an adjusted basis over a two-year period, which is well above our long-term goal of delivering at least 10% annual earnings per share growth on an adjusted basis.\nOur earnings per share guidance assumes an effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 23%.\nCapital spending is expected to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion as we continue to invest in our strategic initiatives and core business to support and drive future growth.\nWe also plan to repurchase a total of approximately $1.8 billion of our common stock this year, reflecting our strong liquidity position and confidence about the long-term growth opportunity for our business.\nLet me now provide some additional context as it relates to our expectations.\nGiven the unusual situation, I will elaborate on our comp sales trends thus far in Q1.\nDespite approximately 8,400 lost store operating days as a result of closures due to winter weather across the country, same-store sales for the month of February increased 5.7%, reflecting a healthy comp sales increase of 11.2% on a two-year stack basis.\nFrom the end of February through March 16, comp sales decreased approximately 16% as we are in the midst of lapping our most difficult monthly comp sales comparison of the year.\nAs a reminder, comp sales growth for the month of March in 2020 was 34.5%.\nLooking ahead, we remain cautious in our 2021 sales outlook, given the continued significant uncertainty that still exists as well as the unique comparisons against last year.\nThat said, as you think about the sales cadence of 2021, our performance is expected to be stronger in the second half, given a more difficult sales comparison in the first half and particularly in Q1.\nTurning to gross margin.\nIn 2020, gross margins benefited from a greater proportion of sales coming from our higher-margin non-consumable categories, driven by a full year net sales percentage increase of these categories well in excess of our consumables business.\nWe expect our sales mix will ultimately shift toward our consumables categories in 2021, resulting in pressure on our rate.\nHowever, the timing of when this dynamic may occur and its corresponding impact to gross margin are currently uncertain.\nGross margins in 2020 also benefited from a reduction in markdowns, including the benefit of higher sell-through rates as a result of significant customer demand in seasonal and other clearance-sensitive non-consumable categories.\nIn 2021, we expect our markdown rates will increase somewhat from the abnormally low levels we saw in 2020, which likely will create some gross margin pressure compared to last year.\nIn addition, while we continue to see the effect of higher carrier rates and fuel costs, our ongoing efforts to improve efficiencies and reduce expenses, including further expansion of our private fleet, are expected to help partially mitigate these cost pressures in 2021.\nAlso, please keep in mind that the second and third quarters represent the most challenging laps of the year from a gross profit rate perspective, following improvements of 167 basis points in Q2 2020 and 178 basis points in Q3 2020.\nIn terms of SG&A, while we expect to incur ongoing expenses related to the pandemic in 2021, overall, we anticipate a meaningful reduction in COVID-19-related costs compared to last year.\nHowever, the leverage from these reduced costs is expected to be offset by deleverage associated with lower comp sales and approximately $60 million to $70 million in incremental year-over-year investments related to our strategic initiatives as we further their rollouts.\nWith regard to our strategic initiatives, in aggregate, we anticipate they will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2021, driven by NCI and DG Fresh as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated expense.\nFinally, we estimate operating profit will be negatively impacted by approximately $35 million to $40 million in Q1 as a result of lost sales from storage closures and expenses related to the widespread winter weather that we experienced in February.\nIn closing, we are very proud of the team's execution and performance, which resulted in exceptional fourth quarter and full year results.\nAs always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital, with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term.\nWe remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same-store sales growth, healthy new store returns, strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.\nLet me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities, including our strategic initiatives and plans for 2021.\nOur first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth.\nThe team did a fantastic job in 2020.\n[Technical Issues] NCI consists of a new and expanded product offering in key non-consumable categories.\nThe NCI offering was available in more than 5,800 stores at the end of 2020, including nearly 400 stores in our light version.\nThis compares to our prior expectation of more than 5,600 stores at year-end.\nGiven our strong performance to-date, we plan to expand this offering to about 5,700 additional stores this year, bringing the total number of NCI stores to more than 11,000 by year-end.\nThis total includes over 2,100 stores in our light version, which incorporates a vast majority of the NCI assortment but through a more streamlined approach.\nMoving to our newest concept, pOpshelf, which further builds on our success in learnings with NCI.\npOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun, affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise, a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with about 95% of our items priced at $5 or less.\nWe opened our first five locations in 2020.\nAnd as Todd mentioned, given our strong results to date, we plan to accelerate the rollout of pOpshelf in 2021.\nIn fact, we are now targeting to have a total of up to 50 pOpshelf stores opened by year-end compared to our previous goal of about 30 total locations.\nIn addition to these stores, we also plan to incorporate this concept in up to 25 Dollar General stores in 2021.\nIn terms of our store-within-a-store concept, a smaller footprint pOpshelf shop will be prominently positioned in the center of the store, and we will display both Dollar General and pOpshelf branding on exterior entrances to build and maximize awareness.\nFrom these initial stores, our goal is to test, learn and ultimately expand to more locations over time as we look to leverage the unique strengths of these complementary formats and build on our early success with pOpshelf by making it more available to a broader range of customers.\nTurning now to DG Fresh, which is a strategic, multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods.\nThe primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product costs on our frozen and refrigerated items, and we continue to be very pleased with the product cost savings we are seeing.\nIn fact, DG Fresh continues to be the largest contributor to the gross margin benefit we are realizing from higher initial markups on inventory purchases, and we expect this benefit to grow as we continue to scale this transformational initiative.\nAnother important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories.\nWe are pleased with the success we are seeing on this front, driven by higher overall in-stock levels and the introduction of new products in select stores being serviced by DG Fresh.\nGiven our success to-date, we are further accelerating the rollout of additional offerings with the recent introduction of even more products, including both national and private brands as we look to further optimize our assortment while increasing our relevance with customers.\nAnd while produce is not included in our initial rollout plans, we believe DG Fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than 10,000 stores over time as we look to further capitalize on our extensive self-distribution capabilities.\nIn total, we were self-distributing to more than 16,000 stores from 10 facilities at the end of 2020.\nThis compares to our previous expectation of over 14,000 stores at year-end.\nOverall, we remain well on-track to complete our initial rollout across the chain in 2021.\nMoving to our cooler expansion program, which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative.\nDuring 2020, we added more than 62,000 cooler doors across our store base.\nIn total, we expect to install more than 65,000 cooler doors in 2021 as we continue to build on our multiyear track record for growth in cooler doors and associated sales.\nAs a reminder, in 2019, we began incorporating high-capacity coolers into the majority of our new, remodeled and relocated stores, creating additional opportunities to drive higher on-shelf availability and deliver a wider product selection, all enabled by DG Fresh.\nNext, a quick update on our FedEx relationship.\nThis convenient customer package pickup and dropoff service is now available in over 8,500 stores, with plans to be in a total of over 9,500 stores by year-end, further advancing our long track record of serving rural communities.\nIn addition to the gross margin benefits associated with NCI and DG Fresh, we continue to pursue additional opportunities to enhance gross margin, including improvements in private brand sales, global sourcing and supply chain efficiencies.\nWith regards to our supply chain, our plans for 2021 include further expansion of our private fleet, which accounted for more than 20% of our outbound fleet at the end of 2020.\nReducing stem miles is also an important contributor to these efforts, and the recent opening of our Walton, Kentucky dry distribution center is expected to drive additional efficiencies as we move ahead.\nWe also plan to open two additional DG Fresh facilities in 2021 as we look to further optimize our fresh network and support future growth.\nIn addition, we anticipate our combination DG Fresh and dry distribution center in Blair, Nebraska will be completed in late [Technical Issues] contribute to a further reduction in stem miles over time.\nFinally, while we are very pleased with our progress in 2020, shrink reduction remains an important area of opportunity.\nWe continue to build on our success with electronic article surveillance by increasing the number of items tagged while further leveraging technology to drive even higher levels of in-store execution.\nOur second priority is capturing growth opportunities.\nOur proven high-return, low-risk real estate model continues to be a core strength of our business.\nIn 2020, we completed a total of 2,780 real estate projects, including 1,000 new stores, 1,670 remodels and 110 relocations.\nAdditionally, we now have produce in more than 1,100 stores.\nFor 2021, we expect to open 1,050 new stores, remodel 1,750 stores and relocate 100 stores, representing 2,900 real estate projects in total.\nWe also plan to add produce in approximately 700 stores, bringing the total number of stores that carry produce to more than 1,800.\nIn addition, as Todd noted earlier, we continue to advance the evolution of our store base with plans to build on the success of our DGP format, including the introduction of two new format types.\nWith about 8,500 square feet of selling space, both our first new format and DGP concept allow for expanded higher capacity cooler counts, an extended queue line and a broader product assortment, including NCI, a larger health and beauty section and produce in select stores.\nIn total, we expect more than 550 of our overall real estate projects this year to be in one of these format types as we look to further enhance our value and convenience proposition, particularly in rural America.\nThe second new format consists of about 9,500 square feet of selling space.\nIn addition to an extended queue line and broader assortment, this larger layout also includes nearly 50 high-capacity coolers and expanded produce offering, fresh meat and additional checkout lanes, including a self-checkout bullpen with multiple stations.\nWe believe this even larger format better positions us to meet the growing needs of our customers, particularly in highly underserved markets, and we are targeting more than 100 locations by year-end.\nOverall, these larger formats allow us to incorporate our best and most impactful initiatives and are designed to expand high-growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format all while continuing to drive strong returns.\nMoving to an update on the number of new store opportunities.\nThrough a combination of our growing relevance with customers, format innovation, an evolving retail landscape and leveraging new technologies, we estimate there are now approximately 13,000 additional small-box store opportunities in the Continental U.S. which are available for a Dollar General store.\nThis compares to our prior estimate of nearly 12,000 opportunities and is inclusive of our 2021 new unit pipeline.\nAlthough these opportunities are available to all small-box retailers, as a leader in small-box retail, combined with our proven track record of new unit development and format innovation, we believe we are well positioned to capture a disproportionate share as we move ahead.\nAnd while we continue to evaluate, we currently estimate pOpshelf could add approximately 3,000 additional store opportunities in the Continental U.S., with about another 1,000 additional opportunities available for our smaller footprint DGX format.\nWhen taken together, we estimate there are a total of approximately 17,000 new store opportunities available across our format types which we believe represents a long runway for new unit growth.\nOverall, our real estate pipeline remains robust, and we are excited about the significant new store opportunities ahead.\nNext, our digital initiative, which is an important complement to our brick-and-mortar footprint as we continue to deploy and leverage technology to further enhance the customer in-store experience.\nOverall, our strategy consists of building a digital ecosystem that is specifically tailored to provide our customers with an even more convenient, frictionless and personalized shopping experience.\nWe made significant progress in 2020, highlighted by the accelerated rollout of DG Pickup, our Buy Online Pick Up In-store offering to more than 17,000 stores providing another convenient access point for those seeking a more contactless shopping experience.\nDuring the year, we also saw continued growth in customer engagement across our digital ecosystem, including our digital coupon offering, shopping list feature, cart calculator shopping and budgeting tool, eCommerce site, DG Go!\nmobile checkout and our mobile app, which ended the year with nearly 4 million monthly active users.\nLooking ahead, our plans include providing more relevant, meaningful and personalized offerings with the goal of driving even higher levels of customer engagement and loyalty.\nOur third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low-cost operator.\nOver the years, we've established a clear and defined process to control spending, which governs our disciplined approach to spending decisions.\nThis zero-based budgeting approach, internally branded as Save to Serve, keeps the customer at the center of all we do, while reinforcing our cost control mindset.\nOur Fast Track initiative is a great example of this approach, where our goals include: increasing labor productivity in our stores, enhancing customer convenience and further improving on-shelf availability.\nWe continue to be pleased with the labor productivity improvements we are seeing as a result of our efforts around both rolltainer and case pack optimization, which have led to the more efficient stocking of our stores.\nThe second component of Fast Track is self-checkout, which provides customers with another flexible and convenient checkout solution while also driving greater efficiencies for our store associates.\nSelf-checkout was available in more than 1,600 stores at the end of 2020, with plans for an aggressive expansion as we move ahead.\nIn fact, we expect to introduce this offering into the vast majority of our stores by the end of 2022.\nOur underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture growth opportunities while controlling expenses and always seeking to be a low-cost operator.\nOur fourth operating priority is investing in our diverse teams through development, empowerment and inclusion.\nAs a growing retailer, we continue to create new jobs in the communities we serve.\nAnd for those associates already on our team, this growth is resulting in numerous opportunities for career advancement.\nIn fact, more than 12,000 of our current store managers are internal promotes, and we continue to innovate on the development opportunities we can offer our teams, including continued expansion of our private fleet and those associated with DG Fresh as well as pOpshelf.\nIn addition, we transitioned to a virtual learning environment in 2020, resulting in the continued development of our people, including nearly 3 million training hours for our employees, all supported by our award-winning training and development programs.\nImportantly, we believe these efforts continue to yield positive results across our store base, as evidenced by continued record low store manager turnover, record staffing levels, healthy applicant flows and a robust internal promotion pipeline.\nWe believe the opportunity to start and develop a career with a growing and purpose-driven company is a unique competitive advantage and remains our greatest currency in attracting and retaining talent.\nOverall, we are making great progress against our operating priorities and strategic initiatives.\nWe have a robust set of initiatives in place for 2021 and are confident in our plans to drive long-term sustainable growth while creating meaningful value for our shareholders.\nIn closing, I am proud of our team's performance and our 2020 results, which further demonstrate our unique combination of value and convenience, continues to resonate with customers and positions us well going forward.\nI look forward to all that we can accomplish together in the year ahead.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:In particular, the extent of the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business remains uncertain at this time.\nDuring today's call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.\nAs for the content of today's call, Kevin will start with a discussion of the business, and Lewis will follow with a recap of Dolby's financial results and provide our third quarter and second half fiscal 2021 outlook.\nWith another strong performance in licensing revenues this quarter, we are off to a solid start to our fiscal year.\nOur first half fiscal 2021 revenues have grown about 10% compared to the first half of fiscal 2020, and earnings have grown at an even higher rate.\nOur financial results reflect the strength of Dolby's business model and the broad adoption of Dolby Technologies across the devices and services that consumers are seeking to enjoy their content.\nBefore Lewis takes you through the numbers, I wanted to highlight some of the areas of our progress and the recent examples of how Dolby is enabling a broader range of content.\nWith a growing number of content experiences becoming Dolby experiences, we add to our value proposition for deeper adoption in existing device categories, and we address the use cases for adoption in new device categories, which together drive our opportunities for growth.\nWith Dolby Atmos for music, we are enabling a significant step forward in how people can enjoy their favorite songs, which is creating new opportunities to expand the adoption of Dolby Atmos to a broader range of devices and services.\nLucid Motors announced that they will be bringing the first automobile to market that will include Dolby Atmos.\nThe Lucid Air will enable the Dolby Atmos for music experience for the car and is the first example of a significant opportunity to address the primary entertainment use case within automotive.\nLucid is just one example of how we are creating more ways for consumers to enjoy a growing library of music in Dolby Atmos.\nWe have strong engagement with top artists around the world as more songs and albums are being made available in Dolby Atmos, including many recent Grammy-nominated artists like Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga and Megan Thee Stallion.\nThis quarter, Hungama, a top music streaming service in India began supporting Dolby Atmos.\nThey joined TIDAL, Amazon Music and Anghami who are currently streaming music in Dolby Atmos.\nAs we continue to build on the momentum for Dolby Atmos for music, we see opportunities for more services to adopt Dolby Atmos, and to deepen our adoption across mobile, PCs, automotive and headphones.\nGaming is another area where we see much of the opportunity ahead of us, to bring Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos to a growing number of experiences.\nMicrosoft Xbox will be the first gaming console to support the combined Dolby experience for games.\nXbox gamers will have more ways to enjoy the Dolby experience with new gaming headsets released this quarter from Microsoft and Bang and Olufsen that highlight support for Dolby Atmos.\nLenovo recently launched a new mobile phone designed to support gaming content, the Legion Phone Duel two that highlights support for Dolby Atmos.\nWe also saw the first eSports event in Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos this quarter.\nAs part of Blizzard Entertainment's BlizzConline, we enabled an event that showcased Overwatch matches to be viewed in the combined Dolby experience through PCs and gaming consoles.\neSports gives us unique opportunities to engage gamers by bringing Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos to the experiences that they are passionate about.\nAs we grow the number of Dolby experiences within games, we add to our existing value proposition and drive more reasons for adoption on gaming consoles, PCs and mobile phones.\nBy expanding our presence in music and gaming, we addressed two of the primary use cases on a mobile device.\nAt the same time, we see more ways for Dolby to enable the highest quality experiences across more of the content enjoyed on mobile devices.\nOver the past few quarters, we've highlighted how we are enabling new experiences in mobile, like being able to record in Dolby Vision with the iPhone 12 or being able to enjoy live sports content in Dolby Atmos through a mobile app.\nThis quarter, Earshot, a leading podcast service in India became the first podcast app to support Dolby Atmos.\nThey will be making Dolby Atmos content available across different genres of podcasts and in multiple languages.\nAs we continue to expand the relevance of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos across a broader range of content, we address more of the use cases for mobile devices, driving the reasons for deeper adoption with our partners.\nThis quarter, Xiaomi launched their first mobile phones that support Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos.\nThis adds to the growing number of partners that support the Dolby experience within mobile, which is highlighted by the Apple iPhone 12 lineup that features the combined Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experience.\nIn addition, Samsung, OPPO and Sony continue to highlight Dolby Atmos with the recent launch of their latest flagship models.\nAll of this progress adds to our strong position within movie and TV content, which continues to drive more device adoption within the living room.\nThis quarter, Samsung released their Q7 sound bar, highlighting support for Dolby Atmos.\nWithin TVs, our partners around the world, including Xiaomi, Changhong and Skyworth, released new models that support the combined experience.\nIn addition to supporting Dolby Atmos, TCL and Hisense also highlighted support for Dolby Vision IQ within their recent TV launches.\nWith this momentum, we still see a significant opportunity ahead to reach higher levels of adoption with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos in the living room, similar to the broad presence of our core audio technologies.\nThe adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos on devices is driven by a consistent flow of new titles that are being enabled in the combined Dolby experience.\nOur streaming partners, like Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV+ and HBO Max, continue to make a broad range of titles available in Dolby, and the combined experience is consistently highlighted with the release of their latest tentpole titles.\nLet me shift to cinema.\nAs consumers begin to return to the movies, they are seeking out premium experiences and Dolby Cinema is the best way to enjoy a movie.\nWe now have about 90% of our Dolby Cinemas opened globally to certain capacity restrictions.\nOur engagement with exhibitor partners remain strong as we recently added a new Dolby Cinema partner in China, and we also had four new Dolby Cinema locations open during the quarter.\nWe also see initial signs of strong box office performance from titles like Godzilla vs.\nKong and successful local content in China, including Detective Chinatown three and Hi, Mom that were all available in Dolby Cinema.\nWe look ahead to anticipated titles later this year, including Top Gun: Maverick, A Quiet Place II and Black Widow that will all be available in Dolby Cinema.\nDuring the last year, we have started to bring the Dolby magic that powers the best movie, TV and music experiences to a much broader range of content and interactions with Dolby.io, our developer platform.\nOur focus is on deepening our engagement with the developer community, growing the number of developers on the platform and building their engagement with our APIs.\nJust last week, we completed an integration with Box.com and Dolby.io.\nCompanies that use Box can now enable their users to easily improve the quality of their audio directly from where their files are stored within Box, powered by Dolby Media APIs.\nWe are excited to bring unique solutions to Box's broad range of customers and the opportunity to drive more people to engage with Dolby.io.\nOur interactivity APIs are supporting a wide range of use cases, and we see new customers across multiple industries from online learning to enabling influencers to connect with fans, or even in one case, supporting an application that enables live streaming for medical teams.\nAs we look ahead, we also see opportunities where real-time interactions come together with recorded media and we can uniquely provide comprehensive solutions by embedding both our interactivity and media APIs.\nWith a growing number of new experiences being enabled by Dolby.io, we are learning from our engagement with developers and evolving our offerings to best support the use cases where we see significant opportunities to bring higher quality media and best-in-class real-time interactions.\nSo to wrap up, we have growing momentum in enabling Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experiences in more forms of content like music and gaming.\nAs we enable our technologies to address a broader range of content, we build upon our strong position within movies and TV and create more reasons for adoption across devices and services.\nWith Dolby.io, our technologies are beginning to address a much larger world of content experiences and interactions.\nAll of this gives us confidence in our ability to drive revenue and earnings growth into the future.\nAnd with that, I'm going to hand it over to Lewis to take us through the financials.\nAnd of course, May the fourth be with you.\nAs Kevin said, our financial results were very solid this quarter.\nRevenue and earnings both coming in higher than we previously guided.\nSo let me go through a few details for everyone.\nSecond quarter revenue of $320 million was above our guidance range of $280 million to $310 million, as the volumes that we had were higher-than-expected in several of our end markets.\nAnd then we also benefited from a true-up of about $15 million in the quarter for Q1 shipments reported that were above our estimate.\nOn a year-over-year basis, second quarter revenue was down from last year's $352 million due to lower recoveries and lower revenue from cinema-related business partially offset by higher adoption of Dolby Technologies and higher market volume in areas like PC and TV.\nOn a sequential basis, total revenue was down from Q1 due to lower recoveries and lower seasonality, and both of these were anticipated when we gave our guidance at the beginning of the quarter.\nSo the Q2 revenue was comprised of $304 million in licensing and $16 million in products and services.\nSo let's go through the trends in licensing revenue by end market, starting with broadcast.\nBroadcast represented about 35% of total licensing in the second quarter.\nBroadcast revenues decreased by about 19% year-over-year, and that was driven by lower recoveries offset partially by higher market volume along with higher adoption of Dolby.\nOn a sequential basis, broadcast decreased by about 25%, due primarily to lower seasonality along with lower recoveries.\nMobile represented approximately 22% of total licensing in Q2.\nMobile decreased by about 12% from last year, that was due to a shift in timing of certain contracts, and that was offset partially by higher adoption of our technologies.\nOn a sequential basis, mobile was down about 38%, due primarily to lower recoveries and timing of revenue under contracts.\nPC represented about 17% of total licensing in the second quarter.\nPC was higher than last year by about 12% due to higher market volume, along with increased adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos.\nAnd that was offset partially by declining ASP because of mix of our disc versus non-disc units.\nSequentially, PC was up by about 56%, driven by timing of revenue under contracts, along with seasonally higher activity from patent programs.\nConsumer electronics represented about 16% of total licensing in Q2.\nOn a year-over-year basis, consumer electronics was lower by about 2% due to a shift in timing of certain contracts offset partially by higher volume in devices like sound bars and DMAs, as well as higher adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos.\nOn a sequential basis, CE decreased by about 7% due mainly to lower seasonality and timing of revenue under contracts.\nOther markets represented about 10% of total licensing in the second quarter.\nThey were up about 14% year-over-year, driven by higher revenue from gaming and automotive, and that was offset partially by lower Dolby cinema revenues.\nOn a sequential basis, other markets decreased by about 22%, driven by lower seasonality in gaming and lower admin fees from Via.\nBeyond licensing, our products and services revenue was $16 million in Q2 compared to $16.9 million in Q1 and $23 million in last year's Q2.\nAnd the year-over-year decrease was attributable to lower demand in the cinema industry because of the pandemic.\nSo now I'd like to discuss Q2 margins and operating expenses.\nTotal gross margin in the second quarter was 89.9% on a GAAP basis and 90.5% on a non-GAAP basis.\nProducts and services gross margin -- products and services gross margin on a GAAP basis was minus $345,000 in Q2 compared to minus $5.5 million in the first quarter.\nProducts and services gross margin on a non-GAAP basis was a positive $1.1 million in Q2 compared to a negative $3.9 million in the first quarter.\nAs I mentioned when I gave guidance, we took steps to reduce the cost structure in manufacturing, and that's helping our product gross margins return to positive territory.\nOperating expenses in the second quarter on a GAAP basis were $204 million compared to $189.8 million in Q1.\nThe annual salary increases for our employee base went into effect at the beginning of Q2.\nAnd also, Q1 operating expenses benefited from a gain on sale of our facility in Brisbane.\nOperating expenses in the second quarter on a non-GAAP basis were $178.4 million compared to $167.1 million in the first quarter.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were pretty much in line with the guidance that we gave.\nOperating income in the second quarter was $83.2 million on a GAAP basis or 26% of revenue compared to $105.9 million or 30.1% of revenue in Q2 of last year.\nOperating income in the second quarter on a non-GAAP basis was $110.9 million or 34.7% of revenue compared to $129 million or 36.7% of revenue in Q2 of last year.\nIncome tax in Q2 was 10.6% on a GAAP basis and 16% on a non-GAAP basis.\nNet income on a GAAP basis in the second quarter was $76.2 million or $0.73 per diluted share, and that compares to $88.5 million or $0.86 per diluted share in last year's Q2.\nAnd net income on a non-GAAP basis in the second quarter was $94.8 million or $0.91 per diluted share, that compares to $106.6 million or $1.04 per diluted share in Q2 of last year.\nFor both GAAP and non-GAAP, net income in the second quarter was above the guidance that we gave and that was due to the revenue coming in higher than what we had expected.\nDuring the second quarter, we generated about $83 million in cash from operations which compares to the $66 million generated in last year's second quarter, and we ended the second quarter this year with about $1.2 billion in cash and investments.\nDuring the second quarter, we bought back about 760,000 shares of our common stock and ended the quarter with about $76 million of stock repurchase authorization still available.\nWe also announced today a cash dividend of $0.22 per share.\nThe dividend will be payable on May 25, 2021, to shareholders of record on May 17, 2021.\nSo now let's talk about the forward outlook.\nthree months ago, when I went through the outlook for Q2, I said then based on a variety of factors and assumptions, that we could see a scenario for second half revenues in the mid- to high 500s.\nNow with Q2 behind us, our updated scenario is for second half revenue ranging from $560 million to $600 million.\nAnd if I focus more specifically on Q3, we anticipate that third quarter total revenue could range from $260 million to $290 million.\nWithin that, licensing could range from $250 million to $275 million, while products and services revenue could range from $13 million to $18 million.\nIn terms of the assumptions we've made about market conditions, industry analyst reports indicate that PC TAMs in the second half could be higher on a year-over-year basis.\nHowever, for TVs and other consumer devices, industry reports continue to indicate that TAMs could be down in the second half because of an uptick in demand that happened last year in the middle of the pandemic, but might not repeat this year.\nAt the same time, we are expecting organic growth in the second half, and that's on a year-over-year basis.\nDriven by broader adoption of our Dolby technologies broadly across various markets.\nAnd we also anticipate higher revenue from our cinema-related businesses in the second half as that industry starts to recover compared to where it was last year.\nSo let me move on to the rest of the P&L outlook for Q3.\nQ3 gross margin on a GAAP basis is estimated to range from 88% to 89%, and the non-GAAP gross margin is estimated to range from 89% to 90%.\nWithin that, products and services gross margin is estimated to range from about breakeven to $1 million positive on a GAAP basis and from $1 million to $2 million positive on a non-GAAP basis.\nOperating expenses in Q3 on a GAAP basis are estimated to range from $210 million to $220 million; and operating expenses in Q3 on a non-GAAP basis, are estimated to range from $185 million to $195 million.\nNow the increase in operating expenses from Q2 to Q3 is being driven mainly by our marketing programs that from a timing standpoint, have more of their activities taking place in the second half this year, which also means that at this point, Q4 expenses could be at least as much as what we spend in Q3.\nBut I'd like to point out that for the year as a whole, the marketing expenses at the high end of our opex range would be similar to what they were last year, just timed differently.\nWe'll give you an update on this when we report our Q3 results.\nSo let's finish up the Q3 outlook.\nOther income is projected to range from $1 million to $2 million for the third quarter, and that's $1 million to $2 million for the third quarter.\nAnd our effective tax rate for Q3 is projected to range from 20% to 21% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.\nBased on a combination of the factors I just covered, we estimate that Q3 diluted earnings per share could range from $0.15 to $0.30 on a GAAP basis and from $0.37 to $0.52 on a non-GAAP basis.\nSo with that, I'll kick it back over to Mr. Yeaman.\nAs I'm sure most of you or all of you saw, we also announced today that Lewis has made a decision to retire later this year.\nOver the last nine years, Lewis has played an integral role in building our strong financial position, navigating new business models, and just overall supporting the expansion of Dolby experiences.\nHe's built a very strong team.\nHe's mentored countless employees, both within and beyond the finance organization.\nAnd Lewis is going to be working closely with me to ensure a smooth transition as we work to identify our next Chief Financial Officer.\nSo we've still got Lewis.\nWe're going to enjoy that for now.\nAnd then we'll be happy to -- that Lewis will have more time to focus on his family.\nSo Kevin, is it true that when I first told you, you said good riddance?\nI think you might have misinterpreted that.\nI can't believe now that they actually have books out there called Dad Jokes because I think all my jokes probably fit into that category, but it has definitely been a privilege to serve as the company's Chief Financial Officer and lot of great memories.\nAnd since we're all about the experience, I can definitely say that I've had my own unique Dolby experience here.\nSo I look forward to a smooth transition as we move on to the next phase.\nCompany is in great shape.\nGreat shape, great promise ahead.\nSo I will happily watch from sidelines.\nWell, Lewis, I haven't heard anyone disagree with you yet when you talk about the quality of your humor.\nAnd we are going to make sure and get the most out of your remaining transition time.\nAnd with that, I'm sure our audience is eager to get to questions.\nWe've covered a lot of ground.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:In particular, we are currently in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe extent of its continued impact on our business will depend on several factors, including the severity, duration and extent of the pandemic, as well as actions taken by governments, businesses and consumers in response to the pandemic.\nAll of which continue to evolve and remain uncertain at this time.\nAs for the content of today's call Lewis will begin with a recap of Dolby's financial results and provide our fiscal 2020 outlook and Kevin will finish with a discussion of the business.\nAnd I hope you're all staying safe out there.\nI'm glad to report that Q3 revenues came in at the high-end of the scenario that we provided three months ago and our earnings were above the range as we had a large tax benefit in the quarter to go along with some lower than projected operating expenses.\nWhile we did do better than Q3 outlook, its worth noting that the numbers were lower than the original forecast from the start of the year before COVID-19 came into the picture.\nSo here the numbers.\nThird quarter revenue was $247 million, compared to $352 million in Q2, and $302 million in Q3 of last year.\nOur Q3 revenue guidance coming into the quarter was a range of $225 million to $250 million.\nNow if I compare that to what we assumed in our guidance, revenues from TVs, PC and mobile were at the higher end, while consumer electronics and set-top boxes were at the lower end of our scenario.\nProducts and services were at the high-end of the range, but remember that we had lowered our expectations by 70% to 80%, because of the significant impact of COVID-19 shutdowns on the cinema industry.\nNow looking at total company quarter-over-quarter, revenue was down by about $105 million from Q2, roughly half of that was driven by timing of revenue under contracts, as well as lower recoveries, and roughly the other half of that was attributable to the impact from COVID-19, which includes lower royalties from unit shipments across a variety of devices, lower sales of cinema products and services and lower revenue from box office share at Dolby Cinemas.\nNow looking at total company year-over-year, revenue was down by about $55 million versus last year's Q3, and that was predominantly attributable to COVID-19, and similar to what I said a minute ago, lower unit shipments, lower products and services and lower Dolby Cinema revenue.\nThe composition of Q3 revenue was $235 million in licensing; and $12 million in products and services.\nSo, let's go through a breakdown of licensing revenue by end market, starting with Broadcast.\nBroadcast represented about 38% of total licensing in the third quarter.\nBroadcast revenues were down about 34% year-over-year, and that was driven by lower recoveries and lower unit volume due to the pandemic, despite the fact that adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos into TVs and set-top boxes is higher than last year.\nOn a sequential basis, Broadcast was down by about 31% due to lower recoveries and lower unit volume.\nMobile represented approximately 33% of total licensing in Q3.\nMobile was up by about 65% over last year, due to higher recoveries and revenues from our patent programs, offset partially by unit volume impact from the pandemic.\nOn a sequential basis, Mobile was up by about 3%, driven by recoveries offset partially by unit volume impact from the pandemic.\nPC represented about 10% of total licensing in the third quarter.\nPC was down by about 4% year-over-year, due to lower recoveries and lower unit volume, although, its worth noting that adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos of the PCs has increased since last year.\nAnd sequentially PC was down nearly 50%, due to timing of revenue under contracts and also lower recoveries.\nConsumer electronics represented about 9% of total licensing in the third quarter and on a year-over-year basis CE licensing was down by about 29%, driven by lower volume and lower recoveries.\nOn a sequential basis, CE was down by nearly 60%, due to timing of revenue under contracts, as well as lower unit volume.\nOther markets represented about 10% of total licensing in the third quarter.\nThey were down by about 34% year-over-year due to significantly lower revenues from Dolby Cinema, because nearly all of those screens were closed for the quarter and lower revenues from gaming due to console life cycles.\nOn a sequential basis, Other Markets was down by about 16% driven by lower revenue from Dolby Cinema and from via admin fees and those are the fees in the patent pool program that we administer.\nAnd this was offset partially by higher recoveries in automotive and gaming.\nBeyond licensing our products and services revenue was $11.8 million in Q3, compared to $23 million in Q2, and $30.3 million in last year's Q3.\nWe had anticipated a big drop-off in sales in this category, as most of this revenue comes from equipment that we sell to cinema exhibitors.\nAnd these customers in general, continue to be negatively affected by the pandemic.\nNow let's cover margins and operating expenses for Q3.\nTotal gross margin in the third quarter was 87.9% on a GAAP basis, and 89% on a non-GAAP basis.\nProducts and services gross margin on a GAAP basis was minus $5.5 million in the third quarter, due to fixed cost not fully covered by the lower volume that we ran.\nAnd as a reminder, the guidance I gave at the beginning of the quarter was for GAAP gross product margin to range from minus $6 million to minus $9 million.\nProducts and services gross margin on a non-GAAP basis was minus $3.5 million in the third quarter for the same reasons as I just went over in the GAAP discussion, and there as a reminder, our guidance for non-GAAP product gross margin was minus $5 million to minus $8 million.\nOperating expenses in the third quarter on a GAAP basis were $182.9 million, compared to $209 million in Q2.\nOperating expenses in Q3 were about $8 million less than the low end of the range we've guided, mostly driven by timing of certain marketing programs that were pushed into Q4, lower legal expenses and lower travel and outside services.\nOperating expenses in the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis were $159.2 million, compared to $188.4 million in the second quarter.\nAnd the Q3 non-GAAP total was also below the range we projected and for the same reasons that I discussed in the GAAP expenses.\nOperating income in the third quarter was $34.1 million on a GAAP basis, or 13.8% of revenue, compared to $34.3 million or 11.3% of revenue in Q3 of last year.\nAnd last year's Q3 included a $30 million charge for restructuring mostly associated with an early exit from a leased facility.\nOperating income in the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis was $60.5 million, or 24.5% of revenue, compared to $85.9 million or 28.4% of revenue in Q3 of last year.\nIncome tax was a $27.4 million benefit in Q3 on a GAAP basis, and a $21.2 million benefit on the non-GAAP basis.\nThe Q3 income tax amounts include approximately $36 million of discrete benefits for a specific item that were resolved during the quarter.\nNet income on a GAAP basis in the third quarter was $67.3 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, compared to $39.6 million or $0.38 per diluted share in last year's Q3.\nNet income on a non-GAAP basis in the third quarter was $87.5 million or $0.86 per diluted share, compared to $79.3 million, or $0.76 per diluted share in Q3 of last year.\nFor both GAAP and non-GAAP net income in Q3 was above our original guidance, due to revenue being at the higher end of our range, operating expenses at the lower range and the favorable income tax that I discussed.\nDuring the third quarter, we generated about $134 million in cash from operations, which compares to about $91 million generated in last year's third quarter, and we ended the third quarter with a little over $1.1 billion in cash and investments.\nDuring Q3, we bought back about 500,000 shares of our common stock and ended the quarter with about $230 million of stock repurchase authorization still available.\nWe also announced today a cash dividend of $0.22 per share, which will be payable on August 26, 2020 to shareholders of record on August 17th, 2020.\nNow let's cover the outlook for Q4.\nThree months ago, when I went over the guidance for Q3, I highlighted the challenges that we are facing in the environment.\nConsumer demand was dropping, visibility was much more limited than usual, and industry data reports were not consistent or current.\nFast forward to now, we have updated TAM data for some of our end markets, but not all of them.\nCustomer visibility is still very limited and remember we won't have actual shipment data for the June quarter until all our customers send us the reports over the next few months and the economy is still pretty uncertain.\nSo with that as a backdrop, here's our current scenario for Q4, along with some key assumptions that we've embedded into the outlook.\nLet's start with products and services revenue, most of which goes into the cinema industry.\nThe screens are opening more slowly than we thought last quarter, so we are assuming that there will not be any significant uptick in equipment, purchasing activity from exhibitors in Q4.\nWe estimate that products and services revenue in Q4 could range from $10 million to $15 million.\nLet's talk about licensing.\nWe estimate that licensing revenue in Q4 could range from $215 million to $240 million, that's in comparison to the $235 million that we had in Q3.\nAs I look at the transition from Q3 actual to the Q4 outlook scenario, there is downward movement from timing of revenue under customer contracts.\nThis is not unusual, and I think of it as Dolby seasonality.\nIn other words, within the course of our fiscal year, we tend to have higher revenue in our Q2 and our Q3, and lower amount in our Q1 and Q4, and a lot of this is because of timing of revenue under various contracts.\nPartially offsetting it this year is an assumption that total unit shipments could increase modestly in Q4 over Q3 as consumer spending starts to improve.\nOur Q4 scenario assumes that there will roughly be a 5% improvement in unit shipments plus or minus blended across all device categories.\nFor Q4, we're also assuming very little revenue from Dolby Cinema box office share.\nSo to summarize, our scenario for total revenue in Q4 is a range of $225 million to $255 million.\nIf I compare that to last year's Q4 actual revenue of $299 million, the majority of the potential decline would be attributable to the economic ripple effect of the pandemic, and the remainder would largely be due to lower recoveries.\nGross margin for Q4 on a GAAP basis is estimated to range from 85% to 86%; and non-GAAP gross margin is estimated to be about 1 percentage point higher than the GAAP number.\nProducts and services gross margin will remain a negative territory in Q4, mainly because of fixed costs that are not fully covered at the lower revenue levels.\nAt the revenue range in the outlook I provided, products and services gross margin on a GAAP basis could range from minus $6 million to minus $9 million in Q4; and on a non-GAAP basis, it could range from minus $5 million to minus $8 million.\nOperating expenses in Q4 are estimated to range from $187 million to $197 million on a GAAP basis; and from $167 million to $177 million on a non-GAAP basis.\nOther income is projected to range from $2 million to $3 million for the quarter; and our income tax rate for the fourth quarter is projected to range from 19% to 21% on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis.\nBased on a combination of the factors I just reviewed, we estimate the Q4 diluted earnings per share on the GAAP basis could range from five -- from about $0.05 to about $0.20; and then on a non-GAAP basis, we estimate, it would range from about $0.22 to $0.37.\nAnd as for the full-year, if you do the math, that would mean that our FY '20 revenue for the full-year could range from $1,115 million to $1,145 million; GAAP diluted earnings per share could range from $2.04 to $2.19; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share could range from $2.76 to $2.91.\nWith the strength of our financial model, balance sheet and value proposition, Dolby continues to be well positioned to navigate through these challenging times.\nOur people continue to bring their creativity and passion to enable more Dolby experiences to more people around the world.\nWhile our Q3 revenues came in at the high-end of our scenarios, there is still a lot of uncertainty across many of the markets in which we operate.\nIn addition to lower consumer spending the pandemic has resulted in some shifts in the timing of new customer wins and revenues.\nAt the same time, our partners remain deeply engaged with enabling new Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experiences.\nAs consumer spending does return, we are confident that with our strong positioning across a broad range of devices and services, we will return to our path of driving revenue and earnings growth.\nOur formula for growth has always started with increasing the amount of compelling content available at Dolby.\nThe Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experience in movie and TV content has led to growing adoption across a broad range of devices.\nWe are also expanding the Dolby experience in areas such as gaming and music that broaden our value proposition and create more opportunities in device categories like mobile, PC and automotive.\nIn addition, we are beginning to address a growing population of content beyond premium entertainment, most recently with the launch of our development platform Dolby.io.\nAll of these gives us confidence in our ability to drive long-term growth.\nLet's turn to some of the highlights this quarter.\nAs people are watching a growing amount of streamed content, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos continues to be highlighted within the content that matters most to people.\nThe highly anticipated releases of Hamilton on Disney Plus and Greyhound on Apple TV Plus are both available in Dolby.\nThis quarter, we began to see the first titles in Dolby Vision on Google Play.\nAnd Hotstar, the largest streaming service in India, began to support Dolby Vision for Disney Plus content.\nThis quarter, we saw several partners adopt Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos within their products.\nApple, which supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos across most of their devices, announced that AirPods Pro will support Dolby Atmos with the release of iOS 14.\nSonos launched the Sonos Arc, their first soundbar that supports Dolby Atmos.\nFree, one of the largest Internet service providers in France, launched their first set-top box to support Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos.\nAnd last month, Xiaomi launched their first TV supporting the combined experience.\nAdoption of both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos within TV is continuing to expand globally, most notably in India.\nThis quarter TCL, Sony, OnePlus and Nokia all announced new TV models in India supporting the combined experience.\nAlso, Panasonic expanded their adoption of Dolby Vision IQ to additional models in this quarter.\nIn FY '19, Dolby Vision was included on about 10% of 4K TV shipments, and we are on track to materially increase that adoption rate for fiscal '20 with a significant growth opportunity still ahead of us.\nOur strong presence in movie and TV content has enabled the initial option of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos within PC and mobile devices.\nBeyond that, we see a significant opportunity to accelerate the adoption by enabling more experiences on these devices, including gaming and music.\nRecently, title significantly expanded the number of devices that support Dolby Atmos music to include Dolby Atmos enabled sound bars and home theater equipment.\nWe are also seeing examples of how Dolby Atmos can create unique experiences across a wide range of music genres.\nThis quarter, we saw examples of classical music from John Williams, and recordings from the London Philharmonic Orchestra mixed in Dolby Atmos.\nEmpire, an independent label, began releasing music in Dolby Atmos from artists like Fat Joe and Remy Ma.\nThe music in Dolby experience elevates our engagement with partners and strengthen the value proposition for Dolby Atmos in existing device categories; such as mobile phones and creates new opportunities for us in areas such as automotive and smart speakers.\nLet me shift to Cinema.\nDuring the quarter, most cinemas remained closed with a few regions slowly beginning to reopen.\nThe closure of cinemas around the world has significantly reduced demand for our cinema products.\nWe believe that when Cinemas do begin to reopen, exhibitors will look to highlight their premium offerings and consumers will seek out the best experience.\nAnd there is none better than Dolby Cinema.\nLast month, the first Dolby Cinema in South Korea was opened with our partner Megabox.\nWe have also added our second partner that will bring Dolby Cinemas to Saudi Arabia, where we saw our first site opened just last week.\nAs we look ahead, we are excited by the unique opportunity to significantly broaden the content experience we addressed with Dolby technologies.\nDuring the quarter, we launched our developer platform Dolby.io.\nDolby.io enables developers to access Dolby technology to raise the bar on the quality of the media and communications experiences within their apps and services using our APIs.\nAmong our initial customers, we have seen the application across a wide range of use cases, including podcast, e-learning and telehealth.\nBeginning a few weeks ago, artists can optimize the quality of their music recordings with mastering on SoundCloud powered by Dolby's platform.\nWe are excited by the initial reception of Dolby.io, and by the potential to bring Dolby to the growing amount of media and communications content, it is part of our daily lives.\nTo wrap up, Dolby has a solid foundation with a strong business model and more than ever, people want immersive entertainment and communications experiences.\nThe quality of these experiences matter.\nWe continue to focus on growing the number of devices that support Dolby Vision and Atmos.\nWe will accelerate adoption and broaden the device categories that support the Dolby experience by enabling new forms of content like music and gaming.\nAnd we are excited by the opportunity to enable an even broader range of Dolby experiences most recently with the launch of Dolby.io.\nAll of these reinforces our belief in the opportunities that are still ahead of us and give us confidence in our ability to drive revenue and earnings growth.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm Pankaj Gupta, Dow investor relations vice president.\nAnd joining me on the call today are Jim Fitterling, Dow's chairman and chief executive officer; and Howard Ungerleider, president and chief financial officer.\nDow's Forms 10-Q and 10-K include detailed discussions of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences.\nUnless otherwise specified, all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items.\nWe will also refer to non-GAAP measures.\nOn Slide 2, you will see our agenda for the call.\nJim will begin by reviewing our third-quarter highlights and operating segment performance.\nHoward will share our modeling guidance and outlook, and then Jim will recap our strategy for disciplined value growth that we outlined at our investor day earlier this month and why Dow continues to be a compelling investment opportunity.\nStarting on Slide 3.\nIn the third quarter, Dow achieved top and bottom-line growth, both year over year and sequentially.\nOur proactive storm preparations enabled us to maintain the safety of our team and community and recover quickly.\nWe delivered a 53% sales increase year over year with double-digit gains in every segment, business, and region.\nWe also recorded a 7% increase in sales over the prior quarter.\nWe captured strong price momentum, driven by tight supply demand balances across our key value chains, and we achieved volume growth of 2% both year over year and sequentially, supported by continued strong end-market demand despite supply and logistics constraints.\nWe increased operating EBIT by more than $2.1 billion year over year with improvements in all segments and businesses and $58 million higher sequentially.\nKey contributors included year-over-year margin expansion of 1,170 basis points, driven by price momentum and demand growth, and increased equity earnings, up $189 million, for margin expansion at our Sadara and Kuwait joint ventures.\nOur continued focus on cash generation and our balanced disciplined capital allocation enabled us to deliver cash flow from operations of $2.7 billion, up $958 million year over year, driven by margin expansion from price momentum in key value chains.\nWe returned a total of $918 million to shareholders through our industry-leading dividend of $518 million, plus $400 million in share repurchases.\nAnd we also reduced gross debt by more than $1.1 billion in the quarter.\nOur proactive liability management actions to tender existing notes have resulted in no long-term debt maturities due until 2026, and we've reduced annual interest expense by more than $60 million.\nOverall, Dow continues to deliver on its priorities, and we see further strength ahead as we benefit from a favorable macro backdrop and execute our disciplined strategy to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings, driving significant value for all stakeholders.\nMoving to our segment performance on Slide 4.\nIn the packaging and specialty plastics segment, operating EBIT was $2 billion, compared to $647 million in the year-ago period.\nSequentially, operating EBIT was down $60 million.\nPrice gains in both businesses and in all regions led to margin improvement in the core business and increased equity earnings.\nOn a sequential basis, operating EBIT margins declined by 300 basis points on higher feedstock and energy costs.\nThe packaging and specialty plastics business reported a net sales increase year over year, led by local price gains in industrial and consumer packaging and flexible food and beverage packaging applications.\nVolumes declined year over year due to lower polyethylene supply as a result of planned maintenance turnarounds and weather-related outages in the quarter.\nCompared to the prior quarter, the business delivered price and volume gains on strong demand in industrial and consumer packaging applications, which were partly offset by hurricane-related outages.\nMoving to the industrial intermediates and infrastructure segment.\nOperating EBIT was $713 million, up $609 million year over year, primarily due to continued tight supply and demand in both businesses.\nSequentially, operating EBIT was up $65 million, and operating EBIT margins expanded by 50 basis points on volume and price gains in both businesses.\nThe polyurethanes and construction chemicals business increased net sales compared to the year-ago period with price gains in all regions on tight supply demand balances.\nVolume declines year over year primarily reflected the planned transition of a low-margin coproducer contract, as well as weather-related outages and third-party supply constraints.\nSequentially, the business delivered sales growth due to increased local price and volume from additional supply availability to meet resilient demand.\nThe industrial solutions business delivered a net sales improvement compared to the year-ago period with local price gains in all regions.\nVolume increased year over year on strong demand for materials in industrial manufacturing and energy applications.\nNet sales also increased sequentially, driven by volume growth, primarily in coatings and industrial applications from increased supply and local price gains in all regions.\nAnd finally, the performance materials and coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $284 million, up $209 million versus the same quarter last year as margins increased 750 basis points due to strong price momentum and robust demand recovery for silicones and industrial coatings offerings.\nSequentially, operating EBIT was up $59 million on price gains, leading to margin expansion of 210 basis points.\nThe consumer solutions business achieved higher net sales year over year with price gains in all regions.\nVolume increased over the prior year on stronger consumer demand for personal care, mobility and electronics offerings.\nSequentially, sales were down as price increases in all regions were more than offset by volume declines as a result of planned maintenance and third-party supply and logistics constraints.\nThe coatings and performance monomers business delivered increased net sales year over year as higher raw material costs and tight supply/demand balances led to price gains in all regions.\nVolumes were down year over year as demand recovery for industrial coatings was more than offset by weather-related outages and third-party supply and logistics constraints.\nSequentially, the business delivered local price gains in all regions, supported by increased volume due to continued strong demand for acrylic monomers and architectural coatings and increased supply availability.\nTurning to Slide 5.\nIn the fourth quarter, we see a continuation of robust demand growth across our packaging infrastructure, consumer, and mobility end markets.\nBrand owner inventory levels remain low.\nAnd as a result, we anticipate higher seasonal demand continuing into the holiday season this year.\nIn packaging and specialty plastics, we continue to see resilient demand for packaging applications and for our differentiated functional polymers.\nGlobal polyethylene supply remains constrained as the industry completes higher turnaround activity and supply chains recover from weather events on the U.S. Gulf Coast.\nWe exited the third quarter experiencing higher raw material and energy costs which we anticipate will likely persist through the fourth quarter.\nWe expect these costs to be an approximately $350 million headwind sequentially.\nDow will continue to utilize our broad geographic footprint and best-in-class feedstock flexibility to help mitigate these impacts.\nWe also anticipate a $175 million tailwind from turnarounds in the quarter as we completed our planned maintenance at our cracker in Canada.\nIn industrial intermediates and infrastructure, continued consumer demand for furniture and bedding, appliances, pharma, and home care are expected to keep supply tight in our key value chains.\nDue to the weather-related outages in the third quarter, some of our planned turnaround activity was moved to the fourth quarter.\nSadara will also start a turnaround at its isocyanate facility in the fourth quarter as well.\nAltogether, we anticipate $100 million in this segment from turnaround impacts.\nShort-term increased energy costs in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Europe are expected to be an additional $100 million headwind in the quarter.\nWe continue to see sequential recovery in industrial activity, particularly for energy applications.\nWe anticipate this recovery will continue at least through the fourth quarter as industrial production continues to ramp up from very low inventory levels to meet demand.\nIn performance materials and coatings, demand for electronics, mobility, building, and construction continues to outpace supply.\nDemand for architectural coatings is also expected to remain elevated due to persistently low inventory levels across the value chain.\nGlobal production for silicones has been impacted by the recent dual control policy enforcement actions in China, with silicone metal prices almost three times their previous highs.\nWe intend to pull forward a scheduled turnaround at a siloxane facility in Zhangjiagang in China to coincide with government actions to curtail power usage.\nOur current estimate for the quarter includes $125 million from increased raw material costs and turnaround impacts.\nWe'll continue to work on mitigating the impacts of rising raw material costs through our integrated position in both businesses.\nDespite higher raw material and energy costs in the fourth quarter, Dow will continue to leverage its advantaged global footprint, structural cost, and feedstock advantages, as well as our broad suite of differentiated products, to meet growing demand.\nOn Slide 6, as we look ahead, we expect robust economic growth to continue.\nWith the Delta variant slowing the reopening of economies around the world, there remains significant pent-up demand globally, particularly across our industrial and consumer end markets.\nMany industries continue to see elevated order backlogs, coupled with low inventory levels, as supply chain struggled to keep up with robust demand.\nThese supply chain disruptions are expected to persist, which will certainly prolong the ability to restock inventories across most value chains.\nAs a result, we expect tighter-than-forecasted market conditions to continue, a view strengthened by China's recent dual control policy that has impacted both cold olefins and methanol to olefins-based capacity, which represent more than 30% of China's total polyethylene production.\n2022 GDP growth forecasts are well above historical averages in most areas of the world as industries ramp up to match the robust consumer demand with further upside as global chip shortages continue to extend the recovery in manufacturing.\nCollectively, G7 countries have not yet fully recovered to pre-pandemic GDP.\nThis points to additional upside as economies return to more normalized consumption levels with degree of vaccination increasing, particularly in Asia, where levels remain low relative to the rest of the world.\nMoving to Slide 7.\nAt our investor day earlier this month, we outlined how our differentiated portfolio and our focus on sustainability-driven innovation will enable more than $3 billion in underlying EBITDA improvement across the cycle.\nOur restructuring program and digital investments will yield $600 million in increased EBITDA.\nBoth are in progress, and our restructuring program is on track to achieve its $300 million run rate by year end.\nWe also have a suite of higher return, lower risk, and faster payback capital and operating investments that will enable an additional $2 billion in EBITDA in the near term.\nAnd our investments to decarbonize and grow at our Fort Saskatchewan site in Alberta, Canada are also expected to deliver approximately $1 billion in increased EBITDA.\nAnd as we've already shared, we're executing against a favorable macro backdrop that we expect will continue to support constructive market fundamentals for our key value chains.\nTurning to Slide 8.\nYou'll see the detailed list of these low-risk growth investments.\nOur capital investments are expected to generate $1 billion in EBITDA through incremental capacity expansions, debottlenecking, and enhanced feedstock flexibility across our operating segments.\nWe're already making good progress.\nFor example, in packaging and specialty plastics, our Fort Saskatchewan expansion to add ethylene capacity of 65,000 metric tons per year to support growing polyethylene demand is now complete and will ramp by the end of the fourth quarter.\nOur FCDH pilot plant in Louisiana will start up in 2022, featuring 20% to 40% lower capex and 5% to 7% lower opex while reducing CO2 emissions by up to 20% compared to other PDH technologies.\nIn industrial intermediates and infrastructure, our debottlenecking project to add 60,000 metric tons per year of aniline will be fully online by year end.\nAnd earlier this year, we signed an MOU for a new South China hub to advance local supply and formulating capabilities to serve the fast-growing Asia-Pacific market.\nIn performance materials and coatings, we recently completed a capacity expansion at one of our silicone polymer plants.\nAnd by year end, we will complete a new silicone sealant compounding unit to enable sustainable solutions for high-performance building and infrastructure applications.\nAnd we are progressing our 50 kt methacrylate investment on the U.S. Gulf Coast to support global end markets, such as inks, resins, and packaging materials, which is scheduled to come online in the first half of next year.\nIn addition, our operating investments are also expected to generate another $1 billion in EBITDA as we improve our production capabilities and shift our product mix to higher growth and higher value markets.\nFor example, in industrial intermediates and infrastructure, we're increasing capabilities and shifting our mix toward higher-margin polyurethane systems for mobility and consumer applications.\nOur industrial solutions business is increasing capabilities to supply differentiated materials into the textile market.\nOur ECOFAST collaboration with Ralph Lauren lowers energy usage by 40% and water usage by 50% in the fabric dying process.\nAnd by 2025, the brand aims to incorporate this technology in more than 80% of its solid cotton products.\nIn performance materials and coatings, we're expanding our ability to formulate differentiated silicones for a number of attractive markets, including silicone adhesives for foldable displays in consumer electronics, thermal conducted silicone solutions for electric vehicles, and silicone solutions for 5G where the market is expected to more than double over the next 10 years.\nAnd we recently partnered with customers on high-value innovations like paper barrier coating applications that use our award-winning Rhobarr polyolefin dispersion technology and Callaway's Supersoft golf balls, which feature a new hybrid cover made with Dow's paraloid-impact modifier.\nIn packaging and specialty plastics, we're enhancing our extensive conversion and testing capabilities to commercialize residents through packaging design, speeding the innovation process, and expanding the addressable market for higher margin and more sustainable products.\nFor example, we're already benefiting from the nine-layer blown film extrusion line project completed this year.\nWe're also making investments to improve asset reliability, which will increase output and expand margins.\nAnd we're using digital technology for customer trials and process automation to accelerate catalyst development for new resins and processes like FCDH where we can typically be 100x more efficient than conventional experimentation.\nCollectively, our slate of near-term investments will generate an increase of approximately $2 billion in underlying EBITDA, and we intend to deliver this growth with a disciplined and balanced approach, maintaining our top quartile performance in cash flow, cost structure, debt reduction, and shareholder remuneration.\nTurning to Slide 9.\nThe strategy we outlined at our investor day builds on our long history of industry leadership.\nOur plan enables us to capture demand from sustainability drivers, achieve zero Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions, and deliver meaningful underlying earnings and cash flow growth for years to come.\nOur path to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings is a phased site-by-site approach that both retrofits and replaces end-of-life assets with low-carbon-emission facilities while also expanding our capacity.\nThis plan will deliver a 30% reduction in our CO2 emissions between 2005 and 2030 through a disciplined approach that manages timing based on affordability, macro and regulatory drivers around the world.\nOur Texas 9 cracker proves that we can do this and do it well.\nTexas-9 is 60% lower-carbon intensity than any asset in our fleet, and that's without any specific design for carbon capture or hydrogen.\nThe project was delivered with 20% better capital efficiency and 12 months faster than any other crackers built in that wave.\nOverall, the project has a 65% lower conversion cost, is running consistently at more than 110% of nameplate capacity, and has delivered greater than 15% return on invested capital since start-up.\nWe will leverage key learnings from Texas-9 as we plan to build the world's first-ever net-zero carbon emissions ethylene cracker and derivatives complex in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, delivering approximately $1 billion in EBITDA, as Howard outlined earlier.\nThis project will more than triple our ethylene and downstream derivative capacity at the site while decarbonizing emissions for 20% of our global ethylene capacity.\nWe selected this site due to the availability of carbon capture, infrastructure, advantaged feedstocks, and supportive government policies and incentives.\nOn Slide 10, as we capture these attractive growth opportunities, we will maintain our balanced and disciplined financial approach since spin.\nWe are committed to keeping capex at or below D&A, well below pre-spin levels while targeting return on invested capital above 13% across the economic cycle.\nWe will continue to align our capital spend to the macroeconomic environment, our affordability, and return targets.\nOur investments align to three categories: First, we'll maintain our foundation and maximize the return of our existing assets while ensuring safe and reliable operations.\nSecond, we'll execute our pipeline of faster payback, lower-risk incremental growth projects for downstream and sustainability-driven applications growing faster than GDP.\nAnd we'll invest approximately $1 billion per year to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings.\nThese investments enable us to capture increasing demand for low carbon footprint products while derisking the enterprise with lower emissions assets.\nIn closing, on Slide 11, Dow is well-positioned to deliver significant long-term value for shareholders.\nWe have actions in place to both decarbonize our footprint and grow the enterprise as we achieve an additional $3 billion in underlying EBITDA, maintain industry-leading cash flow generation, and drive toward zero Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions.\nOur balanced capital allocation approach targets more than 13% return on invested capital, keeps capex within D&A, and return 65% of net income to shareholders across the economic cycle.\nAll of this is underpinned by our industry-leading portfolio, cost position, and strong track record of innovation that enables us to deliver differentiated products and solutions for our customers and a more sustainable world.\nOperator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Also joining me on the call today are Rick Muncrief, our president, and CEO; Clay Gaspar, our chief operating officer; Jeff Ritenour, our chief financial officer; and a few other members of our senior management team.\nWe appreciate everyone taking the time to join us on the call today.\nFor Devon Energy, 2021, as a transformational year that can best be defined by our willingness to be a first mover and pursue bold strategic consolidation.\nOur operational excellence and unyielding commitment to capital discipline, and the groundbreaking deployment of our industry-leading cash return business model, underpinned by our fixed plus variable dividend.\nThis transaction was perfectly timed at the very bottom of the cycle and set the groundwork for Devon's significant value creation during the year.\nWith this Advantage platform, we executed on her Delaware focused operating plan and captured cost synergies that resulted in $600 million of annual cash flow improvements.\nThese margin expansion efforts, combined with a disciplined capital allocation framework that prioritize value over volumes, resulted in Devon generating the highest level of free cash flow in our prestigious 50-year history.\nWith this powerful stream of free cash flow, we delivered on exactly what our shareholder-friendly business model was designed for, and that is to leave the industry in cash returns.\nAs you can see on the graphic, we rewarded shareholders with outsized dividends, opportunistic share buybacks, and we took meaningful steps to strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet.\nThis disciplined execution was rewarded by the market, with our share price achieving the highest return of any stock in the entire S&P 500 index during 2021.\nI am so very proud of what we accomplished, and I want to extend my sincerest gratitude to everyone involved.\nOur team comprehensively executed on the tenets of our strategy while responsibly providing our nation with a low-cost and reliable energy source, that is the lifeblood of our a modern economy.\nNow turning to slide six, while 2021 was a record-setting year for Devon, the setup for 2022 is even better.\nWith the operational momentum we've established, we have designed a capital program to efficiently sustain production at a ultra-low WTI breakeven funding level of around $30 a barrel.\nCombined with the full benefit of merger-related costs synergies and a vastly improved hedge book, we're positioned to deliver free cash flow growth of more than 70% compared to 2021.\nAs you can see on the graph, the strong outlook translates into a free cash flow yield of 14%, assuming an $85 WTI price.\nPlay will run through the details of our operating plan later but simply put, we expect 2022 to be another great year for Devon.\nTurning your attention to slide seven, with this significant stream of free cash flow, the top priority for our free cash flow is the funding of our fixed plus variable dividend.\nThis cash return strategy is a staple of our capital allocation process, allowing us to return meaningful and appropriate amounts of cash to shareholders across a variety of market conditions.\nWith this differentiated framework, we've increased Devon's dividend payout for five consecutive quarters, and in aggregate, we paid out $1.3 billion of dividends in 2021, which is a per share increase of roughly two times that of 2020.\nImportantly, we expect our dividend growth story to only strengthen in 2022.\nAs you can see on the bar chart, we're on pace to essentially double our dividend again in the upcoming year, which equates to around 8%.\nI would like to highlight that this attractive yield includes a substantial increase to our fixed dividend that we announced last night.\nThere's 45% increase in the fixed dividend reflects the confidence we have in our underlying business and financial performance as we head into 2022.\nNow Slide nine, I want to briefly showcase how our unique dividend policy offers a quite compelling alternative for yield-seeking investors.\nTo demonstrate this point, we've included a simple comparison of our estimated dividend yield in 2022 compared to other commonly referenced yields in financial markets.\nAs you can see, Devon's yield of 8% is approximately six times higher than the S&P 500 index, and well in excess of the prevailing interest rate you can get from a 10-year treasury.\nOn Slide 10, in addition to our market-leading dividend payout, we're also excited to announce that we are increasing our share repurchase authorization by 60% to $1.6 billion.\nAt a multiple of less than five times cash flow, we believe our business trades at a substantial discount to the intrinsic value, especially given the structural improvements we've made to expand margins and returns.\nGiven this favorable setup, we put our money where our mouth is by aggressively repurchasing $589 million of shares just in the fourth quarter alone.\nWith the board expanding the capacity of our repurchase program, we will continue to be opportunistic buyers of our stock throughout the upcoming year.\nAnd lastly, the diagram on Slide 12, I believe, does a great job of summarizing what we've created here at Devon.\nWe've assembled a high-quality asset portfolio, and a team that has worked incredibly hard to deliver on our commitment to expand margins, and deliver growth, and free cash flow, accelerate our cash returns with our market leading dividend payout, enhance per share growth with opportunistic buybacks, and take consistent and meaningful steps to further enhance our financial strength.\nWhile 2021 was a record year, we're only getting started.\nAt Devon, we have the right mix of assets, proven management, the right team, and a shareholder-friendly business model designed to continue to lead the energy industry and capital discipline, and cash returns.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn it to Clay for the call to continue and provide an overview of our recent operational results and upcoming capital plan.\nAs Rick touched on, 2021 was a pivotal year for Devon, that demonstrated the power of our asset portfolio and the capabilities of our talented organization.\nAcross the portfolio, our team delivered results that exceeded production and capital efficiency targets, while continuing to drive down per-unit operating costs and improving margins.\nResults matter, and while I don't take any of these accomplishments lightly, I'm equally proud of the way that we were able to accomplish these financial metrics.\nOvercoming the challenges of the merger, pandemic, and supply chain issues we built a unified culture took many best practices from both legacy companies, and we're now poised for further leverage of those collective wins.\nThe first key point that is there is no change to the upstream capital budget of $1.9 to $2.2 billion as we disclosed last quarter.\nWhile inflation is an absolute reality, our teams have done a good job of working with our service companies, mitigating escalations where we can, and quantifying the remaining impact or forecast.\nThe great thing about a cyclical business is that if you're paying attention, you should have a pretty good idea of what the most critical thing is to focus on in anticipation of the next phase.\nAt this point in the cycle, we're focused on listening to our service company partners and helping them help us be successful.\nIn this very tight supply chain market, the key phrase we hear is predictable and reliable.\nYou'll notice that our 22 program looks quite a bit like our 21 program.\nThis is what has allowed us to telegraph to our service companies, midstream partners, and other key stakeholders to expect more of the same.\nThat predictability allows them to plan their own supply chain work, and the reliability allows them to know that we're going to do what we say we're going to do.\nRelationships are one of our core values at Devon, and this listening and working with our critical partners is an example of that value in action.\nThe relatively steady level of activity in 22 is projected to sustain our production throughout the year, ranging from 570,000 to 600,000 Boe per day.\nDuring 2021, we had great success with our capital program that resulted in production growth rate of 34% compared to our first quarter 21.\nIt's high margin growth was driven by consistent execution and outstanding well productivity that was headlined by several memorable projects such as Danger Noodle, Boundary Raider, and Fiscal Cobra, to name a few.\nEach of these prolific projects eclipse 30-day rates of more than 5,000 Boe per day on a plural basis, exhibiting the world class reservoir potential that resides in the Delaware Basin.\nIt's important to note, the strong volume performance in 2021 was paired with excellent capital efficiency and substantial additions to our approved reserves.\nWhile I would never point to a single year of reserves booking as the measure of success with consistent and reasonable conservative booking processes, which we have, it can provide insight into the quality of the underlying assets.\nAt year-end, our proved reserves in the Delaware increased 18% on a Pro Forma basis, and these reserve additions replaced more than 200% of what we produce during the year.\nI find it especially impressive that our team added these reserves and an ultra-low F&D cost of only $5 per Boe.\nThis result is just another example how advantaged and sustainable our resources in the Delaware Basin.\nTurning your attention to the map on the right, you can expect more of the same for us in 2022.\nYou have a great slate of projects lined up to execute on, and once again, most of our program will consist of the high impact opportunities focused on developing Upper Wolfcamp and Bone Spring Zones, and to a lesser degree, the wolf is going to be Avalon targets as well.\nTo execute on this plan, we expect to run 14 rigs in 4 [inaudible] during the year.\nThis capital activity will be diversified across our acreage footprint with sweet spots in Southern Lea and Eddy County, and state line receiving most of the funding.\nNot only with this level of activity continuing to grow Delaware production in 22, but the benefits of our operating scale and best practices from the merger integration, we are well-positioned to continue to improve our execution capabilities.\nAs you can see on the slide, with the efficiencies captured in the Delaware, the team has essentially doubled the productivity of our rig and frac equipment compared to just a few years ago.\nThe operational improvements have also meaningfully reduced our cost over time to about $550 per lateral foot in 2021, which competes very well with anyone out there.\nAs I look ahead to 22, I expect our operational performance to continue to improve.\nOur team consistently is identifying new ways to leverage technology, operational breakthroughs, and industry best practices.\nInflationary pressure and supply chain disruptions are reality.\nBased on today's industry activity and commodity price projections, we've baked in around 15% higher costs than we saw in 2021.\nWe have been, and continue to be focused on consistency, planning, and staying out in front ahead of these in reacting to any unforeseen issues.\nThis work will be even more critical as the market continues to tighten.\nOn Slide 17, the next area I want to showcase is the momentum we're building in the Anadarko Basin, where we have a concentrated 300,000 net acre position in the liquids rig window of the play.\nWith the benefits of our $100 billion Dow JV Kerry, we drilled over 30 wells in 2021 and commenced the first production on 16 of those wells during the year.\nAs you can see on the charts, on the right, the initial capital efficiency is excellent.\nWith the benefit of state-of-the-art completion designs, and appropriately up spaced developments, per well capital cost of decrease by 25% versus legacy activity and well productivity to date has exceeded the type curve expectations by 35%.\nWith the strong execution, the carried returns we're seeing from this activity will compete for capital with any asset in our portfolio.\nGiven the success, we've elected to step up activity in the Anadarko Basin to 3 rigs and 22.\nThis program will result in around 40 new wells coming online in 2022, allowing us to maintain steady production profile throughout the year and harvest significant amounts of free cash flow.\nCollectively, these assets generated more than a billion dollars of free cash flow in 2021, and we're on pace to produce a similar amount of free cash flow in 22.\nWe also remain some of the best returns in our portfolio.\nThe team has continued to unlock additional locations and has leveraged company best practices to significantly improve our ESG footprint.\nOur Eagle Ford Asset continues to deliver solid returns.\nThe team is doing some very exciting work to unlock additional locations and a very significant refract potential.\nThe Powder, is a basin with the most upside yet to unlock.\nOur team is making great progress in that regard by driving laterals longer to three miles and rebooting the stimulation design, we're seeing very encouraging results.\nI'm proud of what these assets are delivering, and I appreciate the team's hard work and effort that goes into fulfilling this important role within our portfolio.\nAs many of you are aware, we set aggressive emissions reductions targets last year that covered a myriad of near, mid, and long-term priorities.\nIn addition, to ensure our organizational alignment, we directly tied progress on these targets to our annual compensation program.\nWe've also dedicated a board committee to engage in our ESG goal-setting process, performance, and reporting.\nSince the announcement of these environmental targets, we've taken immediate action and delivered results.\nWe do not have finalized figures yet for this past year, but I can tell you our scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions will improve roughly by 20% in 2021 versus our 19 baseline, well ahead of that, stated the stated goals from this past summer.\nTwo of the key successes on reducing overall emissions is reducing methane emissions, and reducing flaring.\nIn 2020, we reduced methane emissions by 47% and we reduce flaring by 33%.\nI expect this positive rate of change to continue.\nLooking specifically at 22, we have many visible catalysts that will drive important results, such as advancing advancements and leak detection technologies, improved facility design, facility retrofits, wide-scale deployment of air-driven pneumatic controllers, and electrification of select field operations.\nI believe that it's also important to point out that these efforts are focused on changes that will not only improve our ESG metrics, but will also improve our overall operations.\nBy focusing on these operational wins, we further align our organizational focus and excitement around ESG improvement.\nMy comments today will be focused on the key drivers of our financial results in 2021, and also provide some insights into our 2022 outlook.\nBeginning with production, our total volumes in the fourth quarter averaged 611,000 Boe per day, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by 3%.\nThis production B was across all products, with the most significant outperformance coming from NGLs, where processing and economics were exceptionally strong during the quarter.\nIn the upcoming quarter, we expect production to approximate 570,000 Boes' per day.\nWe expect this to be our lowest production quarter of the year due to winter weather downtime that reduced volumes by about 15,000 Boe per day.\nAll winter-related curtailments are back online, and we expect no impact to our full-year production estimates.\nMoving to expenses, our lease operating GP&T costs exceeded 2021 at a rate of $7.25 per barrel.\nThis result represents a 1%t decline compared to where we started the year, but with slightly elevated compared to our forecast.\nAs you might expect, we experienced moderate pricing pressures across several service and supply cost categories in the quarter, and we are also incurred a non-recurring charge to GP&T expense in the Eagle Ford.\nAnother key variance was higher work-over activity, which contributed to our strong production results in the quarter.\nOverall, our exposure to higher-value production, coupled with the low-cost structure, expanded Devon's field level cash margin to $42.37 per barrel, a 14% increase from last quarter.\nJumping to corporate cost, we did a great job of improving this expense category in 2021.\nIn aggregate, G&A and financing costs declined 31% year over year on a pro forma basis due to lower personnel cost and the company's ongoing debt reduction program.\nThese structural improvements will carry over into 2022 and act as an ongoing annuity for years to come.\nCutting to the bottom line, Devon's core earnings increase for the sixth quarter in a row to a $1.39 per share.\nThis level of earnings momentum translated into operating cash flow of $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter.\nafter funding our disciplined maintenance capital program, we generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter.\nThis represents growth in free cash flow of more than 400% compared to where we started the year after closing the WPX merger.\nThe top priority of our free cash flow is the funding of our dividend.\nAs Rick covered earlier, in conjunction with our earnings report, we announced a fixed plus variable dividend of $1 per share that is payable in March and includes the benefit of our 45% raise to the fixed dividend.\nThis payout represents the highest quarterly payout in Devon's history.\nAnother avenue that we're returning cash to shareholders through is the execution of our share repurchase program.\nSince we initiated the program in November, we're off to a great start by repurchasing $14 million shares at a total cost of $589 million.\nThis equates to an average price of $42 per share, which is around a 25% discount to our current trading levels.\nWith the board expanding our share repurchase program to $1.6 billion, we now have roughly $1 billion remaining on this authorization, and we expect to continue to opportunistically buy back stock in 2022.\nWe also have returned value to shareholders through our efforts to reduce debt and improve the balance sheet.\nIn 2021, we made significant progress strengthening Devon's financial position by retiring more than $1.2 billion of outstanding notes, and we achieved our net debt to EBITDA target ahead of plan, exiting the year at less than a turn of leverage.\nAt today's pricing, we expect our leverage to trend even lower in 2022 pushing toward a zero net debt balance by year-end.\nAnd lastly, I do want to highlight that our disciplined strategy is also resulting in excellent returns on capital employed.\nIn 2021, we achieved a 20% return on capital employed, and we are positioned for this measure to substantially increase in 2022.\nThe strong rate of change we are delivering with ROCE, combined with our cash return framework, further differentiates Devon versus other opportunities in the market today.\nIn summary, 2021 was a banner year for Devon.\nWe delivered on exactly everything we promised and then some.\nNow, as we shift our focus to the upcoming year, I want to be clear that there is no change to our cash return playbook.\nIt will be more of the same.\nWe will be relentlessly focused on delivering high returns with capital employed, margin expansion, accelerating free cash flow growth, and returning excess cash to shareholders.\nOur talented team here at Devon take great pride in leading the industry in this discipline operating framework, and when coupled with the development and deployment of two net of new technologies.\nSimply put, we are very energized and ready to roll in 2022.\nI sincerely hope you can now appreciate how we've delivered on the vision that Dave Hager and I, along with our respective teams, had when we announced our merger in September of 2020.\nWe wanted to create something truly special and we feel that we've done just that.\nWe'll now open the call to Q&A.\nPlease limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.\nWith that operator, we'll take our first question.\nSummary:

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:During our call, management may discuss certain items which are not based entirely on historical facts.\nAnd of course, on the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management uses in its review of the business and believes will provide insight into the company's ongoing operations.\nJoe and I will share highlights of our fourth-quarter performance and what we're seeing quarter to date.\nAnd by now, you've heard most others in our space.\nAnd despite the volatility we're all facing, it's good to see the category and the industry moving in the right direction.\nYou'll hear some of the same themes from us, like progressive improvements throughout the quarter as dining rooms reopened, growth in off-premise and digital expansion.\nThe biggest difference you'll hear is in our level of performance.\nBy staying true to our strategy and making aggressive moves to grow the business, our team has navigated this pandemic very well.\nChili's generated significant top-line progress throughout the quarter.\nAnd with our operators' disciplined margin management, we delivered positive cash flow for the quarter, which we used to pay down debt.\nOur debt load is now below our pre-pandemic level.\nWe continued this momentum into July, ending the month with Chili's down just 10.9%.\nAnd in the 84% of our company-owned restaurants with open dining rooms were down just 3.8%, and 36% of our company-owned Chili's restaurants ran positive comp sales for the month.\nIt wasn't our quick reaction to the crisis that enabled us to deliver these results.\nIt was our choice to stay true to the strategy we've been working for more than two years.\nWe had already made significant progress in the areas required to thrive in this environment; off-premise, digital, value and scale.\nWe didn't have to scramble in the pandemic hit.\nWe walked into it with seven solid quarters of performance.\nAll we had to do is stay focused and push the accelerator a little harder.\nAs a result, we set the bar in casual dining, landing the top spot in sales and traffic for three straight months according to KNAPP-TRACK, and we're poised for continued future success.\nYou've heard how many restaurant companies are leaning into digital to manage through this crisis.\nAnd while Chili's is no exception, we were leading the way in the digital space long before the pandemic.\nOver the past decade, we've made significant investments to build our digital infrastructure, foster connections with guests and enabling us to quickly respond to their evolving dining needs.\nIncreasing convenience is a big component of how we leverage our digital capability.\nWe can lean into our 8 million member loyalty database, gain check-level purchasing insight from our tabletop devices and continue to improve our five-Star app with features like one-tap reorder of our guests most frequent-ordered items.\nAnd last year, we integrated DoorDash into our POS system and our e-commerce experience, making it possible to shift our marketing focus from national TV spots to our digital platform, where we continuously test and learn to increase e-commerce conversions.\nAnd as a result, our digital sales of off-premise meals have grown from low teens to more than 50% in the fourth quarter with only a slight dip as dining rooms reopen.\nWe have also driven frequency -- increased frequency through our takeout and delivery channels at a fraction of the marketing expense.\nThat's the beauty of a digital strategy that makes dining easier and more convenient for guests.\nBecause we can meet them where they are, guests use us more.\nFinally, here's something you haven't heard from anyone else in our space.\nDuring the last fiscal week or last week of fiscal 2020, we accomplished something no other restaurant company has ever done.\nIn a single day, we launched It's Just Wings, our first virtual brand, in 1,050 Chili's and Maggiano's across the country.\nSales continue to build every week, and we clearly see the potential to exceed $150 million in the brand's first year, which would secure It's Just wings a spot in the top 200 restaurant brands.\nOver the years, casual dinings has been deemed for being overbuilt.\nWe believe this is our opportunity to prove that maybe it isn't overbuilt, it's just underutilized.\nIt's Just Wings leverages existing buildings, equipment and labor.\nEven after aggressive pricing and marketing, buying quality ingredients and packaging and paying our last-mile logistics partner, we're generating strong flow-through.\nThe brand's guests are highly incremental to Brinker concepts, and their feedback is extremely positive.\nSatisfaction ratings are among the top restaurant brands on DoorDash and [Inaudible] is high, and we're just getting started.\nWe created this business in six months and launched it overnight with minimal investment in a consumer channel where demand is growing by more than 100% annually.\nTaking into account our scale, the capacity of our kitchens, our exclusive partnership with DoorDash, we believe our ability to win in this space is unmatched.\nSo we're testing additional virtual concepts and learning how to drive visibility among the millions of DoorDash guests looking for food delivery options and how to continually improve our operations to meet consumer demand for speed, food quality and value.\nWe are pleased to have not one but two brands that rank among the most popular on the DoorDash platform, and we're excited about the potential that lies ahead.\nObviously, things aren't back to normal for any of us yet, but we see a bright future for all the Brinker brands.\nWe promised you last quarter that no matter what came our way, we would do two things; put the safety of our guests and team members first and continue to perform and take share.\nI couldn't be more proud of how our operators and our support teams have delivered on both of those promises and how we're creatively and boldly building our future together.\nNo matter what lies ahead, with the talent on our team, the power of our brands and the scale at our disposal, we start from a position of strength.\nRegardless of the descriptor you put on the operating environment to the most recent quarter and a number of less complementary ones come to mind, our operators quickly adjusted course to the realities of the pandemic and rose to the challenge to exceed expectations with the results delivered.\nFor the fourth quarter of FY '20, Brinker reported consolidated net comp sales of negative 36.7%, although comp sales recorded material improvement as the quarter progressed with the June period consolidated results down 19%.\nBoth brands generated a positive progression of performance through the quarter with Chili's leading the casual dining sector from a comp sales perspective.\nWhile the reported quarterly net comp sales for the brand was a negative 32.2%, performance progressed from down 51% in April at the height of the dining room closures to down only 13% for the June period.\nChili's outpaced the competition throughout the quarter with comp sales positive the casual dining sector by approximately 13% and traffic positive to the sector by approximately 18%.\nMore than 25% of our corporate Chili's restaurants reported positive comp sales for the June period, a percentage, as Wyman earlier stated, that increased to 36% in July.\nOur P&L highlights for the quarter were total revenues of $563 million, a restaurant operating margin of 6.4% and an adjusted loss per diluted share of $0.88.\nIncluded in the $0.88 loss is a burden of approximately $0.18 due to the timing of recording expenses related to annual and long-term incentive compensation plans beyond what would typically be recorded in the fourth quarter in our G&A expense.\nThroughout this crisis, our team has done an exceptional job of taking care of our guests and team members and has proven an equal ability to effectively manage expenses in the face of meaningful sales decreases.\nOur managers have been efficient in utilizing our scheduling tools to optimize labor hours to fit the current business environment.\nHourly labor and payroll tax have a good degree of variability and were favorable year over year, although total labor, including restaurant management, was unfavorable in the quarter by 260 basis points driven by sales deleverage.\nRestaurant expense margin for the quarter increased by 6.2%, again primarily due to sales deleverage.\nDespite our operators reducing year-over-year spend in this area by more than $29 million, we recorded meaningful savings in advertising spend, repair and maintenance and supplies related to on-premise dining, a portion of which we believe will be ongoing.\nAs to cost of sales, we were positive 30 basis points versus prior year, primarily due to favorable menu mix.\nBy earlier commented, our restaurant operating margin from the quarter was 6.4%.\nHowever, in conjunction with the progress we made, top line, our operating margin improved through the quarter, increasing to 12.2% for the June period.\nAssuming an improving operating environment, we believe we are set up for additional margin improvement as we carry forward identified efficiencies, further open dining room capacity and leverage sales from our virtual brand, It's Just Wings.\nStrengthening the balance sheet is an important part of our financial strategy moving forward, and we are currently focusing free cash flow toward debt reduction and liquidity enhancement.\nTo further enhance our liquidity position, we executed an equity offering in the quarter, raising approximately $139 million, which was used to pay down revolving credit debt.\nOur overall total debt balance at fiscal year end was approximately $1.2 billion, a reduction of just over $220 million from the end of the third quarter as revolving credit borrowings decreased from $700 million to less than $473 million.\nOur liquidity, which we consider to be cash balances and revolving credit availability, now exceeds $575 million.\nIn addition, we recently completed a 15-month extension of our revolving credit facility now maturing in December 2022.\nAs sales and cash flows improved, we resumed new restaurant development activity that have been temporarily halted early in the quarter.\nWe plan to open or relocate four new Chili's restaurants during this current quarter.\nNow as to operating guidance, while in past years, we would typically provide annual guidance for Brinker during this earnings call, potential volatility and unknowns of the current operating environment makes that exercise difficult.\nInstead, we are providing some limited guidance as to our consolidated performance for the current first quarter and anticipate providing quarterly insights as we move through the year.\nFor Brinker in the first quarter, we expect consolidated comp store sales to be down in the low to mid-teens range.\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share are currently estimated to be a loss in the range of $0.25 to $0.40.\nWe anticipate positive operating cash flow, and weighted average shares is estimated to be 45 million to 46 million shares.\nI would also like to remind everyone that fiscal year 2021 includes a 53rd week, which takes place during the fourth quarter.\nDespite the difficulties experienced from this pandemic, our team has risen to the challenge.\nOur strategy of focusing on value, convenience and safety has proven to be well received by our guests has given us the ability to outperform our competition and leaves us very well-positioned to continue to take market share as we move through the fiscal year.\nI greatly appreciate the hard work and commitment from our team members, especially those on the front line serving our guests each and every day.\nI have every confidence we will continue to demonstrate our ability to sustain our progress and return to growth on the top and bottom line for the long term.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm Patrick Burke, the company's head of investor relations.\nArtie Starrs, Topgolf's CEO; William Davenport, Topgolf's CFO; and Jennifer Thomas, Callaway's chief accounting officer, are also in the room today for Q&A.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles.\nResults for the second quarter were nothing short of outstanding, and I'm extremely proud of our entire global team for the work they have put in to build this business to the powerhouse that it is today.\nAs you will hear throughout the call today, we are experiencing strong momentum across all of our business segments and are delivering exceptional operating results despite a challenging environment.\nRevenue for the quarter was up 208% to $914 million and up over 112% to approximately $1.6 billion for the first half of 2021, both new records for our business.\nProfitability also reached new highs, with adjusted EBITDA of $164 million for the quarter and $292 million for the first six months of the year.\nWhile headwinds from COVID persist, we have strong conviction in both the long-term strategic position and impressive earnings growth prospects of this unique business.\nBefore shifting gears to talk specifically about each area of our business, I want to give a personal shout-out to our tour team who's having an exceptional year as well.\nCongrats to Phil and John for their wins at the PGA Championship in the U.S. Open earlier this season; to Xander for his gold medal performance in Tokyo; and to Annika for her dominant victory at the U.S. Senior Women's Open.\nWhat a summer for Callaway Golf's tour staff.\nI can't tell you how excited I get seeing our players representing Callaway, along with our other brands, including TravisMathew and Topgolf, on the game's biggest stages.\nFrom a business perspective, I'm confident this exposure is very good for our brands and will help us deliver long-term shareholder value.\nLooking first at our golf equipment business.\nDemand for clubs and balls remains very high as the sport continues to gain interest from both new entrants, which are driving continued unprecedented growth in package sets, junior clubs, and women's clubs, along with core golfers who are playing more than ever and showing strong enthusiasm for the game.\nAccording to Golf Datatech, rounds played in June remained at an all-time high, and retail demand remains elevated.\nDatatech's hardgoods sell-through in Q2 was up an impressive 40% versus 2019, and retail inventory levels remain extremely low, with only 2.2 months on hand at the end of June as industry supply chain strained to keep up with the last 12 months of unprecedented demand.\nWith more options for activities opened this spring and summer compared to last year, we were cautious that there could have been a potential slowdown in golf participation and/or demand.\nHowever, thus far, we're pleased to report that we're not seeing this from our seat in the market.\nWe are also monitoring supply chain disruption due to the resurgence of the coronavirus Delta variant.\nThe resurgence has not had any negative demand implications yet, but it has caused further supply disruptions from factories based in and around Southeast Asia, primarily Vietnam.\nThe safety of the people working in these regions is top priority, and we're working with suppliers to make sure operating conditions are and remain as safe as possible.\nAlso, we have become accustomed to adapting to these circumstances over the last 18 months, and thus, we're able to shift some portion of our production to other less-impacted factories.\nStill, given how lean inventories are already, the fact that nearly all our factories are running at 100% capacity, and that we'll need to shift production shortly toward next year's launches to protect that supply, these shutdowns will have an estimated $55 million negative impact on second-half revenues, primarily in our golf equipment segment and primarily in Q3.\nAlthough disappointing, I view this disruption as a short-term issue, not one that will have a long-term impact on value for strategy.\nOn the positive side, and I recognize this is a glass-half-full view, we now believe field inventory levels will almost certainly stay lower than expected through this year, in many ways, a healthy market dynamic that bodes well for 2022.\nAll in all, we are very pleased with the strength of this category and our position in it.\nWe expect to deliver record performance for our golf equipment segment this year, and perhaps most importantly, we continue to believe the outlook for the golf equipment category is highly positive, with both a larger total market and a higher embedded growth rate.\nTurning now to our apparel and soft goods segment.\nThe business put up another strong quarter, exceeding our expectations as retail locations reopened across the world and our brands remain top of mind for consumers.\nThis business strongly overperformed during the quarter and continues to see incredible growth as we move into the back half of the year.\nTo contextualize, year over year for the second quarter, we saw more than 30% comp store growth in our own retail stores versus 2019, the last period of unaffected by COVID as well as strong growth in sell-through at wholesale accounts and e-commerce.\nAnother fun fact is that we are not just seeing brand momentum in the target male audience buying for themselves, as approximately 30% of the direct-to-consumer sales that we track are her buying for him.\nI'm no expert here, but when women are picking the brand for their men, I think it's a very good sign.\nJack Wolfskin was a strong performer as well this quarter.\nThe business has faced additional challenges given the longer COVID shutdowns in Europe than here in the U.S., but the team has worked through the issues brilliantly and is on track for a strong year.\nAs our owned stores in Europe reopened during the quarter, retail picked up nicely, almost reaching 2019 levels of revenue.\nMost importantly, we experienced strong sell-through of the spring/summer 2021 line, as well as strong, prebooks for the spring/summer '22 line, two very important indicators for the health of the brand.\nOur stores in China also continued to perform well as the brand maintains strong awareness and positioning within the outdoor apparel market there.\nThe team at Jack Wolfskin has done a fantastic job of revitalizing this business and putting us in a strong position to grow on the top and bottom line as COVID restrictions abate in the brand's key markets of Europe and China and as the brand grows and strengthen appeal.\nLastly, our Callaway-branded soft goods business showed strength as well, particularly in Japan, as popularity for the sport drove consumer spending.\nAdditionally, toward the end of the quarter, we took back the Korea apparel business, which was being licensed to a third party for several years.\nAlthough that business is just starting up, we are very excited about the long-term opportunity it will provide to our soft goods segment, and the team did an excellent job managing this transition given the COVID travel restrictions and challenges.\nWith demand levels high across this business segment, we expect to enter 2022 with low retail inventory across all of our soft good brands.\nIn summary, we are fortunate to be in excellent categories and are on our path to deliver a good 2021 in this segment as well as future growth.\nNow on to Topgolf.\nQ2 marked the first full quarter of Callaway results with Topgolf included in our numbers, and they delivered beyond our expectations.\nWhile COVID concerns remain a challenging variable for venue operations, the team put up outstanding numbers even as other options for consumers became available.\nWe continue to be invigorated by the momentum of this business brought to both Callaway's portfolio and to the game of golf.\nSame venue sales percentage versus 2019 levels continued encouraging trend of recovery, with Q2 results in the low 90s, up substantially from the low 80s in Q1 of this year.\nResults were driven by a mix of strong walk-in sales and continued recovery in the event business.\nLooking forward, and this assumes no major restrictions from COVID upticks, we feel same venue sales for Q3 will be above Q2 results, while we expect Q4 sales to be slightly slower than Q2 due to the corporate events mixed in that quarter and that the full year should end at approximately 90%.\nTo put this in context, this is considerably above our expectations for the year and, we believe, a strong performance.\nDomestic venue expansion continued as planned during the quarter, with four new venues opening.\nAnother venue, Holtsville, Long Island, opened recently, and yet another, Colorado Springs will open later this week.\nWe then expect to open one more venue in Q4 for a total of nine new domestic venues this year.\nAt the end of the year, we will have 67 domestic venues in operation across three owned UPA venues for a total of 70 owned venues in operation.\nInternationally, our U.K. venues had an excellent quarter as they reopened strongly after COVID induced shutdowns in Q1, and our franchise international venue business continues to build capability and momentum despite various COVID challenges.\nOverall, the venue business is very healthy, with profitability exceeding our expectations.\nThe Toptracer business had a successful quarter as well, with over 2,000 bays installed in Q2, setting a new record as we continue to see strong demand and excellent customer feedback.\nWhile some challenges remain on the installation front due to COVID, we expect to meet or exceed our target of 8,000 new bays for the year.\nOne of the highlights for the quarter was the successful installation of Toptracer into what we believe is the world's largest driving range, Golf Club Daiju located outside Nagoya in Central Japan.\nLastly, Topgolf's unique position in the market as a gateway to golf is continuing to introduce new players in the sport, and we see excellent long-term potential through our preferential ability to market to these new entrants and drive synergies across a growing consumer base, both on and off course.\nLooking ahead to the second half of the year and beyond, I remain excited about the opportunity ahead of us.\nWe operate in great categories with a unique portfolio of businesses that are all exceeding our expectations.\nThere are, of course, macroeconomic hurdles that we and many companies are facing, including supply chain constraints, freight costs, staffing challenges, and inflationary pressure, but at the demand level, we are experiencing and expect to experience in the foreseeable future we see these as manageable and expect to still deliver excellent financial results.\nOn the supply chain side, our guidance assumes an estimated $55 million negative impact to our top-line growth, primarily in Q3, to account for current disruptions.\nOn the inflationary side, we have already started taking some price and believe we'll largely have the ability to take price as needed.\nGiven the various moving parts for the remainder of the year, we are providing both third quarter and full-year guidance.\nI'll let Brian discuss the numbers in more detail, but the headline is that we expect our full-year 2021 sales to be over $1.3 billion higher than 2019 and adjusted EBITDA to be between $134 million and $149 million higher than 2019.\nOur EBITDA for 2021 will be very close to the number we guided to for 2022 when we provided longer-term guidance in the fall of last year.\nWe are essentially a year ahead of plan.\nAs Chip mentioned, we are very pleased with our second quarter and first-half results.\nEach of our operating segments performed above our expectations, leading to record results despite a challenging operating environment.\nThere are some continuing challenges from the pandemic that will have effect on our business in the short term, including supply chain constraints, increased freight costs, staffing challenges, and inflationary pressures.\nHowever, we believe that current demand levels, along with actions we can take, will mitigate the impact of these factors, and we expect to have strong financial results for the year and the foreseeable future.\nWe are energized by the opportunities ahead of us, and we believe we are well situated to handle the prolonged pandemic.\nMore specifically, each of our operating segments support an outdoor, active and healthy way of life that is compatible with the world of social distancing, and we have a strong liquidity position.\nAs of June 30, 2021, our available liquidity, which is comprised of cash on hand and availability under our credit facilities, was $877 million, compared to $483 million at June 30, 2020.\nIn evaluating our results for the second quarter and first half, you should keep in mind the following: First, our non-GAAP results exclude non-cash amortization expense of intangible assets acquired in acquisitions, including fair value adjustments to Topgolf's leases and debt; noncash depreciation expense from the fair value step-up of Topgolf assets; transaction and transition costs from the acquisitions; noncash amortization of the debt discount on the notes issued during the second quarter of 2020; the $174 million pre-tax non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2020 related to the Jack Wolfskin goodwill and trade name; a $253 million non-cash gain related to the write-up of our premerger Topgolf investment; a $33 million benefit in the second quarter of 2021 from the reversal of a portion of the noncash valuation allowance related to certain of our deferred tax assets and certain other nonrecurring items.\nWe have provided in the tables to this release a reconciliation detailing the impact of these items on second quarter and first-half GAAP results.\nSecond, this is a reminder that our first-half financial results include Topgolf for four months only as the merger was completed on March 8, 2021.\nWith those factors in mind, I will now discuss our financial results.\nLooking at Slides 10 and 11.\nFollowing record revenues in the first quarter, our revenues continued to be very strong in the second quarter of 2021, setting another record for the company.\nThe second-quarter 2021 revenues benefited from incremental revenue from the Topgolf merger, and second-quarter 2020 revenues were significantly impacted as much of the company's business in golf retail will shut down then due to the pandemic.\nDuring the second quarter of 2021, sales in all product segments and in all major regions increased compared to both 2020 and 2019.\nWith that said, consolidated second quarter 2020 revenues were $914 million, compared to $297 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of $617 million or 208%.\nThis increase was led by a 98% increase in the golf equipment and soft goods businesses as well as an incremental $325 million from the Topgolf business.\nChanges in foreign currency rates had an $18 million favorable impact on second-quarter 2021 revenues.\nConsolidated second-quarter 2020 revenues also increased $467 million or 105% compared to the same period in 2019, including a 37% increase in golf equipment and 21% increase in our soft goods business.\nAs a result, consolidated revenue for the first half of 2021 increased $826 million or 112% compared to 2020 and increased $602 million or 63% compared to the same period in 2019.\nTotal cost and expenses were $806 million in the second quarter of 2021, compared to $474 million in the second quarter of 2020.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, which excludes, among other things, the $174 million non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2020, our total costs and expenses increased $503 million to $796 million for the second quarter of 2021, compared to $293 million in the second quarter of 2020.\nTopgolf added $301 million of total costs and expenses.\nThe remainder includes increased variable expense, the restoration of some expenses that were reduced during the pandemic in 2020, planned investment in the business, increased corporate costs to support a larger organization, and increased freight and inflationary pressures, including labor and commodity prices.\nTo date, the overperformance of the company's business has generally allowed us to outpace the cost increases.\nWe are also reporting for the second quarter of 2021 operating income of $107 million, an increase of $285 million, compared to a loss of $177 million for the same period in 2020.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the impairment charge in 2020, operating income for the second quarter of 2021 was $118 million, a $114 million increase, compared to $4 million for the same period in 2020.\nThe increase in second-quarter non-GAAP operating income was led by a $96 million increase in segment operating income from our golf equipment and soft goods businesses as well as an incremental $24 million from the Topgolf business.\nNon-GAAP operating income for the first half of 2021 increased $167 million to $215 million, compared to $47 million for the first half of 2020.\nOther expense was $31 million in the second quarter of 2021, compared to other income of $2 million in the same period of the prior year.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, other expense was $27 million in the second quarter of 2021, compared to other income of $3 million for the comparable period in 2020.\nThe $30 million decrease was primarily related to $14 million of higher interest expense related to the Topgolf business in the second quarter of 2021 and an $11 million gain from the settlement of a cross-currency swap arrangement in the second quarter of 2020.\nNon-GAAP other expense for the first half of 2021, which excludes, among other things, the $253 million non-cash gain related to the write-up of the company's premerger investment in Topgolf, was $33 million of expense, compared to $1 million of income in the first half of 2020.\nEarnings per share was $0.47 on approximately 194 million shares in the second quarter of 2021, compared to a loss per share of $1.78 on approximately 94 million shares in the second quarter of 2020.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share was $0.36 in the second quarter of 2021, compared to earnings per share of $0.06 for the second quarter of 2020.\nNon-GAAP fully diluted shares were 194 million in the second quarter of 2021, compared to 95 million shares for the same period in 2020.\nThe share increase is primarily related to the issuance of additional shares in connection with the Topgolf merger.\nFull-year estimated diluted shares is approximately 178 million shares, which includes the weighted average shares issued in connection with the merger over approximately a 10-month period.\nAs of June 2021, we had approximately 186 million shares that were issued and outstanding.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $164 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $29 million in the second quarter of 2020 and $66 million in the second quarter of 2019.\nTopgolf contributed adjusted EBITDA of $57 million.\nFor the first half of 2021, adjusted EBITDA was $292 million compared to $89 million in the first half of 2020 and $159 million in the first half of 2019.\nTopgolf contributed adjusted EBITDA of $17 million for the four months.\nTurning now to Slide 12.\nI will now cover certain key balance sheet and other items.\nAs of June 30, 2021, available liquidity, which represents availability under our credit facilities, plus cash on hand, was $877 million compared to $483 million at the end of the second quarter of 2020.\nThis additional liquidity reflects overperformance in all of our business segments and improved liquidity from working capital.\nAt June 30, 2021, we had total net debt of $1.1 billion, including $652 million of Topgolf-related net debt.\nThe Topgolf debt includes demand -- I mean, deemed landlord financing of $263 million related to financing of its venue businesses.\nOur leverage ratios have improved significantly period over period, and on a funded debt basis, are now under three times.\nOur consolidated net accounts receivable was $325 million, an increase of 52% compared to $214 million at the end of the second quarter of 2020.\nThe legacy business sales outstanding decreased to 58 days on June 30, 2020, compared to 79 days as of June 30, 2020.\nThe increase in net accounts receivable is primarily attributable to the increase in second-quarter revenue but also includes an incremental $9 million of Topgolf accounts receivable.\nWe continue to remain very comfortable with the overall quality of our accounts receivable at this time.\nAlso displayed on Slide 12, our inventory balance decreased by 12% to $335 million at the end of the second quarter of 2021 compared to $379 million at the end of the second quarter of the prior year.\nThis $44 million decrease was due to the high demand we were experiencing in the golf equipment business and better-than-expected performance in our soft goods business.\nTopgolf added approximately $14 million of inventory this quarter.\nCapital expenditures for the first six months of 2021 were $96 million, net of expected REIT reimbursements.\nThis includes $66 million related to Topgolf.\nFrom the full-year 2021 forecast perspective, the golf equipment and soft goods business forecast is $65 million, consistent with our previous forecast.\nThe 2021 full-year forecast for Callaway and Topgolf is approximately $243 million, net of reimbursements, primarily related to the new venue openings.\nThe foregoing does not include approximately $33 million in capital expenditures for Topgolf in January and February premerger.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $43 million in the second quarter of 2021.\nNon-GAAP depreciation and amortization expense was $36 million in the second quarter of 2021, compared to $8 million in 2020.\nThis includes $27 million of non-GAAP depreciation and amortization related to Topgolf.\nFor the full year in 2021, we expect non-GAAP depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $133 million, which includes $95 million for the Topgolf business.\nThe foregoing does not include approximately $18 million of Topgolf non-GAAP depreciation and amortization for January and February in the aggregate.\nI am now on Slide 13.\nAs Chip mentioned, we are providing revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for the full year and third quarter of 2021.\nPlease note this guidance only includes the post-merger Topgolf results for 10 months of 2021.\nFor the full year, we expect revenue to range from $3.025 billion and $3.055 billion.\nThat compares to $1.590 billion in 2020 and $1.701 billion in 2019.\nThe company's full-year 2021 net sales estimate assumes continued positive demand fundamentals for our golf equipment and soft goods segment; no further business, supply chain, and retail shutdowns due to COVID; and the Topgolf's 10 months of segment sales approach 2019 full year levels of $1.06 billion.\nThe outlook also assumes $55 million of supply chain risk due to the current Southeast Asia COVID shutdowns, almost all of which is expected to occur in the third-quarter 2021.\nFrom a cost perspective, full-year 2021 non-GAAP operating expenses for our golf equipment and soft goods businesses are estimated to be approximately $100 million higher than full-year 2019 non-GAAP operating expenses.\nThis is $20 million to $30 million higher than we previously guided at the beginning of the year, and the increase is related primarily to variable costs associated with the strong performance of the business this year, accelerated investments in the TravisMathew brand to support its faster-than-expected growth and additional corporate infrastructure costs to support a larger organization.\nInvestors should also note that approximately 85% of the incremental $100 million in expense is expected to be incurred in the second half of 2021 due in part to the Callaway apparel business in Korea that we took over from our licensee in July and a more normalized level of spend in the second half of 2021 to support all of our businesses.\nIn addition, we are expecting continued cost pressure from increased freight costs and inflationary pressures, including labor and commodity pricing, at least through the first half of 2022.\nTo date, positive volume variances have outpaced the majority of these increased costs, but they will continue to have some impact.\nFull-year adjusted EBITDA is projected to be between $345 million and $360 million.\nThe company's full-year 2021 adjusted EBITDA estimate assumes the Topgolf segment will deliver over $100 million in adjusted EBITDA for the 10 months beginning March 8, 2021.\nThis estimate assumes a previously mentioned supply chain revenue risk and continued elevated freight and other cost pressures, which are expected to have an overall greater impact than we originally anticipated for the balance of the year.\nFrom a third-quarter perspective, we expect revenue to range from $775 million to $790 million versus 2020 revenue of $476 million and 2019 revenue of $426 million.\nWe expect adjusted EBITDA for the third-quarter 2021 to be between $51 million to $58 million versus 2020 of $87 million and 2019 of $57 million.\nThis projected revenue growth represents the addition of Topgolf revenue as well as growth in the soft goods segment.\nBecause of the previously mentioned supply constraints in the extraordinary second half the golf equipment business had in the second half of 2020, as interest in golf surge following the relaxation of COVID restrictions, we are forecasting third-quarter revenue for the golf equipment segment to be below 2020 levels but above 2019.\nWhile not optimal, the third quarter supply constraints are not currently forecasted to affect the fourth quarter of 2021 or even 2022 to any significant degree.\nIn closing, I would like to emphasize a couple of points.\nI know we have spent some time today discussing the short-term headwinds from COVID, particularly on the forecasted supply chain constraints in the third quarter.\nAlthough annoying, the short-term disruption will not have a long-term impact on our value or strategy.\nInvestors should not lose sight of the fact we are having a tremendous year.\nAnd yes, without those headwinds, we would be having an even better year, but this is still a great year.\nWe're hitting our financial goals essentially a year ahead of what we had planned despite a challenging operating environment.\nEach of our segments are performing well.\nThe Topgolf merger has been wildly successful, and we feel well-positioned for the future, both in a COVID operating environment and after.\nWe also remain very excited about the opportunities and growth prospects ahead of us.\nOperator, over to you.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Today, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; Chief Financial Officer, Frank Dellaquila; and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan.\nColleen joins us from the Automation Solutions finance organization and will be your main point of contact going forward as I transition to a new role in the operating business units.\nI certainly wish you health and success.\nPlease join me on slide two.\nI certainly have big shoes to fill.\nAs Pete mentioned, I'm coming into this role from our Automation Solutions finance organization, and I've been with Emerson for over 13 years.\nI'm certainly excited and humbled to be joining the Investor Relations team during this dynamic time for our organization.\nI look forward to speaking with all our investors and partners very soon.\nNow I would like to take a moment to highlight two areas of real ESG impact within Emerson.\nFirst, on slide three, in keeping with environmental sustainability framework of greening of, by and with Emerson that we introduced in February, our first topic is about greening by Emerson.\nIt is a great example of how Emerson solutions are relevant in enabling our customers' sustainability initiatives.\nEmerson recently signed a multiyear agreement with PureCycle Technologies, which has a novel technology and process for fully recycling plastic number five polypropylene back to a clear pellet.\nAs some of you may know, polypropylene is a common form of plastic that has not had great recycling options.\nEmerson is serving as their born digital automation partner going forward with initial plant projects in Ohio, Georgia and a remote operation center in Florida.\nNow please join me on slide number four.\nOur second topic is the greening with Emerson example.\nLeveraging our Helix Innovation Center in Dayton, Ohio, Emerson has collaborated with the Department of Energy and their Oak Ridge National Laboratory to advance next-generation HVACR technology.\nExpanding the applicability of heat pump technologies, redesigning refrigeration architectures to maximize efficiency in food retail and working to minimize energy use and leaks in commercial HVAC applications are just a few of the exciting areas of cooperation.\nWe have a number of collaborations with the Department of Energy and their labs.\nWe look forward to continuing to build these relationships and support the development of novel solutions and real sustainability road maps going forward.\nGod speed and have a good luck in your new opportunity.\nGreat to have you here.\nColleen and I had the opportunity to spend couple of years together in Automation Solutions, and we're very blessed to have her join our Investor Relations team.\nAnd we have a lot of energy and momentum behind us, which was very exciting to see as we executed through the last three months.\nI had the opportunity over the last six months to meet many of you, and I look forward to meeting more of you as I go through the next part of the year.\nBut I appreciate your continued confidence, your challenges and of course, your investment.\nA few things just that are not financially related that I want to mention to the team here.\nFirst of all, our cultural work is well underway.\nWe will be announcing our new Chief People Officer later this month.\nWe're all very excited about the selection process.\nIt will be an outside hire and somebody who fundamentally will have the opportunity to come in here and really help us as we navigate some of the challenges and create many of the pathways that we have as we evolve the culture of Emerson into the future.\nSecondly, our portfolio work is complete.\nWe have -- we are now getting ready to review it with the Board, which will occur at the October Board meeting.\nWe discussed briefly with the Board yesterday.\nAnd essentially, what we have defined is multiple paths for our business to drive higher underlying sales growth and diversification of the portfolio.\nWe're all very excited about the process that we underwent.\nIt was very exhaustive, and we have turned over a lot of different stones, defining broad markets with high growth and lots of optionality in terms of M&A and organic activity.\nI'll mention on the M&A side that industrial software continues to be critical as we think about share of wallet, as we think about the potential for underlying growth acceleration and our many pathways there.\nOur SI acquisition is performing incredibly well and ahead of our internal synergy board plans.\nSo that's been very, very well done.\nBut what stands out to me most above all is the execution by the team.\nYes, there were market tailwinds, and we'll talk about those, particularly as they accelerated in Automation Solutions and continued across our Commercial & Residential businesses and they are relevant, but the execution was absolutely phenomenal.\nThere were a lot of hurdles to overcome through the quarter, material inflation, material availability.\nWe did a lot of expediting.\nWe had to get very creative in qualifying suppliers, logistics and management of cargo around the world and of course, labor availability in the United States.\nBut the team just did a great job.\nAnd we're seeing, despite these operational headwinds, the value of that work being reflected in the incrementals of the company.\nThe operating leverage -- profit leverage at 34% was very strong and now most importantly, has given us the room to accelerate investment in differentiating technologies and further -- that will further, I think, drive relevance -- increased relevance at our customer base.\nSo very exciting headroom that's created, and we started those investments.\nAnd I'll share a number of those with you, and we'll talk about that more as we go through the year.\nWe're especially pleased with the results in the quarter, especially in light of the operations challenges that Lal just described and Ram will talk about a little later in the call.\nIf you please go to slide six.\nSo a continued recovery in our end markets, combined with the benefits of the cost reset actions, and it drove strong operating performance and financial results in the third quarter.\nAdjusted earnings per share was $1.09, up 36% from the prior year.\nDemand continues to strengthen with sales coming in ahead of our expectations with underlying growth of 15%, and June trailing 3-month orders were at 26%.\nAutomation Solutions notably turned positive this quarter in both sales and orders, up 9% in sales and 17% on an underlying basis.\nCommercial & Residential Solutions continues to experience robust demand across the business and geographies with 29% sales growth and 43% orders growth on an underlying basis.\nThe cost reset benefits continued to be realized as planned reading through to the margins.\nAnd along with the additional volume and leverage, they drove adjusted segment EBIT growth of 40%, 280 basis points of increased margin to 19.6%.\nCash flow continues to be very strong with operating and free cash flow up approximately 30% year-over-year and free cash flow conversion exceeding 150% of net earnings.\nWe're continuing to implement the remaining elements of the cost reset program.\nIn this quarter, we initiated $32 million of restructuring actions.\nThe program is on schedule and delivering the projected savings as we've planned.\nThis is a bridge of the earnings per share increase from the prior year.\nThe operational performance was very strong.\nSo the noteworthy thing on this chart is the green bar.\nOperations added 33% to adjusted EPS, and it was balanced between the platforms.\nThey both delivered strong profit leverage on the strength of volume increases and cost reduction benefits, as Lal mentioned.\nLeverage was 34% across the enterprise.\nTax, currency, pension, stock comp netted to a $0.05 headwind, and there was a minor favorable impact from share repurchase.\nAgain, in total, adjusted earnings per share was $1.09, up 36%.\nPlease go to the next chart, Chart number eight.\nSo as I mentioned, underlying sales is up 15%.\nGross profit increased 90 basis points to 42.4%, driven mainly by the benefits of the cost reduction actions and then the leverage on the volume across the enterprise.\nWe did offset the impact of price/cost headwinds, which we are beginning to see intensify and which we will see in the next couple of quarters and we will talk about a little later in the call.\nAdjusted EBIT margin was 18.4%, up 310 basis points.\nEffective tax rate was 19.2% versus 11% in the prior year.\nLast year, we had several favorable discrete items, mostly around R&D credits that we described at the time.\nThis was a $0.10 headwind year-over-year that we overcame.\nAdjusted EPS, as mentioned, was $1.09 versus $0.80 last year.\nIf you go to slide nine, please, we'll talk about earnings and cash flow.\nAdjusted segment EBIT again increased 40%, margin up 280 basis points.\nThe leverage on volume and cost reset benefits offset material cost headwinds in the Climate Technologies business.\nAdjusted pre-tax earnings increased 350 basis points to 17.6%.\nOperating cash flow was very strong, up 31% at $1.1 billion.\nFree cash flow was $977 million, also up a little over 30%, driven by strong earnings growth and effective working capital management.\nLastly, the trade working capital ratio improved to 15.4% of sales.\nTurning to slide 10, we'll look at Automation Solutions.\nUnderlying sales turned positive this quarter at 8%.\nTrailing 3-month orders accelerated to 17%.\nThe improvement in the Americas is particularly encouraging and notable with continued momentum in life sciences, food and beverage and medical markets and a return to growth more broadly across the traditional process automation markets and sustainability-related business.\nWe're seeing increasing KOB three activity across our process automation customer base mainly driven by shutdown turnaround and outage activity and opex spend.\nMRO spend is returning to pre-pandemic levels from pent-up demand and delayed STOs.\ncapex spending is recovering at a slower rate with tailwinds from site-based emissions and optimization projects.\nThe platform continues to implement the comprehensive restructuring actions that have been ongoing, and the benefits are flowing through to the financial results.\nAdjusted EBIT margin increased 320 basis points and 310 basis points at adjusted EBITDA, driven mainly by the flow-through of the cost reset savings and by the volume leverage.\nThe integration of OSI continues to go very well.\nWe're very pleased with the acquisition and the results to date, and we have increasing confidence in the synergy plan that we have.\nBacklog increased to $5.5 billion.\nIt is up 17% year-to-date.\nWe'll talk a bit about the project funnel and other opportunities later in the call.\nTurning to slide 11, we'll review Commercial & Residential Solutions.\nSales were up on an underlying basis 29% versus the prior year.\nOrders continue to be strong and very broad-based in their strength.\nThe June trailing 3-month underlying orders were up 43%, and it was very balanced across both Climate Technologies and Tools & Home products.\nAll our businesses and geographies showed strong double-digit growth.\nResidential markets continue to be strong and growth has accelerated in Cold Chain and Professional Tools.\nThe Americas were up 29% with continued strength across all end markets.\nEurope was up 37%, driven by continued heat pump demand and increasing sales of professional tools.\nAsia, Middle East and Africa was up 25%, driven by Cold Chain and various heating technologies.\nMargins improved by 170 basis points of adjusted EBIT and 120 basis points of adjusted EBITDA driven by the strong volume leverage and the cost reset savings, which more than offset the price/cost headwinds that we are seeing in the business.\nI'm going to pass this over to Ram, and he's going to talk a bit about operations, what we've done in the quarter to deliver the results and some of the challenges that we face.\nClearly, as you can see, our operating environment remains very challenging as commodity inflation, electronic supply and labor availability continues to impact our global operations.\nSteel prices are at record highs with 11 months of consecutive increases and in our estimation, have not peaked yet.\nPlastic resin prices remain elevated as our global teams have maneuvered expeditiously defined alternatives to maintain supply.\nAnd while copper pricing has receded off record highs, it is still up over $1.40 a pound year-over-year.\nOur hedge positions lessened the impact to 2021, but the inflation impact in terms of copper will carry over into most of 2022.\nElectronics shortages are proliferating in most of our businesses, impacting both platforms, and supply is expected to remain constrained well into 2022.\nVery little component inventory on microprocessors, controllers, linear integrated circuits are available in the open market, and the number of shortages faced by our EMS suppliers is growing, severely impacting lead times.\nAnd finally, labor availability continues to be an issue across many industries in the U.S., and our businesses are impacted as well.\nOur V-shaped demand recovery in many of our Commercial & Residential Solutions businesses, local competition driven by tight labor markets in many cities and rolling labor constraints as waves of COVID disruptions impact our sites has added a new level of complexity to our operational plans.\nIt is important to note that price/cost remains at an unfavorable $75 million as we estimated last quarter.\nNo change, but we expect the maximum impact of the commodity inflation to be felt in the next two quarters.\nNow despite these challenges, turning to slide 13, I'd like to highlight some of the outstanding work by our global supply chain and operations teams to combat these challenges and help deliver phenomenal operational results to date as they remain flexible, creative and nimble in a dynamic environment to serve the needs of our customers.\nOur supply chain teams have worked tirelessly in this environment to ensure continuity of material supply to our global plants.\nAs you can see on the chart, many creative solutions are being implemented on a real-time basis quickly and effectively.\nOur regional footprint, both on the manufacturing side as well as supply chain that we spent many years developing, has certainly been an advantage for us in these challenging times.\nMany of our global plants are producing at record levels while ramping up capacity to meet surge demand and in many cases, in-sourcing critical elements of the supply chain to address sudden disruptions.\nLet's turn now to slide 15.\nWe are improving our sales outlook for the year based on the continued strength in our orders, the pace of business and the year-to-date profit performance.\nWe now expect underlying sales growth to be near the top of our May guidance of approximately 5% to 6%, Commercial Residential above their range in May at 15% to 16% and Automation Solutions closer to the top of that range at 0% to 1%.\nThe strong volume and improved cost base will flow through to margins.\nOur estimates are now 50 basis points above the previous guidance, increasing adjusted EBIT margin and adjusted EBITDA by 0.5% to approximately 18% and 23%, respectively.\nThere's no change to the restructuring, tax rate, capital spend or dividend.\nStrong profitability and working capital performance enabled an increase in our operating cash flow and free cash flow estimates, both of which increased by $300 million.\nWe are also raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $4.07, plus or minus $0.01.\nOur price/cost headwind for 2021 currently remains as estimated in Q2 and Ram covered at $75 million despite the current challenges that were highlighted.\nWe continue to manage this through containment, selective price actions, but the recent market developments that Ram described will be challenged through the next two quarters as we navigate them.\nStock compensation impact increases to $125 million.\nSo now we'll go over to Chart 16, and I'll just frame the order environment that we've experienced through the last three months.\nEmerson's trailing 3-month orders continue to be very strong and have momentum from the last update we gave you in the second quarter, with Commercial & Residential Solutions continuing to climb higher in their order run rates and Automation Solutions turned sharply positive to the high teens in June.\nCommercial & Residential Solutions continues to see strength in Residential, Cold Chain and the Professional Tools business, and all three very near to that average band of 43%.\nDiscrete and hybrid end markets in Automation Solutions continue to be very strong, while we see recovery in later cycle process automation markets, especially in North America.\nKOB three and KOB two are driving most of the recovery, but we are beginning to see some KOB one activity materialize, particularly in chemicals, power and biofuels.\nThe Americas really strengthened, up 29% as deferred maintenance demand and site access drove momentum.\nFinally, as we have commented in the past quarters, life sciences momentum continues to be extremely strong.\nLet's now turn to Chart 17, and I'll review the underlying sales growth outlook.\nQ3 underlying sales were up 15% versus prior year, exceeding our management expectations, driven by the strength in Commercial & Residential Solutions as well as the North America recovery just discussed.\nFull year expectations on underlying sales are between 5% and 6%, at the top end of our prior guidance of 3% to 6% and sales of approximately $18.4 billion.\nThe fourth quarter is expected to land in the high single digits to low double-digit range.\nFor the remainder of the year, we expect to see the North America business continue to recover in Automation Solutions as well as continued broad strength in commercial residential solutions.\nHowever, the impact of supply chain and labor issues will be a challenge.\nAs Frank mentioned, for the full year, we are expecting Automation Solutions sales to be flat to 1% and Commercial & Residential Solutions to be between 15% and 16%, driving us to our overall 5% to 6% underlying sales expectations.\nSo starting off in the Americas.\nQuarter four is expected to be strong in Automation Solutions at approximately 20% growth, broad-based recovery across all industries, led by continued strength in discrete and increasing strength in hybrid.\nProcess is showing some recovery, although uneven with some strength from returning domestic oil demand, offset by reduced midstream investment and continued fiscal restraint in upstream.\nFor KOB 3, we expect to see continued spend for deferred maintenance and increasing spend for site access that has been pent-up from the pandemic with an expectation that we will see a strong fall shutdown turnaround season.\nIn Latin America, strength in mining industries particularly are expected to continue.\nOn the Commercial & Residential side of the business, ongoing momentum in the residential markets, driven by do-it-yourself trends, home starts and HVAC seasonality as well as strength in Professional Tools and Cold Chain are expected to continue.\nEurope will continue to see demand in life sciences and biofuels on the automation side.\nProject wins in power, midstream, downstream and sustainability will drive low to mid-single-digit growth in Q4.\nCommercial & Residential will see robust demand for heat pumps and professional tools as well as the continuation of the refrigeration market recovery in Q4.\nTurning to Asia, Middle East and Africa.\nOur Asia automation business is seeing healthy project activity in marine, nuclear, life sciences and semiconductors and a positive trend for site-level spending in the Middle East.\nOn the Commercial & Residential side, we are seeing the commercial recovery across the region, specifically with commercial AC and cold chain solutions.\nOngoing COVID restrictions continue to be a challenge across the organization, particularly in this part of the world.\nLet's now turn to Chart 19, and we'll review the business funnel for Automation Solutions.\nSo back in February, we commented that our traditional large project funnel was $6.4 billion, and this should be something that is very familiar to those of you who watch this carefully.\nSince February, we have booked approximately $80 million of projects, some LNG and one most notably in Mexico.\nNew projects added include clean fuels, hydrogen, renewable diesels, lithium mining and LNG projects, while projects removed from the funnel since February were mostly oil and gas and downstream refining projects.\nThe August 2021 funnel is now valued at $6.3 billion in approximately 180 projects.\nAnd below in the donut pies, you can see the industry mix of our traditional funnel.\nWe have identified new decarbonization opportunities.\nAnd though generally smaller than our traditional definition of projects for our funnel classifications, these projects are increasingly relevant to our business.\nThey're being added into this view because they have the potential to grow in nature over time.\nToday, as depicted on the chart, these opportunities are worth $400 million in approximately 120 projects.\nThe combination of our traditional project funnel and the new sustainability funnel is now valued at $6.7 billion.\nAnd below is the combined industry mix where we are working to diversify our funnel.\nOn the right side of the chart, we are introducing the business opportunities with our recent OSI acquisition, which gave us an important foothold into the transmission and distribution automation space.\nThese opportunities have slightly different characteristics from our traditional project funnel definition, and therefore, we are keeping it separate for our discussion purposes today.\nGenerally, these opportunities are smaller and more numerous compared to our large traditional project funnel, but they are clearly strategically important.\nThe value of these opportunities is $1.5 billion and are made up of 530 projects.\nTo give you some perspective on the scale and how differentiated it is, approximately 15% of that $1.5 billion has a value of greater than $5 million, and 50% of it is between $1 million and $5 million.\nThe funnel is global, although approximately $1 billion of it is in North America and Europe.\nOverall, we have strong opportunities ahead, and I'm bullish on overall project outlook as we diversify and expand into new spaces.\nNow let's turn to Chart 20.\nThis is a very important chart.\nAnd as Frank mentioned in our financial results showcase, our robust cost reset plan is being incredibly well executed across the enterprise.\nAs a reminder, this comprehensive plan began in late 2019 and will be fully realized by 2023.\nIt involves over $600 million in spend and approximately $650 million in savings.\nIn February, we also introduced our midrange targets of 24% adjusted EBITDA margins and $4.75 to $5 in adjusted EPS.\nWe are very much on track to reach those targets by 2023.\nImportantly, however, the recent outperformance and momentum through the end of 2021 is creating some headroom for critical investments.\nAnd I'm particularly excited about this, particularly as I think about key technologies that will enable our business to outperform over the long term.\nAs you can see, revenues, margins and cash flow are all better than February expectations and are enabling this acceleration in technology investments.\nI've outlined four examples below and will come out over the next months and in depth in February as to how we're managing and thinking about these very significant investments.\nExamples outlined are the Copeland K7 scroll, which is the largest new product investment in the history of our air conditioning business.\nThis thing drives obviously increased performance and meets the 2023 efficiency regulations and is optimized for 2025 refrigerants.\nThe Greenlee remote cutters, an award-winning tool on the right-hand side of the chart, which enhances safety for cutting underground cables.\nThe Gemini, which is our next-generation pressure and temperature device being developed in our Measurement Solutions business, which will have next-generation electronics, unmatched safety and process insight.\nAnd lastly, our Plantweb Optics, our integrated operational performance platform, which unifies data, people and systems to drive operational performance.\nSummary: ",

website.\nTo be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question, plus one follow-up.\nBefore we get started, I want to let you all know that we are planning an Investor Day in early April, and we will be sharing more information soon.\nWith that, I will turn the discussion over to Phil Snow.\nBefore I begin, let me start by welcoming Kendra, who recently became FactSet's, Head of Investor Relations.\nKendra has worked at FactSet for more than two decades, most recently, serving as my Chief of Staff.\nShe brings a deep knowledge of the Company and industry expertise to her new role.\nI look forward to working with Kendra to continued growing our Investor Relations program.\nWe are excited to have her here and have already begun leveraging her deep financial and operational expertise, as we continue to execute our growth strategy.\nTurning to our performance.\nFactSet is off to a strong start to fiscal 2022, and I'm pleased to share that this quarter, had the highest Q1 incremental ASV on record.\nBuilding on the momentum from Q4, we grew organic ASV plus professional services by 9% year-over-year in Q1.\nThe strong performance of our sales and client-facing teams carry forward from Q4, increasing the pace of our go-to-market strategy.\nThese teams continue to drive increased retention and expansion rates among our existing clients, while achieving a high number of new business wins.\nThe biggest contributor to this quarter's growth were institutional asset management clients, as we continue to see strength in our workstation and accelerating growth in our analytics workflow solutions.\nThe last two years of accelerated investment in content and technology continue to drive top line growth.\nWe are seeing increased demand for differentiated content and workflow solutions.\nFactSet's leading open content and analytics platform is allowing us to meet this demand and capture more share of wallet with our clients.\nBy client type, wins were broad-based.\nWe saw a double-digit ASV growth rates from our banking, wealth, hedge fund and corporate clients, as well as private equity and venture capital funds and partners.\nOur investments in content and technology including deep sector, wealth and analytics solutions continue to support client retention rates and renewals across the board.\nOverall, we are pleased that our performance resulted in a 13% increase in adjusted earnings per share from the prior year period.\nOur adjusted operating margin of 33.6% exceeds our guidance.\nLinda will walk you through the details in a few minutes.\nWe are now in the final year of our multiyear investment plan, and we remain on track to achieve our goals.\nOur focus is on our digital platform scaling our content refinery and creating hyper personalized workflow solutions.\nWithin our content refinery, ESG, data for wealth, private markets and deep sector are all fueling workstation growth.\nWe continue to grow our deep sector data launching real estate and technology media and telecom in November.\nDeep sector and our investments in private markets have translated into growth and high retention within sell-side firms.\nAnd our recent acquisition of Cobalt further advances, our private market strategy by connecting differentiated data with tracking and portfolio monitoring providing value to our private equity and venture capital clients.\nOur workflow solutions, which deliver efficiencies across the front, middle and back office continue to add meaningful ASV.\nOur analytics APIs are resonating with our clients, and we are increasingly integrating with cloud-based platforms.\nEarlier this month, we launched over 90 datasets and a number of APIs on Amazon Data Exchange, the first major data and analytics provider to do so.\nOur trading business continues to grow, bolstered by the recent addition of fixed income support for trade execution.\nThis enables our clients to surface new insights and trade across asset classes with greater speed and efficiency and was a significant contributor to the growth of our analytics and trading business during the quarter.\nOur product teams are focused on identifying, developing and implementing made for client workflow solutions for each of our client types.\nThis has been incredibly successful within wealth, as our Advisor Dashboard maintains a healthy pipeline and solid client engagement for FY22.\nWe see this hyper personalization as a key differentiator and are committed to working with our clients to evolve our offerings.\nLooking across our regions, we saw continued strength in ASV growth across all our markets.\nThe Americas was the biggest contributor, as organic ASV growth accelerated to 9% supported by broad-based strength across our businesses.\nThis was driven by strong retention and expansion among asset managers and asset owners.\nThe region also benefited from capturing higher price increases.\nIn EMEA, growth accelerated to 7% consistently improving over the past three quarters.\nResearch and advisory had a particularly positive impact, driven by improved retention among asset managers and wealth clients and strong workstation sales to new customers.\nAsia Pacific had another robust quarter with growth accelerating to 14% driven primarily by CTS.\nWe again saw wins across many countries with hedge funds, asset managers and asset owners driving ASV growth.\nIn summary, I am proud of the FactSet team for delivering such strong results to the start of the year.\nThe first quarter, as you know is historically a slower start to the fiscal year and not necessarily an indication of our performance for the rest of the year.\nHowever, our momentum from Q4 has continued, and we are well positioned to deliver on our targets for the year.\nAs such, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2022 guidance, and we remain confident in our pipeline and then the value we are delivering to our clients.\nLooking ahead, we continue to focus on the three strategic priorities, scaling up our content refinery, enhancing the client experience through hyper personalized solutions, and delivering next generation workflow solutions for clients.\nAnd we believe that our people, culture and performance-driven mindset will enable us to execute on these priorities, as we accelerate the pace of change.\nWe are committed to investing in and developing the talent experience and the skills of our team, as we build the industry's leading open content and analytics platform.\nFinally, an important milestone in our Company's history occurred earlier this week when FactSet became part of the S&P 500 Index.\nOur addition was in fact predicted by our S&P 500 constituents prediction signal on October 1st.\nOur inclusion is a proud moment for FactSet and a testament to our tremendous growth and our efforts to help our clients do their best work.\nOur team's creativity, dedication and collaborative spirit make us a trusted partner, and I'm tremendously proud of their drive to create smarter, more innovative solutions for our clients.\nI'm really pleased to be here today as part of the FactSet team.\nI've been at FactSet for just a few months, but in that short time it's become clear that the Company has been performing really well, from accelerating top line growth and strong free cash flow generation to its long history of consistent and growing shareholder returns, and there is still a lot of runway ahead of us, as the investments made over the past two years are paying off and driving growth.\nThere is undeniably a great deal of talent across the organization.\nI look forward to working with the team to build on FactSet's history of outstanding performance, while generating meaningful value for shareholders.\nI'll now share more details on our first quarter performance.\nFirst on ASV, we grew organic ASV plus professional services by 9%.\nAs Phil noted previously, we typically see a seasonal deceleration in Q1.\nOur performance reflects increased demand for our content and product, higher retention, and our ability to realize higher pricing.\nThe marketplace has been supportive with solid workstation growth in banking and greater demands for our portfolio analytics solutions, as market conditions continue to evolve, our subscription-based ASV will continue to support value-based pricing.\nGAAP revenue increased by 9% to $425 million, while organic revenue, which excludes any impact from foreign exchange and acquisitions increased 9% to $423 million, growth was driven primarily by analytics and trading and research and advisory.\nAll regions experienced notable year-over-year growth.\nFor our geographic segments, on an organic basis, Americas revenue grew 9%, EMEA also came in at 9% and Asia Pac revenues grew at 14%.\nThe main drivers in the region were analytics, CTS and workstation growth.\nTurning now to expenses.\nGAAP operating expenses grew 13% in the first quarter to $302 million, impacted by anticipated changes incurred during the period.\nWe recorded a restructuring charge of $9 million to drive a more efficient and empowered organizational structure.\nOngoing savings from this realignment will primarily be used for product reinvestment and key talent retention.\nIn addition, we recognized $4 million of expense related to vacating certain office space in New York City.\nWe recently pulled our employees on optimal work arrangements and consistent with what we see in the market, a vast majority prefer a hybrid or remote working model.\nGiven this preference, we are reassessing our real estate footprint to better reflect our new work arrangements.\nAlso, in Q1, we incorporated the FactSet Charitable Foundation to facilitate our corporate social responsibility goals.\nCompared to the previous year, our GAAP operating margin decreased by 230 basis points to 29% and our adjusted operating margin decreased by 70 basis points to 34%.\nAs stated before this exceeds our guidance on this measure.\nOur increased expenses were partially offset by lower compensation expense.\nAs a percentage of revenue, our cost of sales was 32 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis and 72 basis points lower on an adjusted basis.\nThis reflects increased data and infrastructure costs and higher compensation expense for our existing employee base.\nThese expenses also include our ongoing shift to the public cloud, as part of our digital transformation and multiyear investment plan.\nLower personnel expenses, partially offset these increases.\nWhen expressed on a percentage basis of revenue, SG&A was 198 basis points higher year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 145 basis points higher on an adjusted basis.\nThe primary drivers include increased employee compensation, higher bonus accrual and real estate exit costs.\nThis was partially offset by lower stock compensation year-over-year.\nTurning now to taxes, our tax rate for the quarter was 10% compared to last year's rate of 16%.\nThis lower rate was due to a tax benefit from the exercise of stock options, as a result of our record stock price.\nThis caused the annual estimated benefit to be higher than expected.\nThe lower annual rate was partially offset by higher-than-expected U.S. income.\nGAAP earnings per share increased 7% to $2.79 this quarter versus $2.62 in the prior year.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $3.25 driven higher -- by higher revenues and a lower tax rate.\nFree cash flow, which we defined as cash generated from operations, less capital spending was $64 million for the quarter, a decrease of 9% over the same period last year.\nThis was primarily due to the timing of tax payments, higher year-over-year employee bonus payments, and a reduction in capital expenditures related to facilities build outs.\nOur ASV retention remained at -- greater than 95%.\nWe grew the total number of clients by 14% compared to the prior year, which continues to be driven by the addition of more wealth and corporate clients.\nOur client retention improved to 92% year-over-year, which speaks to the success of our products and investments and the efforts of our sales teams.\nFor the first quarter, we repurchased 46,200 shares of our common stock for a total of $19 million at an average per share price of $403.\nWe remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders.\nWe are reaffirming our guidance for 2022, and as we often say our business is a tale of two halves.\nWhile it is clear that our momentum from Q4 has continued and we believe that we are well positioned to deliver on our targets, it's still early in the fiscal year.\nWe remain focused on developing our content, technology and people and delivering value for our shareholders.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:To kick things off, our CEO, Bryan Jordan and CFO, BJ Losch will provide an overview of our results and then we're going to open things up for question.\nWe're really pleased to have Susan Springfield, our Chief Credit Officer with us to help with that effort.\nOur statements reflect our views today and we aren't obligated to update them.\nAnd with that, I'm going to hand it over to Bryan.\nThis has been a very significant quarter for us.\nWe closed our merger of equals with IBERIABANK, we acquired the 30 branches from SunTrust Truist, really excited about that.\nThat integration was done in mid-July.\nWe've made significant progress during the quarter.\nWe are very pleased with the performance of the organization, the great work that our associates did to serve their customers and their communities in what has been a challenging and trying time.\nWe see good momentum in our business, we proved out again the counter cyclical benefit of our businesses, mortgage, mortgage warehouse lending and our fixed income business.\nOur balance sheet continues to perform well.\nAnd as we've talked about over the last ten years or 12 years, we have really significantly restructured the balance sheet and the focus is more on C&I.\nWe had net charge-offs of 44 basis points during the quarter and we saw a slight tick up in nonperforming assets, but we ended the period with about $1.3 billion of capacity for loss taking.\nSo very strong balance sheet.\nWe had a good quarter in terms of deposit activity.\nWe had good customer inflows and the balance sheet feels good and we saw some progress made in adjusting our pricing to compensate for the lower interest rate environment.\nAlso during the quarter, we made good progress on our expenses.\nWe captured another $8 million of run rate, excuse me of run rate in our quest for $170 million plus in expense savings.\nWe feel very good about our progress in controlling costs and are planning for the integration.\nThere is a couple of good slides in the investor deck, which you can reference that lay out the expectations around expense efficiencies over the next couple of quarters and year.\nOur capital base continues to be strong.\nVery, very pleased with the positioning.\nWe came in with a CET1 ratio of 9.15%.\nOur tangible book value dilution was very slight from the acquisition of the branches and the completion of the merger, largely offset by our earnings during the quarter.\nOur planning around the integration continues to go well, we expect that the significant integration work will be completed by the fall, early fall of 2021.\nWe are on target and on track for completing that integration.\nWe have a lot of work to do between now and then.\nWe have associates all over the organization who are working to make sure that we do it in a seamless fashion and minimize, absolutely minimize adverse impact on our customers and our communities.\nClearly, the progress of the PPP programs, of fiscal stimulus has been positive to date on the economy, but there is still uncertainty.\nI feel like we're well positioned in terms of a strong balance sheet, strong while taking capacity, strong capital and also positioned with a tailwind in the sense that we have our non -- our counter-cyclical businesses and we also have the ability to realize a significant amount of cost savings over the next 18 months to 24 months.\nSo with that, I will stop.\nWe think it's important to note that the impact of merger accounting on our financials are overall in line with the estimates we provided you during the second quarter call and in the pro forma released during the quarter.\nWe've provided the detail on the marks and other impacts related to the merger in the appendix for your review.\nOn Slide 6, we provide a summary of our adjusted financials for the quarter compared with FHN stand-alone adjusted results in the prior quarters.\nSo obviously, the trends here largely reflect the net impact of the IBERIA merger and the branch acquisition.\nMoving on to Slide 7 for a look at net interest income and net interest margin.\nWe generated net interest income of $532 million in the quarter, up $227 million linked quarter, driven by the impact of the merger.\nNII remains fairly stable with second quarter combined levels, despite the impact of the challenging rate environment.\nThird quarter results included a $44 million benefit from accretion or about 12 basis points on the NIM which was modestly higher than we originally expected given higher prepayments.\nReported NIM came in at 2.84% in the quarter, down 6 basis points, reflecting the impact of low rates and continued elevated levels of liquidity, somewhat offset by accretion.\nWe also continue to take action to improve our deposit pricing profile.\nOur deposit rate paid was down again this quarter with interest bearing deposit costs down to 36 basis points.\nOur goal is to manage down interest bearing deposit cost toward the levels we saw in a prior zero interest rate cycle back in 2015 of around 24 basis points.\nIn this quarter, we plan to align our deposit pricing across the expanded franchise, which should provide additional benefit as we enter 2021.\nOur NIM also continues to reflect the impact of much higher levels of liquidity.\nWe estimate excess cash to lower the third quarter margin approximately 12 basis points.\nWe averaged about $3 billion of excess cash, which grew to $4.5 billion at quarter end.\nAs you know, while this excess cash position lowers the margin, it does not impact our net interest income.\nWe continue to look opportunistically for more attractive reinvestment alternatives going forward and expect to put more of that money to work over time.\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect to see additional margin pressure likely in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, but expect that level to represent the bottom for NIM going forward.\nMoving on to Slide 8 and 9, I would note that here, we have provided our results versus prior period combined results for FHN and IBERIA.\nWe delivered solid performance in fee income again in the third quarter with relatively stable results on a linked quarter basis and a 23% year-over-year increase as the benefit of our counter-cyclical businesses in fixed income and mortgage banking helped to mitigate COVID related pressure in some of our more traditional banking fee income streams.\nFixed income results came in as expected with relatively stable results linked quarter and a $33 million increase year-over-year given average daily revenues of $1.5 million.\nMortgage banking again delivered standout results with a $13 million increase linked quarter and almost $40 million year-over-year.\nSecondary originations of $1.2 billion were up 3% from strong second quarter levels while gain on sale margins expanded over 100 basis points to 3.93%.\nAs we look into the fourth quarter, while we expect a seasonal slowdown in volumes for both of these businesses, we do expect overall market conditions to remain favorable for both -- for the foreseeable future.\nAs you can see on Slide 9, we continue on our commitment to expense discipline.\nLinked quarter expenses were down $15 million as the reduction in personnel expense and other non-interest expense was partially offset by an expected increase in intangibles, amortization from the Merger and Branch acquisition.\nSalaries and benefits increased $7 million, driven by the alignment of benefits across the combined platform, the addition of personnel from the 30 acquired branches and an increase in healthcare costs following the pandemic driven slowdown.\nThis increase was more than offset by a reduction in revenue based incentives and commissions as well as lower deferred comp costs.\nOur results this quarter also reflect the benefit of $8 million in net merger cost saves, giving us a year-to-date total of $18 million.\nWe understand the importance of remaining incredibly focused on utilizing cost control as a lever in this environment.\nWe have unique advantages to be able to do so given our merger and we'll continue to look for further expense reductions beyond our targeted merger savings.\nTurning to Slide 13 and 14, you see a review of our loan growth and funding profiles relative to combined First Horizon, IBERIA results.\nAs expected, period end loan growth was modest as customer demand remains muted, pay-offs continue and utilization rates have returned to more normal levels.\nBright spot in the quarter was continued strong mortgage warehouse demand, which drove loans to mortgage companies up $1.6 billion on a spot basis and approximately $430 million on average.\nSimilar to fixed income and mortgage banking originations, the loans to mortgage companies functioned as a counter-cyclical, high return specialty business for us and we expect continued strong performance.\nOn the liability side, period-end deposits were up $2.3 billion, driven by the branch acquisition primarily as well as continued strong customer inflows, which enabled us to run off higher cost non customer balances.\nGiven current levels of excess liquidity and our enhanced market presence, we expect to continue to move our interest bearing deposit costs lower, particularly as we move to align our pricing strategies across the footprint.\nWe also further improved our funding profile with a $1.2 billion reduction in borrowings from 2Q combined levels as we leveraged our excess liquidity to pay down legacy IBERIA that Federal [Phonetic] Home Loan Bank advances.\nTurning on Slide 12, we'll cover asset quality over the next few slides.\nClearly, our results this quarter reflect the impact of the merger with a lot of moving parts.\nBut if we step back, broadly speaking, overall asset quality continues to remain fairly benign so far outside of energy despite the impacts of COVID-19.\nNet charge-offs came in at 44 basis points, up from 20 basis points for legacy FHN driven by energy-related losses and we saw a relatively modest 6 basis point increase in NPLs to 75 basis points of total loans, despite the impact of the merger.\nOn Slide 13, you see, we continue to add reserves this quarter as the impact of the merger and branch acquisition added $475 million to the allowance for credit losses.\nOutside of merger math, we also built reserves by a modest $13 million.\nTherefore, we ended the quarter with reserves of $1.1 billion, which is equivalent to 2.15% of the loan portfolio, excluding the low risk PPP and loans to mortgage companies portfolios and about four times annualized net charge-offs.\nWhen you also factor in the unrecognized discount on acquired loans, we have total loss absorbing capacity of $1.3 billion or over 2% of total loans.\nOn Slide 14, we provide an update of our view around the portfolios that investors have been most focused on in terms of impacts from the pandemic.\nWe continue to do very detailed portfolio reviews of industries currently affected and in the quarter, we reviewed in detail $9 billion of loans in the commercial portfolio across these various sectors.\nAs a result of that, as well as other broader portfolio reviews, we believe that just under 11% of our total loans should be and are subject to a heightened level of monitoring.\nWe've shown the sub sectors of the portfolio that may be more stressed such as real estate lending, energy, retail, trade and the non-fast food portion of our accommodation foodservice portfolio.\nIt's important to note that other sectors such as essential services, recreational goods, manufacturing and home improvement are continuing to perform well, and additionally our higher quality consumer portfolio is performing well as well with a weighted average FICO score of 750 on a refreshed basis.\nAs we've mentioned to date, customers are proving to be more resilient than originally feared and overall stress appears to be declining.\nWe've provided data in the appendix on the reserve coverage across our portfolio, as well as on deferrals which have now declined meaningfully to around 2.4% of federal loan balances from a peak of almost 13%.\nOverall, we continue to feel very comfortable with our risk profile and reserve levels, particularly after going through the very detailed process of marking the IBERIA loan book, which represents about 45% of the portfolio.\nMoving on to capital and tangible book value per share on Slide 15, as we mentioned, TBV per share of $9.92 remained relatively stable to second quarter as strong earnings were offset by the impact of the IBERIA merger and the Truist branch acquisition and the CET1 ratio ended the quarter at $9.15.\nNear term, we expect to continue targeting a CET1 ratio in the 9% to 9.25% range.\nTurning to Slide 16 for Merger Integration Update, we continue to be very energized as Bryan said by the opportunities ahead of us in connection with our merger of equals.\nIn the year since we announced the deal, we've established a strong merger integration framework to help ensure that we capitalize on the opportunities in a highly efficient manner even in the face of the pandemic.\nWe've already done a great deal to align our cultures, processes and systems to ensure a successful integration.\nWe've completed much of HR related integration by identifying leadership and converting payroll systems.\nAnd on the customer side, we've built out our go-to-market and organizational models, as well as finalizing our customer experience dashboard.\nWe're on track to convert various other platforms and are currently planning for the full systems conversion to occur in the fall of 2021.\nAgain as Bryan said, in the third quarter, we delivered $8 million of cost savings, bringing the year-to-date total to $18 million.\nAnd in the table on the right, we provided a modestly updated view of our expected saves over time.\nWe continue to be highly confident in our ability to deliver at least $170 million of annualized savings in 2022, but the path of the save got shifted by a quarter or so.\nThis largely reflects the fact that we now believe it's prudent to target a September-October system conversion versus the previous year of the late second quarter conversion.\nIn the table on the right as well we've provided the estimated timing of our merger savings on an annualized basis.\nIn third quarter 2020, our annualized expense base excluding incentives and commissions totaled about $1.52 billion, and based on our expectations for the timing of the merger sales, we believe that our 2021 expenses excluding incentives and commissions should reflect a low single-digit decrease.\nWrapping up on Slide 17, we believe we're well positioned to capitalize on the benefits of our more diversified business model over time and through our IBERIA merger and the branch acquisition, we now have an expanded franchise across some of the most attractive markets in the south.\nAs we've demonstrated this quarter, we have a revenue mix that helps us offset NII pressure from the low rate environment.\nWe also have the advantage of merger cost saves and through prior acquisitions and efficiency initiatives, we've proven our commitment to expense controls.\nOur prudent approach to risk management should help us mitigate credit losses going forward, and we have the benefit of the marked loan book and significant loss absorption capacity.\nWhile the economic environment remains challenging and loan demand is needed, it gives us the ability to focus on merger integration for the next year, and we believe our business model will result in outperformance and shareholder value creation in the quarters and years ahead.\nSince I know they're listening, I want to give a quick shout out to all those on our various teams across IR, accounting, finance, credit and technology in particular that have done an extraordinary work and have spent long hours getting us to this point.\nThis is my 47th quarterly earnings call with First Horizon and I've seen a lot over the years, but the complexity and the uniqueness of this quarter and the year take the cake.\nWe believe our strong balance sheet capital and liquidity will serve us well in this difficult operating environment.\nWe've maintained strong underwriting standards and built a diversified portfolio focused on profitability and performance in a downturn.\nDespite the economic headwinds, we are uniquely positioned to capture merger opportunities with enhanced scale, better efficiency and improved earning power to create significant shareholder value.\nWe are incredibly committed to continuing to assist our associates, communities and customers in efforts to overcome the impact of COVID-19 and revitalize the economy.\nAgain, we are very well positioned.\nI'm very, very excited about the combination of IBERIABANK and First Horizon, and we think we have unprecedented opportunities ahead of us.\nWith that operator, we'll be happy to take any questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm Ian Hudson, the Company's Chief Financial Officer.\nAlso with me on the call today is Jennifer Sherman, our President and Chief Executive Officer.\nThese documents are available on our website.\nIn addition, we will file our Form 10-Q later today.\nI'm going to begin today by providing some detail on our first quarter results, before turning the call over to Jennifer to provide her perspective on current market conditions, our progress against strategic initiatives, and our outlook for the remainder of the year.\nIn summary, we delivered another strong quarter with record orders and operating results, exceeding our expectations despite ongoing pandemic related disruptions.\nWe also had to navigate through the February ice storms in the south, which caused us to temporarily close our facilities in Texas, Alabama and Mississippi.\nFortunately, we did not experience any significant damage, but we did lose several days of production.\nDespite these challenges, the teams recovered well with both groups delivering adjusted EBITDA margins at or above levels achieved in the first quarter of last year.\nThat feed is even more impressive, given the strength of the prior year quarter, which included record production at our largest facility and minimal impact from the pandemic.\nTurning now to the numbers where consolidated net sales for the quarter were $279 million compared to $286 million last year.\nConsolidated operating income for the quarter was $27.8 million compared to $32.3 million last year.\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $41.2 million compared to $43.9 million last year.\nThat translates to a margin of 14.8% in Q1 this year compared to 15.3% last year.\nNet income for the quarter was $22.2 million compared to $23.4 million last year.\nThat equates to GAAP earnings per share for the quarter of $0.36 per share compared to $0.38 per share last year.\nOn an adjusted basis, earnings per share for the quarter was $0.38 per share, compared to $0.39 per share last year.\nOrder intake for the quarter was outstanding with orders of $384 million represent -- representing our highest quarterly orders on record and an increase of $80 million or 26% compared to Q1 last year.\nConsolidated backlog at the end of the quarter also set a new company record at $410 million that represents an increase of $9 million compared to Q1 last year and an increase of $106 million or 35% from the end of 2020.\nIn terms of our group results, ESG net sales for the quarter were $228 million compared to $233 million last year.\nESG's operating income for the quarter was $27.1 million compared to $29.4 million last year.\nESG's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $39.3 million compared to $40 million in the prior year.\nThat translates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.2% in line with last year.\nEFC reported orders of $324 million in Q1 this year, an improvement of $87 million or 37% compared to last year.\nSSG's net sales for the quarter were $51 million this year compared to $53 million last year.\nOperating income for the quarter was $7.2 million dollars compared to $7.4 million last year.\nSSG's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was consistent with the prior year at around $8.2 million while its adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter improved to 16.2% of 80 basis points from Q1 last year.\nSSG's orders for the quarter was $60 million compared to $66 million last year.\nCorporate operating expenses for the quarter was $6.5 million, up from $4.5 million last year.\nThe increase was primarily due to an unfavorable year-over-year variance of $2.6 million associated with changes in mark-to-market adjustments of post-retirement reserves.\nThese market based adjustments benefited our earnings in Q1 last year by approximately $0.02 per share but were unfavorable in Q1 this year.\nTurning now to the consolidated income statement where the decrease in sales contributed to a $6 million reduction in gross profit.\nConsolidated gross margin for the quarter was 24.7% compared to 26.1% last year.\nAs a percentage of sales, our selling, engineering, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were down 20 basis points from Q1 last year, despite the unfavorable mark-to-market variance I just mentioned.\nOther items affecting the quarterly results include a $700,000 increase in other income and a $400,000 decrease in interest expense.\nTax expense for the quarter was down $2.2 million dollars, largely due to lower pre-tax income levels and higher excess tax benefits from stock compensation activity.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter with 18.4% compared to 23.5% last year.\nThe lower tax rate in Q1 of this year was in line with our expectations after we had included an estimate of excess tax benefits.\nAt this time, we continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 24%.\nOn an overall GAAP basis, we therefore earned $0.36 per share in Q1 this year compared with $0.38 per share in Q1 last year.\nTo facilitate earnings comparisons, we typically adjust our GAAP earnings per share for unusual items recorded in the current or prior year quarters.\nIn the current year quarter, we made adjustments to GAAP earnings per share to exclude acquisition related expenses, coronavirus-related expenses and purchase accounting expense effects.\nOn this basis, our adjusted earnings for the quarter were $0.38 per share compared with $0.39 per share last year.\nLooking now at cash flow where we generated $26 million of cash from operations during the quarter, an improvement of $21 million over Q1 last year.\nWe ended the quarter with $168 million of net debt and availability under our credit facility of $270 million.\nOur current net debt leverage ratio remains low even after funding the acquisition of OSW during the quarter for approximately $53 million.\nOur strong financial position allows us to continue to invest in organic growth initiatives and pursue strategic acquisitions like OSW.\nAt the same time, we remain committed to pursuing strategic acquisitions and returning cash to stockholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.\nOn that note, we paid dividends of $5.5 million during the quarter, reflecting an increased dividend of $0.09 per share.\nAnd we recently announced a similar dividend for the second quarter.\nIt's been over a year now, since the pandemic began.\nAnd while there have been many challenges along the way, I remain in awe of how our teams have responded modifying our work practices to keep employees safe, exercising flexibility in handling uncertain market conditions, and finding new ways to serve our customers.\n[Technical Issues] continues to experience some ongoing COVID related disruptions, but conditions are improving.\nOur companywide efforts to raise awareness about vaccines, assist our employees in gaining access to vaccines and encourage participation levels, are paying off and we are pleased to report that our domestic employee vaccination rates are ahead of the national average.\nIn fact, in Illinois, where we have three of our largest facilities and the corporate office, over 60% of our employees are now fully vaccinated.\nWith that, we've seen an uptick in our sales, resources, traveling, reinforcing our customer-centric value proposition and contributing to greater order intake.\nAs in the last two quarters, we again saw improved demand for our products with our first-quarter order intake setting a new record for the company, surpassing the previous high by over $50 million.\nOur first quarter orders reflect strength in most of our end markets and growing confidence in a post-pandemic recovery, which seems to be further solidified by recent economic stimulus.\nThat sentiment seems to be shared widely by our dealer partners and customers across most of our businesses.\nDemand for sewer cleaners remains strong, with first quarter orders up 30% year-over-year, and almost double the amount recorded last quarter.\nSafe digging is also continuing to gain acceptance.\nOver the last couple of years, approximately 70% of our sewer cleaners orders have included an optional safe-digging package, which allows our sewer cleaners to also be used for hydro or vacuum excavation purposes.\nWe saw similar trends this quarter with customer appreciation for the safety and efficiency benefits of safe digging gaining momentum.\nAt MRL, our road marking and line removal business, first quarter orders were the highest quarterly levels since we acquired the business in 2019.\nAnd with its planned expansion now complete, we are well positioned to benefit from potential infrastructure investment.\nOur road marking services business, Highmark also won an $8 million striping contract during the quarter.\nSince the 4th quarter of last year, we've also seen an uptick in our industrial end markets with improved orders for our Guzzler and JetStream products heading into the spring-cleaning season.\nIn addition, our dump bodies and trailer businesses reported strong organic order growth of 28% across our end markets, achieving record backlog.\nWhile our backlog is at a record high, there are a few factors that may limit us from realizing the full benefits from the operating leverage that we typically experience with backlog at these levels.\nThe first factor that many of you will be aware of is the impact of the global semiconductor shortage on chassis availability.\nWe started to see some supply tightness late last year and our teams were proactive in securing additional chassis and recommending to our customers and dealer partners that they do the same for those orders were they supply the chassis.\nAs a reminder, that is about 50% of the time for our ESG businesses, excluding TBEI, where the customer almost always supplies the chassis.\nWe were recently notified by one of our chassis suppliers that they are temporarily suspending production of certain chassis for up to 90 days in light of the semiconductor shortage.\nThe issue primarily impacts our sewer cleaners, safe digging trucks, and certain street sweeper models.\nThe situation remains fluid and the teams have been working hard to mitigate the impact of the short-term disruption.\nBased on the data we have received, we expect the situation will be resolved during the 3rd quarter with production expected to ramp back quickly thereafter.\nBecause we do not rely on any one single TSC manufacturer, and with the proactive actions we took, we have been able to pivot quickly to minimize the financial impact.\nFor example, at Elgin, our team was able to adjust production schedules, so that we build a higher concentration of the three-wheel Pelican sweepers during the period of the expected impact.\nAs a reminder, for that product line, we actually manufacture the chassis ourselves.\nAt our Streator facility, where we make sewer cleaners and Safe digging trucks, we have had an ongoing effort to secure additional chassis from other manufacturers.\nHowever, because of lead times on certain chassis, there is a period of approximately two weeks where we have a shortage at Vactor.\nWith the goal of optimizing efficiency, the teams have worked diligently to manage the schedule, so that this brief pause will occur over the July 4 holiday.\nWith the additional chassis supply that we have secured, we are expecting a ramp up in production thereafter.\nLike most companies, we are also experiencing rising commodity costs.\nAs our teams have done in the past, we took proactive measures such as locking in pricing and securing availability of steel based on forecasted needs.\nOur teams are working diligently to mitigate the impacts of rising commodity costs by implementing price increases and surcharges where possible.\nAs it relates to labor availability, our ongoing commitment to environmental social and governance continues to benefit our company.\nInvestment in our employees differentiates us and our ability to attract labor at the majority of our facilities.\nI now want to take a few minutes to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives.\nWe remain bullish about Safe digging prospects, and with noted industrial end market recoveries and infrastructure spend optimism throughout the channel, we are confident Safe digging trends will continue to improve.\nOur TRUVAC safe digging product line portfolio includes a complete range of truck mounted safe digging equipment with applications across a number of end markets.\nWe were pleased to see that TRUVAC product demonstrations for the quarter were up 70% from last year.\nAs I just mentioned, these education efforts are also having a positive impact in sewer cleaners demand with the inclusion of the optional safe digging package, turning our sewer cleaners into a multi-purpose vehicle.\nWe also continue to make progress with our aftermarket initiative with aftermarket revenues for the quarter improving by 6% and representing a higher share of ESG's revenues for the quarter at around 27%.\nWe continue to closely monitor rental fleet utilization and remain disciplined in making decisions about the size and composition of our fleet.\nAs part of that process, we have seen healthy used equipment sales in recent months and an uptick in rentals.\nWe are monitoring the current COVID situation in Canada with Ontario and many other provinces being subject to some of the most extreme stay-at-home measures since the start of the pandemic.\nWhile we have not experienced any significant financial impact to date, we may see some impact in our Canadian markets over the next few months, which is typically a seasonally strong period for equipment rentals and part sales.\nOn the organic growth front, we have several new product launches in the pipeline, a few of which I'll touch on today.\nWithin ESG, street sweeper electrification remains a key area of investment.\nWe have previously talked about our first orders for hybrid electric broom bear street sweeper, which are currently expected to ship later this year.\nThis hybrid model, uses both battery energy and either CNG or diesel power for sweeping, with performance designed to meet or exceed current sweeper performance.\nThe hybrid broom bear is now being demonstrated by our dealer channel, primarily on the West Coast and then moving to the Southeast, and the feedback to date has been encouraging.\nIn addition, development of a hybrid version of our most popular line of street sweepers, the Pelican, is under way.\nThe plug-in hybrid electric Pelican sweeper is assembled and undergoing testing with product demonstrations plan for the second half of this year.\nWithin our dump body and trailer product portfolio, we are also realizing benefits from new product introductions.\nDuring the quarter, products launched over the last year equated to organic growth of about 4%.\nWithin SSG, based on the nature of its product portfolio, our innovation pipeline typically includes a higher volume new product introductions and enhancements, that while individually may not have a significant financial impact, collectively aggregate to meaningful organic growth.\nFor example, we launched production of our MicroPulse line during the quarter.\nThe MicroPulse is a low profile, high performance LED lighting product for both first responders and work truck vehicle.\nThe line includes production of both new product models and those that were previously outsourced.\nIn sourcing this line, which leverages automated laser technology, is estimated to improve the related margins and drive annual savings of over $1 million.\nIn addition, we are currently on track to launch a low cost light [Phonetic] power in the second quarter.\nIn addition to these organic growth initiatives, M&A will continue to contribute meaningfully to our future growth.\nDuring the quarter, we completed the acquisition of OSW, a leading manufacturer of dump bodies and a customer upfitter of truck equipment and trailers.\nThe acquisition provides considerable opportunity for long-term value creation through the application of our 80/20 improvement principle, organic growth initiatives and additional bolt-on acquisitions.\nLast week, we held an initial 80/20 improvement training session at OSW, which was well received by the teams.\nIntegration is well under way, and while it is still early days, OSW was off to a solid start in the first quarter.\nOur M&A pipeline has been active to say the least.\nAnd it's been exciting to be back on the road visiting potential targets.\nAs Ian noted in his comments, our financial position and liquidity are strong, enabling us to pursue strategic acquisitions and there are a number of M&A opportunities our teams are currently reviewing.\nWe have also continued to make significant investments in our existing plans to add capacity to support our long-term growth and to gain operational efficiencies through automation.\nAs we continue to optimize our manufacturing footprint, we are evaluating our long-term strategy with respect to our Elgin and University Park production facilities in Illinois.\nBoth properties are currently leased at above market rates with lease terms ending in 2023.\nWe are currently looking at opportunities and alternative facilities in the surrounding areas as we proactively plan for a potential move.\nThe American rescue plan, COVID release package, includes approximately 1.9 trillion of economic stimulus with approximately $350 billion going to state, local and territorial governments with the goal of keeping frontline workers employed, distributing the vaccine, increasing testing, reopening schools, and maintaining essential services.\nWe are actively educating our dealer channel about the stimulus program and have distributed the latest estimate allocation of the $350 billion of state and local government support by jurisdiction to our dealer channel to share with its customer base.\nAs a provider of equipment for -- used for essential services like sewer kitting and street sweeping, Federal Signal stands to benefit meaningfully from additional aid that may be provided to state local sources for these purposes.\nAs was evident with our first-quarter order intake, our dealer partners remain optimistic about market conditions in 2021, noting that both corporate and sales tax collections appear to have held up better than originally anticipated, which should add stability to their revenue sources.\nWe expect that our long-term infrastructure bill will provide visibility for project planning and could see capital equipment demand increases in areas such as roads, bridges, broadband, Clean Energy and public transportation buildup.\nWe anticipate that this will provide benefits for the majority of our product offerings, including equipment sales and rentals of dump trucks and trailers, Safe digging trucks, road marking equipment, sewer cleaners and street sweepers.\nWe have positioned Federal Signal in a manner in which we fully participate in the post-pandemic recovery by increasing capacity within our facilities, reducing lead times to a level where we can better respond to customer needs, investing in new product development and gaining market share.\nTurning now to our outlook for the rest of the year.\nOrders thus far this year have exceeded our expectations, fueled by a combination of new product launches ongoing execution against our strategic initiatives and strong recovery in our end markets.\nWith certain chassis manufacturers temporarily impacted by the global semiconductor shortage, we are currently encountering some short-term production challenges at our largest facility.\nOur teams are working diligently to navigate through this disruption as they have in the past when faced with similar situation.\nAfter factoring in the impact expected over the next couple of months, at this time, we are maintaining our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the year of $1.73 to $1.85.\nWith our recently completed capacity expansion at several facilities, we are well positioned once the current chassis uncertainty eases.\nDemand for our products is at an all-time high, with the recent federal stimulus, and the possibility of infrastructure investment offering potential for further momentum, which we have not factored into our current outlook.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Information required by SEC Regulation G relating to these non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors section of our website, www.\nfortive.com, under the heading Investors Quarterly Results.\nWe completed the separation of our Industrial Technologies segment through the spin-off of Vontier Corporation on October 9, 2020, and have accordingly included the results of the Industrial Technologies segment as discontinued operations.\nAll references to period-to-period increases or decreases and financial metrics are year-over-year on a continuing operations basis.\nStarting on slide three.\nOur first quarter performance continued to highlight the benefits of our efforts to enhance the growth and resilience of our portfolio, significantly expanding our positions in software and healthcare and adding substantial sources of higher growth recurring revenue.\nAs a result, our portfolio has been well positioned to drive rapid sequential improvement over the past few quarters as markets have begun to reopen.\nIn Q1, we continue to see significant improvement, not only across our short-cycle businesses, primarily Fluke Instruments and Tektronix, but also at many of the businesses that have faced COVID-related headwinds, such as Advanced Sterilization Products.\nTurning to the results in the quarter.\nWe generated total revenue growth of 13.6% and core revenue growth of 9.1%, above the high-end of our guidance.\nAdjusted earnings per share was $0.63, representing an increase of 37% year-over-year.\nThe combined outperformance on core growth and earnings helped drive another strong quarter of free cash flow.\nOur SaaS offerings at Accruent, Intelex, Censis, eMaint and Gordian continue to perform well, generating double-digit growth in the quarter, with the current Gordian seeing better top line momentum overall.\nThese software offerings are an important part of our strategy to leverage leading hardware positions to provide broader software-enabled solutions to address pain points in our customers' critical workflows and their ongoing digital transformation priorities.\nDespite the challenges of a COVID environment, we continue to leverage FBS tools to drive performance improvements across the portfolio.\nASP is advancing the implementation of the Fortive Business System more broadly, driving strong improvements in working capital turns as well as progress accelerating commercial efforts, as it delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of growth in its global installed base.\nIntelex also continues to see success from the application of FBS tools to improve its sales process, driving better lead generation, improved customer win rates and stronger sales pipeline creation.\nWhile these are just a couple of examples, we are highly focused on building FBS capability across our newer businesses, in order to deliver accelerated growth, innovation and market share gains.\nRelative to organic growth, we continue to invest in strategic initiatives across our operating companies as well as build additional capacity to drive future innovation.\nWith the FORT, we are continuing to scale our data analytics capabilities, providing leverage to our operating companies to pursue key AI and machine learning applications.\nIn 2020, we more than doubled the number of projects conducted and expect to do the same this year, targeting more than $250 million of potential revenue opportunity.\nOur acquisition of ehsAI significantly expanded our machine learning expertise to help grow our position within EHS workflows as well as generate learnings that can be applied more broadly within Fortive.\nWe've also made a number of additional investments to expand our partnership with Pioneer Square Labs, with three start-up opportunities currently in different phases of incubation.\nWith these investments, we are enhancing our ability to generate disruptive innovation that will deepen our competitive advantage and increase our customer value proposition.\nIn terms of performance across the major geographies, core growth was led by low 20% growth in Asia.\nThis included approximately 30% growth in China and low double-digit growth in Japan.\nElsewhere, our core revenue grew by low double-digits in Western Europe and by low single-digits in North America.\nTaking a closer look at performance in the segments on slide seven, Intelligent Operating Solutions posted a total revenue increase of 9.5%, with core revenue increase of 5.5%.\nThis included high-teens growth in China, high single-digit growth in Western Europe and a flat top-line in North America.\nFluke's core revenue continued to improve in the first quarter, increasing by high single-digits.\nThis performance was highlighted by low double-digit growth at Fluke Industrial and high-teens growth at Fluke Calibration.\nFluke's growth included the launch of the 377 and 378 Fluke Connect, plant meters for non-contact voltage testing.\nThese introductions incorporate Fluke's FieldSense technology and extend its leadership position in safer non-contact measurement tools.\nAt Fluke Industrial, point-of-sale in North America turned positive in the first quarter, increasing by low single digits.\nMeanwhile, point-of-sale in both Western Europe and China continue to improve, rising by mid-single digits and mid-teens, respectively.\nStrong performance at Fluke Digital Systems continued this quarter, increasing by mid-single digits as eMaint saw strong demand with mid-teens growth in SaaS bookings.\nIndustrial Scientific declined single-digits in the first quarter, as a result of continued weakness in instrument sales.\nThe company's iNet offering continued to demonstrate its resilience, increasing by low single-digits.\niNet also registered an 18% increase in bookings, while driving a more than 500 basis point improvement in net retention.\nStub's strong bookings growth in ISC's rental business provided a signal of improving stability in its end-markets with customers beginning to restart maintenance project activity.\nAt the same time, we are seeing continued success from the application of FBS growth tools at Intelex to accelerate sales pipeline creation, driving a record revenue quarter with low double-digit growth.\nThe integration of ehsAI continues to go well.\nWhile the revenue contribution remains small, product integration is on schedule, and the Intelex team has started to accelerate new customer acquisition.\nAccruent grew by low single-digits in the first quarter, highlighted by high single-digit growth in SaaS.\nAccruent continue to see good momentum in its Industrial and Life Science segments.\nThis included a recent win at BioMarin, which included Accruent's Meridian solution as a critical tool for management of their pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities, including communication with contractors and support for FDA validation.\nAccruent is also seeing growing demand across a range of end markets for its facility planning and resource scheduling solutions with customers beginning to prepare their facilities for the future needs of their workforce as they emerged from the pandemic.\nAccruent's growth in the quarter was aided by the resumption of some on-site service, implementation and project-related activities with further improvement expected as the year continues.\nAfter facing headwinds during the second half of 2020, Gordian's top-line improved to flat in the first quarter.\nGordian's job order contracting procurement business grew by low single digits and is expected to accelerate as the ramp-up of recovery from COVID continues.\nThe company's estimating business continued to perform well, increasing by high single-digits and seeing strong renewal momentum and conversion rates for the SaaS version of its RSMeans product line.\nGordian saw signs of improvement during the first quarter regarding site access issues.\nWe expect this improvement will continue in the coming quarters.\nThe Precision Technology segment posted a total revenue increase of 14.3% with a 12.1% increase in core revenue.\nThis included mid-30s percent growth in China, mid-teens growth in Western Europe and mid single-digit growth in North America.\nTektronix generated high-teens growth, driven by strength in its general industrial and semiconductor markets.\nPoint-of-sale continue to accelerate, up greater than 40% in China, greater than 20% in Western Europe, while North America turned positive with a mid single-digit increase in the quarter.\nTektronix has seen strong demand in China as economic recovery continues, driven by government investment in 5G, electric vehicles and IoT solutions.\nLooking across the product lines at Tektronix, mainstream oscilloscope in Keithley both had an excellent first quarter.\nMainstream oscilloscope posted high 30% growth, driven by strong demand trends across most of its key product segments, particularly our six series and four series scopes.\nKeithley grew mid-teens, while the Tektronix service business continued to show stability, reporting mid single-digit growth in the first quarter.\nTektronix also saw outperformance across a range of recent new product introductions, including its new ISO view probe solution for semiconductor and automotive market applications.\nSensing Technologies grew by low double-digits, driven by broad strengthening across end markets, including industrial and electronics customers.\nSensing saw accelerating demand in China as it delivered a number of key wins with strong momentum among factory automation OEM customers.\nSensing also generated strong growth from its critical environment products, etc, with mid-30% growth for the quarter.\nPacific Scientific EMC returned to growth, increasing by low single-digits in the first quarter.\nThe business continued to see good order trends with a book-to-bill of 1.2 over the trailing 12 months and has a strong backlog that we expect to support improving growth in the coming quarters.\nMoving to Advanced Healthcare Solutions.\nTotal revenue increased 20.3% with a 10.9% increase in core revenue.\nThis included low 40% growth in China, low 20% growth in Western Europe and low single-digit growth in North America.\nASP returned to growth in the first quarter, increasing by mid single-digits.\nGrowth at ASP was driven by a greater than 40% increase in capital equipment sales as it continued to grow its global installed base.\nThis momentum in capital sales more than offset the fact that electric procedures were 91% of pre-COVID levels globally and continue to weigh on ASP's consumable revenue.\nStronger capital sales are an indication of the progress ASP is making in its FBS journey by driving better sales execution and improved funnel management at priority independent delivery network accounts.\nASP continued to perform well in Western Europe with its fifth consecutive quarter of growth.\nASP was also recently named the Preferred Supplier by the National Health Service in the UK and a large multiyear tender for terminal sterilization capital and services.\nCensis also had a strong first quarter, growing by low-teens with low-double-digit growth in its CensiTrac SaaS offering.\nCensis has seen improved upselling momentum across its business and is also seeing evidence of US hospitals moving to post-COVID operations and faster purchasing decisions.\nFluke Health Solutions increased by low-teens in the first quarter, with broad strength across its product lines.\nFHS continues to have success deploying FBS to drive to growth and margin improvements at LANDAUER leveraging global go-to-market scale and accelerating cross-selling and products and services.\nLandauer is now seeing an approximate 2.5 times improvement in its operating margins since acquisition.\nFinally, Invetech reported mid-40% growth as it delivers against a strong backlog of 2020 orders for its diagnostic offerings.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to Chuck, who will take you through additional details on our margins and free cash flow for the quarter.\nSolid execution across the portfolio enabled us to deliver strong margin performance in Q1.\nAdjusted gross margins were 57% in the first quarter, up 90 basis points, driven by the fall-through on the strong growth at Fluke and Tektronix as well as the year-over-year gross margin improvement at ASP coming off the transition service agreements.\nIt also reflected solid execution with FBS throughout the portfolio, including continued price realization of 90 basis points in the quarter.\nOur Q1 adjusted operating profit margin was 22.7%, a bit higher than we had guided, helped in part by the stronger volume we saw in the quarter.\nWe generated 40% of adjusted incremental operating margins and 240 basis points of core operating margin expansion and also generated more than 200 basis points of core operating margin expansion in each of our three segments.\nDuring the first quarter, we generated $144 million of free cash flow, representing an increase of 50% year-over-year.\nWe continue to be pleased with the consistent growth in free cash flow and have delivered -- that we've delivered over the past year, with the first quarter taking our trailing 12 months free cash flow to $950 million.\nAlong with significant growth in earnings, disciplined working capital management at ASP, Fluke and Tektronix contributed to this free cash flow performance.\nEarly in Q1, we executed the tax-efficient monetization of our remaining 19.9% stake in Vontier, generating approximately $1.1 billion in proceeds which we used for debt repayment.\nOn the basis of that transaction and our free cash flow from Q1, we ended up the first quarter with a net leverage ratio of 1.2 times.\nSupported by our continued strong free cash flow and significant balance sheet capacity, we are well positioned to pursue our key capital allocation priorities and are maintaining an active pipeline of deal cultivation efforts.\nWe continue to see a broad range of opportunities to deploy capital to build on our core hardware and instrumentation positions as we also leverage deep domain and workflow expertise into adjacent high value software data-driven opportunities.\nTurning now to the guide on slide 11.\nAs a result of the strong first quarter performance and given some improvement in our outlook for the rest of the year, we are raising our 2021 guidance.\nFor the full year, we now expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be $2.50 to $2.60, representing year-over-year growth of 20% to 24% on a continuing operations basis.\nThis assumes total revenue growth of 10% to 13%, core revenue growth of 7% to 10%, adjusted operating profit margins of 22% to 23% and an effective tax rate of approximately 14%.\nIt also assumes core revenue growth of 5% to 7% in the second half of 2021.\nWe also continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income for the year.\nWe are initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.56 to $0.60, representing year-over-year growth of 30% to 40%.\nThis assumes total revenue growth of 20% to 23%, core revenue growth of 16% to 19%, adjusted operating profit margins of 19.5% to 20.5% and an effective tax rate of approximately 14%.\nFor the second quarter, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 85% of adjusted net income.\nThe full year guidance incorporates $35 million of additional investments that we are making to drive innovation and enhance our capabilities to support higher growth in the years ahead with $15 million in the second quarter.\nThis includes funding for the FORT to expand our analytic capabilities and talent base as well as to accelerate the development of AI machine learning offerings for our customers.\nIt also includes funding for investments in our partnership with Pioneer Square Labs, where we have seen good early progress thus far.\nWith that, I'll pass it back to Jim for some closing remarks.\nBefore we move to questions on slide 13, I wanted to highlight the continued progress we're making with respect to our key sustainability goals.\nIn Q1, we completed an updated materiality analysis, yielding valuable insights that we use to define the new pillars of our sustainability strategy, which will guide our efforts going forward.\nWe've also made significant progress implementing the Intelex sustainability performance indicators platform across the portfolio, which we used to complete the collection of 2020 emissions data with new, more aggressive carbon emissions targets.\nWe look forward to discussing our progress and our evolving sustainability goals at our upcoming Investor Day.\nThe results that we announced today are a testament to the depth and dedication of our teams and the relentless focus on the continuous improvement principles that power our culture.\nAs we look forward, we are excited about the strength of our portfolio, the quality of the market opportunities we address and the significant organic and inorganic growth opportunities ahead of us.\nAs macro indicators continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, our focus will remain on driving strong core growth, margin expansion and free cash flow generation, while investing in innovation and deploying our capital to acquisitions that accelerate our strategy and increase the value we bring to customers.\nWe are also excited to share more details with you about our road ahead when we speak on May 19 at our Investor Day.\nIn the almost five years since our spin, we have positioned the portfolio to be higher growth, more profitable and a more powerful generator of free cash flow.\nThis sets us up well for accelerated compounding across our businesses, which we look forward to discussing with you.\nThat concludes our formal comments.\nSummary: ",

financial measures are available on the Investors section of our website, www.\nfortive.com, under the heading Financial Information.\nWe completed the divestiture of the automation and specialty business on October 1, 2018, and accordingly have included the results of the A&S business as discontinued operations for historical periods.\nAll references to period-to-period increases or decreases and financial metrics are year-over-year on a continuing operations basis.\nWe are pleased with our third quarter results as strong execution across the portfolio delivered a top line performance that was significantly better than our initial guidance as well as a return to year-over-year growth in adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share.\nFor the quarter, we reported adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.94, an 8% increase year-over-year.\nWhile the operating environment remained challenging in Q3, we continued to successfully navigate the near-term headwinds by leveraging the Fortive Business System.\nWe increased core operating margins by 160 basis points and generated another quarter of strong free cash flow while prioritizing growth investments across our portfolio to drive continued share gains.\nOn October 9, we completed the successful spin-off of Vontier Corporation, a global industrial technology company focused on mobility infrastructure.\nI'm extremely proud of the effort and the focus shown by our team throughout the year leading up to the separation, and I am very excited about the future opportunities that lie ahead for both companies.\nThe ability to maintain our readiness and execute this complex transaction despite the obvious challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic is a testament to the resilience and adaptability of our people and the power of FBS.\nAs separate companies, Fortive and Vontier are both well positioned to execute against their strategic priorities to generate increasing value for all our stakeholders.\nWith the spin-off of Vontier complete, Fortive is well positioned as a provider of essential technologies for connected workflow solutions across a range of attractive end markets.\nWe have strong established positions with leading brands that benefit from long-term secular growth drivers and have opportunities to increase recurring revenue.\nWe have a long track record of disciplined capital allocation, significant balance sheet capacity and free cash flow and substantial opportunities for both organic investment and strategic M&A across the portfolio.\nMost importantly, we have the Fortive Business System, the cornerstone of our culture, and an enduring source of competitive advantage that underpins our commitment to continuous improvement.\nSince Vontier was part of Fortive throughout the third quarter, the financial results that we will discuss today include the Vontier businesses.\nAlso, the guidance that we provide today will be for Fortive's continuing operations only.\nWith that, let's turn to the details of the quarter.\nAdjusted net earnings were $338.5 million, up 8.8% from the prior year, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.94.\nTotal sales increased 2.3% to $1.9 billion, with core revenue essentially flat, reflecting significant sequential improvement from the prior quarter.\nAcquisitions contributed 220 basis points of growth, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates increased growth by 20 basis points.\nAdjusted gross margins were 51.8% in the third quarter, increasing 50 basis points year-over-year.\nGross margins benefited from 50 basis points of price, the growing contribution of our higher-margin software businesses and disciplined supply chain execution.\nWe also generated 160 basis points of core operating margin expansion, resulting in an adjusted operating profit margin of 22.7% for the quarter.\nOur ability to drive strong core OMX, despite the significant ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic reflected the solid execution of our teams and the disciplined application of FBS.\nWe continue to effectively manage the business through this uncertain environment, flexing cost actions as needed while also investing in our strategic product development and innovation priorities to position us well for the future.\nDuring the third quarter, we generated $455 million of free cash flow, representing conversion of 134% of adjusted net earnings and an increase of 31% year-over-year.\nThis performance took our year-to-date free cash flow up to approximately $1.1 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately 48%.\nDespite a challenging environment over the past few quarters, our operating companies continue to use FBS to manage their working capital effectively in the short term, increasing inventory turns and limiting the headwinds from the sequentially improving top line.\nTurning to our segments.\nProfessional Instrumentation posted a total revenue increase of 0.9% despite a 3.5% decline in core revenue.\nAcquisitions contributed 370 basis points, while favorable foreign exchange rates increased growth by 70 basis points.\nCore operating margin increased 90 basis points, resulting in segment-level adjusted operating margin of 22.8%.\nIndustrial Technologies performed well in Q3 driven in particular by the North American businesses of both Gilbarco Veeder-Root and Matco.\nTotal revenue increased 4.5%, including a 5.5% increase in core revenue.\nCore operating margin increased 290 basis points, resulting in segment-level adjusted operating margin of 25.9%.\nNote that the growth rates shown on the slide reflect consolidated Fortive Q3 growth, which includes the results of the Vontier businesses.\nThat said, we will focus our operating company color primarily on the businesses that remain with Fortive.\nIn Asia, core revenue declined low single digits despite mid-single-digit growth in China.\nStrength in China was broad based, highlighted by mid-teens year-over-year growth at Fluke, double-digit growth at Advanced Sterilization Products and greater than 20% growth in Sensing.\nWestern Europe core revenue declined mid-single digits in Q3, highlighted by low double-digit growth at ASP.\nASP has reported year-over-year growth in each quarter of 2020 thus far, driven by solid sales execution.\nAccruent also delivered a strong quarter in Western Europe led by Meridian, its engineering information management solution, reflecting the momentum the company has built in the region.\nWhile point-of-sale remained negative for both Fluke and Tektronix, the point-of-sale trend improved throughout the quarter, and revenue at these businesses increased mid-teens versus the prior quarter.\nNorth America core revenue grew low single digits in Q3, showing broad-based sequential improvement versus Q2.\nGrowth in North America was led by a strong quarter for the Vontier businesses.\nAt new Fortive, a number of the software businesses continue to perform well with growth across Intelex, eMaint and Censis; Industrial Scientific's iNet business; and Qualitrol also performed well.\nAs in Western Europe, Fluke and Tektronix saw improving point-of-sale trends, though still negative as we turn the corner into Q4.\nIn recent quarters, we have laid out a framework for analyzing our portfolio with businesses organized into groups based on the relative sensitivity to pandemic-driven disruption and resulting deterioration in end market demand.\nAs shown on Slide 11, the relative performance of these groups largely played out as expected in the quarter.\nGroup I, which represented approximately 20% of new Fortive revenue in Q3, continued to show significant resilience, posting low single-digit growth.\nThe group's performance again reflected a solid contribution from the software businesses, highlighted by high single-digit growth at Intelex, which is seeing continued robust growth in North America and is benefiting from the successful execution of the company's expansion into Western Europe.\nElsewhere, Censis posted low-single-digit growth, underpinned by the momentum of its SaaS offerings.\nAccruent also benefited from the resilience of its SaaS business, which increased slightly in the quarter with continued growth in annual recurring revenue based on improving churn and increased net retention.\nFluke Industrial Imaging had another strong quarter, although its growth moderated as some of the initial COVID-related demand began to level off.\nGordian saw slowing in project work among state and local governments and higher education customers, leading to a low single-digit decline for the quarter.\nMeanwhile, despite continued strong order flow, EMC registered a mid-teens decline due to certain COVID-related supply chain issues and some customer delays.\nGroup II, which represented approximately 32% of new Fortive revenue in Q3, recorded a low single-digit decline.\nISC's iNet subscription business posted a high single-digit growth, while Fluke Health Solutions showed mid-single-digit growth driven by ventilator tester tailwinds and support from Landauer's high recurring revenue business model.\nASP reported a mid-single-digit decline due to a mid-single-digit decline in North America and pressure in Japan, which saw a resurgence of COVID cases and an associated reduction in elective procedures.\nHowever, we are very pleased to see this partially offset by strong growth in both China and Western Europe in the quarter.\nWe now estimate that elective procedures in the U.S. are back to approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels and are back to approximately 95% in both China and Europe.\nGroup III, which represented approximately 12% of new Fortive in Q3, saw a high single-digit decline in the quarter.\nWhile the Sensing portfolio declined by mid-single digits, this represented sequential improvement versus the second quarter.\nSemiconductors and electronics continue to be a bright spot for Sensing, which also benefited from COVID-related tailwinds in medical end markets.\nElsewhere in Group III, Accruent's professional services and licenses business lines saw an ongoing negative impact from continued delays in accessing customer sites.\nGroup IV, which represented approximately 36% of new Fortive Q3 revenue, declined by high single digits in the quarter but saw a meaningful sequential improvement and performed ahead of our forecast.\nBoth Fluke Industrial and the Tektronix Instruments business saw broad-based sequential improvement.\nFluke Industrial decreased by low single digits, paced by Fluke Calibration, which registered mid-single-digit growth.\nThe performance of the Tek Instruments business was highlighted by Keithley, which recorded mid-single-digit year-over-year growth.\nThe business also saw improved order activity as the quarter progressed, including initial orders for the new six and eight-channel versions of the six Series oscilloscope.\nWhile we are encouraged by what we saw at both Fluke Industrial and the Tektronix Instruments business in the third quarter, we remain watchful of key macro trends as we continue to work our way toward a return to year-over-year growth in both businesses.\nSince the end of the second quarter, we have continued to reduce our net debt with our strong free cash flow and the proceeds received from the Vontier separation.\nIncluding the recent proceeds from Vontier, our net debt is now approximately $2.8 billion, down from over $5.1 billion at the end of 2019.\nAs we look ahead, we expect to continue to generate solid free cash flow, which will enable us to reduce our net debt further.\nWe also expect to monetize our remaining 19.9% stake in Vontier in a tax-efficient manner, with timing subject to market conditions.\nWhile Q3 saw a continuation of the better operating performance that started as the economic lockdowns lifted back in the spring, we remain watchful of macro conditions in light of the continued fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn Q4, we expect the total revenue will increase zero to 3% on a year-over-year basis.\nWe also expect to deliver incremental margins of approximately 35%.\nFinally, we are planning to execute approximately $30 million of strategic productivity initiatives before the end of the year, in line with our prior expectation that some of the temporary actions we executed early in the year would be made permanent as we turn the corner into 2021.\nThe resegmentation highlights the strong position we have assembled to provide essential technologies for connected workflow solutions across a range of attractive end markets.\nThis view also helps to frame how we think about our portfolio from the perspective of both organic and inorganic opportunities.\nDetails on the segments are as follows.\nThe Intelligent Operating Solutions segment includes Fluke, Industrial Scientific, Intelex, Accruent and Gordian and represents approximately 40% of new Fortive total revenue.\nThis segment provides solutions to accelerate field and facility safety, reliability and productivity as well as operating intelligence to a range of end users and addresses a total available market of greater than $15 billion.\nPrecision Technologies segment includes Tektronix, Pacific Scientific EMC and the Sensing businesses, which will now also include Qualitrol and represent approximately 35% of new Fortive total revenue.\nThis segment provides mission-critical technologies that enable our customers to accelerate the development of innovative products and solutions and addresses a total available market of greater than $10 billion.\nThe Advanced Health Care Solutions segment includes Advanced Sterilization Products, Fluke Health Solutions, Censis and Invetech and represents approximately 25% of new Fortive total revenue.\nThis segment provides solutions that enhance patient safety, prevent hospital infections, deliver operating efficiencies and accelerate healthcare system innovation and addresses a total available market of greater than $5 billion.\nImportantly, we will report on this basis from the fourth quarter onward and plan to issue supplemental financial information in the coming weeks that aligns with this resegmented view of the portfolio so that you can rebase your models.\nBefore we wrap up, I want to quickly express my appreciation to the Fortive and Vontier teams for their continued effort and strong execution in 2020.\nThis has undoubtedly been an extremely difficult year, but our performance in the third quarter highlighted once again how our continued -- our team continues to rise and meet the challenge.\nWith the strong support of FBS, we managed to complete our final preparations for the spin-off of Vontier while also navigating the challenging macro environment to deliver improved top line performance and another quarter of strong free cash flow.\nWhile we face an uncertain environment in the near term, we will continue to benefit from the increasingly resilient portfolio that we have established through our efforts to continue to transform the portfolio over the last four years.\nWith our consistent free cash flow, strong M&A pipeline and an expanding set of organic innovation capabilities, we are well positioned to capitalize on the many opportunities ahead of us.\nThat concludes our formal comments.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Our speakers are Jim Owens, H.B. Fuller, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Corkrean, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nFirst, a reminder that our comments today will include references to organic revenue, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation on our revenues and the impact of acquisitions or divestitures.\nWe believe that discussion of these measures is useful to investors to assist their understanding of our operating performance and how our results compare with other companies.\nUnless otherwise specified, discussion of sales and revenue refers to organic revenue, and discussion of EPS, margins or EBITDA refers to adjusted non-GAAP measures.\nMany of these risks and uncertainties are, and will be exacerbated by COVID-19 and the resulting impact on the global business and economic environment.\nLast evening, we reported another quarter of strong revenue and earnings growth.\nOrganic revenues in the second quarter were up 19% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA was up 21% and adjusted earnings per share of $0.94 increased 38% versus last year.\nWe overcame significant supply chain disruptions and moved quickly to raise prices in the quarter.\nWe achieved an all-time record quarter in revenue as we met increasing customer demand and gained market share.\nThroughout the quarter, H.B. Fuller experienced raw material and container shortages, but because of strong support and global collaboration with key suppliers and the ingenuity of our technical and supply chain teams, we made certain to keep our customers supplied.\nH.B. Fuller's ability to assure supply of critical adhesives and provide innovative solutions that customers need remains a competitive differentiator for our company, which is evident in our top-line growth.\nH.B. Fuller's revenue growth was broad-based across segments and geographies.\nOrganic revenues increased in each segment versus the second quarter of 2020, including strong double-digit growth in both Engineering and Construction Adhesives segments, and very solid growth in Hygiene, Health and Consumable Adhesives against a very strong second quarter of 2020.\nRevenues also grew in each geography, including organic growth of 19% in the Americas, 27% in the EMEA and 9% in the Asia-Pacific region.\nImportantly, our revenues are also up from pre-COVID levels.\nTotal organic revenues increased by 9.5% versus the second quarter of 2019, which had no COVID-19-related impacts with double-digit growth in HHC and Engineering Adhesives and mid single-digit growth in Construction Adhesives.\nStrong volume leverage in the quarter, coupled with pricing benefits and operational efficiencies we're driving in the business offset significantly higher raw material costs and drove a 21% increase in EBITDA dollars year-over-year.\nRaw material input cost increased in the second quarter by about 10% from the end of 2020 with some raw materials increasing more rapidly than we forecasted.\nWe have implemented $150 million of annualized price adjustments to date and we'll implement an additional $75 million in the third quarter.\nWe're prepared to do more as necessary.\nThese price adjustments will offset the impact of raw material increases in this fiscal year.\nSuppliers have made good progress in restoring capacity for the commodity and specialty chemicals we purchase.\nHowever, the rate of recovery going forward will likely be uneven until inventory levels are rebuilt to fully meet demand.\nOur planning assumptions anticipate that the current supply volatility will lessen and pricing will begin to stabilize in the fourth quarter.\nWe now expect the year-on-year raw material inflation to be over 10% and expect that our pricing will fully offset raw material increases by the end of the third quarter.\nWe expect gross margin headwinds in the third quarter, which is seasonally slower for volumes, and we will see additional pricing and margin benefit in the fourth quarter, which is typically our strongest volume quarter.\nOur global sourcing expertise, our innovative chemistries and our operational agility were more critical than ever this quarter, and continue to provide competitive differentiation.\nAnd the actions we have taken on price and to drive efficiencies across our business enabled us to seamlessly serve our customers and achieve our profit targets in the quarter, while at the same time increasing our debt paydown over last year's level, in line with our target for $200 million of debt reduction in 2021.\nNow, let me move on to discuss performance in each of our segments in the second quarter on Slide 4.\nHygiene, Health and Consumable Adhesives' second quarter organic sales increased 3.3% year-over-year, which is an outstanding result considering the comparison to a very strong quarter last year when the business grew 7% organically.\nSales increased versus last year across the majority of our HHC markets with strong growth across our packaging applications, beverage labeling, multiwall bags and tape and label.\nHHCs segment EBITDA increased by 11%, significantly more than the top-line growth and EBITDA margin was strong at 14.7%, up 70 basis points versus last year.\nMargin improved driven by strong volume leverage, restructuring benefits and good expense management.\nConstruction Adhesives' organic revenue was up 23% versus last year with strong growth in both flooring and commercial roofing as share gains and improving demand drove significantly improved top-line performance versus 2020.\nEven compared to a strong non-COVID impacted second quarter of 2019, organic revenue was up 4%.\nContributions from the pricing adjustments we have implemented in this segment were under-represented in the second quarter as we fulfilled prior Construction Adhesives orders in backlog following the temporary disruption from the effects of Storm Uri.\nWe have already begun to see increased pricing roll through in the first few weeks of the third quarter and expect additional pricing realization in the P&L over the rest of the year.\nConstruction Adhesives EBITDA increased 4% versus last year as strong volumes were offset by higher raw material costs, unfavorable mix and some temporary manufacturing costs that were required to return to normal service levels after the extreme weather event in the first quarter.\nEngineering Adhesives' results were extremely strong with organic revenue up nearly 40% versus last year, reflecting share gains and improving end market demand.\nSales increased versus last year in all 14 of our Engineering Adhesives end markets with exceptional growth in adhesives for automotive, recreational vehicles, woodworking, electronics and insulating glass.\nAnd looking back to the non-COVID impacted second quarter of 2019, organic revenues were up 11%.\nWe expect continued strength and double-digit full year growth in this segment.\nEngineering Adhesives' second quarter EBITDA grew 42% year-on-year, driven by exceptional volume performance.\nWe expect EBITDA margins to improve in the coming quarters as pricing actions are fully implemented and offset the impact of raw material cost increases.\nLooking ahead at our full year results, our planning assumptions are that economies will continue to open up as vaccines are rolled out around the world.\nRaw materials will be tight through most of the year and pricing will remain elevated as supply chains begin to normalize and demand continues to be strong.\nWe anticipate continued strong demand and share gains in each of our business units to drive strong volume growth in 2021 versus 2020.\nRevenue in most of our end markets will exceed 2019 levels.\nOverall, when considering our strategic pricing actions, coupled with the solid volume growth in HHC, continued improving performance in Construction Adhesives and strong demand in Engineering Adhesives, we now expect full-year double-digit revenue growth versus 2020.\nI'll begin on Slide 5 with some additional financial details on the second quarter.\nNet revenue was up 22.7% versus the same period last year.\nCurrency had a positive impact of 3.9%.\nAdjusting for currency, organic revenue was up 18.8%, with volume up 17.4% and pricing up 1.4%, with most of that pricing realized in the second half of the quarter.\nAll three GBUs had strong growth versus 2020, as well as compared to the non-COVID impacted second quarter of 2019, which we believe validates the strength of our top-line performance.\nWhen compared to Q2 2019, organic revenue increased 9.5% for the total company with strong organic growth for all three GBUs.\nAdjusted gross profit was up 17.4% year-on-year, and gross profit margin was down 120 basis points as volume growth and pricing gains were offset by higher raw material costs.\nAdjusted selling, general and administrative expense was down 130 basis points as a percentage of revenue, reflecting volume leverage, savings associated with our business reorganization, and general cost controls, offset by higher variable compensation than last year.\nIn total, adjusted operating income margin improved by 20 basis points year-over-year.\nNet interest expense declined by $1.3 million, reflecting lower debt balances.\nThe adjusted effective income tax rate in the quarter was 26.8% compared to 27.6% in the same period last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter of $122 million was up 21% versus the same period last year, driven by strong volume growth, pricing gains and restructuring savings, partially offset by higher raw material costs and higher variable compensation.\nAdjusted earnings per share were $0.94, up 38% versus the second quarter of last year, reflecting strong income growth and lower interest expense associated with our debt reduction.\nCash flow from operations in the first half of the year of $80 million compares to $108 million in the same period last year, reflecting working capital requirements to support strong top-line performance, as well as higher raw material costs.\nWe continue to reduce debt, paying down $62 million in the first half of 2021 compared to $51 million during the same period last year and keeping us on track for our full-year debt paydown plan of $200 million.\nRegarding our outlook, based on what we know today, we now expect full-year revenue growth to be in the low double-digits.\nAs you will recall, we increased our adjusted EBITDA guidance range last quarter to $455 million to $475 million and this guidance remains unchanged, given our expectations for the continued strong volume growth and accelerating pricing offsetting raw material cost increases that we now expect to exceed 10% for the fiscal year.\nBased on the seasonality of our business and the timing of raw material and price increases, we expect revenues in the third quarter to be up about 15% versus the third quarter of 2020 as we continue to deliver strong top-line growth.\nEBITDA margin in the third quarter is expected to be about 100 basis points lower than the second quarter on a sequential basis.\nAs pricing actions are fully implemented, margins will improve in the fourth quarter, which is also our strongest quarter from a volume standpoint.\nWe expect cash flow to be strong for the rest of the year, allowing us to maintain our target to pay down approximately $200 million of debt during 2021.\nDuring our last conference call, I outlined the three critical priorities we set for 2021 in the current supply constrained inflationary COVID recovery environment.\nThese three priorities are volume growth, price and greater productivity, and we executed well against each of these key imperatives in the second quarter.\nOur first priority is to drive volume growth by supporting our customers in the current high-demand and supply constrained environment.\nVolume growth and share gains are our foundation for creating durable shareholder value.\nOur 19% second quarter organic revenue growth is even more significant than it appears, considering our HHC business had a very strong quarter of 7% organic growth in the second quarter last year.\nAnd our business, overall, grew 9.5% compared to pre-COVID levels in the second quarter of 2019.\nOur second imperative is to strategically manage pricing, aligned to the value we deliver, in this inflationary environment.\nWe implemented $150 million in price increases, effective from March 1 through July 15, and we're planning an additional $75 million in price increases later in Q3.\nWe are also delivering on our third priority to release greater productivity and capacity through our operational excellence programs.\nIn the second quarter, we out-delivered competitors and supported customers and our factory labor and overhead, as a percentage of revenue in the second quarter, decreased versus the second quarter last year.\nCOVID-19 has changed how businesses operate and supply constraints and pricing volatility are challenges that are impacting our industry today.\nIn this environment, H.B Fuller's strategic priority, the benefits of our robust global operations and supply chain, our culture of collaboration and market-based innovation and the speed and agility we have developed across our company is delivering results for our customers and for our shareholders.\nWe will continue to navigate the challenges of a constrained supply environment, grow our business and build on our rising leadership position in the global adhesive industry and we will continue to deliver strong results for our customers and for our shareholders.\nOperator, please open up the call so we can take some questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Today, I am joined by Bill Furman, Greenbrier's executive chairman; Lorie Tekorius, CEO and president; Brian Comstock, executive vice president and chief commercial and leasing officer; and Adrian Downes, senior vice president and CFO.\nThis past month has been an eventful time in the world and at Greenbrier.\nOn March 1, Lorie Tekorius assume the role of Greenbrier's CEO.\nLast week, our board of directors appointed Lorie as our newest director.\nAs we begin today's call, I want to first congratulate Lorie on the new positions at Greenbrier.\nAnd we're proud of the board's development of Greenbrier, how we have managed this very important transition.\nI'm pleased that I now serve as executive chairman through the remainder of our fiscal year and as a board member and investor until 2024.\nWith Lorie's appointment, we've expanded our board's gender diversity, four of our 11 directors are female.\nFurther, three of the directors identify as people of color.\nOmicron is still a factor in our operations, as you will hear today, but things are getting much better.\nJust so those impacts begin to add, the war in Ukraine has impacted the economies everywhere we operate.\nWe are witnessing a true tragedy and I pray for a swift end to the conflict and to all of the human suffering.\nWhile the war creates challenges for everybody in the near term, it also provides opportunities for major shifts in freight corridors and transportation roads that will enhance Greenbrier's business as the world enters a reordered state.\nHistory demonstrates the integral role of railroads to support civilian life and economies and a heightened manner during wartime.\nThe current war in Europe has created direct pressure on the availability and cost of commodities ranging from minerals to food, to fertilizer, to crude oil as well as coal and natural gas.\nRailroads and railway suppliers will help meet the challenge of keeping civilian life and economies functioning during the crisis.\nThe commodity markets are traditionally leading indicators for expansion in rail freight.\nMost commodities shipped by rail are experiencing upward pricing pressure from demand constraints due to either sanctions on Russia or reduced production from Russia and in the Ukraine.\nWe expect rising global commodity prices and shifting trade patterns to elevate railcar demand in North America and Brazil and elsewhere in the world.\nAlready changing energy policies in North America and Western Europe are creating opportunities for rail transport of oil, ethanol and other products.\nThe impact will be similar in fertilizers and other items needed to produce food.\nFinally, the rising cost of diesel creates a distinct opportunity for model shift from road to rail.\nFreight rail is one of the most sustainable and fuel-efficient modes of surface transportation.\nU.S. freight railroads with diesel-electric power generation are three to four times more fuel efficient than trucks.\nThink about that for just a moment.\nOne ton of freight can be moved by rail almost 500 miles per gallon of fuel.\nAdditionally, moving freight by train instead of trucks reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 75% per tonne travel and it reduces congestion on wear and tear on bridges and byways.\nAs more freight ships to rail, in many cases, this will induce longer railcar dwell tough times and lowered railroad velocity.\nIn turn, railroad congestion causes the need for more railcars to make railroad service more efficient, notwithstanding the increase in demand we expect in major commodities like fertilizer, food steps, and other products.\nWe recognize the role and responsibility our industry must play in times of crisis and as the geopolitical landscape shifts.\nThe cruel irony is this war in Ukraine is that there will be ultimately beneficiaries.\nNow we can't choose the exogenous factors that affect our business, but we have almost always have to be ready to meet the challenges and opportunities that come with them.\nGreenbrier has proven the ability to thrive on adversity and seize opportunities.\nI'm sure this legacy will continue for years to come under Lorie's leadership.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Lorie to discuss our strong performance during the quarter.\nBefore I discuss our results for the quarter, I'd like to express my gratitude to Bill and the rest of the Greenbrier Board for the opportunity to serve as CEO.\nWe have an outstanding team at Greenbrier who works hard and smart every day.\nWhile it's difficult to predict the specific opportunities or challenges that may arise, I know that Greenbrier team has the experience, knowledge, and tenacity to make the most of any situation with a focus on increasing shareholder value.\nGreenbrier posted strong results this second quarter.\nAnd while not all of our operating segments performed as expected, our business is highly diverse and in the aggregate, performed very well.\nIn the quarter, we delivered 4,800 railcar units, a 17% increase from the prior quarter, driven by our core North American market.\nOur lease fleet utilization increased to 98% and our leasing team generated robust cash proceeds and gains through regular lease fleet optimization and monetization transactions.\nOur leasing business is operating ahead of our expectations as we achieve growth at scale.\nOur strong quarterly performance was achieved as the omicron variance of COVID-19 reached peak levels in the United States.\nSadly, in February, Charles Wallace, a longtime employee in our maintenance services group passed away due to COVID.\nCharles is survived by a son and four sisters.\nWe send them our condolences for their loss.\nFurther, we experienced significant absence here another quarter as approximately 12% of our workforce contracted the virus.\nRecently, the infection rates have declined, and we're hopeful the worst of the pandemic is now behind us.\nOur manufacturing gross margin percentage was below our expectations in the quarter, impacted by supply chain and labor issues.\nOur global sourcing team continues to do an exceptional job of mitigating severe disruptions to support increasing production rates and simultaneously minimizing production delays.\nWe have avoided any line shutdowns across our network due to material availability.\nAdditional expenses were incurred in connection with sourcing spot materials and expediting delivery.\nOperating momentum is increasing, and we expect improved performance in the coming quarters due to improved pricing and overhead absorption on higher production.\nIn Europe, the situation is fluid.\nThe period leading up to and the subsequent war in Ukraine has created a highly disruptive environment for many European manufacturers.\nOur operations have been impacted by rapidly rising energy costs and now finished steel and components in our supply chain.\nUkraine and Russia are among the biggest suppliers of iron ore, finished steel, and wheelsets to European mines and welders.\nAs Bill mentioned, railroads are integral to supporting the economy during wartime.\nOur management team is working together with our customers and suppliers to maintain production and ensure the best outcomes for all parties.\nOur maintenance service business continued to be impacted by higher material costs and labor shortages during the quarter with the omicron variant having an outsized impact on the network of smaller workforces.\nWe are beginning to see improving financial results on the action plan implemented to mitigate these headwinds in Q1.\nWe expect to sustain our momentum in the second half of the year as we remain focused on executing our plans while also looking for additional opportunities to reduce costs and improve margins.\nOur leasing and management services group had another strong quarter, driven by increased fleet utilization and regular asset optimization and monetization transactions.\nOur owned fleet has grown by over 25% from the end of fiscal 2021 to around 11,000 units.\nAnd in addition to managing our lease fleet, our management services, or GMS group, continues to provide creative railcar solutions for over 25% of the North American rail freight fleet.\nWithin GMS, we're launching an initiative to redevelop the service platform used to manage equipment and data.\nOne of the goals with this important initiative is to ensure scalable support for our leasing and syndication business as well as our external customers as we continue to execute on our leasing strategy.\nLooking ahead, we see strong operating momentum continuing throughout fiscal 2022 and beyond.\nWe've been able to maintain our market-leading positions through disciplined execution and by maintaining our strong liquidity position.\nThese were hallmarks of our management team's plans at the start of the pandemic and they continue to service well.\nThere is no doubt that the market backdrop will remain dynamic, particularly with the war in Europe.\nInflation, supply chain issues, and the continuing human impact of pandemic will persist for some time.\nWe are managing the business accordingly and maintain our optimistic market outlook.\nWe expect our operating metrics to continue to improve as we move through the next several quarters and beyond.\nAs we've said before, the market recoveries won't follow a straight line, and there will be challenges along the way.\nWe're managing our business to get ahead of these challenges wherever we can to continue to provide solutions to our customers and ultimately, deliver value to our shareholders.\nAs I said before, our leadership team has the experience, knowledge, and tenacity to make the most of any situation.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call over to Brian Comstock to provide an update on current railcar demand environment and our leasing activity.\nGreenbrier's secured new railcar orders of 8,500 units valued at $930 million.\nWith deliveries of 4,800 units in the quarter, the book-to-bill increased to 1.8 times.\nOrders through the first half of the year are already over 85% of fiscal 2021 activity.\nNew railcar backlog of 32,100 units has a market value of $3.6 billion and provides multiyear visibility.\nThis is Greenbrier's largest backlog in six years.\nHistorically, when our backlog reaches this level, it includes several multiyear orders.\nIn this case, there are a few multiyear orders, which illustrates the strength of the overall demand environment.\nFrom an operations perspective, this means that a greater portion of our backlog is scheduled to enter production in the short term and translate to revenue sooner.\nAlso, as production space becomes more valuable, we expect multiyear orders to follow and pricing could continue improvement.\nAs a reminder, our new railcar backlog does not reflect 3,200 units valued at $180 million that are part of Greenbrier's refurbishment program.\nBecause of the large scale and nature of this activity, this work occurs at our manufacturing facility that absorbs production capacity while contributing to overhead absorption.\nOur refurbishment program is an important part of ensuring rail remaining the most environmentally friendly lot of surface transport.\nI'm excited about this growing partnership with our customers to sustainably repurpose North America's aging railcar fleet.\nFleet utilization ended the quarter at 98%.\nLease pricing and terms continue to improve sequentially, and we are seeing strong demand for new and used leased equipment.\nAs part of our enhanced leasing strategy, GBX Leasing, closed our inaugural asset-backed securitization by using -- by issuing $323 million in investment-grade rated notes with a blended coupon rate of 2.9% and an anticipated repayment date of January 2029.\nOur capital markets team executed well this quarter and syndicated 1,400 units, the highest level of activity in nearly two years.\nSyndication is an important source of liquidity and profitability, and we expect to continue strong syndication activity in the second half of the year.\nAs many of you know, syndication and asset disposition are important activities for leasing that will continue to grow into the future.\nLooking ahead, I remain optimistic about the momentum that has been building, especially in light of the strong demand environment in North America.\nGreenbrier is well-positioned for a period of strong growth.\nI believe the combination of market forces, the ability of our focused management, and experienced management team to capitalize on them will deliver results in its early phase of this railcar cycle, which is substantially better than we've seen in previous cycles.\nToday, I will discuss highlights from the quarter, and we're also affirming guidance for fiscal year 2022.\nSecond-quarter highlights include revenue of $683 million, deliveries of 4,800 units, which includes 400 units from our unconsolidated joint venture in Brazil.\nAggregate gross margins of 8% reflects continued effects from ramping of new railcar production, the impact of the omicron variant, mitigation of supply chain, labor shortages, and an additional warranty accrual for certain older railcars.\nSelling and administrative expense of about $55 million was higher sequentially, reflecting increased employee-related costs, consulting, travel, and legal expense from higher levels of business activity.\nNet gain on disposition of equipment was $25 million.\nThis activity was part of our ongoing optimization and monetization of our leasing portfolio.\nNon-controlling interest provides a benefit of $1.6 million, primarily resulting from the impact of line changeovers and production ramping at our Mexico joint venture.\nThis improved sequentially, and we expect our Mexican JV to be profitable in the second half of the year.\nNet earnings attributable to Greenbrier of approximately $13 million or $0.38 per diluted share, and EBITDA of about $52 million or 7.6% of revenue.\nIn the quarter, we recognized $2.1 million of gross costs, specifically related to COVID-19 employee and facility safety.\nThis expense increased almost 75% sequentially and was our highest level in the last 12 months.\nGreenbrier's liquidity increased to $804 million at the end of Q2, consisting of cash of $587 million and available borrowings of $217 million.\nBecause of the strength of our balance sheet, we are well-positioned to navigate any market dynamics.\nWe expect to receive a large portion of our $106 million tax receivable in fiscal Q4, reflecting delays in processing with the IRS.\nThis refund will be in addition to Greenbrier's available cash and borrowing capacity.\nIn the quarter and shortly after the quarter, Greenbrier entered additional interest rate swaps to fix long-term floating rate debt for the next several years, reducing the risk of increasing interest expense and a rising interest rate environment.\nAt the end of the second quarter, effectively all of our outstanding leasing debt was at fixed interest rates and approximately 90% of our corporate non-leasing long-term debt was fixed.\nTogether with executing on over $2 billion of new and refinanced borrowing facilities over the past year, including the ABS lease financing completed in Q2, this positions Greenbrier quite well as we move forward.\nOn March 31, Greenbrier's board of directors declared a dividend of $0.27 per share, our 32nd consecutive dividend.\nBased on yesterday's closing price, our annual dividend represents a dividend yield of approximately 2.3%.\nSince reinstating the dividend in 2014, Greenbrier's returned nearly $380 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nBased on current business trends and production schedules, we're affirming Greenbrier's fiscal year 2022 outlook to reflect the following: deliveries of 17,500 to 19,500 units, which includes approximately 1,500 units from Greenbrier-Maxion in Brazil.\nAs a reminder, in fiscal 2022, approximately 1,400 units are expected to be built and capitalized into our lease fleet.\nThese units are not reflected in the delivery guidance provided.\nWe consider a railcar delivered when it leaves Greenbrier's balance sheet and is owned by an external third party.\nSelling and administrative expense guidance is unchanged and expected to be approximately $200 million to $210 million.\nGross capital expenditures of approximately $275 million in leasing and management services, $55 million in manufacturing, and $10 million in maintenance services.\nNet of proceeds on equipment sales of $150 million, leasing capex is expected to be $125 million.\nGross margin percent is expected to increase sequentially in Q3 and Q4 with Q4 margins between low double digits and low teens.\nTo close, I want to add that I shared with you as expressed by our colleagues earlier.\nSpecifically, Greenbrier will successfully navigate the challenges we face in the second half of the fiscal year.\nGreenbrier's highest backlog in more than half a decade, ample liquidity, and a strong balance sheet make this possible.\nDespite delivering effects of the multiyear pandemic and the impacts of war on a stressed global supply chain, we are better positioned than at any point in time to achieve our ambitious goals.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:My name is Matt Eichmann.\nI'm joined by Pete Watson, Greif's president and chief executive officer; Larry Hilsheimer, Greif's chief financial officer; and Ole Rosgaard, Greif's chief operating officer.\nWe will take questions at the end of today's call.\nIn accordance with Regulation Fair Disclosure, please ask questions regarding issues you consider important because we're prohibited from discussing material nonpublic information with you on an individual basis.\nPlease limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question before returning to the queue.\nActual results could differ materially from those discussed.\nAs always, we appreciate your interest in Greif.\nThe team delivered excellent results despite a challenging operating environment that was complicated by the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and inflationary pressures beyond our control.\nFiscal 2021 was an exceptional year with record financial results.\nWe significantly de-levered our balance sheet, improved our shareholder returns, achieved top decile colleague engagement, and were recognized as a leading workplace in the United States.\nLooking ahead, these accomplishments have us positioned for an even stronger future as our fiscal 2022 guidance points to performance in line with the commitments we established in 2019.\nFinally, in this past year, we made meaningful enhancements to our already strong sustainability performance and have embedded ESG deeper into our business strategies.\nI'd like to ask Ole Rosgaard, our chief operating officer, to make a few comments regarding ESG that's on Slide 4.\nI hope you and your families are well.\nIn my mind, sustainability is not an afterthought or corporate function, rather it's a leadership focus that creates business value by reducing risk and costs and bringing new market opportunities to growth.\nWe achieved several notable ESG accomplishments in 2021.\nFor example, we diverted a minimum of 90% of waste from landfills at more than 140 of our global facilities, increasing our global diversion rate to roughly 85% from about 70% last year.\nEven more impressive, at year end, 50 of our global facilities had achieved zero waste to landfill status.\nWe launched our fourth Colleague Resource Group to provide professional development opportunities and further foster a more representative and inclusive culture across Greif.\nAnd finally, we linked ESG KPIs to the Greif business system, improving our performance management capability to further drive this critical work.\nThe takeaway here is that Greif's strong ESG focus is core to our plans for sustainable value creation.\nI look forward to sharing additional highlights with you in the future.\nAnd now, back over to Pete to discuss our business results on Slide 5.\nThe global industrial packaging business delivered an outstanding fourth quarter result.\nOur overall global primary product line was strong and benefited sales by almost 3% versus the prior year.\nand EMEA and ongoing recovery in our industrial end markets.\nGlobal steel drum volume fell by 1.5% per day versus the prior year.\nThe biggest shortfall was in APAC, reflective of our decision to implement strategic pricing actions and supply chain disruptions that negatively impacted our customers' operations.\nFourth quarter global steel drum volume was also impacted by performance in EMEA where volumes, where steady through most of the quarter but did slow in October as customers in this region faced their own set of supply chain disruptions.\nThe Americas region recorded strong mid-single-digit growth during the quarter.\nGenerally speaking, our industrial end markets remain healthy.\nCustomers report solid order backlogs and strong underlying demand, but they do face external supply chain disruptions.\nAcross GIP, we see little indication of customers building inventory, but some are carrying more stock than normal due to supply chain disruptions, impacting their ability to ship to their customers.\nGIP's generally stronger volumes and higher average selling prices resulted in significantly higher segment sales and gross profit year over year.\nGIP's fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA rose by roughly $47 million due to higher sales, partially offset by higher raw material, manufacturing, and transportation costs.\nThe business also benefited from a $3 million dollar FX tailwind.\nLooking ahead, we expect GIP's fiscal 2022 profits to be lower year over year, while we do anticipate volume growth, contribution from new capex projects, and beneficial efficiency gains.\nProfits will be lower as the unprecedented run-up in steel costs provided a roughly $100 million tailwind to GIP's fiscal 2021 results that will not recur.\nWe anticipate GIP's normal profit cadence through the year to persist.\nPaper packaging's fourth quarter sales rose by roughly $120 million versus the prior year due to stronger volumes and higher published containerboard and boxboard prices.\nAdjusted EBITDA rose by roughly $10 million versus the prior year due to higher sales that were substantially offset by higher raw material, manufacturing, and transportation costs, including a significant $50 million -- $51 million drag from higher OCC index cost and an $8 million natural gas cost spike not contemplated in our guidance.\nThe business benefited from a $4 million legal settlement tailwind reported in SG&A that will not recur.\nVolume demand across our paper business remains strong that our combined mill backlogs exceed eight weeks.\nFourth quarter volumes in our CorrChoice sheet feeder system were up 2.4% today versus the prior year.\nThe demand for durables, e-commerce growth, and the OEMs auto supply chain all remained very solid, and we see no slowdown on the horizon.\nFourth quarter tube and core volumes were up 7% per day versus the prior year.\nDemand was strong in most key end markets, including film, paper cores, textiles, and protective packaging.\nLooking ahead into fiscal 2022, we expect significantly higher profits in paper packaging due to strong demand and continued flow through published price increases.\nBig picture, our team delivered excellent fourth quarter results despite significant external challenges.\nFourth quarter net sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, rose 35% versus the prior year quarter due to stronger volumes and higher selling prices.\nAdjusted EBITDA rose by 57 million, including a 7 million combined tailwind from FX and a one-time legal settlement.\nKeep in mind our adjusted EBITDA result overcame an OCC index headwind of 51 million and roughly 40 million of non volume related transportation and manufacturing inflation, including an $8 million unforecasted natural gas cost spike.\nInterest expense fell by 9 million versus the prior-year quarter due to lower debt balances.\nWe also benefited by reaching a lower interest rate tier in our credit facility as a result of our substantial debt repayments.\nOur fourth quarter GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate were both roughly 11%.\nFourth quarter adjusted Class A earnings per share more than doubled to $1.93 a share.\nFor fiscal '21, we delivered adjusted Class A earnings per share of $5.60 a share, a 74% improvement versus the prior year and a significant beat relative to our Q3 guidance.\nPart of the earnings improvement came from a lower-than-anticipated non-GAAP tax rate of 18.1%, which benefited from reserve releases due to audit settlements, and statute of limitation expirations.\nWe estimate the lower tax rate relative to the guidance we shared at $0.15 at -- to fiscal '21 results.\nThe lion's share of our year-over-year earnings improvement came from disciplined operational execution.\nFourth quarter adjusted free cash fell roughly $79 million versus the prior year.\nWhile profits improved significantly, capex rose and working capital dragged on cash flow primarily due to higher raw material costs than we anticipated in our forecast.\nWorking capital was also negatively impacted by lower-than-anticipated October volumes outside the U.S. while customers struggled with external challenges and ordered fewer drums.\nThat said, our team is controlling what it can with strong results and trailing 12-month average working capital as a percentage of sales, improved by a significant 140 basis points to a -- year over year to 10.8%.\nOur core capital priorities are clear and remain consistent: reinvest in the business as needed to create value and support growth, return excess cash to shareholders via an attractive and growing dividend, and de-lever our balance sheet and maintain a compliance leverage ratio between two to two-and-a-half turns.\nOur balance sheet is in great shape.\nWe anticipate spending between 150 million and 170 million in capital expenditures in fiscal '22 and target growing our dividend in '22 as mentioned in previous calls.\nWe are in the midst of our strategic planning process to determine the focus and extent of growth activities going forward to prudently leverage our strong balance sheet for the benefit of our shareholders.\nWe are pleased to introduce fiscal '22 guidance, excuse me, that delivers on the commitments we made more than two years ago.\nOur guidance reflects the considerable improvement we've made in the base business over the last several years, including the successful Caraustar integration and synergy capture, and demonstrates Greif's resilience in overcoming the unforeseen and considerable external challenges presented by COVID and dramatic inflationary headwinds well beyond our control.\nAt the midpoint, we anticipate generating $6.15 of adjusted Class A earnings per share in '22.\nOverall, we expect lower profits in GIP in fiscal '22 to be more than offset by higher profitability and EPS, highlighting once again the benefit of our diversified portfolio.\nInterest expense will be significantly lower in fiscal '22 as a result of our aggressive de-leveraging, and we expect it to evolve further when we move to refinance our 6.5% 27 senior notes sometime in the first half of calendar '22.\nWe anticipate '22 adjusted free cash flow between 400 million and 460 million.\nIn addition to increased capital expenditures, we anticipate significantly higher cash tax in fiscal '21, mainly due to additional pre-tax income.\nWe anticipate working capital revert to a cash source.\nIt was a $222 million use in '21 as raw material cost inflation accelerated.\nNow, a few reflective comments for your consideration.\nFrom my perspective, the Greif of today is a far different company than the Greif of six years ago.\nOur margin profile has stabilized and grown, profits have increased significantly, and our transparency and communication has improved and been applauded.\nOur capital allocation strategy has been steady, disciplined, and predictable.\nWe have delivered on what we promised, and we continue to derive even greater value for our shareholders.\nDespite these improvements, we continue to trade at a discount to our historical metrics in the broader market.\nAs an example, assuming a historic free cash flow of 11% in the midpoint of our '22 free cash flow guidance would imply a combined market cap of roughly $3.9 billion, or an increase of roughly 30%.\nSo, while we don't get to vote when it comes to our valuation, our opinion is that we deserve a closer look, given the discount present in our stock today.\nNow, I'm going to take a minute and go off-script.\nAs most of, if not all of you are aware, today is Pete Watson's last earnings call.\nPete embodies the leadership and has a personal connection with many of Greif's colleagues that developed through personal contact.\nHe is a humble and respected leader who leans on his athletic coaching background for the skills in building a cohesive team.\nAs he took leadership at Greif, many things were broken.\nSince taking the helm in November of 2015, the results have been extraordinary.\nIn safety, steady improvement, in colleague engagement, we improved dramatically to be a top decile in gallops industrial sector.\nThose engaged colleagues have delivered outstanding customer service and driven incredible improvement in doubling our NPS scores over that period.\nThat focus on virtuous service profit chain has lead to financial improvement that has been exceptional.\nFrom 2015 to 2021, [Inaudible] and EBITDA have essentially doubled.\nAdjusted EBITDA earnings per share has gone from $2.18 to $5.60 with no stock repurchases.\nAnd adjusted free cash flow, which was $70 million in 2015 has averaged nearly $30 million in the last three years and will exceed $400 million in '22.\nPete has worked diligently to ensure this succession plan and left Greif in good leadership hands going forward to secure his legacy as an outstanding leader.\nYou certainly did go off-script and much appreciated.\nAnd again Larry, I appreciate your comments and thoughts.\nYou are a good man.\nAs Larry talked about, today is my final earnings call as president and chief executive officer of Greif.\nYou know, it's a great company.\nIt's been my distinct honor to serve our global Greif team.\nAnd I'm extremely proud, as Larry talked about, of what we've all accomplished together over the last six years.\nI'm incredibly grateful to all our colleagues for their passion and dedication to excellence and also for their commitment to our team and our customers.\nAnd while fiscal 2021 is a record year for our company, I'm even more excited for what lies ahead.\nWe are well-positioned to benefit from ongoing strength and improving trends at our key end markets and our extensive global portfolio, our differentiated service capability, and our sharp focus on operational execution allows us to best serve our customers' needs and generate significant shareholder value.\nI, along with the rest of the board, are confident in Ole Rosgaard's ability to lead Greif going forward.\nHis operational background, strategic mindset, and passion for team building and serving customers will be advantageous to Greif's future.\nI look forward to the company thriving under his leadership.\nIt has certainly been a pleasure working with all of you, and we certainly appreciate your interest in Greif.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Our conference call slides have been posted on our website and provide additional information that may be helpful.\nSales totaled $367 million this quarter, a decrease of 14% from the second quarter last year.\nAcquisitions added two percentage points of growth this quarter, while changes in currency translation rates decreased sales by approximately one percentage point.\nNet earnings totaled $29 million for the quarter or $0.17 per diluted share, including $30 million or $0.20 related to the impairment charges associated with selling the Alco business.\nAfter adjusting for the impairment and other tax adjustments, net earnings totaled $62 million or $0.37 per diluted share.\nDuring the second quarter, we entered into negotiations to divest the U.K. valve business, Alco, which has significant exposure to oil and gas natural gas markets.\nAlco operations contributed $7 million of sales and $2 million of operating losses year-to-date, which have been included within the Process segment.\nBased on the negotiations to sell, our investment in Alco was revalued in the second quarter, and we recorded noncash impairment charges of $34 million after tax, including $24 million of previously unrecognized foreign currency translation losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nThe $24 million loss reserve for previously unrecognized foreign currency translation is recorded in other current liability at the end of the second quarter and will be cleared through accumulated other comprehensive income in the third quarter, as the divestiture was finalized in early July.\nOur gross margin rate was 49.8% for the second quarter, approximately three percentage points below the second quarter last year.\nPrimarily due to the effect of product and channel mix, as sales in the Contractor segment increased, while sales in the Industrial and Process segments declined double digits and also due to lower factory volumes and changes in currency translation rates.\nRealized pricing was favorable.\nWithout recovery in sales volumes, unabsorbed factory costs will continue to weigh on gross margin rates in the second half, so strong realized pricing partially offsets the favorable effect.\nChanges in product and channel mix can affect gross margin rates.\nOur global procurement team has been working closely with our supply chain to keep our lines running throughout the quarter.\nGiven the growth in certain products in the Contractor segment, particularly products for the home center channel, the supply chain for some components is stretched and we are monitoring the situation closely.\nOperating expenses, excluding the effect of the impairment, decreased by $12 million from the second quarter last year, as reductions in volume and earnings based expenses more than offset higher product development costs.\nThe reported income tax rate was 31% for the quarter, 13 percentage points higher than the second quarter last year, primarily due to nondeductible impairment charges.\nAfter adjusting for the effect of the impairment and excess tax benefits from stock option exercises and other nonrecurring tax benefits, our tax rate was 19% for the quarter or one percentage point lower than last year.\nCash flows from operations totaled $143 million year-to-date as compared to $164 million last year as a result of lower revenues.\nCapital expenditures totaled $33 million year-to-date as we continue to invest in manufacturing capabilities as well as the expansion of several locations.\nCash dividends totaled $58 million year-to-date.\nWe also completed an acquisition for $27 million in the second quarter, which will be a part of the Process segment.\nFor the full year 2020 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $80 million, including approximately $50 million for facility expansion projects.\nWe completed share repurchases of $17 million net of share issuances during the quarter, bringing our total share repurchases net of issuances to $62 million for the year.\nWe may make further opportunistic share repurchases going forward.\nA few final comments, looking forward to the rest of the year.\nOn Page 11 of our slide deck, we note our six-week booking average by segment.\nThese are the six-week average bookings through last week, July 17.\nBased on current exchange rates and the same volume and mix of products and sales by currency as last year, the effective exchange is currently expected to be negligible on sales and a headwind of approximately one percentage on earnings in 2020.\nUnallocated corporate expenses are expected to be approximately $30 million for the full year 2020 and can vary by quarter.\nThe effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20% to 21% for the full year, excluding the effect of onetime items and any impact from excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises.\nAnd given the wild environment in the second quarter, I'll focus my commentary on our operational status, our strategic focus, sales trends as we progress through the quarter and make a few observations on end markets.\nOur major factories and distribution centers remained fully operational during the second quarter.\nHigh-risk employees remained at home, and we've dealt with the positive COVID-19 cases that we have experienced at various facilities without disruption.\nBy reducing our use of temporary labor in certain factories and flexing our workforce to areas of greater need, we've largely been able to survive the quarter without resorting to lay offs or pay reductions.\nWe had enough work in all of our major factories to keep our full-time people productive.\nOverall, I'm very pleased with the resolve our employees have shown and continue to show throughout this pandemic.\nConsistent with what we told you during the first quarter call, we've continued full speed on our growth initiatives.\nAny expense reductions in the second quarter were the result of variable expenses, such as rebates and incentives as well as reduced spending on travel and prudent discretionary expense management.\nSpending on our initiatives for 2021 and beyond have continued as usual.\nThis may put pressure on our short-term financial results, but will position us to capitalize when market conditions normalize.\nConsolidated order trends improved sequentially throughout the quarter.\nHowever, the improvement has not been consistent between the segments.\nAfter a terrible April, our Contractor business rebounded with a very strong June, resulting in low single-digit growth for the quarter.\nProfessional paint channel improved, as paint stores opened up to foot traffic.\nAnd the Home Center business has been on fire for most of the quarter, resulting in operational challenges to meet the demand spike.\nThe outlook for the Contractor business is positive for the second half of the year.\nOur Industrial business, on the other hand, experienced marginal improvement after the business tanked in April.\nAccess to customer facilities is slowly improving and quoting activity has increased in many sectors or we're yet to see a significant bounce back in orders.\nAutomotive is weak globally, industrial production is down, oil and gas is weak, and uncertainty continues to weigh in to weigh on the capital equipment appetite of most end users.\nThe outlook for Industrial remains cloudy, and I'm not overly optimistic about the second half.\nOur Process business didn't drop as severely in April.\nAnd despite being down double digits for the quarter, we've seen some positive end market trends.\nWithin this business, we have stronger end markets such as semiconductor and environmental and weaker end markets such as our lubrication business, which has performed comparably to our Industrial segment.\nWith a wide range of end market exposures, our outlook for the second half remains uncertain.\nI'm comfortable that our approach of continuing to invest in our growth strategies, such as new product and new market development, will position us nicely to drive strong results once things normalize.\nWe used a similar approach during the 2008, 2009 crisis and our investors were subsequently rewarded and we look to repeat this again.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm Patrick Suehnholz, Greenhill's head of investor relations.\nJoining me on the call today is Scott Bok, our chairman and chief executive officer.\nThese statements are based on our current expectations regarding future events that, by their nature, are outside of the firm's control and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions.\nFor a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.\nWe reported fourth-quarter revenue of $106.7 million, an operating margin of 39% and net income of $1.05 per share.\nFor the full year, we had revenue of $301 million, an operating margin of 15% and net income of $0.45 per share.\nOur quarterly revenue was up 20%, and earnings per share was up 133% from the same period last year.\nFor the full year, our revenue was down 14%, and earnings per share was down 68%.\nIn sum, we had a strong finish to the year, resulting in respectable full-year results on the top and bottom line, all consistent with our commentary on the past couple of quarterly investor calls.\nWhile industry data shows a decline in global transaction activity versus the prior year, and almost all of our competitors have reported declines in advisory revenue, the primary driver in our reduced revenue for the year was that lower revenue in Europe more than offset increases in revenue in North America, Australia and the rest of the world.\nBy type of advice, we benefited from significant improvement in restructuring advisory revenue relative to recent years as our recently enlarged team gained increasing traction throughout the year.\nOur capital advisory team had another strong performance though fell short of the prior year's record revenue level.\nAnd in M&A, results were relatively strong nearly everywhere other than in Europe.\nBy industry sector, we had good results in consumer products, financial services and media, offset by weaker results in energy, healthcare and technology.\nWith respect to costs, our compensation ratio for the year was 59%, slightly above our target level as a result of lower revenue for the year.\nFor the quarter, the compensation ratio was an unusually low 42% in order to offset unusually high ratios in the first two quarters of the year.\nOur management objective, as always, is to achieve a reasonable compensation ratio on a full-year basis while also ensuring that our team is appropriately compensated at competitive levels relative to their individual performance.\nOur non-compensation operating expenses for the quarter were $21 million, which was $3.7 million higher than the same period last year due to some foreign currency-related losses compared to gains the prior year along with a charge for an uncollectible account receivable from a client in financial difficulty.\nFor the year, our non-compensation operating costs were very similar to last year as the above-mentioned unusual costs were in aggregate about the same size of the unusual cost the prior year when we incurred an accounting charge related to the earnout on our acquisition of Cogent.\nWe continue to monitor non-compensation expenses closely and are hopeful to achieve a lower annual level in dollar terms in 2020.\nOur interest expense for the quarter was somewhat lower than for the same period last year as the incremental cost of an increased level of borrowing was more than offset by the impact of lower market interest rate and a lower coupon premium on our debt following our favorable refinancing early in 2019.\nWe expect our interest expense to continue to decline going forward.\nOur effective tax rate was 33% for the quarter and 40% for the year.\nOur tax rates for both periods were negatively impacted by the fact that we had a significantly lower than typical portion of our revenue and profit in lower tax rate jurisdictions, particularly the U.K., and a higher than typical portion of our revenue and profit in higher tax jurisdictions, particularly Australia and Brazil.\nOur rate for the year was also negatively impacted by an unfavorable difference between the grant price and market price on vesting restricted stock units.\nWe continue to expect a rate generally in the mid-20% range going forward.\nIn terms of capital returns, we've continued to aggressively repurchase shares given our view that the market is underestimating our earnings potential as well as the fact that our stock trades at a valuation multiple below that of our peers and far below its typical historic valuation multiple level.\nDuring the quarter, we purchased 1.5 million shares and share equivalents at an average price of $15.98 per share.\nFor the full year, we purchased 3.8 million shares and share equivalents at an average price of $18.04 per share.\nFor 2020, our Board has authorized $60 million in purchases of shares and share equivalents, which compares to $69 million we spent for such purchases during 2019.\nIn the quarter to date, we have repurchased 345,723 shares of common stock at an average price of $16.47 per share for $5.7 million in total, meaning we have repurchase authority of $54.3 million left for the remainder of the year.\nWe also declared a quarterly dividend for the quarter of $0.05 per share.\nWe ended the year with cash of $114 million and debt of $365.6 million, meaning we had net debt of $251.6 million.\nAs of yesterday, our cash balance was up to $133.9 million despite the incremental share repurchases in January with the debt amount unchanged.\nOur required principal payment obligations are modest until maturity of our debt in 2024.\nBut based on our business outlook, as described below, we are aiming for significant deleveraging during 2020 alongside the additional share repurchases referred to above.\nWe enter 2020 with a favorable outlook across all of our businesses.\nThe environment for M&A activity currently feels positive across the regions that performed well for us in 2019, and our current book of assignments in Europe indicates the potential for a very substantial rebound in revenue there this year.\nIn restructuring advisory, we ended 2019 with a much improved level of monthly retainer fees and a much larger backlog of assignments that should get to completion during 2020.\nRecent tightening of credit availability and increasing cost for borrowers with weaker credit ratings should also be a positive factor for this business.\nIn capital advisory, the continued growth of pools of private equity capital and the increased market liquidity available to chief investment officers that are invested in those funds should result in a continuing favorable operating environment for that business as well.\nI'll close with a few words on our strategy.\nWe remain focused on building a business with increasingly diversified revenue streams and greater aggregate revenue.\nThat was the purpose of our acquisition of capital advisory specialist Cogent Partners almost five years ago, that was the purpose of the recent expansion of our restructuring advisory team, that was the purpose of last year's expansion in Singapore and France, and that is the purpose of our continuing recruitment of M&A specialists across various industry sectors.\nRecruiting will continue to be key to our growth plans as well the continued development of talent internally.\nIn the past year, we added a net five client-facing managing directors, such that we have 79 today, and we increased our total professional headcount by 11%.\nWe have all the tools needed to continue to successfully implement our strategy.\nOur culture makes our firm a great place to work, leading to both recruiting success and very high retention rates for strong performers.\nOur brand for high-quality and independent advice has been built over decades of client service,

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We certainly appreciate your time today and your interest in Graham Corporation.\nJoining me on the call are Dan Thoren, our president and CEO; and Jeff Glajch, our chief financial officer.\nYou should have a copy of the third quarter fiscal 2022 financial results, which just released a few minutes ago.\nIf not, you can access the release as well as the other slides that will accompany our conversation today at our website, grahammanufacturing.com, and I also want to point out that we also have now ir.\ngrahamcorp.com to access the investor information.\nThese documents can be found on our website or at sec.gov.\nDuring today's call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these will be useful in evaluating our performance.\nWe have provided reconciliation of non-GAAP measures with comparable GAAP measures in the tables that accompany today's release and the slides for your information.\nI am starting on Page 3.\nAs you might imagine, having just assumed the role of CEO in September, reporting this fiscal third year -- third quarter's results is a little bit rough.\nRevenue has increased to $28.8 million, but we had a loss of $0.35 per share.\nThe loss was driven by Navy project cost overruns in our Batavia operations as a result of decisions we made during the quarter to ensure timely execution of our high-profile submarine and carrier projects.\nThe multiple decisions that led to the loss were for long-term gain over short-term pain and were not made lightly.\nOur Navy business is very important for our future.\nWe had to protect this business and ensure our customers knew we were committed to hitting their need dates, even though we took a significant financial hit in the quarter and over our fiscal year 2022.\nJeff and I will provide more detail on subsequent slides.\nAs a result of the quarter loss, we were out of compliance on our financial covenants, which required suspending our dividend.\nJeff will talk more about the waiver we obtained and the coming amendment of our credit facility.\nWhile this was a disappointing quarter and has been a very challenging year, we are deeply committed to our strategy to diversify beyond refining at petrochem with our defense work.\nThe pivot toward defense has been successful, as indicated by bookings and revenue.\nOur defense revenue is now over half our total revenue.\nWe had a huge bookings quarter at $68 million.\nOver half of these bookings were at Barber-Nichols.\nNow that we have the bookings, we have to execute this work profitably.\nFinal point on this page is that Barber-Nichols' performance is exceeding our expectations.\nThey are building a larger backlog and delivering strong margins.\nJeff will provide more detail in the financial discussion.\nBut first, I'd like to provide more detail on our Navy challenges in Batavia.\nWe'll move to Slide 4.\nSo let me first address what led up to our third quarter performance.\nTo date, Graham manufacturing has been very successful in winning the trust and confidence of the U.S. Navy and its prime shipbuilders with its high-quality heat exchange and vacuum products used in the nuclear Navy power plants.\nNavy orders and backlog continue to climb and have now significantly exceeded our commercial backlog and will soon exceed our commercial revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our Navy backlog in Batavia was over $100 million.\nThose orders come with big expectations.\nAs we have worked over the last two years to continue to win new business and meet those expectations, a perfect storm brewed in our third quarter.\nThere were several events that led to our need to readjust in Q3.\nAfter getting started on Colombia, there was a Navy wide reset of quality requirements that caused delays with welder and quality recertification.\nThis was followed by the impact of COVID-19, the ongoing limited skilled workforce in the welding trades, and the sheer magnitude of work running through our shop combined with first article learning curve, all of these items caused us to get behind on our Navy jobs.\nWe do continue to have first article challenges.\nThis is quite typical with defense projects, and we would have expected this on the Columbia project.\nWe've reviewed this with you in the past.\nNow while the CVN-80 work is not a true first article job for us, the lack of process documentation from the previous work combined with severe labor challenges and use of contract welders new to the equipment caused challenges on the carrier work as well.\nEven as we work to catch up on hours, our equipment became the pacing item associated with our nation's most strategic ship and submarine build schedules.\nThe pressure to expedite was extreme.\nLet's turn to Page 5.\nThe chart on Page 5 shows our labor plan with blue bars, our actual labor, application in gray bars, and the resulting deficit of hours caused by actual being less than our planned hourly expenditure.\nThe depth of our deficit occurred around May of 2021.\nIn past calls, we talked about redirecting commercial welders to Navy and hiring contract welders to address this deficit.\nIn third quarter, we redirected even more commercial welders, outsourced more commercial work, hired more contract welders and even added some of our new welders that completed our training programs.\nThese actions help to reverse the Navy labor deficit, but they came at additional costs.\nOutsourcing commercial work results in less margin.\nWe also realized less third quarter revenue as the outsourced suppliers were not able to ramp up quickly.\nThe contract welder costs were high, the specialized training required by the Navy took a long time and retention of the contract welders was poor.\nUltimately, we've been able to reduce our Navy program labor deficit by doubling our Navy workforce, mitigating the schedule slips and keeping our customer relationship strong.\nThe deficit should be erased in the first half of fiscal '23, but we expect to start reducing high-cost contract welders as we enter the next fiscal year.\nIn the end, the actions we took to stay on track in the last quarter resulted in revising estimates on labor hours and material, and we booked loss conversion costs that were recorded in the quarter and impacted our results as well.\nJeff will cover that detail in the financial briefing.\nCertainly, we've learned a lot from this experience and have or will institute corrective and preventative actions to ensure that we continue to grow our Navy business and can deliver quality products in a timely fashion and earn a fair return for our efforts.\nOur customers have been very appreciative of our efforts and we do not see any negative consequences if we hold current deliveries.\nThis equipment is built into the bowels of these ships, and they will never come out.\nThus, quality is paramount and Graham has not disappointed.\nAs we catch up on these programs and reduce our labor deficit, we can reclaim margins by eliminating contract welders, reassigning our commercial welders back to our commercial product and reduce the outsourcing that we're doing today.\nOur people pipeline continues to be critical, and our welder training program will be continued.\nLooking back, we could have done a better job in predicting and mitigating the situation with better developed FP&A, financial planning and analysis, and project management skills.\nWe are adding new talent with defense expertise in Batavia to better manage these processes.\nIn fact, we're adding a new position and Batavia will have a Navy business leader beginning February 28.\nAs we look forward, our processes need to advance to enable our ability to document and optimize all of our fabrication processes to prevent a recurrence of this first article issues that we've seen.\nWe see opportunities to increase future profits with investment in time-saving automated welding, and we're evaluating current contract margins and revisiting pricing on future production opportunities.\nIn summary, our Batavia defense business was hit by a perfect storm at a very inopportune time.\nWe made decisions to protect our strategic Navy business.\nIt cost us in the short term, but proved our dedication to our customers for the long term.\nAs Dan mentioned, our third quarter performance was quite disappointing.\nSales were $28.8 million, up $1.6 million over last year's third quarter.\nBarber-Nichols contributed $12 million in sales in the quarter, helping to offset the weak sales quarter of our legacy Graham manufacturing business.\nOur Batavia operations were impacted because of its need to focus on catching up and executing the two large Navy projects.\nThose projects will both require more labor and material costs to complete that were projected at the start of the quarter.\nThe additional labor hours to complete the projects impacted the quarter's revenue since we did not move the projects as far along as expected.\nThe added labor and material costs, including the use of higher cost contract laborers required us to record increased reserves.\nThe sum of all these items impacted both revenue and gross margin.\nThe impact of the cost increases and required fully burdened contract costs in the quarter were $2 million.\nIn addition, the delayed revenue was approximately $6 million, and the delayed operating profit is approximately $750,000.\nFurthermore, to get back on schedule with the Navy projects, we reallocated our commercial labor to Navy work, which resulted in increases in cost estimates for those jobs, which have now been outsourced.\nAll of the above items contributed to an adjusted EBITDA of negative $2.6 million in the quarter and an adjusted net loss of $0.27 per share.\nOn the positive front, with the addition of Barber-Nichols, we had 58% of our sales to the defense industry, as well as 5% or $1.5 million to the space industry.\nIf we can move on to Slide 7.\nThe impact of the third quarter results on top of a challenging first half of the year have yielded an unacceptable loss even as sales increased 16% or $11.3 million to $83.1 million.\nThere is a bright light within the results, and this has been the contributions of Barber-Nichols, which we acquired on June 1.\nIn the seven months since the acquisition, BN has contributed $31.9 million in sales, offsetting significant declines in refining and petrochemical markets.\nIn fact, our diversification into defense, which is less cyclical than our commercial business, has resulted in 52% of our year-to-date revenue coming from that industry.\nThe shortfall in commercial sales in the first nine months of the fiscal year reflects the very low order levels, which we saw in the second half of fiscal 2021.\nThe two Navy projects in our Batavia operations will continue to convert over the next three quarters, and we expect this to be behind us by mid fiscal 2023.\nAs of December 31, we recorded all known expected costs on these large projects.\nWe are also implementing expanded processes within our project management group to better review all of Batavia's major projects.\nThe year-to-date impact of increased cost on these two jobs is approximately $4.5 million.\nIn addition, the delayed revenue was approximately $12 million and the delayed operating profit is an additional $1.5 million.\nThese latter amounts will be recognized over the next three quarters as the jobs are completed.\nWe've had to outsource more commercial work and have also had cost challenges on a couple of projects.\nThis, too, has impacted financial results.\nThe increased cost of outsourcing and higher costs has impacted the commercial business by $3 million.\nAll of the above items contributed to an adjusted EBITDA of negative $5.4 million year-to-date, and a year-to-date net loss of $0.70 a share and an adjusted loss of $0.60 per share.\nBarber-Nichols again, is a strong positive in the first three quarters.\nIn the seven months since the acquisition, BN sales are on track at $31.9 million, and EBITDA margins are well ahead of expectations.\nI have noted in previous calls, that we were expecting $45 million to $48 million in sales and low double-digit EBITDA margins.\nThe sales number is on target, and we are now seeing mid-teen EBITDA.\nIn fact, through seven months since the acquisition, BN has achieved our targeted EBITDA for the full fiscal year.\nSo its Q4 EBITDA will represent overachievement compared with our expectation.\nMoving on to Slide 8.\nAnd given the weak financial performance in the first three quarters, we have failed to meet our debt covenant related to debt-to-EBITDA and fixed cost charges.\nThis miss was due to the EBITDA loss.\nWe were given a waiver by our lender for Q3 and are proactively in negotiations to amend our existing bank agreement.\nBecause of the covenant misses, it was necessary to suspend our dividend.\nAnd as part of the waiver agreement, we have agreed not to utilize more than $15 million of our revolver.\nI want to be clear that the issues we are seeing are P&L profit issues and not liquidity issues.\nWe have sufficient liquidity from cash we are generating from operations to work through our challenges.\nIn fact, in January alone, lowered our revolver debt from $9.75 million to $6 million.\nWe expect to lower it further between now and the end of March.\nConversations with our lender have been very positive.\nI've been pleased with the bank's willingness to understand the details and not overreact to the numbers.\nThey understand the near-term challenges are primarily related to profitability and delayed revenue.\nWhile there are certainly some significant cost -- cash cost increases, the costs booked in Q3 and the elongation of project revenue and profit recognition into future quarters have doubled down the impact on our year-to-date P&L.\nThe bank and I both expect the lending amendment to be completed by the end of Q4.\nOnto Slide 9, some very good news on the order front.\nAs Dan noted, orders in Q3 were $68 million.\nJust over half of this came from Barber-Nichols, which most of their orders coming from key defense projects.\nThey also continue to bring in a nice level and variety of space orders.\nOn the commercial side, Graham manufacturing saw another strong quarter of aftermarket and short-cycle orders.\nThose are promising since historically, an increase in those areas has often been a precursor to a recovery in capital investment by our customers.\nWe also booked a significant refinery order in China.\nOur backlog at the end of Q3 is a record $272.6 million, with both Barber-Nichols and the legacy Graham business having a nice step-up in their respective backlogs during the quarter.\nDefense represents 77% of total backlog.\nThis defense backlog extends over the next 6 years, though much of it converts in the next three to four years.\nAdditionally, we are seeing growth in our commercial backlog.\nThe commercial backlog was quite low entering the fiscal year.\nIt has grown from $33 million at the end of March to $63 million now.\nAbout one-fourth of that increase occurred when we added BN, the rest was due to orders received in the first nine months of the year.\nAnother positive feature of the commercial backlog and its growth is that it has a much shorter conversion cycle than the defense backlog generally 12 to 18 months.\nWe've had a rough fiscal 2022, but the future looks far better.\nMoving on to Slide 10.\nWe have lowered our guidance for fiscal 2022.\nOur revenue guidance is now $120 million to $125 million, which implies $37 million to $42 million in Q4.\nWe expect a breakeven adjusted EBITDA in Q4.\nWhile this is below our prior expectations, it's far better than Q3 results, and we believe we have turned the corner on many of the challenges we have faced this fiscal year.\nI will now pass the call back to Dan to talk about our strategy going forward.\nWe are now on Slide 11.\nAt a high level, we have been talking about a strategic pivot toward defense for many years, and we have been making good progress.\nThe long-term visibility of strategic naval programs provide stability and an ability to invest intelligently in our business, and it offsets the cyclicality and challenges of our refining and petrochemical markets.\nThe acquisition of Barber-Nichols strengthened the strategy and brought additional market experience to our company.\nAs with any new venture, we have had some lessons learned and opportunities to further strengthen our strategy.\nI'd now like to give you some insight on how our strategy is evolving going forward.\nLet's turn to Page 12.\nGraham Corporation is a related group of mission-critical engineered product companies that win on superior quality, performance and customer trust.\nOur corporate role is to strengthen our member companies with best practices, leader rotation and board expertise while providing value-enhancing services and core in any collaboration to win large programs.\nIn fact, we are filling out critical leadership positions in upgrading talent for what the future of Graham Corporation requires.\nOur board took on this requirement themselves last year after the BN acquisition, and they began a search for director candidates with strong defense experience.\nOur Batavia operations, which we are referring to as Graham manufacturing, will continue to serve the Navy refining and petrochem markets with high-quality, highly engineered heat transfer and vacuum systems.\nIt is expanding into new energy and we'll now put more focus on aftermarket opportunities to be a life cycle partner with our customers.\nInternally, we are restructuring for significant Navy growth and we'll be leveraging our large installed base for growth capital.\nOur strengths will help us realize our goals.\nIn Batavia, we want to realize strong margin in all of our markets, improve our operational effectiveness and develop capabilities to provide more value to our customers.\nWe need to establish roles and responsibilities to align with the structure designed to be responsive analytical and forward thinking.\nAnd we need to create an organization that is accountable and that can diagnose problems, evaluate alternatives, improve, develop, reshape and quickly redirect as required.\nImportantly, we need to make sure our people are provided the tools, materials and information they need to do their jobs well.\nBarber-Nichols continues on its path of intelligent full life cycle turbomachinery systems in identified high-growth potential markets.\nBN has structured people, technology and customer relationships mostly in place.\nThey are moving to the next level in teams, processes and improvement to optimize business performance, while working even closer with customers developing new product to ensure year-over-year growth.\nOur future opportunities will be the result of proper execution of our plans that will get us beyond these short-term issues.\nWe believe this is the inflection point.\nWe have no doubt hit bottom.\nSo I am confident we can go up from here.\nI realize that we have to prove to you that we can drive earnings and generate cash.\nAs Jeff noted, we already have in the first month of 2022 -- in the first month of 2022, I'm sorry.\nAs we look to our future, we see the BN acquisition as a model that we will look to repeat.\nThere were several novel approaches utilized that we believe can entice the best and the brightest, small independent companies to join us.\nWe are an organization in the midst of dynamic change.\nWe serve great markets.\nWe have the confidence of the customer.\nWe have the orders and the backlog to prove it.\nWe have been challenged on execution, but have identified the issues and put corrective actions in place.\nWe have a plan for growth.\nWe believe we have a strong business model with excellent earnings, power and cash generation.\nWhile we have several quarters of work to get these projects out the door, we are on the upward trend of the curve.\nAnd then Jeff and I will answer questions from the audience.\nSummary: ",

pricing, volume, conditions of markets, adverse developments in the global economy as well as the public health crisis related to COVID-19 and resulting impacts on demand for new and used vehicles and related services.\nUncertainty regarding the duration and the severity of COVID-19 and its impact on U.S. and international authorities to ease current restrictions on various commercial and economic activities.\nUncertainty regarding the timing, pace and extent of an economic recovery in the U.S. and elsewhere from the unknown current and future impacts of COVID-19 and unknown future impacts of oil producers and the effects of such can have on travel, transportation, oil prices, which, in turn, will likely adversely affect demand for our vehicles and service.\nAlso, our ability to obtain an inventory desire for new and used vehicles and the impact of supply change disruptions, which may occur from time to time.\nAlso, our ability to maintain vehicle margins and implement and maintain expense controls and maintain sufficient liquidity to operate.\nThose risks and other risks are described in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission over the last 12 months.\nCopies of these filings are available from both the SEC and the company.\nAs required by applicable SEC rules, the company provides reconciliations of any such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on its website.\nI'd now like to take the time -- to take -- hand the call over to Earl.\nI'm pleased to report that for the quarter, Group one generated adjusted net income of $103 million.\nThis equates to adjusted earnings per share of $5.57 per diluted share, an increase of 236% over the prior year and an increase of 170% over the pre-pandemic first quarter of 2019.\nOur adjusted net income results exclude noncore items of $1.7 million of after-tax disaster pay provided to employees who couldn't work during our February Texas store closures partially offset by an $800,000 after-tax benefit from legal settlements and a $200,000 after-tax net gain on dealership and real estate transactions.\nThese profit results were particularly impressive given the fact that our Texas operations, which typically represent around 40% of our total revenues, were severely impacted due to a record-setting February winter weather event.\nOur stores effectively lost about the equivalent of a full week of business.\nIt is likely that vehicle sales were largely deferred into subsequent months, but the available service shop hours were permanently lost.\nAlso the U.K. remained under lockdown throughout the entire first quarter.\nWith so many restrictions in all our markets in 2020, it was difficult to generate revenue growth.\nThis improvement was driven by new and used vehicle revenue increases in the U.S., of well over 20% in the first quarter.\nOf course, we should remember that the pandemic did start to negatively impact traffic and sales during the second half of March last year.\nBut the important fact is that consumer demand for vehicles in the U.S. remains extremely strong and hit an even higher year in March.\nIt is true that sales have and will be hampered to a certain degree by low inventory levels.\nBut this continues to support above-average margin levels.\nDaryl will speak more about our inventory situation shortly.\nOur aftersales business has suffered throughout the pandemic from less driving and a variety of lockdown conditions in all our markets.\nIn particular, our U.S. business started 2021 very slowly in January and February, but exploded in March.\nAgain, Daryl, will provide more detail, but this gives us great confidence that we will enjoy very strong parts and service business this spring and summer in both the U.S. and also likely the U.K. as those facilities are now completely open.\nIn the U.S., we are especially pleased that our service results have now returned to pre-pandemic levels.\nOn a same-store basis, our U.S. total aftersales gross profit increased 3% versus the first quarter of 2019, and customer paid gross profit increased 14% over that same pre-pandemic time period.\nThese are very encouraging signs for continued aftersales improvement in 2021.\nDaryl will provide more detail on our U.S. results in a moment.\nRelative to the U.K., mandatory lockdowns began on November 5, 2020, and lasted through the entire first quarter.\nThey have since been lifted as of April 12.\nLike the U.S., our U.K. operations have shifted heavily to online selling via our Acceleride platform since our showrooms have been closed for five months.\nDespite not having the benefit of physical sales departments, or the ability to conduct test drives, we were able to deliver over 13,000 new and used vehicles during the quarter.\nLimited new vehicle availability increased our same-store new vehicle margins by 160 basis points to 5.6% during the first quarter.\nOur aftersales margin increased by almost 400 basis points to 58.4% as most service work at our dealerships was heavy repair work as customers chose to defer routine maintenance until after the lockdown.\nThe strong new vehicle and aftersales margins combined with strong cost discipline, evidenced by an 1,800 basis point same-store SG&A improvement over last year, enabled us to generate a meaningful level of profit in the U.K. despite closed showrooms.\nAs we were permitted to open showrooms again on April 12, we've seen very strong sales and service traffic levels back in our dealerships.\nThis gives us a high level of confidence in our U.K. business during the remainder of 2021.\nA number of factors contributed to our outstanding U.S. first quarter results, namely, new and used vehicle sales growth, aftersales growth and continued strong cost discipline, all of which are a continuation of the trends from the second half of 2020.\nCompared to the pre-pandemic first quarter of 2019, our same-store new and used unit sales increased by 11% and 5%, respectively.\nThis 11% increase in new outperformed the retail industry.\nU.S. new vehicle inventory levels finished the quarter at 14,500 units, of 34 days supply.\nWe anticipate inventories remaining tight and we'll continue to adjust our operations as necessary.\nOur same-store used vehicle unit sales improved sequentially by 14%, along with a 5% growth over the first quarter of 2019.\nUsed inventories remain constrained as well.\nHowever, we've made a number of changes in our merchandising, sourcing, reconditioning and acquisition processes that have resulted in higher velocity and better inventory return.\nAlthough we are around record high monthly levels of 90 units sold core rooftop, in the quarter, we continue to believe there is a great deal of opportunity in used vehicles in our dealerships going forward.\nThe second and most encouraging profit driver was our aftersales performance.\nWarranty and collision sales were still very depressed in January and February, but we saw improvement in March.\nOur customer pay business is very strong.\nAs Earl mentioned, our same-store CP customer pay gross profit was up 14% versus the first quarter of 2019.\nThis allowed us to grow total aftersales gross profit by 3% versus pre-pandemic levels, despite the significant headwinds in warranty and collision, both of which will reverse in time.\nWe saw a significant expansion in gross profit per repair order in the quarter, offsetting RO declines.\nIn March, traffic counts increased and our same-store customer pay RO count grew 23% versus March of 2020.\nWe foresee aftersales continuing to ramp-up in the near term.\nThe third major factor driving our outstanding profit performance was continued cost discipline.\nOur first quarter adjusted SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 63%, down from 74% in the pre-pandemic first quarter of 2019.\nPart of the decline is certainly due to higher vehicle margins, which we don't believe to be fully permanent, but a material part of the improvement is due to productivity gains.\nFor example, because of tools like Acceleride, our salespeople are more productive.\nBecause of our mix, the higher mix of flat rate techs, our techs are more productive.\nThese examples of permanent productivity gains will allow for us a significant ongoing reduction in our cost structure.\nI would like to provide another quarterly update on Acceleride, our digital retailing platform.\nWe continued our upward trajectory in the first quarter by selling a record 4,000 vehicles through Acceleride, an increase of 124% over the prior year and 7% of total retail units sold.\nCustomers choosing Acceleride continue to close at a much higher rate than our other sources.\nAdditionally, I would like to share with you a number of enhancements we have made or will make soon to the Acceleride platform.\nFirst, we've integrated real-time loan payoff quotes within the platform.\nSecond, we launched an Android App in addition to our existing Apple App.\nThird, customers now have the ability to toggle between English and Spanish.\nAnd fourth, in addition to be able to reserve a vehicle with a credit card, customers also now have the ability to process down payments for any amount directly through the app.\nAnd fifth, over the next couple of months, we will introduce dynamic delivery fees live within the customer workflow.\nThis will introduce delivery fees earlier in the process and include them in the monthly payment calculation based on the customer's delivery address.\nWe're also working through numerous other enhancements and will provide future updates as appropriate.\nWe believe our digital retailing process is second to none in the industry, and we continue making improvements to remain at the forefront of this transformative technology.\nTurning quickly to Brazil.\nDespite a 7% decline in new vehicle industry sales driven by tight inventories and additional COVID lockdowns, our team did a tremendous job of growing margins and aggressively thinning the cost structure in order to realize a very strong quarterly profit in what is seasonally the weakest quarter of the year.\nWe easily set a record for the most profitable first quarter over the entire eight years of Group 1's ownership and are well positioned to benefit from a sales rebound coming out of the pandemic.\nAs of March 31, we had $83 million of cash on hand and another $245 million invested in our floorplan offset accounts bringing total cash liquidity to $328 million.\nThere was also another $283 million of additional borrowing capacity on our U.S. syndicated acquisition line bringing total immediate liquidity to over $600 million.\nWe also generated $157 million of adjusted operating cash flow in the first quarter and $134 million of free cash flow after backing out capex.\nOur rent adjusted leverage ratio as defined by our U.S. syndicated credit facility which reduced to two times at the end of March, leaving plenty of flexibility for capital deployment.\nOn a net basis, which considers all U.S. cash on hand, our leverage was 1.6 times as of March 31.\nFinally, related to interest expense.\nOur quarterly floorplan interest of $7.6 million was a decrease of $5.3 million or 41% from the first quarter of 2020.\nThis decline was primarily driven by lower inventory levels and related borrowings.\nNon-floorplan interest expense decreased by $4.3 million or 24% from prior year, primarily due to the last year's bond debt refinancing.\nAs a reminder, we continue to manage our interest risk conservatively.\nWe have floorplan swaps averaging $550 million in place through 2026.\nWe also considering our mortgage swaps on bond debt, over 75% of our debt is at fixed rates.\nAs a result, a 100-basis point increase in interest rates would only have an approximate $0.20 negative impact on our annual EPS.\nOur balance sheet and liquidity position have never been stronger, and we look forward to growing the company through M&A.\nWe are seeing a strong flow of potential deals and anticipate closing or entering into contracts to acquire additional dealerships this year.\nRelated to our corporate development efforts, we previously announced the March acquisition of two Toyota franchises on Cape Cod that increased our new England platform to 10 stores and will contribute $120 million in incremental annual revenues.\nWe also previously announced the January dispositions of the Cadillac franchise in the Dallas-Fort Worth market area and a mini franchise in the El Paso market.\nWe've also since completed the termination of the U.K. Ford franchise in March and the disposition of a Mississippi Kia franchise in April.\nAs Daniel mentioned, we continue to prioritize external growth in our capital allocation process and we're optimistic that we will have beneficial opportunities as the year progresses.\nSummary: ",

versus the second quarter.\nIn the quarter, business transient room nights were roughly 75% of prior peak levels.\nGroup continued to lag but showed significant sequential improvement versus the second quarter, boosted by strength in social events.\nFor the quarter, group RevPAR was approximately 60% of 2019 levels, improving 21 percentage points from the second quarter.\nOverall systemwide RevPAR versus 2019 peaked in July at 85% with rates just shy of prior peaks.\nAs expected, recovery slowed modestly later in the quarter due to typical seasonality and customer mix shift, but overall trends remained solid.\nBoth August and September RevPAR achieved roughly 80% of 2019 levels, driven by continued strength in leisure and upticks in business travel post-Labor Day as offices and schools reopen.\nThese trends improved modestly into October with month-to-date RevPAR at approximately 84% of 2019 levels and rates in the U.S. nearly back to prior peaks.\nRoughly 40% of systemwide hotels have exceeded 2019 RevPAR levels in October month-to-date.\nAdditionally, bookings for all future periods are just 8% below 2019.\nWith loosening travel restrictions and strong nonresidential fixed investment forecast, we remain optimistic for future travel demand.\nTSA reported third quarter travel numbers were nearly 80% of 2019 with demand picking up further following the announcements of the U.S. border reopening and the lift of the international travel ban for vaccinated travelers.\nAdditionally, studies show that nearly 70% of U.S. businesses are back on the road, up 28 points from the end of the second quarter.\nWith roughly 80% of our typical corporate mix coming from small- and medium-sized businesses and with the lagging recovery of larger corporate travel, we've taken the opportunity to continue our work from before COVID to further increase our focus on this segment of demand.\nThis demand is higher rated, the more resilient -- resilient, which has helped us recover more quickly in business transient and should drive rate compression in the future as larger corporate travel picks up.\nOn the group side, our position for the rest of the year remains fairly steady with forward booking sentiment improving as variant concerns taper.\nAdditionally, the recent reopenings of some of our large urban properties, like the New York Hilton Midtown, increased our confidence in our positioning as group recovers.\nWe added nearly 100 hotels and 15,000 rooms across all major regions and delivered strong net unit growth of 6.6% in the third quarter.\nConversions represented roughly 1/3 of openings.\nYear-to-date, we've added more than 42,000 net rooms globally, higher than all our major branded competitors.\nOur performance reflects the success of our disciplined growth strategy, the strength of our brands, network effect and commercial engines across the world.\nIt also illustrates our increasing confidence in a strong recovery in global tourism in the months and years to come.\nDuring the quarter, we launched our large-scale franchise model in China, enabling independent owners to explore franchising opportunities with our Hilton Garden Inn brand with a prototype developed specifically for the Chinese market.\nTo date, we have signed more than 100 deals to develop Hilton Garden properties in China, strengthening our confidence in the long-term growth of our focused service brands and our ability to cater to a growing middle class.\nFollowing our recently announced exclusive license agreement with Country Garden, we were thrilled to open our first Home2 Suites in China with plans to grow to more than 1,000 properties.\nWe look forward to leveraging our partnership to capture the rapidly growing demand for mid-scale hotels in China.\nWe also celebrated the opening of our 500th Home2 Suites following the brand's launch just 10 years ago, making it one of the fastest-growing brands in industry history and boasting the industry's largest pipeline in North America with more than 400 hotels in development.\nOur luxury and lifestyle footprints also continued to expand globally with the debut of the Canopy by Hilton in Spain and the highly anticipated opening of the Mango House LXR in the Seychelles.\nMarking another important milestone in its global expansion, LXR celebrated its debut in Asia Pacific with the opening of the ROKU KYOTO.\nIn the quarter, we signed nearly 24,000 rooms, up approximately 40% year-over-year, driven by strength in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions.\nDriving our positive momentum in luxury, we announced the signing of the Conrad Los Angeles, the brand's first property in California.\nThe 300-room hotel is expected to open in 2022 as part of The Grand LA mixed-use development.\nWith approximately 404,000 rooms in development, more than half of which are under construction, we expect positive development trends to continue, driven by both new development and conversion opportunities.\nFor the full year, we expect net unit growth in the 5% to 5.5% range, and we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth for the next several years.\nFor our guests, flexibility has always been important, but the pandemic has made choice and control even more critical.\nWe were excited to launch several new commercial programs and loyalty extensions, including the launch of Digital Key Share, a first for a major hospitality company.\nThis feature allows more than one guest to have access to their room's digital key.\nAdditional technology enhancements have enabled our elite Honors members to begin enjoying automatic room upgrades.\nGold and Diamond members may be notified of a complementary upgrade prior to arrival, enabling guests to choose their upgraded room directly by using the Hilton Honors app.\nWe continue to focus on new opportunities to further engage our 123 million Honors members and are thrilled to see engagement is nearly back to 2019 levels.\nIn the quarter, membership grew 11% year-over-year.\nHonors members accounted for 59% of occupancy with the U.S. at 66%, just two points below 2019 levels.\nDuring the pandemic, approximately 23 million U.S. households brought home a new pet, including my own.\nAnd like so many others, my family loves traveling with our new dog, Miller.\nIn the coming months, Homewood Suites will join Home2 in becoming 100% pet-friendly in the U.S. with plans for all limited service brands to be pet-friendly by the first quarter of next year.\nOur guests are eager to travel with their furry little friends.\nAnd by making that simpler, we're able to capture demand and bring new business into the system.\nAs the global travel environment improves, I continue to be impressed by our team members' dedication to providing exceptional experiences to our guests.\nThat's why I am particularly proud that, last week, we were named the number three World's Best Workplace by Fortune and Great Place to Work.\nAfter six consecutive years of being ranked, Hilton was the only hospitality company on the list.\nWe truly believe that Hilton continues to be an engine of opportunity for all of our stakeholders around the world and are very optimistic for the future.\nDuring the quarter, systemwide RevPAR grew 98.7% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis as the recovery continued to accelerate, driven by strong leisure demand, particularly in the U.S. and across Europe.\nPerformance was driven by both occupancy and rate growth.\nAs Chris mentioned, systemwide RevPAR was down 18.8% compared to 2019.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $519 million in the third quarter, up 132% year-over-year.\nResults reflect the broader recovery in travel demand.\nManagement and franchise fees grew 93%, driven by strong RevPAR improvement and Honors license fees.\nAdditionally, results were helped by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels.\nOur ownership portfolio performed better than expected in the third quarter, driven by the accelerating recovery in Europe, the Tokyo Olympics and ongoing cost controls.\nFor the quarter, diluted earnings per share, adjusted for special items, was $0.78.\nTurning to our regional performance.\nThird quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 105% year-over-year and was down 14% versus 2019.\nRobust leisure demand and improving business transient trends drove strong performance in July.\nTrends modestly slowed later in the quarter due to seasonality.\nU.S. occupancy averaged nearly 70% for the quarter with overall rate largely in line with 2019 levels.\nIn the Americas outside the U.S., third quarter RevPAR increased 168% year-over-year and was down 30% versus 2019.\nThe region benefited from easing travel restrictions and strong leisure demand over the summer period.\nCanada also saw a noticeable step-up in demand in August after reopening their borders to vaccinated Americans.\nIn Europe, RevPAR grew 142% year-over-year and was down 35% versus 2019.\nTravel demand accelerated across the region in the third quarter as vaccination rates increased and international travel restrictions loosened.\nIn the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 110% year-over-year and was down 29% versus 2019.\nPerformance benefited from strong domestic leisure demand and international inbound travel from Europe.\nIn the Asia Pacific region, third quarter RevPAR grew 5% year-over-year and was down 41% versus 2019.\nRevPAR in China was down 25% as compared to 2019 as a rise in COVID cases led to reimposed restrictions and lockdowns across the country.\nChina has recovered steadily into October with occupancy nearing 60% for the month.\nIn the rest of the Asia Pacific region, prolonged lockdowns in Australia and New Zealand offset upside from the Tokyo Olympics.\nAs Chris mentioned, in the third quarter, we grew net unit 6.6%.\nOur pipeline grew sequentially, totaling 404,000 rooms at the end of the quarter with 62% of pipeline rooms located outside the U.S. Development activity continues to gain momentum across the globe as the recovery progresses, a testament to the confidence owners and developers have in our strong commercial engines and industry-leading brands.\nFor the full year, we now expect signings to increase in the mid- to high teens range year-over-year and expect net unit growth of 5% to 5.5%.\nTurning to the balance sheet.\nWe ended the quarter with $8.9 billion of long-term debt and $1.4 billion in total cash and cash equivalents.\nWe're proud of the financial flexibility we demonstrated over the past 18 months.\nAnd looking ahead, we remain confident in our balance sheet management as we continue to progress through the recovery and move closer toward our target leverage.\nWe would now like to open the line for any questions you may have.\n[Operator Instructions] Chad, can we have our first question, please?\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:On the call today are Jeff Jones, our President and CEO, and Tony Bowen, our CFO.\nSome of the figures that we'll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis.\nSuch statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance.\nAs a result, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially.\nYou can learn more about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2020 and our other SEC filings.\nDuring Q&A, we ask that participants limit themselves to one question with a follow-up, after which they may choose to jump back into the queue.\nWe hope that you and your families are staying safe and healthy in these unprecedented times.\nWe're also saddened by the senseless acts of racial injustice which continue to plague our country and has tragically taken lives.\nWe are committed to continue building a culture of belonging at H&R Block and doing our part in our communities to help bring about needed change.\nFirst, I'll discuss how we've responded since the start of the pandemic.\nI'll then provide our perspective on the industry in our results followed by thoughts on how we are executing the remainder of the tax season.\nI'll next discuss Wave, including an exciting new product that began rolling out to more small business owners last week.\nFinally, I'll share perspectives on our future and Tony will review our fiscal '20 results, capital allocation and thoughts on fiscal '21.\nThe pandemic has created business challenges beyond anything we've experienced.\nOur financial results have been impacted.\nWe've drawn our full line of credit and we've demonstrated agility and innovation, quickly making dramatic changes to our operating model to continue to serve clients.\nAnd in doing so, we've accelerated our efforts to transform H&R Block.\nNever has our purpose been more important as we help consumers gain access to their much needed refunds and assist small business owners as they navigate the financial uncertainty caused by the pandemic.\nIn mid-March, as the spread of the virus began to impact our business, we quickly turned to our crisis playbook, which enabled us to effectively and efficiently react to an extremely challenging situation.\nIn our retail locations, virtually every state pursued lockdown policies that both affected our ability to operate and prevented people from leaving home to be served the way they want it.\nAt the peak, nearly 20% of our office network was closed to the public.\nFor those offices that remained open, we made dramatic changes by limiting in-person service including requiring drop-off in nearly half the network and increasing the use of our virtual capabilities.\nIn short, our obligation to follow local orders is subject to far greater scrutiny than local independents.\nRegardless of how we operated, one of our top priorities has been providing for the health and safety of our associates, franchisees and clients, while helping clients access their refunds.\nThe teams worked diligently to keep our offices clean, followed social distancing protocols and complied with ever-changing city and state guidelines.\nBecause of these changes, bringing digital solutions to our clients became more important than ever.\nAs you may recall, coming into this year, our primary objective was to digitally enable every aspect of our business to deliver our expertise to consumers in new and exciting ways.\nThese efforts have been instrumental in allowing us to meet the needs of our clients using methods we didn't have in the past.\nWe have seen a dramatic increase in returns, leveraging our digital capabilities, including Tax Pro Go, Tax Pro Review and Approve Online feature.\nApprove Online allows filers to review their returns, approve it and pay their fees off from their mobile device.\nWith a significant portion of our clients historically visiting offices more than once to complete their returns, this capability provides tremendous convenience, especially during these uncertain times.\nWe also enhanced our digital capabilities for our tax pros because many of them couldn't serve clients from our offices.\nWithin two weeks, we stood up a work-from-home model, allowing thousands of tax pros to prepare returns without having to come into the office.\nThis capability will be invaluable moving forward.\nOur efforts during this crisis to continue to meet the needs of clients, digitally enable our business, and serve our clients however they want, has led to strong feedback with service quality scores improving 2 points in Assisted and 5 points in DIY building on significant increases in both areas in fiscal '19.\nBeyond taking care of our clients, we also took significant measures to take care of our associates.\nOur tax pros are our greatest asset and I'm proud of the investment we made to create a leading benefit program for our seasonal associates if they were directly impacted.\nAnd finally, I'm also proud of how we've responded in our continuing commitment to our communities.\nWe joined the American Express 'Stand for Small' coalition in support of small businesses.\nAt Wave, we provided instant payouts to all of our payments customers for free to give them instant access to their money.\nAnd we offered free tax preparation to frontline workers through Tax Pro Go in May and June, which received overwhelmingly positive feedback.\nWith this context on our operations, I'd like to spend a minute on what we're seeing in the industry as a result of the pandemic, as well as our results.\nIndustry returned volume has been unusual due to the filing extension as well as the stimulus package.\nThrough June 5, the IRS reported total filings down 6%.\nThe IRS's volume includes millions of returns completed by those who typically don't file.\nThey did so this year to receive stimulus payments.\nWe believe the vast majority of these returns were completed through the IRS's fillable form site, which is inflating the number of DIY returns in the market.\nExcluding these returns, we estimate DIY e-files are down approximately 4% compared to Assisted e-files, down 15% through June 5.\nWe expect this gap to moderate toward the end of the tax season and we'll provide more thoughts during our Q1 call.\nWith respect to our volumes in DIY, we've maintained relatively flat shares through early June.\nIn Assisted, we had share gains through the end of April, but are seeing that moderate in this extended filing season.\nIt's important to recognize that an extension like this has never happened in U.S. history.\nSo there is no precedent for forecasting consumer behavior.\nDespite states beginning to reopen, there is no business as usual.\nWe have more offices open and have expanded our hours of operation compared to a typical first quarter but a substantial portion of these locations are not serving clients in the office.\nInstead, we continue to interact with our clients either virtually or through drop-off.\nAnd while we have more tax pros working than normal this time of year, it is far less than the number we would have at the end of a typical tax season in April.\nFor these reasons, client volumes may be impacted.\nAs such, we've updated our marketing plans for the quarter to make sure consumers know we're open and to help them understand the variety of drop-off and digital options we have available.\nWe're doing this through multiple channels to make sure we appropriately target those who haven't filed.\nIn addition to the help we're providing consumers, we're also doing everything we can to help small business owners during this difficult time.\nWe've added a free Small Business Resource Center on our website to provide regular updates on government assistance programs.\nAdditionally, in May, we launched our recovery action plan service, which helps entrepreneurs navigate the CARES Act, including loan programs and tax credits.\nThis is another great example of leveraging our human advantage.\nTurning to Wave, after posting strong results of over 40% revenue growth through mid-March, we've seen flat revenues in April and May as small businesses were impacted by the pandemic.\nWe've taken measures to ensure we are limiting operating losses at Wave without sacrificing key investments in the business.\nDespite these actions, we expect the near term performance and resulting valuation of the business to be negatively impacted similar to many other businesses during this pandemic.\nAs such, we have recorded a non-cash impairment of goodwill which Tony will talk about later.\nWhile there has been a short term impact on the business, we remain confident in the long term viability and future growth of Wave.\nOne reason for this confidence is Wave's innovation and the pipeline of valuable products and services we are working on for the future.\nA great example of this is Wave Money, which was expanded to more customers last week.\nWave Money is a business bank account that does what others can't, manage all aspects of bookkeeping automatically, giving entrepreneurs more time to focus on their business.\nThis is the first to market, software-powered small business bank account, which provide several unique benefits to Wave customers including no monthly fees or minimums, seamless integration to Wave's accounting platform for expense categorization and tax readiness and instant access to funds via Wave payments.\nWe are excited about this product as we continue to innovate to simplify the lives of small business owners.\nIn summary, as we navigate this new normal, we haven't lost sight of what we've accomplished this year making significant progress toward our strategic objectives in ways we couldn't have anticipated.\nWe are taking this opportunity to thoroughly and objectively evaluate our progress, determine what we can do better and to reinforce our sense of urgency in these efforts.\nWe remain committed to continuing the transformation of our business.\nWe're in the process of evaluating and reprioritizing our strategic imperatives, while simultaneously, examining our expense structure to identify areas where we can save to help fund the future.\nThis work is ongoing and will remain fluid given our current operating environment.\nWe'll be providing more detail later this year.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Tony.\nThe last time we spoke, we were on track to deliver on our outlook for the tax season in the fiscal year.\nHowever, like most companies, the pandemic has negatively impacted our business and financial performance.\nBecause of the timing of the pandemic aligned with the time in our fiscal year in which we recognize the majority of our revenue, we withdrew our fiscal year '20 financial outlook.\nAs such, I won't be detailing our performance against those expectations as I normally would.\nI will, however, provide insights regarding our fiscal year '20 financial results, how we see the remainder of the tax season impact in our financial performance in fiscal '21 and actions we're taking to enable continued investment for future growth.\nIn fiscal '20, we recognized revenues of $2.6 billion, representing a 14.7% decline from the prior year, driven by lower tax return volumes as a result of the extension of the federal tax filing deadline, partially offset by the contribution of Wave.\nRegarding expenses, total operating expenses increased 3.4%, driven entirely by the impairment of Wave goodwill and Wave's operating expenses.\nExcluding Wave, our total operating expenses would have declined, though at a lower percentage than the decline in revenue due to legal fees, COVID-19 related benefits, and planned investments in technology.\nWe recorded a $106 million non-cash goodwill impairment at Wave due to the pandemic and its impact on small businesses.\nAs Jeff mentioned, we've been pleased with Wave's performance since the acquisition with solid growth through mid-March.\nHowever, revenue growth has slowed during the pandemic, which has impacted the invoicing and payments volume of small businesses.\nWe remain confident in Wave's future and in our ability to continue to deliver tremendous value to small business owners through Wave's innovative platform.\nTurning to the rest of the income statement, interest expense increased by $9 million.\nApproximately half of this increase was due to higher draws on our line of credit during the normal course of the business through our fiscal third quarter, while the other half was due to additional interest associated with the $2 billion draw in late March.\nThe changes in revenue and expenses resulted in a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $3 million.\nGAAP earnings per share was positive at $0.03 due to favorable discrete tax items.\nAdjusted earnings per share, which excludes the impact of the impairment and amortization of intangibles related to Wave and tax office acquisitions, was $0.84.\nIn discontinued operations, there were no changes to accrued contingent liabilities related to Sand Canyon during the year.\nI'll now turn to capital allocation and the balance sheet.\nDespite the unique circumstances related to COVID-19, our capital allocation priorities remain the same.\nAt the top of the list is maintaining adequate liquidity for our operational needs.\nOur current liquidity position remains strong as we ended the year with $2.7 billion in cash, which includes the full $2 billion drawn on our line of credit.\nAs we announced in late March, we believe we have sufficient funds to support the business at the start of tax season '21.\nOur line of credit is subject to various conditions including a covenant, which requires us to maintain a debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.5 times on April 30.\nBased on our fiscal year '20 financial results, we did not meet this covenant, but we have secured a waiver with our lenders with no changes to the terms of our line of credit.\nAfter ensuring adequate liquidity, we then made strategic investments back into the business that we believe will drive sustainable growth, ultimately benefiting our shareholders.\nAs Jeff mentioned, given the pandemic's impact to our business, we have undertaken a review of our expense structure to eliminate any unnecessary spend in order to continue funding the initiatives that will fuel future growth.\nI'll talk about these expense measures in a moment.\nThe last step of our capital allocation process is to deploy excess capital through quarterly dividends and share repurchases.\nI'm pleased to announce that despite the financial impact of COVID-19 and the extended tax season, our Board of Directors has declared a $0.26 per share dividend payable July 1.\nWe've never missed a dividend payment since going public in 1962.\nWe remain committed to performing an annual review of the dividend after each fiscal year.\nWith respect to share repurchases, in fiscal '20, we repurchased a total of 10.1 million shares for $247 million at an average price of $24.36.\nWe made no share repurchases in the fourth quarter.\nFor the past two years, we have committed to, at a minimum, repurchasing shares to offset dilution from equity grants and opportunistic share repurchases thereafter.\nGiven the uncertainty created by COVID-19, we have not yet determined our share repurchase approach for fiscal '21.\nI'll now discuss our thoughts on -- regarding fiscal '21.\nAs a reminder, last year, we provided our fiscal year financial outlook on our Q4 call.\nGiven, we haven't yet completed the current tax season and there remains uncertainty due to the pandemic, we will not be providing a financial outlook at this time.\nInstead, we plan to provide a tax season recap on our first quarter call in September and our full financial outlook for fiscal '21 on our second quarter call in December.\nLet me provide some high-level thoughts on how we expect to close out the tax season and our efforts to mitigate cost increases as a result of the extension.\nFirst, while it's natural to expect all volume loss in Q4 of fiscal '20 to shift into the first quarter of fiscal '21, that may not necessarily be the case.\nAs Jeff mentioned, during this quarter, we are still operating under a modified model.\nWhile we have more offices open than usual, we are still operating with just half of our total network and a substantial portion unable to serve clients face to face.\nThis may impact our ability to retain clients and attract new clients to the brand.\nRegarding expenses, due to the extension of the tax season, we anticipate additional cost during the first quarter.\nWe expect an increase of approximately $10 million in marketing expense and approximately $10 million in interest expense.\nAdditionally, we expect variable expenses related to compensation benefits and bad debt to be approximately 40% of incremental Assisted revenues generated.\nWe are actively evaluating ways to mitigate any additional cost by taking a detailed look at all spend categories and making prudent reductions across our business.\nWe're still in the process of finalizing these plans but I can offer a few areas of focus, including renegotiating rents with landlords across our retail footprint, implementing a hiring freeze, eliminating merit increases for fiscal '21, examining vendor spend to renegotiate existing contracts, and reducing capital expenditures to only what is necessary.\nIn addition to these savings, we have entered into a non-binding letter of intent with MetaBank to be the provider of our financial products, including Refund Transfer, Refund Advance, Emerald Advance and Emerald Card, which will result in savings.\nMetaBank is a leader in providing financial solutions to consumers and have significant experience in the tax preparation industry.\nWe're excited to partner with them to continue providing valuable products to our clients.\nIn summary, we've taken prudent steps to adjust to the pandemic, including our modified operating model, line of credit draw, and cost reduction efforts.\nThese measures will allow us to operate effectively, while enabling continued investments in our future.\nWe've been challenged during the last few months unlike any other time in our history.\nThe resilience and dedication of our team, our strong financial foundation, and our ability to adjust our operating model has enabled us to continue delivering tremendous value to our clients at a time when they need us most.\nI am confident we'll come out of this crisis stronger than ever as we continue the work to transform our business.\nI look forward to speaking with you in September.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Neil, you may begin.\nBefore turning it over to Ash to provide some further details on our recent capital raise, the newly amended credit facility and what we are seeing in our portfolio year-to-date and through the first quarter.\nThe conclusion of the fourth quarter closes the most challenging year in Hersha's history.\nAnd our above property team members, many here in our offices today, enabled us to remain nimble, make prudent decisions and execute multiple levers to provide financial flexibility for the foreseeable future.\nJay, Ash and I stand it out on our team shoulders as we share some good news today.\nWe begin 2021 with optimism toward the recovery as the rollout of vaccinations gains momentum and more and more people choose to travel.\nJanuary started off stronger than we anticipated for our portfolio returning to greater than $60 RevPAR with South Florida and Washington DC offsetting lock downs on the West Coast and the Northeast.\nWe had our first month of hotel level positive EBITDA in January, and we are encouraged with February performance to date.\nThe booking pace for President's Day weekend across the portfolio was the strongest since the pandemic one year ago.\nWe agree that leisure demand aided by continued government stimulus will again come first, but with significantly more pent-up demand than was actualized last summer.\nWe are also encouraged by data from the airlines.\nMost corporate accounts anticipate returning to at least 50% of pre-COVID travel by the end of 2021 and more than 40% of these accounts expect a full recovery in corporate travel by 2022.\nThe return of leisure travel will kick-start this year's recovery to be sure, but the industry should see meaningful acceleration with the return of business travel, which we believe could begin as early as the second quarter and ramp up through the back half of the year.\nDrive-to resorts have been our strongest performers since the inception of the pandemic.\nThis portfolio of hotels is about 25% of our pre-pandemic EBITDA, had a weighted average occupancy nearing 40% and realized ADR growth of 2% for the full year 2020.\nGovernment mandated shutdowns in California impacted performance in December and January for our coastal California properties, but we are seeing immediate improvement in February with the lifting of these restrictions.\nNot only have leisure travelers returned, but we are also seeing early signs of business and small group activity.\nNew corporate accounts for near-term projects and deposits for spring and fall weddings are building a base at the Sanctuary Beach Resort and Hotel Milo.\nAcross the country in Key West the Parrot Key Hotel and Villas was our best performing asset during the fourth quarter, generating 55% occupancy and 8.4% year-over-year ADR growth to $306 for the period.\nThe holiday weeks were especially strong, most notably the period between Christmas and New Year's which had greater than 90% occupancy and saw ADR exceed 2019 levels at the hotel.\nWe are expecting several strong quarters ahead at this exceptionally positioned resort.\nOur largest asset the Cadillac Hotel and Beach Club on Miami Beach is seeing increased demand on weekends entering special events, generating occupancies approximating 90% with rate on pace to improve incrementally throughout the balance of the quarter.\nMomentum has been has been building year-to-date in Miami from leisure demand, and recent announcements around major corporate relocations highlight the tremendous draw to the region, which leaves us optimistic for this year's recovery and substantial market growth for years to come.\nUrban destinations were essentially shut down from March to September of last year and then again from November through January.\nWe believe that the reopening of museums, national parks, theaters, sports venues and more bars and restaurants in the coming months will lead to a pickup in both pent up leisure and business demand to our great cities.\nAs travel begins to resume, which we have already seen in warmer climates such as South Florida and even at our lifestyle hotels up north over President's Day weekend, our unique portfolio provides us multiple levers to capture market share while continuing to operate in a cost-efficient manner as occupancy builds toward normalization.\nWashington DC has been a very strong performing market, despite the significantly abbreviated inauguration activity.\nAlthough the public was unable to attend the event the St Gregory Hotel contracted with media outlets including CBS, BBC and Al Jazeera.\nThe Hilton Garden Inn, M Street and the Hampton Inn Mason serve the men and women of the National Guard who were deployed to the city leading up to and through the event.\nThe Ritz Carlton Georgetown was able to hold a $1,000 ADR for the peak nights for the few leisure guests in town.\nWashington has begun 2021 on strong footing ending January with portfolio revenues more than double our expectations at the beginning of the month.\nThe new presidential administration is expected to lead through a pickup in activity among the lobbying, federal government and diplomatic segments, and we are also looking forward to the upcoming Cherry Blossom Festival in the coming quarter.\nOne of our better performing markets during the fourth quarter from our forecast perspective was our New York City portfolio, finishing the quarter with close to 40% occupancy, which came in spite of having few leisure oriented attractions open in the city.\nWe continue to see strong performance from our JFK submarket, but also saw an uptick in first responder business at our Brooklyn and lower Manhattan asset.\nThese customers, the New York Fire and Police Departments and a few medical groups continue to get rest at the new hotel Brooklyn and the Hampton Inn Seaport resulting in January occupancy of 97% and 51% respectively.\nAlthough this business is transitory and related to the ongoing COVID-19 spread we are grateful that these frontline workers are able to utilize our hotels to stay safe and guide us through this homestretch of this pandemic.\nUrban market recovery is not only driven by vaccine distribution and the return of business and international travel, but as meaningfully enhanced with reductions or deterioration of supply.\nIn markets around the country aging hotels are being rendered obsolete the Wardman Park in D.C, the Embassy Suites in Philadelphia, the Buckminster in Boston.\nNew York more than anywhere else consultants of forecasted an array of figures regarding the permanent supply reduction in New York.\nIt may not actualize as high as 25% as some of predicted, but the confirmed closures in 2020 alone provide a concrete realism that the supply will contract.\nAdding to this is the newly announced proposal requiring special permits for new hotels and expansions in zoning districts throughout the city by the Department of Planning.\nPublic hearings on this proposal have commenced, and if passed will materially impact hotel construction across the five boroughs and provide a significant tailwind for hotel owners for years to come.\nBefore Ash takes a deeper dive into our balance sheet and burn rates, I want to spend a few minutes on our capital allocation strategy and sources of additional liquidity.\nAs we've outlined on our previous earnings calls, dispositions represented the lowest cost of capital as we considered alternatives to raise liquidity and increase our financial flexibility.\nWe ran wide and robust marketing processes with multiple brokers beginning this fall.\nOur strong locations in major gateway markets attracted tremendous interest from private equity firms, family offices and residential developers.\nThese were fee-simple hotels that have remained open throughout the pandemic unencumbered of management and onerous labor contracts, many were unencumbered of brand, all of which made the bidding process quite competitive.\nOur goal is to generate $150 million to $200 million in proceeds from asset sales to pay down our senior credit facility.\nThe 6 recently announced asset sales will generate net proceeds of approximately $191 million.\nThe Sheraton Wilmington closed in December while the Courtyard San Diego closed last week.\nThe residents in Coconut Grove, Capitol Hill Hotel Washington and Holiday Inn Express Cambridge are all expected to close by the end of the first quarter, while the sale of the Duane Street Hotel is slated to close in early Q2.\nMany of these hotels represented those with capital intensive projects on the horizon and the successful completion of these sales will lower our capex budget by approximately $20 million over the coming years.\nAs part of a long-term capital recycling strategy, the dispositions achieve liquidity and flexibility at a reasonable cost.\nWe transacted at a discount to pre-COVID value, but we focused our sales on mature hotels, hotels that we don't for nearly 10 years, hotels that would require additional capital investment during the recovery, and the slowest growth hotel in each of our geographic clusters.\nThe successful sale of these hotels marginally improves the absolute RevPAR and EBITDA per key of the remaining portfolio, but meaningfully enhance this portfolio quality, EBITDA growth rate and reduces capex spending and disruption at these assets in the recovery.\nWe were also pleased to announce last week and fund just yesterday our strategic financial commitment with affiliates of Goldman Sachs Merchant Bank providing a $150 million unsecured term loan, which can be expanded to $200 million.\nThis capital infusion in conjunction with asset sales led to the successful amendment of our credit facility, extending our covenant waiver until June 2022 and eliminating term loan maturities in 2021.\nWe are pleased to have cleared the runway and provided the financial flexibility to focus on the ramp up of our portfolio in the coming year.\nAs we've discussed on prior calls and in investor meetings, we've been steadfast in our approach to capital allocation.\nConsidering the cash flow profile and liquidity of our assets and the upcoming recovery and travel and lodging, we were loads to pursue a transaction that would be unnecessarily dilutive to shareholders or constrain our strategic alternatives in the future.\nFor this capital raise, we ran a fulsome process.\nWe were delighted with the depth and quality of investors interested in financing our portfolio and look forward to future transactions with many of them.\nUltimately, the Goldman Merchant Bank offered the prepayment flexibility to draw and pick features and importantly the potential for future partnership in the coming cycle.\nAs we navigate through the tail end of the crisis and into the recovery we remain bullish on our portfolio positions in the markets where we operate, innovation oriented urban gateway markets and regional resorts, a short drive away from them.\n2020 showcase the allure of drive-to resorts for all segments of the traveler, and we believe this trend will not go away soon, but we remind investors that innovation markets provided strong results prior to the pandemic, and these markets have the most to recover with the rollout of the vaccine.\nSince the pandemic Facebook and Google have expanded office space near our hotels on Manhattan's West side and our Tribeca, Union Square and Midtown East hotels will all have major new office developments opening in the coming years.\nAmazon announcing the addition of 3,000 jobs in the Boston Seaport, walking distance from our Envoy Hotel.\nOur Courtyard LA is well positioned in Culver City for the booming tech and studio related office growth [Indecipherable].\nPhiladelphia has attracted several new life science and pharma companies downtown in state-of-the-art new space.\nEven our locations in Miami are attracting new Class A office space, in Coconut Grove and on Miami Beach as there is increasing momentum from Northeastern asset management firms and West Coast technology firms.\nAll of this proving out the corporate expansion remains intact and will add to the already robust demand generators in our gateway markets, particularly for our carefully assembled submarkets and locations.\nOur disposition announcements this year should also reinforce the high quality nature of our portfolio.\nOur hotels are precisely the kind of hotel sophisticated investors seek.\nOur hotels have a high absolute RevPAR, while still producing sector-leading margins.\nThe hotels are young and purpose-built for today's traveler with minimal capex requirements for the foreseeable future.\nOur hotels are fee simple and have prepayable financing and have few management or brand encumbrances all located in the most valuable markets in the United States.\nOur portfolio has proven to be attractive to a vast buyer pool and still offers incredible operational and financial leverage to this recovery.\nAnd with the increased financial flexibility from our capital infusion and no near-term encumbrances following our credit facility amendment, we are able to focus on capturing market share and operating our hotels in a cost-efficient manner to drive cash flow.\nAs Neil mentioned, I'm going to do a deeper dive on our recently announced capital transactions, bank amendment, and their impact on our balance sheet and interest expense before closing with an update on our operating results and current outlook.\nLast week, we announced a strategic financing commitment with affiliates of Goldman Sachs Merchant Bank to provide a $150 million in unsecured notes, which can be upsized to $200 million at any point on or before September 30th of this year with a maturity date on the notes of February of 2026.\nWe successfully closed on this financing yesterday and look forward to furthering our partnership with GS's Merchant Bank.\nWhen we began our capital raising process earlier this year to provide us additional liquidity and optionality we prioritize two items, capital that was not dilutive to our equity and significant prepayment flexibility, and this bespoke solutions satisfied both of these key criteria and several others that we had prioritized.\nThis capital is unsecured and fully subordinated to our bank facility and allows us to defer cash interest on 50% of our financing for the first year, creating substantial near-term cash savings and providing us additional runway during this period of recovery.\nThis capital does not prohibit supplementary junior capital and allows us additional unsecured debt as long as we maintain compliance with certain incurrence test.\nThese unsecured notes do not place any further restrictions on our ability to operate the business or enter into strategic ventures that may be available to us.\nLast week, we also highlighted that we went under contract to sell two additional hotels, bringing our year-to-date total asset value of disposition to $178.5 million.\nThe successful closing closing of these sales in addition to the Sheraton Wilmington, which closed in December and the Duane Street Hotel, which is expected to close during the second quarter will generate total proceeds of $216 million, and following the repayment of the $25 million mortgage loan on the Capitol Hill Hotel net proceeds from these dispositions will amount to approximately $191 million, which we will utilize in tandem with the proceeds from our unsecured notes to pay off our 2021 term loan and reduce our overall debt by approximately $150 million.\nWith the resulting reduction of overall leverage and the payment in current feature of our unsecured notes we estimate that our cash interest expense will decrease by approximately $4 million in 2021, and that our total interest expense including the deferred interest from the notes will remain similar to our 2020 interest expense.\nWe completed these asset sales and closed on the unsecured notes placement contemporaneously with the amendment of our revolving credit facility, and we're very pleased with the continued support from our consortium of over 15 Bank group members.\nThe amendment eliminates all term loan maturities until August of 2022 and extends our covenant-waiver holiday with our next financial covenant test occurring on June 30th of 2022.\nThe first test will be applied to the annualized second quarter performance with the third quarter test annualizing the second and third quarter results and so on.\nThe amendment allows us to pay off the accrual of our preferred dividends and maintain quarterly preferred dividend distributions moving forward.\nAt this time, we anticipate clearing our accrual on the preferred dividends by the end of the first quarter.\nThe completion of these capital transactions allows us to continue to focus on our operational performance, and accretive opportunity that may emerge in the recovery.\nResults at our properties of incrementally improved over the past 6 weeks and ultimately led to the validation of our breakeven forecast during January, in what is seasonally the slowest month of the year our properties generated positive property-level cash flow during the month of January on 40% occupancy with RevPAR levels 60% below January of 2020.\nIn January, 20 of our 36 operational hotels broke even on the GOP line with 14 achieving EBITDA breakeven level.\nThese results represent a 75% increase and 40% increase in properties that broke even on the EBITDA line compared to November and December respectively.\nBased on January's results and our forecast for the first quarter, we are comfortable with our previous estimates that the entire portfolio breaks even at property level with GOP with a 60% RevPAR decline.\nAt the corporate level, our RevPAR breakeven occurs at a 40% decline.\nOur franchise operating strategy allows us to run our hotels in very lean labor models until improved demand warrants additional staffing.\nApplying various cost cutting strategies such as cross-utilizing management personnel and outsourcing and job-sharing within the hotel and across our clusters lowers our overall cost.\nThe model affords flexibility to continue to operate in current staffing levels at our breakeven occupancies approximating 30% up to 55% to 60% at some of the hotels.\nAs occupancies increased at our hotels we are seeing flow throughs as high as 70% on the GOP line, and as we push both rate and occupancy we anticipate maintaining them for the remainder of the year.\nThe flexibility of the model and the resulting cost efficiencies economically justified continuing operations at our urban independent resort destinations throughout the pandemic mitigating cash burn over the course of 2020.\nOur total property-level cash burn for the fourth quarter was $5.9 million and in January the property generated property-level cash flow for the first time since March of last year.\nCorporate cash burn of $4.3 million in January represents a 60% reduction compared to April of 2020 at the depths of the crisis.\nWe expect our February performance to be in line with January with March operating results projected to surpass that of January and February as the pace of vaccination distribution, using government restrictions, spring break travel and warm weather along the Northeast should yield increased bookings across the portfolio.\nBefore I close with comments regarding our balance sheet, a quick update on Hersha's relationship with our New York City joint venture partner Cindat Capital Management.\nAs you may recall, following our 2016 transaction where we sold a majority of this portfolio and in which we netted a gain of $213 million, we retained a subordinated minority interest in the portfolio, which was junior to thin debt to equity position.\nEarlier this month, the equity interest of that portfolio were transferred and we have no remaining equity interests or economic or legal commitments to the joint venture.\nWe removed these 7 hotels from our portfolio count and they will no longer be part of our operating results after the first quarter.\nWe ended the 4th quarter with $23.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and deposits.\nDuring the quarter we received $8.1 million dollars in business interruption proceeds from Hurricane Irma's impact on our South Florida portfolio, and these receivables had a positive impact on our AFFO performance in the quarter.\nWe spent $4.3 million on capital projects last quarter, bringing our 2020 spend to $26 million, approximately $15 million below our forecast at the beginning of the year.\nOur 2021 capex load will be primarily focused on maintenance capex and life safety renovation, and we anticipate it will be roughly 35% below our 2020 spent.\nAs we have very minimal capex moving forward after the $200 million we have spent on capital projects since 2017 and the recent disposition of lower growth, higher cost hotels our portfolio will experience very little disruption or capital spend for the coming years.\nThe unsecured note facility from Goldman Sachs Merchant Bank combined with the announced asset sale will be utilized to reduce our leverage, provide liquidity and pay off the accrual on our preferred dividends.\nThese actions increased our weighted average debt maturity to 3.6 years and resulted more than 88% of our debt being either fixed or swapped.\nOver the past year, we've taken aggressive and swift action to minimize our operational losses.\nWe successfully zero-based budgeting our hotels allowing for margin improvement well into the recovery.\nWe reopened all of our wholly owned hotels and we incrementally reduced our cash burn rate to the lowest it has been since the onset of the pandemic, all are a testament to our aggressive asset management and nimble franchise operating model.\nFollowing the strategic transactions announced last week we have right-sized the balance sheet and turned our focus to operational performance of the portfolio as demand reemerges and accretive opportunities become available across the recovery.\nThis concludes my portion of the call.\nWe can now proceed to Q&A, where we are happy to address any questions that you may have.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We hope you are all well.\nWe will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures.\nWe believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance.\nAt this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Philippe Krakowsky.\nI'll start with a high-level view of our performance in the quarter.\nEllen will then provide additional details.\nThen I'll conclude with updates on the highlights at our agencies, to be followed by Q&A.\nFirst and foremost, as Jerry said, I hope that you and your families are keeping well.\nAs we all know, around the world, the pandemic is still with us to a significant degree.\nWith all that entails, it bears mention that our people continue to navigate the many challenges, both personal and professional, presented by the health crisis.\nTheir extraordinary resilience and capacity for innovation, as well as their care for one another and their commitment to our clients, are inspiring.\nAgainst business conditions that continue to be demanding, our people have driven the solid growth and the high level of first quarter profitability that we are reporting today.\nTurning to those results, beginning with revenue, we are pleased with our start to the year.\nFirst quarter organic net revenue growth was 1.9%.\nThat reflects solid performance in the U.S., an organic decrease of 20 basis points, and strong international growth of 6.3%, with increases in every world region.\nIn the U.S., you'll recall that we are comparing to very strong underlying performance in the first quarter of 2020 when we faced headwinds of nearly 4% due to certain 2019 client losses that we previously identified.\nDomestically, during this year's first quarter, we saw increases in areas such as media, data services and technology and our healthcare specialist agencies.\nOur international performance was paced by 12.4% growth in Continental Europe, where we had a strong start to the year by our media, data and tech offerings as well as McCann Worldgroup.\nWorldwide, our healthcare and retail client sectors, which were consistent outperformers last year, were again our growth leaders in the first quarter.\nFrom the standpoint of our operating segments, Our IAN segment grew 3.2% organically, led by media, data and technology and by the healthcare specialty agencies.\nAs expected, in comparison to last year's largely pre-pandemic first quarter, global conditions in Q1 continued to weigh most heavily on the events and sports marketing disciplines and on certain project-driven businesses in both IAN and DXTRA.\nNonetheless, while the environment understandably retained a strong note of caution across our offerings and client sectors, the lows were generally not as low.\nClients are finding their footing amid a global economy that's increasingly showing signs of recovery.\nAs better days ahead begin to come into focus, conversations with clients have generally become more positive and constructive.\nTurning to operating expense and profitability.\nOur teams once again demonstrated outstanding discipline.\nGiven the uncertainty that prevailed in 2020, we made decisions and took a series of actions during the year, necessary, but in many cases, no less difficult, to ensure the long-term health of the overall business.\nOur expenses in the quarter reflect much of the benefits of the strategic restructuring executed over the course of last year, most notably, in our expenses for base payroll and occupancy.\nWe continue to be highly confident that, over time, we are well positioned to realize the full level of permanent operating expense savings that we've talked about previously, which, as a reminder, annualized at $160 million.\nAlong with a return to growth and the benefits of our restructuring actions, our Q1 results were further helped by variable expense categories that continue to run at very low level, given that many of our activities are still restricted by the pandemic.\nThese include significantly lower expenses for business travel and meetings as well as their associated costs.\nOur first quarter net income as reported was $92 million, which includes the expense of certain nonoperating items.\nOur adjusted EBITA was $266 million, a level which is approximately 2.5 times the first quarters of recent years.\nOur adjusted EBITA margin was 13.1%.\nDiluted earnings per share was $0.23 as reported and was $0.45 as adjusted mainly for our loss on the early extinguishment of debt, the disposition of certain small nonstrategic agencies, both of which are nonoperating expenses, and our expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles.\nDuring the quarter, we refinanced a portion of our outstanding debt on very favorable terms, while extending our debt maturity profile.\nThis level of financial flexibility positions us well in the event there is volatility as the global economy moves through a recovery.\nWe're pleased to be able to share with you these strong set of results, which build on our company's long-term record of industry outperformance and consistent margin expansion.\nIt bears mention that we continue to invest in our people and our capabilities and, as a result, to further differentiate our offerings in the areas of strongest opportunity and growth.\nThis has been particularly relevant since we are seeing growing client demand for technology and data services and amid accelerating transformational change in marketing and media.\nOur ability to create marketing and media solutions that bring together creativity, technology and data in order to solve for higher order client opportunities are what drove growth in the first quarter.\nGiven the complexity of the media and consumer landscape, marketers are looking for partners who can help them build their businesses through more precise, personalized and accountable engagements with individuals.\nWith the deprecation of third-party cookies, all businesses are increasingly focused on realizing value from their first-party data, who are finding partners with whom they can pool data assets.\nAs important, this needs to be done in a way that's respectful of people's privacy and anticipates likely regulatory development.\nWe remain well positioned to benefit from those opportunities.\nOf course, our first quarter is seasonally our smallest, and most of the year still remains ahead of us.\nWe also appreciate the heightened degree of business uncertainty as part of the current reality facing all companies until a business like ours translates into more challenging visibility to the full year.\nAs a result, we're staying very close to our people and our clients, asking our teams for frequent financial updates and continuing to carefully manage expenses.\nTo date, we're seeing cautious optimism from clients, and the tone of business has firmed in the last few months.\nReopenings, fiscal stimulus and vaccination programs in a number of our largest markets are providing a tangible lift to economic activity and marketing demand.\nAs we mentioned to you on our last call, we remain confident in those areas we can control, namely the strength and competitiveness of our offerings and the people and talent within our group.\nWe are seeing that the most contemporary services we provide are growing in terms of the receptivity from clients and prospects.\nGiven our strong start to the year, and based on the assumption that there'll continue to be a reasonably steady course of public health and global economic recovery, we believe that we can deliver organic growth for the full year in the range of 5% to 6%.\nWith that level of growth, we would expect to achieve 2021 adjusted EBITA margin of approximately 15.5%.\nAs such, we see this as another year of strong value creation for all our stakeholders.\nWe will, of course, keep you apprised of our progress as the year develops.\nOn that note, I'll hand the call over to Ellen for a more in-depth view on our results.\nI hope that everyone is safe and healthy.\nI would like to join Philippe in recognition and, candidly, admiration of our people for their terrific accomplishments under very difficult circumstances.\nFirst quarter adjusted EBITDA, before a small restructuring adjustment, was $265.9 million and margin was 13.1%.\nThese are levels that compare very favorably against any previous first quarter.\nWe returned to growth with variable expenses that are lagging the recovery in revenue, and we are additionally seeing the structural benefits of last year's restructuring program.\nDiluted earnings per share was $0.23 as reported and $0.45 as adjusted.\nThe adjustments exclude the after-tax impacts of the amortization of acquired intangibles, a small restructuring refinement, nonoperating losses on sales of certain small nonstrategic businesses and the nonoperating loss on the early extinguishment of debt.\nDuring the quarter, we refinanced $1 billion of senior notes that had been scheduled to mature over the next few years.\nWe placed the $1 billion in new notes maturing in 10- and 20-year tranches.\nThe timing of those transactions initiated in mid-February was favorable in light of the subsequent rise in market rates.\nWe appreciate and value the support and the reception that we received.\nAs you may have seen in late March, we also received upgrades to our outlook from both S&P and Fitch.\nTurning to slide three, you'll see our P&L for the quarter.\nI'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow.\nTurning to Q1 revenue on slide four.\nOur net revenue in the quarter was $2.03 billion, an increase of $55.6 million.\nCompared to Q1 2020, the impact of the change in exchange rates was positive 1.5%, with the dollar weaker against currencies in most of our largest markets.\nNet divestitures were negative 60 basis points.\nOur organic net revenue increase was 1.9%.\nAt the bottom of this slide, we break out segment revenue in the quarter.\nOur IAN segment was -- grew 3.2% organically, a terrific result against last year, largely non-COVID first quarter.\nWe saw solid growth by our offerings in media, data and tech at FCB and at McCann Worldgroup.\nAt IPG DXTRA, the organic change in the quarter was negative 4.8%, which reflects the weight of live events and sports marketing within the segment, the disciplines that have been most significantly impacted by the pandemic.\nWith that, DXTRA's performance was a sharp sequential improvement from the fourth quarter, especially in the public relations disciplines.\nMoving on to slide five, which is a look at our organic revenue change by region.\nIn the U.S., which was 65% of net revenue in the quarter, our organic decrease was 20 basis points against the challenging comparisons underlying our headline number from a year ago.\nCompared to Q1 2020, we did see continued pressure on events and sports as well as certain project work, as has been the case throughout the pandemic.\nInternational markets were 35% of our net revenue in the quarter and increased 6.3% organically.\nWe grew in every international region, which is a notable improvement from Q4.\nContinental Europe grew 12.4%, with increases in every major national markets, including Spain, Germany, Italy and France, driven by increased spend from existing clients.\nWith double-digit growth, there are a number of operating highlights in the region, including strong increases at media and tech and at McCann.\nThe U.K. increased 3.5% organically and, again, this is net of continuing headwinds in the events discipline We had solid growth at McCann at our media, data and tech offerings and at MullenLowe.\nAsia Pac grew 3.4% organically.\nAmong our largest regional markets, we had strong gains in Australia and Singapore, while China and India's revenues declined.\nOur organic growth in LatAm was 5%, with particularly strong results across Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and Chile.\nOur Other Markets group grew 7.3%, with notably strong performance in the Middle East.\nMoving on to slide six and operating expenses in the quarter.\nOur net operating expenses, excluding billable expenses and the amortization of acquired intangibles, decreased 6% from a year ago and to 2.8% growth of our net revenue.\nThe result was first quarter margin expansion to 13.1% from 4.9% a year ago.\nWe have significant year-on-year expense savings in a number of different categories, most notably our restructuring savings in payroll and occupancy and a sharp decrease in certain variable operating expenses.\nIn the latter category, I would call out specifically the sharply lower travel and related expenses, for the obvious reasons, and significantly reduced bad debt expense, which was at an increased level in the first quarter of 2020.\nAs you can see on this slide, our ratio of total salaries and related expense as a percentage of net revenue improved by 340 basis points to 68.7% compared with 72.1% a year ago.\nUnderneath that, we drove very strong leverage on our expense for base payroll, benefits and tax, which improved by 360 basis points.\nWe had a lower severance expense ratio, which was only 30 basis points of net revenue compared to 120 basis points in Q1 2020.\nAt quarter end, total worldwide headcount was approximate 51,200, a decrease of 6.1% from a year ago as a result of our restructuring and regular severance actions taken over the course of last year as well as our business dispositions.\nAlso on this slide, our office and other direct expense decreased as a percentage of net revenue by 480 basis points to 14.4%.\nWe continue to have significant decreases in our expenses for occupancy, driving year-on-year leverage of 110 basis points.\nWe leveraged all other office and other direct expense by 370 basis points, which includes the decreased expense for travel and bad debt.\nOur SG&A expense was 1.4% of net revenue, an increase of 30 basis points.\nOn slide seven, we present detail on adjustments to our reported first quarter results in order to provide better transparency and a picture of comparable performance.\nThis begins on the left-hand side with our reported results and steps through to adjusted EBITDA and our adjusted diluted EPS.\nOur expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles in the second column was $21.6 million.\nThe restructuring charges were $1.3 million.\nTo be clear, these are small adjustments to estimates related to our 2020 restructuring program that we concluded at the end of last year.\nBelow operating expenses, in column 3, we had a pre-tax loss in the quarter of $12.5 million in other expenses due to the disposition of a few small nonstrategic businesses.\nTo the right of that, our pre-tax loss due to the early extinguishment of debt was $74 million, which relates to the refinancing and extending the maturities of $1 billion of our senior notes.\nAt the front of the slide, you can see the after-tax impact per diluted share of each of these adjustments, which bridges our diluted earnings per share as reported at $0.23 to adjusted earnings of $0.45 per diluted share.\nOn slide eight, we turn to cash flow in the quarter.\nCash used in operations was $249.8 million compared with the use of $277.1 million in Q1 2020.\nAs a reminder, our operating cash flow is highly seasonal.\nWe typically generate significant cash from working capital in the fourth quarter and use cash in the first quarter.\nDuring this year's first quarter, cash used in working capital was $496.9 million and follows our fourth quarter of last year, where we generated over $1 billion from working capital.\nIn our investing activities, we used $28 million for capex in the quarter, which was essentially offset by the net proceeds from the sales of investments.\nOur financing activities in the quarter is $212.7 million, which reflects the redemption and issuance of long-term debt and our common stock dividends.\nOur net decrease in cash for the quarter was $492.7 million.\nSlide nine shows the current portion of our balance sheet.\nWe ended the quarter with $2.02 billion of cash and equivalents compared with $1.55 billion a year ago.\nUnder current liabilities, the current portion of long-term debt refer to our $500 million, 3.75% senior notes, which matures in October of this year.\nWe plan on repaying these notes from cash on hand.\nSlide 10 depicts the maturities of our outstanding debt and our diversified and extended maturity schedule following our activity in the first quarter.\nAgain, we have the maturity in October this year and then only $250 million due in April 2024.\nThereafter, our next maturity is not until 2028.\nIn summary, on slide 11, our teams continue to execute at a high level in an unprecedented environment.\nAnd I would like to reiterate our pride in, and gratitude for, the efforts of our people.\nThe strength of our balance sheet and liquidity means that we remain well positioned, both financially and commercially.\nIt's worth repeating that Q1 is our smallest seasonal quarter, but nonetheless, we are pleased by our start to the year.\nThe return to organic revenue growth is a sign that our clients have begun to pivot to an investment mindset as they look to build their brands and grow their businesses in line with the broader economic recovery.\nOur performance is also a reflection of the strength of our people, our offerings and our long-term strategies that have helped us drive consistently strong performance over time.\nWe all know that the pandemic has accelerated a range of underlying trends, whether in business or society at large.\nAs a result, many of our clients are undertaking meaningful transformation of their companies.\nThis means adopting new ways in which they go to market in order to keep pace with rapid digitization of consumer behavior and economic activity.\nIn a world that's more cluttered than ever with messages and channel all vying for our attention, the most critical challenge is to combine great ideas that come from the human storytelling side of our business with strategies and insights that can be generated by our technology and data capabilities.\nWe've increasingly seen the amounts of time people spend online, picking out content that's engaging, informative, entertaining, or some combination of all 3.\nContent is undoubtedly more important than ever, and that's what makes the creative side of our business so vital.\nEqually important is getting those messages to people in ways that are relevant, respectful of their privacy and ultimately connect with them in meaningful ways.\nIt's also key to take the information flow that results from all those digital interactions and apply it at every step along the process, from audience definition to creative ideation, in order to better understand the impact that our clients' communications are having on their businesses.\nOur differentiated capabilities include a range of data-driven offerings that can do this both at scale and at speed.\nAs you know, we've been developing a data and tech infrastructure that underpins the full portfolio of our agencies and deliver solutions to a broad range of business problems through what we call the Open Architecture model.\nAll of our major clients are seeing the benefits of this integrated approach as our prospective clients.\nDuring the quarter, it was gratifying to see that the Kinesso behavioral sciences teams are engaging with more of our advertising and marketing services agencies than at any time since we launched those offerings.\nDespite the challenging external circumstances that we continue to deal with in the quarter, certain key elements of our business remain constant.\nWe will always succeed by adapting rapidly in our ways of working and how we are meeting the needs of clients.\nSince the start of the year, we onboarded or promoted top talents across the organization, once again received high levels of industry recognition and saw solid new business performance, where we remain net positive for the past 12 months.\nAs you've seen in our results, growth in the quarter was driven by contemporary offerings in which we've consistently invested, including media, data and tech, healthcare and digital user experience.\nAnother area where IPG has invested significant resources is in our environmental, social and governance programs.\nFor some time, we focused on building a culture of high ethical standards by adhering to a set of values centered around respect for every individual.\nAs a company responsible for creating some of the world's most well-known marketing campaign, we have an obligation to ensure that the work we do as well as how we deliver it supports the long-term well-being of our communities.\nThis quarter, IPG released its sixth annual sustainability report using the Global Reporting Initiative Standards framework.\nThe report can be found on our website, and it represents another step forward for us in our commitment to ESG.\nIn terms of climate action, we track IPG's global energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions across our entire portfolio.\nNext month, we plan to announce several strategic priorities focused on tackling climate change, including a science-based target for reducing our emissions globally.\nThe report also aligns with the UN Global Compact and focuses on human capital disclosures.\nFurther, we make clear that we operate with a core expectation that individuals deserve control over their data, and that we are responsible for promoting high ethical standards in terms of data privacy and security.\nEquity and inclusion also remain areas of focus for us.\nOur agencies are attuned to this priority, and they are held accountable because we have to show further progress when it comes to diversity in our ranks.\nIPG's latest MSCI ESG Ratings report, which is a key ESG data provider for our various stakeholders, saw an increase in our company's score to an A rating.\nOur improvement was the result of increased disclosure when it comes to human capital management, our position and capabilities related to data privacy and certain governance enhancements.\nMore recently, we joined Civic Alliance, as well as many of our clients, in calling for the protection of voting access here in the United States.\nWe continue to be committed to promoting democracy, and we'll work to support safe, accessible and fair elections, as well as to encourage our employees to participate in civic life.\nAs a business in which attracting top talent and advising clients is crucial to our success, a robust approach to ESG is a key part of our long-term strategy and important to all stakeholders.\nTurning now to highlights from our portfolio.\nDuring the quarter, we issued our second Media Responsibility Audit, addressing in a structured and consistent manner one of the most topical issues in the digital media ecosystem.\nThis framework and the principle it sets forth continue to be well received by clients as well as key industry groups.\nMediabrands' MAGNA unit also hosted a first-of-its-kind equity upfront, a week-long event intended to raise visibility and receptivity for black-owned media and media that serves black audiences.\nIn addition, the network announced that it would be joining forces with TikTok for a creator and content accelerator.\nTwo of our most dynamic units were in the media space, where we continue to leverage our deep data resources and capabilities.\nWe're seeing strong growth in Matterkind, which is customizing addressable media activation at scale for more of our clients.\nAt Reprise commerce, we have rapidly scaled operations on a global basis as we address growing needs in e-commerce, particularly for insight, content and analytics.\nFollowing on a series of new business wins, Initiative elevated its U.S. leader to global CEO, where we believe she will have an even greater impact on the network's success.\nAt UM during the quarter, we added a global rental car client as well as an auto OEM in EMEA and HBO Max in LatAm.\nUM was also named an outstanding company for working mothers, and three of its executives were named Adweek Media All-Stars, a distinction that was also earned by leaders of Reprise and Mediahub.\nAt our creative integrated global agencies, both McCann Worldgroup and FCB were named to the top five most awarded networks of 2020 in The Drum's World Creative Rankings.\nBoth also had work in the Super Bowl that was well received in a number of viewer polls and rankings.\nFollowing the implementation of our succession plan, at the end of 2020, McCann Worldgroup posted a solid first quarter.\nAlong with most awarded networks of 2020 in the Drum rankings, McCann New York came in at number four on that list in terms of the top 100 agencies worldwide.\nAt MRM, the agency was again named a leader in Gartner's 2021 Magic Quadrant for global marketing agencies based on their ability to serve as key strategic business partners for clients and to execute on critical marketing priorities.\nHuge and R/GA also featured on that list.\nThe health operations at McCann and FCB performed strongly in the quarter and continue to take share in the marketplace.\nThe notable program I'd like to call out was FCB Health's launch of the trial for number clinicalequality to shine a light on racial bias in clinical oncology trial.\nIn MullenLowe Group, Mediahub continued on its new business streak with the addition of global wins in Slack and Telly as well as New Balance in the U.K. Mediahub also introduced its inaugural Diversity-Owned Media Day and revamped its U.S. leadership team with a series of internal promotions.\nThe MullenLowe advertising network continues to be a leader in purpose-driven work.\nPartnering with several independent casting agencies, the agency recently launched a campaign for Unilever's Dove to promote inclusivity in commercial casting.\nIn the U.K., the agency has continued to do important work on behalf of the government to inform and educate the British public concerning the pandemic.\nIn the campaign U.S. Agency of the Year awards, the Martin Agency was recognized with multiple honors.\nAnd the agency also teamed with Mediahub for an integrated win of Terminix in Q1.\nHuge posted strong results during the quarter and saw two big wins, adding Coppertone and Wakefern to its client roster.\nThe agency also announced the return of its Huge XD School, with a renewed equity-centered purpose that seeks to use education to increase the participation of underrepresented identities in the design industry.\nAnd in R/GA, the agency's Venture Studio program announced the launch of a new Coalition Venture Studio with a mission to support Black start-up founders.\nIPG DXTRA companies continue to deliver specialized capabilities and integrated solutions for clients in our evolving world.\nCone was once again a standout in new business arena.\nWeber Shandwick was named PR Agency of the Year of the Campaign U.S. Awards.\nAnd the agency also launched the Plan Vx open playbook, a communications program that draws on extensive vaccination and public health communications expertise to help companies play a role in getting America vaccinated.\nAt Octagon, leader in sports marketing, we recently promoted a longtime executive to the role of CEO.\nPerformance at Acxiom was consistent with our expectations and in line for a year of solid growth in 2021.\nThe company continues to carve out a position as an authority in the integration of marketing and advertising technology.\nDuring the quarter, Acxiom expanded its partnership to better manage and measure campaign execution through the cloud in order to provide tangible improvements in campaign efficiency and speed.\nAcxiom is also accelerating its development in client verticals where it sees opportunities.\nRecently, Fortune named Acxiom one of 2021's Best Workplaces in Technology.\nWorking closely with the Acxiom data teams, Kinesso deployed its enhanced identity solution with half a dozen large clients.\nThis has already driven double-digit lifts in campaign efficiency.\nKinesso also expanded its range of direct data integrations with prominent platforms and ad tech companies.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we are pleased to see the Kinesso API connecting data and analytics capabilities across more of the IPG portfolio, since we see this as a growth driver for our business and a source of potential new revenue streams.\nAcxiom, Kinesso and Matterkind, are working together to bring end-to-end data and identity solutions to clients, in collaboration with a number of IPG agencies.\nWe've seen the impact of this recently in new wins and expanded assignments in the telecom, auto, healthcare and financial services sectors.\nLooking forward, we will stay focused on unlocking the enormous opportunities that exist due to the changes and disruptions that have accelerated during these past 12 months.\nWe worked over the years to embed digital capabilities throughout our organization and build a foundational layer of tech and data infrastructure that informs all our work.\nAs a result, we have a deep understanding of audiences at the individual level based on the strong legacy of ethical data practices.\nPersonalization, privacy and accountability are only going to grow in importance and value going forward.\nOur vision is, therefore, for IPG to become a key partner in ensuring that clients businesses thrive in the digital economy.\nAs you'd expect, we are focused on supporting their physical and mental well-being and listening to them in planning a return to office.\nThat's likely is to begin to a meaningful degree in September, dependent on continued progress on matters related to resolving the public health crisis.\nIt will be a gradual and iterative process in which we obviously were going to have to test and learn as we go.\nAs such, on the cost drivers that go hand-in-hand with live collaboration with colleagues as well as calling on clients in person, which have, of course, been reduced as a result of lockdowns, we'll begin to work their way back into our ways of working as well as our operating results.\nWe've already shared with you our perspective on the balance of the year, which is based on the assumption that there will continue to be a reasonably steady course of macro recovery.\nAs is clear, we view our current performance and long-term strategy as significant factors that will continue to enhance shareholder value.\nAs always, we're committed to sound financial fundamentals, including debt reduction as well as continuing to grow our dividend.\nWe also remain focused on getting back to our share repurchase program, when appropriate.\nWe will, of course, keep you apprised on progress as the year develops.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We hope you are all well.\nWe will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures.\nWe believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance.\nAt this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Philippe Krakowsky.\nAs always, I'll start with a high level view of our performance in the quarter.\nEllen will then provide additional details, and I'll conclude with updates on key developments at our agencies to be followed by Q&A.\nThese include the transition to work from home, and now are planning for return to office in many parts of the world, as well as the significant personal difficulties presented by the long course of the pandemic.\nIt's due to the efforts of our people, their commitment to their craft, our clients and to each other that we can share with you today these very strong results.\nPerformance that demonstrates our resilience represents a remarkable rebound from the impact of the pandemic, and is also the largest second quarter in our company's history.\nOur strong results in the quarter build on IPG's consistent record of industry outperformance and margin expansion.\nOur growth across regions, disciplines and client sectors speaks to more than a recovering global economy.\nIt underscores the elevated value that marketing and media partners can deliver in the integration of creativity, technology and data at scale made the significantly increased velocity of digital transformation.\nAt Interpublic, we're confident that we are attuned to the powerful currents that are transforming consumer behavior and are required for business relevance.\nAnd then we are increasingly delivering differentiated and higher-end solutions that help our clients win in a world of accelerated technological and societal change.\nThat takes creativity and precision, data and accountability, all of which we're able to bring together in customized teams that drive talent from across our portfolio.\nUltimately, our growth speaks to our ability to drive outstanding business results for our clients.\nOur net organic revenue growth in the second quarter was 19.8%.\nThat's against the second quarter of 2020 when as you will recall our organic change was negative 9.9%, which while well ahead of our peer group did mark our steepest decrease of the recession.\nIt's also important to note that our 7.9% organic increase this quarter relative to the pre-pandemic second quarter of 2019.\nCompared to last year, our organic growth was at double-digit rates around the world.\nIn the US, it was 17.4%, growth in our international markets ranged from 14% in the Asia-Pacific region to 49% in Latin America.\nWe also had a very broad contribution from our operating segments and disciplines.\nOur IAN segment grew 20.5% organically with increases led by media, data and technology and with solid contributions from our global integrated networks.\nThere was also strength across most of our disciplines led by healthcare.\nAt our DXTRA segment, organic growth was 15.1% with strong increases from last year's heavily impacted Q2 across Octagon's sports and entertainment and Jack Morton's experiential offerings.\nLooking at client sectors, the picture is also one of comprehensive acceleration.\nEach of our eight major sectors had double-digit increases from a year ago.\nThe auto, retail and other sectors were up more than 20%, consumer goods, tech and telecom and healthcare increased in the mid to high teens, food and beverage and financial services were up in the low double-digit range.\nTurning to operating expense and profitability.\nOur teams once again demonstrated outstanding discipline.\nAnd while remaining focused on appropriate cost control, we're also continuing to invest to support accelerating growth.\nWe continue to see the benefits of cost improvements from strategic restructuring actions taken last year, notably in our payroll expense and our expense for occupancy.\nWe also continue to see the benefits of low variable expenses as a result of the highly restrictive global travel environment and from the cost efficiencies of a largely remote workforce.\nAs we look ahead to post-pandemic work life, it's worth noting that we can, of course, expect that expenses for travel, meetings, office utilities and alike will begin to return in the second half of this year, most notably in Q4 and of course into next year.\nOur second quarter net income was $263.3 million as reported.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $405.8 million and adjusted EBITDA margin on net revenue was 17.9%.\nOur results reflect significant operating leverage compared to both last year and the 2019 period on our expense for base payroll and our office and other expenses.\nWe delevered on our expense accrual for our performance based incentive compensation plans, but our operating performance is tracking well ahead of planned target.\nDiluted earnings per share was $0.66 as reported and was $0.70 as adjusted for the after tax expense of the amortization of acquired intangibles.\nAs we look to the balance of the year, you'll recall that in April, we shared a full year 2021 performance outlook based on the assumption that there will continue to be a reasonably steady course of public health and global economic recovery.\nAt that time, we outlined our view toward full year organic growth of 5% to 6% and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 15.5%.\nIn light of our very strong second quarter and also having recently refreshed our bottom-up outlook for the second half of the year based on conversations with our clients and operating teams, we believe it's appropriate at the mid-point of this quite unusual year, unprecedented, in fact, to upgrade those expectations.\nOf course, we do sadly need to recognize that the COVID pandemic and the related risks to the macro environment are not yet behind us.\nIn particular, as we look ahead, we all understand that lagging vaccination rates in many parts of the world and the emergence of new variants may entail a higher COVID risk.\nThat's something we'll watch closely as we enter the second half of the year, especially our seasonally important fourth quarter.\nWith predicated on the continued progress and public health issues, we believe that we can deliver organic growth for the full year of 9% to 10%.\nAnd with that level of growth, we would expect to achieve 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 16%.\nAs such, we see this as another year of strong value creation for all of our stakeholders.\nWe'll of course keep you apprised of progress as the year develops and we look forward to those conversations.\nOn that note, I'd like to hand over the call to Ellen now for more in-depth view of our results.\nI hope that everyone is safe and healthy.\nAdjusted EBITDA, before a small restructuring adjustment, was $405.8 million, and margin was 17.9%.\nThese are levels that compare very favorably against any previous second quarter.\nWith growth having accelerated, certain variable expenses continue to lag and we are additionally seeing the structural benefits of last year's restructuring program.\nDiluted earnings per share were $0.66 as reported and $0.70 as adjusted before the after-tax impact of the amortization of acquired intangibles.\nTurning to slide three, you'll see our P&L for the quarter.\nI'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow.\nTurning to second quarter revenue on slide four.\nOur net revenue in the quarter was $2.27 billion, an increase of $416.2 million from a year ago.\nCompared to Q2 2020, the impact of the change in exchange rates was positive 3.1% with the US dollar weaker against currencies in most of our largest markets.\nNet divestitures were negative 40 basis points.\nOur organic net revenue increase was 19.8%, which brings us to 10.6% organic growth for the six months.\nAt the bottom of this slide, we breakup segment revenue in the quarter.\nOur IAN segment grew 20.5% organically.\nWe had notably strong growth across our offerings in media, data and tech, McCann, FCBs with healthcare, a significant driver, MullenLowe, Huge and R/GA.\nAt IPG DXTRA, organic growth was 15.1%, which reflects some recovery of the events and sports marketing offerings within the segment, the disciplines that have been most significantly impacted by the pandemic.\nOur public relations offerings also had solid growth in the quarter.\nMoving on to slide five, which is a look at our organic revenue change by region.\nIn the US, which was 63% of net revenue in the quarter, organic growth was 17.4%.\nRevenue decreased a year ago in the same period by 8%.\nYear-on-year performance was very strong across media, data and tech, FCB driven by healthcare, IPG DXTRA, McCann, MullenLowe and Huge.\nInternational markets were 37% of our net revenue in the quarter and increased 24.4% organically.\nYou'll recall that the same market decreased 13.1% a year ago in the second quarter which ranged by region between negative 10% and negative 15%.\nContinental Europe grew 27.9% with notably strong growth in Germany, Spain and France.\nThere were a number of operating highlights in the region led by media, data and tech, McCann, R/GA and DXTRA.\nThe UK increased 18.7% organically, led by McCann, DXTRA, media, data and tech and R/GA.\nAsia-Pac grew 14% organically.\nOur organic growth was paced by Australia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and India, while China and Japan decreased.\nOur organic growth in LatAm was 49% with exceptional results across the region, including Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.\nOur other markets group grew 29.2% with notably strong performance in the Middle East and Canada.\nMoving on to slide six, and operating expenses in the quarter.\nOur operating expenses excluding billable expenses, the amortization of acquired intangibles and restructuring charges increased only 11% from a year ago and to 22.5% growth of net revenue.\nThe result was second quarter margin expansion to 17.9% from 9.4% a year ago.\nWe continue to see efficiencies in a number of different expense categories as we had in this year's first quarter and these were both structural and variable.\nIn the structural category, we are seeing the benefit of the strategic restructuring actions, which we initiated in the second quarter of last year and continued to execute over the second half.\nAs a reminder, these actions involve the elimination of certain positions, and resulting headcount reduction that will not return with revenue growth.\nWe also reduced our real estate footprint by 15% last year.\nWe are currently seeing the benefit of most of these actions and at a full run rate they will generate $160 million in annual cost savings.\nWe've also had over the course of the pandemic a sharp decrease in certain variable operating expenses.\nI would call out specifically lower travel and related expenses, which was the case in the second quarter of 2020 and that's continued through Q2 2021.\nAs you can see on this slide, a ratio of total salaries and related expense, as a percentage of net revenue was 65.4%, which has significantly improved from the second quarter of 2020 when revenue had decreased sharply.\nUnderneath that, we drove very strong leverage on our expense for base payroll, benefits and tax, which was 53% of net revenue in the quarter.\nThat reflects the benefit of last year's restructuring and the fact that the pace of new hiring lags our significant revenue growth, as was in the case in past business cycles.\nOur severance expense ratio also decreased sharply to only 40 basis points of net revenue, compared to 3% in Q2 2020, which was at an elevated level due to the impact of the recession.\nGoing the other way, our expense for performance-based incentive compensation increased to 6.4%, consistent with our very strong operating results.\nExpense for temporary labor also increased, as a percentage of net revenue to 4.5%, as a result of servicing the top line's quick acceleration.\nAt quarter-end, total worldwide headcount was approximately 53,000, a 1.4% increase from a year ago and up 5.2% from the beginning of this year, with hiring to support our growth.\nAlso on this slide, our office and other direct expense decreased as a percentage of net revenue by 380 basis points to 13.3%.\nOur occupancy expense decreased to 5% of net revenue, mainly due to the restructuring of our real estate, as well as leverage on our revenue growth.\nWe leveraged all other office and other direct expense by 220 basis points, which reflects lower expense for bad debt and acquisition costs and leverage as a result of our revenue growth.\nOur SG&A expense was 1.3% of net revenue, with the increase from a year ago due to the higher unallocated performance-based incentive expense and increased employee insurance expense, which was at a very low level a year ago.\nOn slide seven, we present detail on adjustments to our reported second quarter results, in order to provide greater clarity and a picture of comparable performance.\nThis begins on the left-hand side with the reported results and steps through to adjusted EBITDA and our adjusted diluted EPS.\nOur expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles in the second column was $21.6 million.\nThe restructuring refinement in the quarter is a benefit of $200,000.\nTo be clear, this is a small adjustment to estimate of the 2020 restructuring program.\nBelow operating expenses in column four, we had a pre-tax loss in the quarter of $1.7 million in other expenses due to the disposition of small non-strategic businesses.\nAt the foot of the slide, you can see the after-tax impact per diluted share of these adjustments was $0.04 per share, which bridges our diluted earnings per share as reported at $0.66 to adjusted earnings of $0.70 per diluted share.\nOn slide eight, we turn to cash flow in the quarter.\nCash from operations was $468.2 million, compared with the use of $87.1 million a year ago.\nWe generated $101.6 million from working capital compared to a use of $264.9 million last year.\nInvesting activities was $43.3 million in the quarter, mainly for capex of $34 million.\nFinancing activities used $101.8 million, mainly for our dividend.\nOur net increase in cash for the quarter was $325.6 million.\nSlide nine is the current portion of our balance sheet.\nWe ended the quarter with $2.34 billion of cash and equivalents.\nUnder current liabilities, the current portion of long-term debt refers to our $500 million, 3.75% senior note which matures in October of this year.\nWe plan to repay these notes from cash on hand.\nSlide 10 depicts the maturities of our outstanding debt.\nAgain, we have the maturity in October of this year, and then only $250 million due in April 2024.\nThereafter, our next maturity is not until 2028.\nIn summary, on slide 11, our teams continue to execute at a high level in an unprecedented environment.\nI would like to reiterate our pride in and gratitude for the efforts of our people.\nThe strength of our balance sheet and liquidity means that we remain well positioned, both financially and commercially.\nWhile we remain very pleased with our results, it's worth reiterating as Ellen just said that this is an unusual, in fact, unprecedented environment in which we're operating.\nNow importantly, it bears noting that when compared to our non-pandemic results in 2019, Q2 results show our company is performing at a very high level.\nWe continue to feel this is the result of strategic decisions that we've taken over a number of years to position our company for the future, investments and actions that have created a sustainable advantage for our organization.\nToday's IPG delivers addressable and accountable digital marketing programs, combined with our world-class creative storytelling capabilities, these solutions make us higher value partners to our clients.\nOne of our many priorities over the years has been the creation and implementation of open architecture solutions, where we bring the best of IPG together in collaborative teams that are customized to client-specific business needs and increasingly a key element of this approach, Open Architecture 2.0, as it were, is Acxiom whose data management expertise and data assets play a role in an increasingly broad range of our offerings.\nIn addition, Kinesso powers many of our applications and services that provide clients with a deep understanding of audiences in order to provide insights and then form creative work, segments for media delivery and line of sight to the effectiveness of the work that we're doing together.\nWe saw this model come to life in the quarter with a Cigna count win, which combined talent from McCann Worldgroup Initiative and R/GA powered by Kinesso and Acxiom.\nThis is a continuation of several years of strong performance in integrated pitches, especially those that include creative and media, as well as media and data.\nAnother another key decision that's contributed to our success has been our continued investment in strong agency brands, which helps us attract and retain top talent and deliver breakthrough creative ideas across a range of marketing disciplines.\nAs a result of this strategy, IPG companies across our portfolio earned a number of important accolades during the quarter.\nMost notably, we had an impressive showing at the 2021 Cannes International Festival of Creativity.\nIPG agencies took home eight Grand Prix, the festival's highest honor.\nWins across the network represented a broad range of clients, categories, agencies, disciplines and geographies.\nFCB's performance was a standout, as the agency took home four Grand Prix and was named Global Network of the Year.\nThe agency's creative community and its leadership deserved credit for this terrific accomplishment.\nFCB Health was also named Healthcare Network of the Year and AREA 23 and FCB Health Agency was named Healthcare Agency of the Year.\nMcCann client, Microsoft was named Marketer of the Year at the festival, which is another major honor.\nAnd the agency also won a Grand Prix in brand experience and activation for its remarkable true name work for Mastercard, which empowers transgender and non-binary cardholders to use their true name when using their credit card.\nIn PR, McCann Paris earned a Grand Prix, partnering with Weber Shandwick for a campaign that ran across the Middle East, which teaches women in a culturally sensitive way to perform self-checks for early breast cancer detection.\nFCB Chicago and Weber Shandwick teamed to earn a Grand Prix for work for AB InBev.\nAnd R/GA continues to be recognized for its ability to humanize technology, winning a Grand Prix in social and influencer marketing for disruptive work it did for Reddit on the Super Bowl.\nOn Ad Age's annual A-List and Creativity Awards, both Deutsch LA and The Martin Agency were named to the prestigious A-list.\nInitiative was named Media Agency of the Year and FCB Health's CEO was recognized as our industry's Executive of the Year.\nAt the holding company level, we made a number of announcements that position us for further success.\nChief among them was our launch of IPG Health earlier this month.\nThe move will align our top performing companies, FCB Health and McCann Health under a new global network, IPG Health, led by a dynamic and proven CEO and a skilled executive leadership team.\nIn this new operating structure, the distinct agency brands within FCB Health and McCann Health will remain active and continue to go to market independently.\nThey will also benefit from access to additional specialty services, knowledge sharing, proactive career management, shared investment in new capabilities and skill-sets, highly complimentary geographic coverage, as well as an even higher level of collaboration.\nAround the world, healthcare and well-being are areas of growing importance for our clients and society at large.\nAs an industry sector, healthcare represents an increasingly vital part of the economy, and one where innovation is becoming an ever more important driver of success.\nSo the alignment of IPG's fully dedicated healthcare networks under the banner of IPG Health strengthens our leadership position in this dynamic sector.\nThe scale, reach and most importantly, quality of our people and our work makes for an exciting combination.\nAnd it's why we think this new offering will continue to deliver great things in the years to come.\nThis month, we also added to our strong roster of marketing technology and e-commerce providers with a launch of Performance Art, a data-led creative CRM agency, whose leadership team is known for delivering platform level creative ideas that are at home in a client's e-retail flow as they are in a 30-second spot.\nTurning to performance at our agencies, growth at IAN in the quarter was once again highlighted by media, data and tech and FCB led by healthcare.\nUM saw significant wins in the quarter with Enterprise Holdings, Behr Paint and most recently, NYC & Company, New York City's official marketing and tourism organization.\nUM also saw an important account retention for the Australian government.\nAt the Campaign Agency of the Year Awards, UM earned Global Media Agency of the Year honors and UM APAC was named Best Media Network in that region.\nAt Initiative, the agency was named 2020's Most Competitive Network Globally in Media Pitches and saw a major win in the UK with banking and insurance company, NatWest Group.\nWe also continue to see terrific momentum at Reprise, especially as it relates to their growing e-commerce capabilities.\nAcxiom, Kinesso, and Matterkind are also performing well and they're key to how we help clients thrive in the addressable media market, which requires flexibility, given the quickly shifting landscape.\nAt Acxiom, we continue to invest behind innovative new products and services, such as customer data platforms, and identity resolution, with which we are seeing increased client adoption.\nAnother important development saw Acxiom deploy their latest customer intelligence platform on the cloud with a key financial services client.\nAt our creative integrated networks, FCB, McCann and MullenLowe Group were named the ACT Responsible 2020 Good Report, a unique ranking of the world's best use of creative communications to promote sustainability and social responsibility.\nOn top of its exceptional showing at Cannes, at FCB Global, the network continues to invest in talent and new offerings, hiring a head of data science and connections to expand its expertise in commerce, data and technology fueled creativity.\nMcCann also continues to prove a creative powerhouse.\nAs we saw, the network was recently named Webby Network of the Year and McCann New York was named Webby Agency of the Year.\nMRM continues to leverage its Martek expertise and is seeing strong growth with its MRM commerce division, which help marketers drive engagement, interaction and conversion on commerce platforms.\nAt MullenLowe Group, Mediahub continues its strong new business momentum and during the quarter, added Hallmark's parent company, Crown Media, as well as Tally Financial.\nMullenLowe is also a global leader in purpose driven work.\nAnd we saw that as it continued to partner with governments in a number of countries around the world to inform people the benefits of being vaccinated against COVID-19.\nAt R/GA, campaign named the London office as the UK's Digital Agency of the Year.\nAnd R/GA London added two new clients, financial services company, Allianz, and Vollebak Clothing.\nWe named the new CEO at Huge who joined the digital agency after a very successful tenure at Initiative, where he helped turn the agency into a leader in the media space.\nDuring the quarter, Huge also saw strong new business activity, adding Sub-Zero Appliances, Wakefern, Tezos Foundation and Nikko Asset Management.\nThe Martin Agency continues to impact culture and drive strong business results for its clients.\nNotably, the agency sold the city's short film for DoorDash at the Tribeca Film Festival last month and had captured the resilience of New York City's restaurants and the role they play in the city's life.\nAt IPG DXTRA, we also saw recognition as the number of companies were called out for their ability to deliver creative solutions.\nWeber Shandwick was the most awarded PR agency at Cannes this year.\nCurrent Global demonstrated their commitment to closing the disability and inclusion gap by creating guidelines and toolkits for marketers so as to make content more accessible for consumers with sight, hearing, or other cognitive impairments.\nAnd this program was recognized as one of Fast Company's World-Changing Ideas for 2021.\nJack Morton launched what they are referring to as the return-to-live dashboard and that's a tool for brand marketers to access where, when, and how businesses in the US can safely get back to hosting live experiences.\nGolin continued its strong performance in new business, was selected as LinkedIn's Global Social Media Agency of Record and also Agency of Record for Yamaha Music.\nGolin was also named PRWeek's Global Agency of the Year.\nPivoting now back to the holding company, another key area that bears mention is our long-term focus on ESG, including diversity, equity and inclusion.\nIn all of our operations and activities, we're working to build on and more fully live into this commitment.\nAnd this includes reassessing how we hire, train and promote a diverse workforce, incorporate rigorous practices around data ethics and media responsibility as well as reduce our greenhouse gas emissions further around the world.\nKey accomplishments on this front include IPG being recently named by Forbes to their top ten list of America's Best Employers for Diversity.\nDuring the quarter, we also created a new position, our industry's first culture officer, to focus on long-term thought leadership relating to a broad range of social justice issues for underserved and underrepresented communities.\nDuring the quarter, as part of our integrated ESG efforts, we also announced an action plan that consists of three climate roles, committing to set a science-based target; sourcing 100% renewable electricity by 2030, and joining the Climate Pledge, co-founded by Amazon and Global Optimism.\nIn addition, we've published our first SASB report, becoming the first company in the advertising and marketing sector to publish an alignment with SASB's industry standards.\nOur agencies also contribute significantly to our ESG profile.\nAnd importantly, here in the US, we saw media brands take a leading role in the industry conversation about promoting greater media equity.\nAnd they announced that they're committing to invest at least 5% of client budgets in black-owned media by 2023.\nOctagon launched an accelerator program with historically black colleges and universities for students interested in sports and entertainment as a career.\nAnd R/GA created an innovative program to raise money for environmental organizations through a dedicated YouTube channel that plays nature videos, which have become hugely popular during the pandemic, and it directs all of the ad revenues generated on this channel to environmental NGOs.\nLike many of us, I look forward to working live with colleagues and clients, especially given that we're an ideas-driven service business.\nOur culture, our capacity for innovation and the ways in which we combine creativity with technology and data are all enhanced by in-person interactions.\nNow here in the US, we expect to have more people returning to our offices in a flexible hybrid model, beginning in mid-September as is already the case in certain other parts of the world.\nWe will, of course, be mindful of the public health situation and of the learnings we've accumulated during the past 16 months when it comes to flexible work practices.\nThe expected costs associated with live collaboration with colleagues as well as travel will begin to return as a normal part of how we work and therefore be reflected in our operating results.\nFor example, as we look forward to the remainder of the year, we expect an increase in travel costs in the fourth quarter, which could return to levels consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nAs we said earlier, these are unprecedented times.\nNone of us had previously been required to adapt the constraints of living and working through a pandemic.\nAnd likewise, none of us has experience in emerging for one.\nEarlier on the call, we shared our perspective on the balance of the year, based on the assumption that there will continue to be a reasonably steady course of macro recovery that people continue to become vaccinated to protect themselves and their communities and that we're able to adequately mitigate the impact of dangerous new variants.\nWe've delivered a very strong first half of the year on top of the most challenging comps in our industry.\nFurther, despite continued macro uncertainty, we have greater clarity to the balance of 2021.\nWe therefore believe that current performance, combined with the continued execution of our long-term strategy, are significant drivers for the sustained enhancement of value for all of our stakeholders.\nAs always, we're committed to sound financial fundamentals, including debt reduction as well as continuing to grow our dividend.\nWe also remain focused on getting back to our share repurchase program and we will keep you apprised of our progress as the year develops.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I think we're all very ready to turn the page and what was a very challenging 2020 and while the global pandemic remains very pervasive, we do all see light at the end of the tunnel and we look forward to 2021 with cautious optimism that conditions will improve.\nThroughout 2020, we focused on executing our long-term strategy while recognizing the necessity to focus on employee health and safety, finding ways to work, and serving and delivering expected outcomes for our clients.\nOver the past decade, we've been successful investing ahead of shift in client demand, placing us in a strong position to take advantage of key industry tailwinds in the future.\nOur investments in these capabilities and our tremendous focus on our clients is now again producing good momentum in our business that became more visible as the year progressed by working better to anticipate, understand, and meet client needs during the challenging times.\nWe've achieved six straight months of net long-term inflows, totaling nearly $18 billion in the second half of 2020 with progress across channels, geographies, asset classes.\nRetail flows improved in the second half significantly.\nOur solutions enabled institutional pipeline remain near record levels.\nWe saw net inflows in Asia Pacific, totaling $17 billion in the second half of the year and improving flows in EMEA within the Americas over this timeframe and net long-term flows in the fixed income remained robust during that period.\nAll of these factors combined build a strong foundation as we head into 2021 and maybe a few highlights of the 4th quarter.\nOn slide 4, if you happen to be following along more specifically during the quarter, investment performance for a large portion of our high demand capabilities were in the upper quartile.\nWe had net long-term inflows and then nearly $10 billion during the quarter, long-term inflows in the fixed income capabilities continued while we saw client demand for equities within ETFs, quantitative and index strategies in particular.\nWe saw another quarter of strong inflows from Asia-Pacific region and flows in the Americas turn positive.\nAlison will provide more information in a few minutes on the flow's strategic evaluation and more details of the quarter.\nBut I would like to note, we also improved our operating leverage during the period, paid our credit facility to zero, and made progress improving our cash position.\nI would like to spend a few minutes on slides 5 and 6 to talk about our competitive strength and key capabilities in areas with high client demand and our focus for 2021.\nSlide 5 illustrates the market opportunities we see for these key growth areas and demonstrates the majority of our investment capabilities are aligned with these opportunities.\nIn these areas, our investment performance is strong.\nWe're highly competitive and well positioned for growth and as we move into 2021, we plan to further expand our market leading position in ETFs in the US and EMEA in particular and build our passive presence in Asia-Pacific.\nWe are the fourth largest ETF provider globally, and our capabilities span passive active strategies in establishing and developing a spectrum of ETF-ESG ETFs and building on our 15-year legacy of innovation, we continue to develop the products in this space as demonstrated by the launch of the QQQ innovation suite and our first non-transparent ETFs that we delivered in the 4th quarter.\nStrong alternative platform and our focus is growing our private markets business led by our market leading real estate and bank loan businesses, and active fixed income and global equity remain key areas of opportunity for us and our offerings are well positioned with strong investment performance and high client demand.\nIn addition, we are focused on our solutions efforts and as we have seen by the contribution to the institutional pipeline, clients value the service, the ability to offer solutions that builds the full power of our competitive set of capability and services-services to client continues to be a priority for us during 2021.\nWe continue to invest in our leadership position in Greater China.\nWe have been managing dedicated Chinese products for nearly 40 years.\nWe have already seen the benefits of our early mover[Phonetic] advantage in the China onshore market through our joint venture, which [Technical Issue] our position in the fast-growing China market and further develop our media solutions and asset allocation offerings.\nGiven our investment in the business over the past decade, our most recent efforts to better align the organization with our strategy, I'm confident that we have the talent, the capabilities, the resources, and momentum to [Technical Issue] future growth and success.\n[Technical Issues] happy New year and remain focused on helping our clients achieve their desired outcomes regardless of where the markets take us.\nMoving to slide 7, we had 61% and 70% of actively managed funds on the top half of peers on a 5-year and a 10-year basis, reflecting strength in fixed income, global equities, including emerging market equities and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally.\nLooking at our AUM on slide 8, we ended the quarter with $1.35 trillion in AUM.\nOf the $132 billion in AUM growth, approximately $95 billion as a function of increased market values.\nTurning to flows on slide 9, our diversified platform generated long-term net inflows in the 4th quarter of $9.8 billion representing 3.9% annualized organic growth, which we generated positive net inflows in active AUM of $400 million and passive AUM of $9.4 billion.\nOur ETFs experienced net inflows of $6.1 billion including $4.7 billion in long-term ETF and $1.4 billion in our QQQ.\nOur US-listed ETFs excluding the QQQs have their best quarter in their 15-year history.\nWe saw net long-term ETF flows in the US focused on equities in the 4th quarter including a high level of interest in our S&P 500 equal weight ETF which had $2.7 billion in net inflows in the quarter.\nTwo of our top 5 end-flowing ETFs were ESG related.\nWe continue to see momentum in our ETF business and demand for ESG funds and as Marty highlighted, the market opportunity is significant for this key growth area in 2021.\nRetail net outflows were $800 million in the quarter, helped by the positive ETF flows.\nOn the institutional side, we had net inflows of $10.6 billion.\nI'll provide a little more color on these flows on the next few slides, but importantly, the growth in our passive AUM and our institutional AUM is meaningful for the firm and contributed to the positive operating leverage we generated in the period.\nAlso, as Marty noted earlier, we are seeing the mix of ETF inflows being weighted toward higher fee-generating products.\nLooking at flows by geography, you will note that the Americas had net inflows of $2.2 billion in the quarter, an improvement of $6.6 billion from the prior quarter.\nThis improvement was driven by net inflows into ETFs, institutional inflows, various fixed income strategies, and importantly, focused sales efforts and improvement in redemption rates.\nOur global equity products improved by over $1 billion or 37% from Q3 driven by our developing market fund, which returned to positive net flows in the 4th quarter following negative net flows in the first three quarters of the year.\nThe UK experienced net outflows of $100 million in the quarter, as positive flows into our institutional quantitative equity capability were offset by net outflows in multi-asset in UK equities.\nEMEA net outflows were $1.4 billion driven by institutional lumpiness and ETF outflows largely in our S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 use ETF.\nAnd finally, I noted last quarter that Asia Pacific delivered one of its stronger-strongest quarters ever with net inflows of $8 billion.\nIn the 4th quarter, net inflows were even higher at $9.1 billion.\nNet inflows were diversified across the Asia Pacific region.\n$4 billion of these net flows were from Japan, $3.8 billion arose from our China JV, and the remaining $1.3 billion was generated from several other countries in the region.\nIt's worth noting that we continue to see strength in fixed income across all channels and markets in the 4th quarter with net long-term inflows of $8.2 billion.\nThis following net long-term inflows of $8.8 billion in the 3rd quarter and $6 billion in the second quarter.\nIt's also important to note that of the $26.1 billion in fixed income net inflows in 2020, $25 billion of these net inflows were from active fixed income capabilities.\nActive fixed income has been a growth area for us in 2020 and remains a key investment area in 2021.\nNow, moving to slide 10.\nOur institutional pipeline remains robust at $30.5 billion on the heels of strong pull through in the institutional pipeline during the 4th quarter.\nThis pipeline is diversified across asset classes and geographies, and our solutions capability has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network warranting our continued investment in this key capability in 2021.\nTurning to slide 11, you will note that our revenues increased $135 million or 12.4% from the 3rd quarter, driven by higher average AUM in Q4, as well as a meaningful increase in performance fees.\nNet revenue yield at performance fees was 36 basis points flat and flat at the, at the Q3 yield level.\nThe impact of rising markets on our yield was offset by modest fee rate decline from the mix shift we experienced across products in the quarter as well as the impact of non-management fee earning AUM.\nWe recorded performance fees of $78 million in the 4th quarter, $48 million of these performance fees arose from our real estate business and $21 million from our institutional business and our China JV, two of our key growth areas.\nSeasonally, we tend to see higher performance fees in the 4th quarter.\nTotal adjusted operating expenses increased 8.3% in Q4.\nThe $57 million increase in operating expenses was driven by higher variable compensation as a result of both market growth and compensation related to the performance fees in the quarter.\nOperating expenses remained at lower than historic activity levels due to pandemic driven impacts to discretionary spending, travel, and other business operations that persisted in the quarter.\nThat being said, we did see a seasonal increase in marketing expenses as expected.\nMoving to slide 12, we wanted to update you on the progress we have made with our strategic evaluation.\nAs we noted previously, we conducted a strategic evaluation across four key areas of our expense base, our organizational model, our real estate footprint, management of third-party spend, and technology and operations efficiency.\nThrough this evaluation, we will invest in key areas of growth, including ETF, fixed income, China solutions, alternatives, and global equities while creating permanent net improvement of $200 million in our normalized operating expense base.\nAs we noted, a large element of the savings will be generated from compensation which includes realigning our client facing workforce to support key areas of growth and repositioning to lower cost locations.\nIn the 4th quarter, we realized $7.5 million in cost savings, $7 million of these savings were related to compensation expense as depicted on slide 12.\nThe remaining $500,000 in savings were related to facilities, which are shown in the property, office, and technology category.\nThe $7.5 million in cost savings were $30 million annualized is 15% of our $200 million net savings expectation.\nOf the remaining $170 million in net savings, we anticipate we will realize roughly 50% of the savings through compensation expense.\nThe remaining 50% would spread across occupancy, tech spends, and G&A.\nAs it relates to timing, we still expect approximately $150 million or 75% of the run rate savings to be achieved by the end of this year, with the remainder recognized by the end of '22.\nWe estimate that we will realize roughly 75% of the anticipated compensation reductions in 2021, roughly 50% of the anticipated reduction in occupancy expense also in 2021, and all of the reduction in G&A this year.\nThe majority of efficiencies identified in our tech spend will not be realized until 2022.\nIn the 4th quarter, we incurred $104 million of our total estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs.\nWe expect the remaining transaction costs for the realization of this program to be in the range of $150 million-$175 million over the next two years, roughly two-thirds of this remaining amount occurring in 2021.\nAs a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results.\nWith respect to Q1, after improved market performance and asset inflows in the 4th quarter, we start the year with ever $1.3 trillion in AUM.\nGiven the market improvement with more back-end weighted toward the end of the quarter, we expect both operating revenues excluding performance fees and the associated variable expenses to be modestly higher in the first quarter.\nThis reflects the follow through from the market and slow growth that occurred over the course of the 4th quarter, even if we assume no change in markets from year-end.\nOn the expense side, this will include higher associated variable compensation from the seasonal increase in payroll taxes, partially offset by lower compensation related to the seasonal decline in performance fees and the execution of our targeted cost savings.\nTurning to slide 13, adjusted operating income improved $78 million to $485 million for the quarter, driven by the factors we just reviewed.\nAdjusted operating margin include 230 basis points as compared to the 3rd quarter to 39.5%, demonstrating the operating leverage in our model.\nThis helped drive a 19% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $0.72 a share.\nIn addition, we benefited from higher non-operating income and lower non-operating expenses in the quarter.\nNon-operating income included $31.9 million in net gains for the quarter compared to $15.2 million in net gains last quarter.\nThe increase was driven by unrealized gains primarily in our seed money holdings.\nInterest expense of $24.4 million was 28% lower than the prior quarter.\nQ3 was the final quarter in which we paid dividends related to our forward purchase agreements, a portion of which we settled in January with the remaining portion to be settled in April 2021.\nOur tax rate for the 4th quarter was 21.7%.\nThe reduction in the rate reflects the lower taxes on unrealized gains in our seed portfolio due to the jurisdiction of our holdings.\nWe estimate our 2021 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24%.\nThe actual effective tax rate may vary from this estimate due to the impact of non-recurring items on pre-tax income and discrete tax items.\nA few comments on slide 14.\nAs Marty mentioned, we reduced revolver balance by $90 million to 0 in the quarter, consistent with our commitment to improve our leverage profile.\nIn addition to using excess cash to reduce leverage, we seek to improve liquidity and our financial flexibility.\nTo that end, our balance sheet cash position improved to $1.4 billion in the 4th quarter from $1.1 billion at the end of Q3, $764 million of this cash is held for regulatory requirements.\nI will note, we paid $117 million earlier in January to settle a portion of the forward share repurchase liability with the remaining liability of $177 million to be settled in April.\nWe believe we're making solid progress in our efforts to build financial flexibility.\nWe remain committed to a sustainable dividend and to returning capital to shareholders longer term through a combination of modestly increasing dividends and share repurchases.\nIn summary, Marty will walk through our key capabilities through organic growth opportunity each presents and our focus on executing the strategy that aligns with these areas.\nWe're also focused on our strategic evaluation and reallocating our resources to position us for growth, and we remain prudent and cautious in our approach to capital management.\nOur focus on driving greater efficiency and effectiveness into our platform, combined with the work we've done to build a global business with a comprehensive range of capabilities, puts Invesco in a very strong position to meet client needs, run a disciplined business, and to continue to invest in and grow our franchise over the long term.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We have slides for our conference call.\nYou can find them in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.\nA great deal has changed in the world in 2020 with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFor us, our top priority is and has been to protect the health and safety of our employees and our customers, while ensuring our business continuity to meet our customers' requirements.\nAll of our 34 plants around the world are operating, and we are satisfying all of our customer needs.\nI am very proud of what the Quaker Houghton team has done to continuing to service our customers, as well to continue our integration efforts, which are going well.\nWe are pleased with our results for the third quarter when considering we were coming from such a weak second quarter.\nOverall, our sales were up sequentially 28% from the second quarter and down 5% from the third quarter of last year on a pro forma basis.\nLet me now give you a little more flavor on what we experienced by segment or region.\nFirst, as we look sequentially, the Americas saw the largest quarterly net sales improvement as sales grew 48% sequentially, driven primarily by stronger volumes.\nA similar story I heard in Asia Pacific, EMEA, and our Global Specialty Businesses, where volume improvement drove net sales increases of 24%, 21% and 16% respectively compared to the second quarter.\nSo we saw good sequential improvement in all business segments.\nAnother way to indicate this sequentially quarterly sales trend is to look at what happened in our three main customer industry groups on a global basis.\nMetalworking increased the most and grew 39% sequentially from the second quarter, due primarily to automotive OEMs and related suppliers coming back from the prolong shutdowns or significantly reduced production rates in the second quarter due to COVID.\nOur other industry groups of metals and Global Specialty Businesses also increased and showed growth of 21% and 16% respectively.\nI hope these different cuts of our significant sequential sales increases help provide insight to what was happening in the quarter.\nSo overall, our sequential volumes were up 27% but our pro forma volumes were still down versus last year by approximately 10%, when excluding the positive impact of Norman Hay, which we acquired last October.\nThis approximately 10% decline was felt in all regions and segments.\nHowever, Asia Pacific was less impacted since China actually showed modest year-over-year growth.\nI also want to point out that we did continue to take market share despite the weakness in our end markets as our continued analysis shows that we have total organic sales growth due to net share gains of approximately 2% in this quarter versus the third quarter of last year.\nI am very pleased to see this strong rebound from last quarter, but we're certainly not all the way back.\nAs we said previously, we estimate it will take at least two more years for our markets to fully return, and some markets like aerospace, which makes up about 3% of our sales, will take more time than that.\nHowever, we expect our sales to rebound more quickly due to our projected continued market share gains, as well as our potential smaller bolt-on acquisitions in the future that we may make.\nConcerning gross margins for the third quarter, they were up significantly compared to both the second quarter and for last year.\nThe sequential increase is primarily due to higher volumes and its impact on the fixed portion of our manufacturing costs.\nThe increase from last year was primarily due to the realization of our manufacturing and raw material cost synergy savings.\nThis pandemic and its impacts have been similar in many ways to what we went through in late 2008.\nJust like then, we took fast action to save costs in numerous ways.\nEssentially, all discretionary expenses have been eliminated, we stopped new hires where possible, some positions were furloughed, and our planned capital expenditures have been cut by over 30%.\nAnd very importantly, we reviewed our integration and synergy plans in light of this situation and took additional actions as well as accelerated other synergies where possible.\nThis has led to additional cost synergies as we have increased our guidance on synergy achievement again this quarter.\nFor 2020, our current estimate is $58 million of cost synergies achieved versus our earlier estimate of $53 million.\nAlso, the total synergies we estimate that we will achieve in 2021 have been raised from $65 million to $75 million with '22 reaching $80 million.\nIn this quarter, we achieved $17 million in synergies, and we expect sequential improvement during our future quarters.\nSo overall, we are pleased with the quarter, given the environment in which we were operating and we were -- and we did see significant sequential improvement in our sales, gross margins, and adjusted EBITDA.\nAlso, our cash flow is very strong and our net debt decreased by 7% or $58 million.\nThe positive cash flow nature of our business during severe downturns is something we have discussed with investors in the past, and we're now seeing its positive impacts again in these tough times.\nLooking ahead, we anticipate that throughout the next year or two, our markets will show gradual sequential improvement.\nHowever, it's hard to predict that improvement by quarter, given the continued uncertainty in our operating environment.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to be in the ballpark of the third quarter, and for the full year, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to exceed $215 million.\nOverall, our higher expected synergies, additional cost saving actions, and improvement in our product margins and our cash flow management are expected to continue to help us during this period of time when our markets are down versus pre-COVID levels.\nAs we look forward to 2021, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to increase by 20%-plus as we continue our integration savings, take market share in the marketplace, and benefit from an expect gradual rebound in demand.\nI am so proud of how our team has performed in servicing our customers, meeting their needs, and successfully continue with our integration execution, which is both critical and difficult for us this year.\nPeople are everything in our business and by far our most valuable asset, and ensuring their safety and well-being is and will continue to be a top priority for us.\nI'm proud of and very happy with our Quaker Houghton team and what we have and will be able to accomplish for our customers and investors both now and going forward.\nI'll now hand it over to Mary so that she can review some of the key financials for you for the quarter.\nThese are available on our website.\nPlease also note that we continue to update our risk factors in our Form 10-Q to address the evolving COVID-19-related issues, and these risk factors should be reviewed along with those in our 2019 Form 10-K.\nReconciliations are provided in the appendix of this investor deck.\nIn this review, our comparison periods show actual and non-GAAP results, as well as pro forma sales and pro forma adjusted EBITDA as if we've been combined with Houghton throughout the periods presented.\nRemember that we closed the Combination on August 1, 2019, so our actual reported and non-GAAP Q3 2019 results include only two months of Houghton.\nPlease see slides 6 through 10 now, while I review some highlights.\nAs Mike noted, we saw sales rebound of $367 million in the third quarter, up 28% from $286 million in Q2, but still down 5% from pro forma Q3 2019 sales of $386 million, due primarily to lower volumes as a result of COVID-19.\nOur gross margin of 38.2% is up significantly from our gross margin of 34% in Q2 and 32.3% in Q3 of last year, which we estimate would have been about 35.5%, excluding a purchase accounting adjustment.\nWe also saw a benefit to our gross margin this quarter that we estimated approximately 0.5%, which we attribute to price mix that we believe was unique to the quarter.\nYou might remember on our last call that I commented that we expected the benefits of our procurement synergies and manufacturing optimization to be more visible as volumes pick up and this is what you see coming through as part of our sequential improvement.\nIn addition, our cost synergies in these areas continue to increase as reflected in our updated cost synergy estimates.\nOur non-GAAP operating income of $43.2 million rebounded significantly from Q2's $11.2 million and is also up 25% from $34.5 million in Q3 of last year, primarily due to the addition of Houghton and Norman Hay and the benefits of realized cost synergies, partially offset by the negative impact of COVID-19.\nSimilarly, our non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.56 is up significantly from Q2's $0.21, while it is flat to last year as a result of the additional shares issued at close of the Combination.\nOur effective tax rate in the current quarter was an expense of 8.1% versus a benefit of 27.6% in Q3 of last year.\nWe've seen significant volatility in our quarterly effective tax rates due to COVID-19-related changes in profitability as well as continued updates to the 2017 tax law.\nExcluding the impact of all unusual items, we estimate that our Q3 effective tax rates would have been approximately 24% and 20% for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFor the full year, we expect our effective tax rate, excluding all unusual items will be in the range of 23% to 25%.\nAs Mike mentioned earlier, we're pleased to see our adjusted EBITDA almost double to approximately $64 million in Q3 from the Q2 level of approximately $32 million and increased approximately 5% compared to our pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $61 million in Q3 of last year.\nThis is due primarily to the benefits of our realized cost synergies in the quarter and the inclusion of Norman Hay more than offsetting the negative impact of COVID-19.\nAnother bright spot in the quarter was our cash flow.\nAs we discussed in our last call, because our business is so asset light, with most of our investment in working capital versus property, plant and equipment, when we experience a major downturn in volumes, we expect to see significant positive cash flow from releases in working capital.\nIndeed, we saw this in both Q2 and Q3 and are pleased to report that our year-to-date operating cash flow more than tripled versus last year to $112 million.\nIn addition, our low capital intensity allows us flexibility with our capital spending, and consistent with our Q2 call, we're on pace to reduce our capex by more than 30% versus our original pre-COVID estimate.\nAs a result of our strong cash flow, we were able to reduce net debt by $58 million, a 7% reduction from Q2.\nThis improves our leverage ratio to 3.4 times from 3.7 times at the end of June, and our bank calculated leverage at the end of Q3 was about 2.9 times versus our covenant maximum of 4.25 times.\nIn short, our liquidity and leverage showed good improvement from already solid levels.\nIn addition, as Mike noted, we further increased our estimates of expected Combination cost synergies from $53 million to $58 million in 2020, from $65 million to $75 million in 2021, and from $75 million to $80 million in 2022.\nIn summary, our track record of navigating successfully through tough economic environments by gaining share, disciplined cost management, and generating good cash flow during major downturns all give us confidence in our ability to weather the current challenges.\nThis strong core operating performance is further enhanced by the cost synergies we are realizing from the Combination, and we're seeing the meaningful impact [Technical Issues] synergies have on our financial performance.\nIn 2021, as Mike mentioned, we expect to see a greater than 20% increase in adjusted EBITDA.\nFinally, we believe the Company is well positioned to leverage the expected upswing in business activity.\nSummary: ",

customers' needs.\nI am very proud of what the Quaker Houghton team has done to continue to service our customers as well as continue our integration.\nWe were pleased with our results for the fourth quarter.\nOverall, our sales were sequentially up 5% with all regions or segments showing revenue growth, which was primarily being driven by higher volumes as our businesses continue to come back from the negative impact that COVID-19 had on our end markets.\nThe sequential increase was strongest for us in EMEA as we saw an increase in sales of 13% compared to the third quarter.\nI think it is interesting to look at our revenue changes from the fourth quarter of 2019, which was pre-COVID of course.\nOverall, our sales were down only 1% and our volumes were relatively flat but there was a difference when looking at this by region or segment.\nThe only area that showed an increase in volume sold was Asia Pacific, which had an increase of 8% versus prior year, primarily being driven by higher sales in China and India.\nEMEA was relatively flat on volumes, mainly due to the fourth quarter of '19 being an unusually weak quarter.\nAmericas was down 2% on volumes, primarily due to our end market still being impacted by COVID.\nAnd our global specialty business volumes were down 9%, primarily driven by lower aerospace maskant sales.\nI also want to point out that our ability to gain new pieces of business and take market share contributed significantly to our performance as our analysis shows that we had total organic sales growth due to net share gains of approximately 4% in the fourth quarter of '20 versus the fourth quarter of '19.\nSo while we were overall relatively flat in our volumes, the 4% net share gains made a big difference, as did our Asia Pacific growth, helping to offset the negative COVID impact on our end markets.\nI am very pleased to see the continued improvement from last quarter, but we're certainly not all the way back.\nAs we said previously, we estimate we'll take approximately two more years for our end markets to fully return and some markets like aerospace, which makes up about 3% of our sales, may take up more time than that.\nHowever, we expect our sales to rebound more quickly due to our projected continued market share gains as well as making acquisitions, which I'll now talk more about.\nAs you may have noticed, since our last conference call, we did make two small bolt-on acquisitions.\nThe first was a private company called Coral Chemical based in the US that we purchased in mid-December for $53 million net of cash acquired.\nCoral provides technical expertise and product solutions for pre-treatment, metalworking and waste treatment applications to the beverage can and general industrial end markets.\nCoral had approximately $37 million in net sales and approximately $5.5 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2020.\nFor this acquisition, we also expect to achieve annualized synergies of approximately $3 million over the next two years.\nAlso in February, we bought assets related to tin-plating solutions, primarily for the steel end markets for $25 million, which will add full-year net sales of approximately $8 million and approximately $4 million of full-year adjusted EBITDA going forward.\nSo we are pleased with the strategic additions to our product portfolio, which we estimate will add about $11 million of EBITDA in 2021, which equates to an approximate 7 times EBITDA multiple purchase price for the combination of these two acquisitions.\nSo overall, we were pleased with the quarter given the environment we're operating in and we saw a good sequential improvement in our sales and adjusted EBITDA.\nSynergy achievement also was a factor on our results as we achieved $18 million in this quarter compared to $5 million in the fourth quarter of last year.\nIn addition, our strong operating cash flow of $66 million in the quarter allowed us to reduce our net debt by another $24 million for the full year.\nAnd for the full year, we reduced debt by about 12%, in addition to making the Coral acquisition.\nThe positive cash flow nature of our business during severe downturns is something we have discussed with investors in the past and we have seen this positive impact again over the past year.\nAnd reflecting upon the full year, the past 12 months have been challenging due to COVID-19, but I'm very pleased with our overall performance.\nOver the past year, we continue to service and supply our customers despite difficult economic conditions.\nWe continue to gain share in our markets and we completed a significant part of our integration activities.\nAnd we were able to realize $58 million of cost synergies, which exceeded our previous estimate of $35 million.\nWe also made these two additional bolt-on acquisitions, which will add approximately $11 million to our adjusted EBITDA in 2021.\nAnd even with those acquisitions, we were able to reduce our debt by 12% or $94 million.\nSo in short, we are delivering on the powerful benefits that we anticipated for our combination with Houghton [Phonetic].\nAs we look forward to 2021, we expect some short-term headwinds from higher raw material costs and lower-than-expected volumes to the automotive market due to the semiconductor shortage.\nHopefully, these are just timing issues and will impact mainly the first half of the year.\nDespite these short-term headwinds, we feel positive about 2021and continue to expect a step change in our profitability with over a 20% increase in our adjusted EBITDA from 2020 as we complete our integration cost synergies, continue to take further share in the marketplace, benefit from a projected gradual rebound of demand in our end markets and see the positive impact of our recent acquisitions.\nAs far as the timing and why I made this decision now, I really wanted Quaker Houghton to be in a strong position when we made this transition and we are.\nThis year we will take a step-change in our profitability.\nWe will essentially complete our integration and we will pay down more debt and reach our targeted leverage ratio.\nWe have the right strategy in place, a strong management team, tremendous people throughout the whole organization and strong opportunities for above-market growth in our businesses for the foreseeable future.\nSo to me, our future is very bright.\nAnd this is the right time to make this transition.\nAnd I look forward to continuing to be involved in the company's bright future as Chairman of the Board following my retirement.\nI am so proud of how our team has performed in servicing our customers, meeting their needs and successfully continuing with our integration execution, which was both critical and difficult for us this past year.\nPeople are everything in our business.\nAnd by far, most valuable asset, ensuring their safety and well-being is and will continue to be a top priority for us.\nI'm proud of them very happy with our Quaker Houghton team and what we have and will be able to accomplish for our customers and investors both now and going forward.\nI'll now hand it over the Mary so that she can review some of the key financials for you.\nThese are available on our website.\nPlease also note that updated risk factors will be included in our 2020 Form 10-K, which we plan to file next week.\nWe followed a similar review format for this deck as the one we used for our Q3 call where our comparison periods show actual and non-GAAP results and also pro forma sales and adjusted EBITDA as if we had been combined with Houghton throughout the periods presented.\nOur Q4 comparisons of 2020 and 2019 in this deck reflect actual results, not pro forma, as we completed the combination with Houghton in Q3 of 2019.\nFor the full year comparisons, I will generally compare 2020 to pro forma 2019 results so that you can see the periods on an apples-to-apples basis.\nAs Mike mentioned, the gradual recovery in our business that we began to see in Q3 of 2020 continued through Q4.\nQ4 net sales were up 5% sequentially as all segments benefited from a gradual increase in volumes and net sales were down only 1% compared to Q4 2019.\nRecall however that Q4 2019 was a relatively weak quarter that was negatively impacted by a widespread slowdown in industrial production, especially in Europe.\nFor the full year, reported net sales increased 25% in 2020 due to the inclusion of Houghton and Norman Hay.\nBut on a pro forma basis, sales were down 9%, primarily on lower volumes due to the global downturn in economic production as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGross margin of 36.8% in Q4 is up from 34.8% in Q4 of 2019, which was deflated somewhat due to inventory adjustments for purchase accounting for Norman Hay.\nExcluding these adjustments, we estimate Q4 of 2019's gross margin would have been about 35.3%.\nThe increase in gross margin Q4-over-Q4 is primarily a result of our progress in achieving combination-related synergies in logistics, procurement and manufacturing.\nOur sequential gross margin was down somewhat from Q3, reflecting a one-time benefit to gross margin in Q3 of approximately 0.5% and current quarter pressure from rising raw material costs and product mix.\nOn a full-year basis, gross margin was 36.2% versus 2019's 34.6%.\nExcluding similar cost adjustments of Q4, we estimate our gross margins in 2020 and 2019 would have been 36.3% and 35.7% respectively.\nLooking ahead, we expect to realize additional combination cost synergies throughout 2021, which should result in a gradual improvement to gross margin.\nWe expect to head toward the 38% gross margin area later this year as we further realize our combination synergies and manage prices to offset rising raw material costs.\nOn both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis, our Q4 operating income improved significantly and our non-GAAP operating margin of 11.3% is up 1.7% versus Q4 last year, reflecting a sequential recovery in sales this year and our combination synergies and the cost-saving actions we took to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19.\nFull-year GAAP and non-GAAP operating income also improved significantly.\nHowever, full-year operating margin declined due to the COVID-related steep decline in sales and volumes in Q2 and the resulting pressure from fixed cost absorption, which we discussed in our Q2 earnings call.\nOur reported effective tax rate was an expense of 4.9% in Q4 of '20 versus a benefit of 18.2% in Q4 of '19.\nExcluding various one-time items, our Q4 effective tax rates would have been approximately 30% and 24% respectively.\nFor full-year 2020 and 2019, we estimate that our effective tax rates, excluding non-core and one-time items, would have been approximately 25% and 22% respectively, in line with our guidance for this year.\nFor 2021, we expect our full-year effective tax rate will be in the range of 24% to 26%.\nOur non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.63 for Q4 is up 22% from $1.34 in Q4 of '19, due primarily to the improved operating income I discussed earlier.\nOur full year non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.78 was down from $5.83 last year but ahead of consensus of $4.67.\nOn Slide 11, we show the trend in our pro forma adjusted EBITDA.\nOur Q4 adjusted EBITDA of $65 million is up $4 million from Q4 last year and up $1 million sequentially.\nAnd our full-year adjusted EBITDA of $222 million is ahead of consensus.\nAlso, our adjusted EBITDA margins improved for both the quarter and the full year.\nOur Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin of 17% is up 1.5% versus 15.5% last year and on a full year basis, our adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 15.7% from our 2019 pro forma margin of 15%.\nThe improved margins are primarily due to the combination-related synergies we've realized, partially offset by the lower impact -- by the impact of lower sales due to COVID-19.\nOn Slide 12, we provide an update on our leverage and liquidity.\nAs Mike noted, cash flow was the star in 2020.\nWe frequently talked about how the asset-light nature of our business helps us to weather downturns as our main investment is in working capital versus property, plant and equipment and we released working capital and generate increased cash flow and economic downturns.\nWe saw this in 2020 during the financial crisis and we saw this year during the COVID pandemic.\nOperating cash flow for the full year was a record $178.4 million, allowing us to reduce net debt by 12% to $717.3 million, paid $53 million for the Coral acquisition, net of cash acquired and pay approximately $7 million in dividends.\nWe're delivering on our commitment to prudently allocate capital by prioritizing debt reduction, while continuing to pay our dividends and seizing growth opportunities which make strategic sense.\nAs a result of our prudent capital allocation, our primary leverage covenant of net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA continues to improve and was 3.2 times at year end 2020 versus 3.5 times last year.\nWe expect to be at our target level of 2.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2021.\nIn addition, our cost of debt continues to benefit from the current interest rate environment with our borrowing cost under 2%.\nIn summary, Quaker Houghton continued to deliver on its commitments in 2020 despite the very challenging market conditions we faced.\nAt that time, we were in the very early stages of the pandemic with no way of knowing what was to come.\nIt certainly turned out to be a very difficult year, but we focused on what we can control.\nWe kept our integration, execution and synergy capture on track and in fact ahead of schedule, we implemented additional cost savings actions to mitigate the fall off in sales and we continued to deliver market share gains.\nAs a result, we achieved record cash flow during the year and were able to reduce debt while continuing to execute on strategic acquisitions that make financial sense.\nIn 2021, we expect to see a greater than 20% increase in adjusted EBITDA and further expansion of our margins as we realize the full synergy benefits toward the end of the year.\nAnd now, back over to you, Mike.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I am Alexandra Deignan, the company's Head of Investor Relations.\nToday's discussion also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are meaningful when evaluating the company's performance.\nHosting our call today are Kenneth Jacobs, Lazard's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Evan Russo, Chief Financial Officer.\nToday, Lazard reported strong results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020.\nWe achieved record quarterly operating revenue.\nFinancial Advisory had a record quarter with strong performance across practices and regions.\nAsset Management's fourth quarter revenue increased 12% and achieved a record year end level of AUM.\nWe entered 2021 with significant momentum as we serve clients positioning themselves for a post pandemic recovery.\nIn Financial Advisory, our M&A activity progressed throughout 2020.\nOur global announcement volume increased 3% even as the markets volume declined 10%.\nThis reflected strong activity in both the US and Europe.\nIn particular, our volume of French and UK announcements increased 34% and 37% respectively from the prior year.\nOur preeminent global restructuring practice continued its work on a wide range of complex assignments.\nIn 2020, Lazard ranked number one in the league tables for completed restructurings globally.\nAs we anticipated, the pace of new restructuring assignments in Europe increased.\nOur sovereign capital and private capital advisory businesses all had strong years as we advise governments, corporations and partnerships on financing strategy and capital raising.\nOur private equity secondary business continues to grow and we are advising on a significant number of growth equity investments globally.\nWe continue to see opportunities for growth in Financial Advisory and have increased our pace of lateral hiring.\nIn 2020, we recruited 12 new Managing Directors globally, plus two more in January of this year.\nIn addition, we are promoting 15 new Managing Directors in Financial Advisory this month.\n10 of them began their careers here as analysts or associates.\nOur ability to develop talent organically remains a powerful competitive strength.\nOur Asset Management business also had a strong fourth quarter, with higher management and incentive fees, reflecting AUM growth and the performance of our strategies.\nOn assets under -- our assets under management increased by $31 billion or 14% from the start to the finish of the fourth quarter.\nOur investments in new strategies and product extensions continue to create new avenues for growth.\nOur quantitative business achieved net inflows for both the fourth quarter and full year as did our global equities and our global and multiregional fixed income platforms.\nWe are also seeing an increase in solutions oriented mandates as we serve more clients with customized strategies.\nWe continue to invest in Asset Management's growth through investment in people, technology and distribution as well as the development of new funds and the scaling up of existing platforms.\nIn 2020, we introduced eight new strategies for clients across our traditional and alternative platforms.\nThree of the strategies are from independent teams we recently recruited.\nAs the asset management industry undergoes a wave of consolidation, we see substantial opportunities to accelerate our recruitment of talent and investment teams, adding strategies that are complementary to our existing platforms.\nWe also continue to build our talent pool from within.\nThis year, Asset Management will name seven new Managing Directors in its annual promotion process.\nFirm wide, Lazard's results -- record results for the quarter underscore the strength of our diversified business model, our global platform and our deep culture of client service.\nWe entered 2021 with momentum across our businesses.\nWe see substantial opportunities for growth in both Financial Advisory and Asset Management and are investing to capitalize on them.\nEvan will now provide some color on our results and then I will comment on our outlook.\nLazard's full year and fourth quarter results reflect the stability and continued high performance of our businesses.\nOur fourth quarter operating revenue of $849 million was a record quarter for the firm, 20% higher than last year's period.\nFourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.66 increased 82%, reflecting the significant operating leverage in our model.\nAnnual revenue of $2.5 billion was about even with 2019, representing a strong recovery from the volatile environment of 2020.\nOur Financial Advisory business had a breakout fourth quarter, with record quarterly revenue of $509 million, which is 23% higher than our previous peak level in 2018.\nThe compelling story behind Financial Advisory's record quarter is that it was driven by strong contributions across our advisory practices and across regions.\nOur revenue performance demonstrates the earnings power of the diversified advisory business we have built.\nIn Asset Management, this story was similar as we generated $336 million in revenue for the fourth quarter, up 12% from the prior year.\nThis reflected contributions across our global platforms with accelerating momentum in a year of extreme volatility.\nFourth quarter management and other fees increased 10% sequentially from the third quarter, reflecting higher average AUM.\nFourth quarter incentive fees were up substantially from the prior year, primarily reflecting strong performance in our alternative strategies.\nAverage AUM for the fourth quarter was $246 billion, up 3% from last year's period and up 9% from the third quarter of 2020.\nThe sequential increase was driven by market appreciation of $25.4 billion and foreign exchange appreciation of $5.8 billion, partially offset by net outflows of $0.3 billion.\nFor the full year, we experienced net outflows of $11.4 billion, primarily in our value strategies within emerging markets and local equities.\nPlatforms with net inflows for the year included global and quantitative equities as well as our global and multiregional fixed income strategies.\nWe finished 2020 with AUM of $259 billion.\nAnd as of January 28, AUM was approximately $258 billion.\nThe decrease was driven by foreign exchange depreciation of $1.3 billion and net outflows of $1 billion, partially offset by market appreciation of $1.3 billion.\nLooking ahead across our franchise, in Financial Advisory, client activity is strong across our advisory practices globally in an improving environment.\nAsset Management is off to a good start in 2021 with AUM well above its average level for 2020.\nWe have a strong pipeline of unfunded mandates.\nWe continue to see demand for both our quantitative and fundamental strategies across our platforms as well as growing demand for our sustainable and customized solutions.\nTurning to expenses, our compensation ratio for 2020 on an adjusted basis was 59.5%, up from 57.5% in 2019.\nOn an awarded basis, our annual compensation ratio was 59.8% compared to 57.7% for 2019.\nThe increase reflected our investments for growth as well as the change in business mix this year.\nWe are maintaining our cost discipline while we navigate a volatile market environment.\nNon-compensation expense of $117 million in the fourth quarter was 10% lower than the same period last year, primarily reflecting a continuation of global travel restrictions and lower business development costs.\nOur adjusted non-compensation ratio for the fourth quarter was 13.7% and the ratio for the full year was 17.1%.\nAs business activity picked up in the fourth quarter, we saw commensurate rise in non-compensation costs especially related to variable expenses.\nOur effective tax rate for 2020 was 20.2% compared to 24.1% a year ago.\nFor 2021, we expect an annual effective tax rate in the low to mid 20% range.\nRegarding capital allocation, our business continues to generate significant free cash flow, which supports our goal of returning excess capital to shareholders.\nThroughout the year, we have been consistent in returning capital through our quarterly common dividend.\nIn the fourth quarter, we returned $51 million of capital to shareholders.\nYesterday, we declared a quarterly dividend on our common stock of $0.47 per share.\nIn 2021, we have resumed our share repurchase program in order to at a minimum, offset dilution from our year end equity grants.\nOur total outstanding repurchase authorization is now $267 million.\nLazard's financial position remains strong with ample liquidity and balance sheet flexibility.\nAs of December 31, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.4 billion.\nKen will now conclude our remarks.\nA few words on our outlook before we open the call to questions.\nIn the near-term, the macroeconomic outlook remains uncertain based on the ongoing health crisis.\nHowever, fiscal and monetary stimulus in developed countries and the rollout of vaccines globally are driving expectations of a recovery by the second half of this year.\nBoth of our businesses are already benefiting from growing optimism in boardrooms and investment committees.\nIn Financial Advisory, the forces driving global strategic activity have accelerated.\nTechnology-driven disruption continues to be a catalyst for M&A across industries.\nShareholder activism has resumed its growth after a brief pause during the first half of 2020 with increasing impact in Europe.\nThe rapid growth of SPACs alongside strategic and private capital, adds substantial dry powder to the M&A market.\nIn addition, climate risk is becoming increasingly relevant to company valuations and is an emerging catalyst for strategic activity.\nOur ESG expertise is well entrenched in our Asset Management business and increasingly in our Financial Advisory business as well.\nIn Asset Management, the expectation of low interest rates for the foreseeable future is a tailwind for our business.\nInvestors need for income and return is driving increased demand for risk assets, including equities and corporate and emerging market debt as well as alternative investments.\nIn addition, institutional investors are seeking sources of differentiated alpha, including ESG, thematic and alternative strategies.\nWe are in an excellent position to meet this demand with a world class investing franchise in markets that reward deep fundamental research and our quantitative strategies are competing effectively in the market for low-cost products.\nWe see substantial opportunities for growth across our businesses and we continue to invest in our people, capability and technology infrastructure to enhance our competitive edge.\nWe remain focused on serving all of our clients well, while we manage the firm for profitable growth and shareholder value over the long-term.\nIn one of the most challenging environments in modern history, they rose to the occasion serving our clients with outstanding financial advice and solutions and reinforcing this great franchise.\nI am proud to work with them.\nNow, let's open the call to questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:On the call today are Tim Crew, Chief Executive Officer; John Kozlowski, the company's Chief Financial Officer, Maureen Cavanaugh, our Chief Commercial Operations Officer; and Steve Lehrer, who leads our insulin biosimilar initiatives.\nA playback will be available for at least three months on Lannett's website.\nIn a moment, Tim will provide brief remarks on the company's financial results, as well as recent developments and initiatives.\nThen John will discuss the financial results in more detail.\nWe hope you remain safe and well as we all manage through the persistency of the pandemic.\nI'll start today reviewing some of the highlights of the past year that are relevant to our future before turning to the key elements we see in that future.\nFirst and foremost, in 2021, we continued to launch products and build our future portfolio.\nWe launched about a dozen new products, highlighted by a few significant contributors, including Levothyroxine tablets, Levothyroxine capsules and Clarithromycin.\nThe products we launched last year added new revenue streams and further diversified offerings, reducing our exposure and reliance on key products.\nWe also grew our base product pipeline with continued investment in a robust internal product development program.\nFor example, our recent Mycophenolate approval was achieved in just under 10 months, the third such product we developed to achieve so called first cycle approval in the past few years.\nWe have made great strides in our internal efforts including significant changes to our portfolio selection.\nSuch changes take time to be fully reflected in our financials, but we believe meaningful value is being built.\nFurther, we are working on our existing strategic alliance partners to expand our agreements to include new products.\nFor example, this past year Insulin Aspart was added to our HEC agreement, and more recently, generic Spiriva, Handihaler was added to our Respirent agreements.\nTogether these products represent multi-billion dollar markets with relatively few competitors expected.\nWe also formed a new strategic alliance partnership to launch Sevoflurane, a product with relatively few competitors and a market size of about $190 million based on IQVIA data.\nWe look to launch Sevoflurane in the back half of the fiscal year.\nThe second key accomplishment last year was even while we launched new products and grew our pipeline, we also maintained firm control over expenses and exhibited operating discipline.\nWe implemented and completed the cost reduction plan that included consolidating our R&D functions to a single location and lowered operating costs by approximately $15 million annually.\nThe third key accomplishment was that we significantly improved our capital structure.\nThis last year, we paid off our Term A loans with cash on hand and later successfully completed a full refinancing transaction of the Term B loans.\nThe refinancing transaction as we have often highlighted was significant for several reasons.\nFirst, we extended the maturity of our debt to 2026 from 2022, which is now after several of our larger and more meaningful pipeline assets are expected to launch and contributed to a reduction in our debt.\nSecond, we upsize our credit facility and substantially freed up cash flow, primarily due to the elimination of mandatory principal payments until maturity.\nThird, the new debt does not have any leverage covenants.\nFourth, as a result of this refinancing, in combination with working capital initiatives, we have improved our cash position.\nThus, we now have more ready resources to invest in growth opportunities.\nOf course, another accomplishment to note was in our teams, particularly in our plants and labs, showed up to work every day throughout the pandemic and maintained a reliable supply of our affordable medicines.\nThis, of course, despite all the extra challenges we have been doing so this past year.\nWe are quite proud of all of these accomplishments.\nOf course, there are also real challenges.\nWell, competition is a fact of life in the generic industry.\nThe competitive environment we encountered last year was particularly impactful because it involved some of our most profitable products.\nWe offset some of these pressures with the aforementioned new product launches and cost reductions, but the decline significantly exceeded the offsets.\nOn top of a particularly competitive environment, COVID-19 continued to impact our financial performance with more downstream influences.\nFor example, as we have said, the pandemic resulted in fewer elective medical procedures being performed, this reduction in limited sales and use of our cocaine-based product.\nAs a branded product, our Numbrino NDA carries a higher than average gross margin for us, so changes up or down in sales have a disproportionate impact on our bottom line.\nFortunately, we believe many of the negative past year are beginning to attenuate while the positive factors continue to foretell meaningful opportunities.\nWith that as a background and leaving John to note the specific financial results, I will turn to our outlook for the upcoming years.\nWe expect our overall net sales and gross margin to continue to face pressure by recent and anticipated competitive pricing of certain key products, partially offset again by the benefit of new product launches.\nWe also expect sales of our Numbrino NDA to be impacted by a continuation of further elective surgeries being performed.\nOnce the pandemic subsides, we would expect to see an increase in these types of procedures and along with that, an increase in sales.\nWhile we are forecasting a down year in sales and profits, we see fiscal '22 as a trough year.\nOur key products have already been impacted by notable competitive pricing pressure, thus, those products have less further downside.\nAt the same time, the relative future potential of our pipeline continues to increase.\nI also want to note that while we believe our generic ADVAIR DISKUS product has the potential to launch in calendar year 2022, we did not include any sales of the product in our FY '22 guidance.\nSimilarly, zolmitriptan is also not contemplated in our FY 2022 forecast, as a result of ongoing delays from our API supplier.\nNevertheless, we do expect both products to be meaningful contributors in fiscal 2023.\nSo now let's turn to our pipeline.\nWe continue to launch products [Indecipherable] approximately 13 ANDAs pending at the FDA including partner products, plus four additional products that are approved and pending launch.\nWe also have more than 20 products in development and expect to add more from both external and internal efforts.\nWe continue to target more valuable products than has been our historical average.\nWith regard to our large durable product pipeline, we currently have five disclosed assets.\nFirst, with our partner HEC, we have two insulin assets, Insulin Aspart, a fast acting insulin product and Insulin Glargine, a long-acting insulin product.\nCombined, the two products participate in a double-digit billion dollar US market as reported by IQVIA.\nSecond, our drug device respiratory portfolio with their partner Respirent now has three assets, generic ADVAIR DISKUS, which is filed with the FDA, along with generic Flovent Diskus, and most recently, generic Spiriva Handihaler.\nCombined sales of these products also represent a multi-billion dollar US market as reported by IQVIA.\nAs we have said, all of these products are differentiated from traditional generic products because of the significant technical expertise required for development and substantial plant investments made by our partners that needed to manufacture them.\nSo for all of these products, we expect only a handful of competitors.\nI will discuss next the significant progress we are making advancing these large durable product opportunities.\nWith regard to generic ADVAIR DISKUS, we have been in regular contact with the FDA regarding this priority application since it was accepted in May of this year.\nWe are encouraged by their level of engagement.\nWe anticipate a mid-cycle review update from the FDA sometime in the next few months.\nThus, we expect to provide a better sense of how the application is progressing on our next investor call in November.\nCurrently, we continue to participate more than one FDA cycle and believe, as just noted, an approval in US launch of the product is possible in calendar year 2022.\nFor those new to Lannett story, generic ADVAIR DISKUS is one of the larger assets in our filed pipeline.\nIt is also currently the closest to expected commercialization in our partnered respiratory portfolio.\nThe second most advanced product in our respiratory portfolio is generic Flovent Diskus.\nThe last patient for the pivotal clinical trial for this product has been dosed and we anticipate the analysis of the trial to be completed within a few months.\nWe are currently planning for an ANDA submission before the end of the current fiscal year and a possible launch in calendar year 2023.\nNext, as noted, we recently expanded our opportunities with Respirent to include generic Spiriva Handihaler.\nThe development arc for this product should be approximately 12 months to 18 months behind the generic Flovent Diskus product.\nHowever, as there were various IP matters involved, we're not commenting today on the specific launch timing expectations.\nFinally, as we have previously said, we're evaluating and in negotiations for additional product opportunities in inhalation respiratory space, particularly dry powder inhalers, and metered dose inhalers.\nThere continues to be additional multi-billion dollar market opportunities to pursue with both current and future partners.\nNow turning to our two biologic insulin products, starting with biosimilar Insulin Glargine.\nClinical material for the drug product has now been manufactured in the new dedicated manufacturing site, which is a very significant milestone.\nWe still expect to submit an IND around the end of the calendar year and commence the pivotal clinical trial early next calendar year.\nHowever, we have recently added a few months to the clinical timeline, due to current COVID-19 restrictions at the study site in South Africa.\nWe have also added a few more months to our timelines to address interchangeability with the FDA, which I'll discuss in a moment.\nThus, we currently think the biologics license application will be filed in the first half of calendar year 2023 and we would expect to launch in the first half of calendar year 2024.\nAlso note, China's version of the FDA, the NMPA has approved HEC's Insulin Glargine for China.\nThat product is made in the same new plant, where we have now just made our Insulin Glargine for clinical trials.\n[Indecipherable] we have added to the development plan to address the interchangeability with the FDA is related to an important recent FDA approval of the first biosimilar and interchangeable Insulin Glargine, the [Indecipherable].\nWe believe that interchangeability approval is good news for Lannett and HEC's insulin.\nIt demonstrates the FDA will approve interchangeable insulin products, which over-time should improve affordable access to these important medications.\nRegarding biosimilar Insulin Aspart, the development of the product continues and we currently anticipate a potential launch of the product about 15 months following Insulin Glargine.\nAgain, Insulin Aspart was produced in the same facilities, working with the same teams and technologies as Insulin Glargine, so we are able to leverage may be earlier Glargine investments in development and manufacturing that have been made by both Lannett and HEC.\nLike our respiratory portfolio, we see several opportunities to leverage our insulin assets.\nThere are other dosage forms of both Glargine and Aspart, such as vials and other distinct insulin products.\nThese opportunities again represent multi-billion dollar markets, as reported by IQVIA.\nWe also see opportunities to leverage our USA clinical data, 10 development and related IP, along with the manufacturing capacity at HEC to form a strategic alliance with third parties looking to accelerate their access to insulin products in international markets such as Europe.\nWell, discussions on such opportunities are very preliminary, such relationships could yield meaningful value for both ourselves and our partners.\nFinally, a few brief comments on Made in America [Phonetic] and ESG.\nWhile we see a future that includes several high technology products from overseas sources, today, we are mainly a US domiciled generic medicines company.\nLannett adheres to strict US laws and US environmental guidelines with regard to development and manufacturing compliance for our US made products.\nMost of our large generic competitors are already based overseas and don't face the same set of regulations and ship most of their products from the far side of the globe.\nWe are proud that today, we serve the US market from the US market and do so with an enviable track record and reputation for being a high quality and reliable manufacturer.\nWe point out these characteristics that make Lannett increasingly unique as a generic supplier so that our investors and customers think of Lannett when they consider Made in America in various ESG related initiatives.\nTo sum-up today's remarks, our accomplishments in fiscal 2021 were significant.\nWe faced head on a highly competitive market environment.\nWe launched new products and made important advances in the development of key products in our pipeline.\nWe expanded existing agreements that added three large durable assets to our respiratory and insulin franchises.\nWe refinanced our debt, improving free cash flow and extended our maturities beyond the expected launch dates of our large pipeline assets.\nWe continue to believe that the exciting products in our advancing and expanding pipeline still have the potential to transform our firm into $1 billion company by 2025.\nI'll begin with our financial results on a non-GAAP adjusted basis.\nFor the 2021 fourth quarter, net sales were $106.0 million, compared with $137.9 million for the fourth quarter of last year.\nGross profit was $26.4 million or 25% of net sales, compared with $48.9 million or 35% of net sales for the prior year fourth quarter.\nR&D expenses declined to $6.0 million from $6.6 million.\nSG&A expenses declined to $15.5 million from $15.6 million.\nOperating income was $4.9 million, compared with $26.7 million.\nInterest expense increased to $12.1 million from $11.3 million in last year's fourth quarter.\nNet loss was $7.4 million or $0.19 per share versus net income of $13.4 million or $0.31 per diluted share.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $12.1 million.\nTurning to our balance sheet.\nAt June 30, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $93 million, up from $81 million at March 31.\nCash increased during the fourth quarter due to a few factors.\nFirst, as a result of the refinancing, we did not have a principal payment on our debt.\nSecond, relates to working capital improvements that continued from the third quarter.\nAnd the third, was the receipt of income tax refunds.\nLooking ahead, we expect to receive additional income tax refunds continue to benefit from initiatives to improve our working capital and we have no mandatory principal payments on our debt until maturity.\nAccordingly, we expect to maintain a healthy cash position throughout the year and end fiscal 2022 with approximately $80 plus million.\nAs for our liquidity, we also have access to our $45 million credit facility, which today we have not drawn upon.\nTurning to our guidance, which as Tim mentioned earlier, does not include sales of generic ADVAIR DISKUS or zolmitriptan.\nFor fiscal 2022, we expect net sales in the range of $400 million to $440 million, adjusted gross margin as a percentage of net sales of approximately 23% to 25%, adjusted R&D expense in the range of $26 million to $29 million, adjusted SG&A expense ranging from $58 million to $61 million, adjusted interest expense of approximately $52 million, the full year adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 22%, adjusted EBITDA in the range of $40 million to $55 million, and lastly, capital expenditures to be approximately $12 million to $18 million.\nRegarding the phasing of the quarters, we expect net sales and adjusted EBITDA in Q1 to be lower than Q4, ramping up slightly in Q2 and continue to ramp-up more in the second half of fiscal 2022.\nThe increase is related to expected new product launches.\nGross margin in the first half of the fiscal year to be in the lower range of our outlook, ramping up to the upper end of the range in the second half of fiscal 2022 and operating expenses to remain relatively consistent throughout the year, though, we expect Q1 to be slightly higher than the other quarters, as they include certain compensation related expenses that are only recorded at the beginning of our fiscal year.\nWith that overview, we would now like to address any questions you may have.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Lexington believes that these statements are based on reasonable assumptions.\nAny references in these documents to adjusted company FFO refers to the adjusted company funds from operations available to all equity holders and unitholders on a fully diluted basis.\nOperating performance measures of an individual investment are not intended to be viewed as presenting a numerical measure of Lexington's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows.\nExecutive Vice Presidents, Lara Johnson and James Dudley will be available during the Q&A portion of our call.\nWe had a great first quarter overall and continue to make substantial progress on executing our business plan.\nAdjusted company FFO was $0.22 per diluted common share in the quarter, which included $10.9 million of lease termination income primarily associated with a legacy industrial asset in Durham, New Hampshire.\nDuring the quarter, we purchased three industrial assets for approximately $51 million and completed the fully leased development project in the Columbus market.\nOverall, these investments produced average estimated stabilized GAAP and cash cap rates of 6.1% and 5.9% respectively.\nMarket rents across our portfolio continued to grow.\nOccupancy is healthy and our industrial exposure represented over 91% of gross real estate assets at quarter-end excluding held-for-sale assets.\nWe continued to see the value of our industrial properties steadily increase during the quarter, and we believe the value of our office portfolio has also improved amid signs of the pandemic easing.\nThere are several factors continuing to drive up the overall value of our holdings.\nCapitalization rates continue to be under pressure replacement cost is increasing rapidly and tenant demand is driving rents higher.\nOur industrial portfolio is benefiting from all these trends with first quarter industrial base and cash base rent renewal increases of 14.6% and 5.4% respectively representing the most visible sign.\nThe factors driving valuations higher are also supporting a highly competitive investment landscape, and we continue to focus our time on finding the best risk-adjusted opportunities in our target markets in the Sun Belt and lower Midwest.\nIndustrial purchases in the quarter included two facilities in Indianapolis and one in Central Florida.\nAdditionally, we have approximately $206 million of assets, either under contract or with an accepted offer, which we expect to close later this quarter.\nAfter a slow start that is typical of the first quarter, current deal flow is robust, with more than $1 billion of investments under review.\nWe are mindful of pricing, as there continues to be a lot of capital chasing opportunities in a competitive market.\nOn the development front, we are finishing the construction of our Atlanta project in Fairburn and we are committed to two other projects in our target markets of Indianapolis and Central Florida.\nDevelopment and the purchase of vacancy continue to be attractive ways for us to produce stabilized yields in excess of what is available in the purchase market for fully leased buildings.\nWe leased 1.5 million square feet during the quarter and at quarter-end our stabilized portfolio was 97.8% leased.\nOur asset management team has done a terrific job in securing both lease extensions and new leases with increasing rents.\nIn addition to the three lease renewals in our single-tenant industrial portfolio, we raised occupancy at our multi-tenant industrial facility in Antioch Tennessee to nearly 100% and simultaneously increased base rental rates by approximately 16% for the two new tenants within the facility.\nSubsequent to quarter-end, we executed a five-year extension at our 423,000 square foot industrial facility in Lumberton North Carolina and increased base and cash base rent by 23% and 8.6% respectively.\nOur balance sheet continues to be in great shape, with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 4.6 times at quarter-end.\nOur cash balance at quarter-end was $170 million, including restricted cash and we had $94.5 million sold forward in our ATM.\nLiquidity was enhanced during the quarter by $58 million of sales at GAAP and cash cap rates of 6.3% and 6.5% respectively and will be augmented by retained cash flow throughout the balance of the year.\nSubsequent to the quarter, we sold our industrial facility in Laurens South Carolina for $40 million.\nCurrently we have assets under contract or with an accepted offer for an aggregate gross price of approximately $135 million.\nOur remaining non-core sale portfolio consists of 17 properties, which generated first quarter NOI of $8.2 million.\nWe believe the current value of this portfolio is approximately $290 million.\nFinally, we continue to make progress with our ESG efforts and have disclosed long-term environmental targets.\nIn addition, we distributed a tenant survey to collect data, gain feedback and identify opportunities to partner with our tenants.\nWe became a supporter of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures and a participant member of GRESB and we are working on reporting to the GRESB real estate assessment for the first time this year.\nThe two Indianapolis assets we acquired during the quarter are virtually identical buildings, each approximately 150,000 square-foot Class A facilities built in 2019, well-located in Northwest Indianapolis within one mile of I-65.\nThe properties are 100% leased, each with two tenants, and have a weighted average lease term of just under five years, with rental escalations of 2.5%.\nThe Indianapolis, central location, excellent infrastructure and its large high-quality labor pool make it very attractive to both users, particularly e-commerce distributors.\nIndianapolis is one of the top five cargo airports in the country, with the second largest FedEx hub in the world and it ranks as one of the top 10 U.S. bulk distribution markets.\nOur Central Florida acquisition in Lakeland is an example where we can add value through leasing up some vacancy in the facility.\nProperty is a brand-new 222,000 square foot Class A warehouse distribution center and is primarily leased on a long-term basis with 2.5% annual escalations to credit tenant Motion Industries a subsidiary of Genuine Parts Company.\nWe are currently in negotiations with a potential tenant for a portion of the remaining square footage and have multiple prospects viewing the additional space, as we work toward a stabilized cash yield forecasted to be approximately 5.3%.\nLakeland is a core sub-market on the I-4 corridor between, Tampa and Orlando, two of Florida's largest and fastest-growing MSAs.\nAnd the property is just a short distance away, from the new Amazon Air Hub facility in Lakeland.\nOur approximately 320,000 square-foot Rickenbacker project in Columbus, leased to a subsidiary of PepsiCo was completed in the first quarter.\nThe estimated GAAP and cash stabilized yields are 7.9% and 7.7%, respectively.\nAs Will mentioned, we continued to have an attractive pipeline of development projects under way.\nIn Atlanta, our Class A, 910,000 square-foot development project is expected to be substantially completed this quarter.\nAtlanta posted record positive absorption in the first quarter of over eight million square feet.\nIn the airport South Atlanta submarket where the property is located, led the Metro with over five million square feet of positive absorption.\nWe currently estimate our development costs to be approximately $54 million.\nAnd our stabilized cash yield is estimated to be around 5.25%, which assumes 100% occupancy and payment of our tenant of our core Promote.\nThe property is in a prime-location along the I-85, South sub-market of Atlanta and we've been seeing sales trade, at substantial premiums to building costs.\nToday I'll touch on the two development projects that we have begun funding in Central Florida and Indianapolis.\nThe Central Florida project is a Class A, 1.1 million square-foot warehouse distribution center, located on a 90-acre site with frontage along I-75 and near our recently purchased Amazon facility.\nThe estimated development cost is approximately $81 million.\nOcala is very well-situated for statewide Florida distribution requirements, located just north of I-75 Florida turnpike's split offering access to Tampa, Orlando and the East and West Coast of Florida as well as more toward Jacksonville and Georgia.\nOur Indianapolis project in Mount Comfort which we began funding subsequent to the quarter, is just 14 miles east of downtown Indianapolis with easy access to I-70.\nMount Comfort is one of Indianapolis fastest-growing modern logistics sub-markets and offers a very favorable labor profile relative to other competing submarkets.\nThe 1.1 million square-foot facility has an estimated cost of roughly $60 million.\nLike our Atlanta development project both projects feature market-leading specs, including 40-foot clear heights, efficient site plans truck court depths, building depth and column spacing and ample trailer and car parking, to meet the demands of e-commerce and other bulk distributors.\nThe shell completions are anticipated late in the first and second quarters in 2022, for the Ocala and Mount Comfort projects respectively, both with stabilized cash yields in the mid-5% range.\nWe'll continue to provide regular updates on the progress of these projects.\nWe generated adjusted company FFO of approximately $64 million or $0.22 per diluted common share in the quarter and adjusted company FFO would have been approximately $0.19 per diluted common share, excluding lease termination income of $10.9 million.\nRevenues during the quarter were $93 million, representing an increase compared to the same time period in 2020, mostly due to new acquisitions and the termination income I just mentioned.\nProperty operating expenses were roughly $11 million with approximately 88% attributable to tenant reimbursement.\nFirst quarter G&A was $8.4 million.\nAnd we expect our 2021 G&A range, to be $31 million to $33 million.\nOverall, same-store NOI increased 0.6% and would have been approximately 1.7% excluding single-tenant vacancy with our same-store lease portfolio at 97.5%.\nMore specifically, industrial same-store NOI increased 1.5% and would have been 2.8% excluding single-tenant vacancy.\nAt quarter-end, approximately 88% of our industrial portfolio leases had escalations with an average rate of 2.3%.\nOn the capital markets front, we took the opportunity in the first quarter to increase our availability under our ATM program to $350 million.\nAdditionally, we entered into forward sales contracts for an aggregate of 3.6 million common shares, which have not yet settled.\nAs of March 31, we had 8.6 million common shares unsettled under forward sales contracts which had an aggregate settlement price of $94.5 million.\nAs Will mentioned, our balance sheet is in terrific shape with low leverage and ample cash available.\nAt quarter-end, we had nothing outstanding on our unsecured revolving credit facility and unencumbered NOI remains high at 91%.\nIn addition, our consolidated debt outstanding was approximately $1.4 billion with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.3% and a weighted average term of 6.7 years.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Melinda will open and close the call and Bob will speak to segment performance and the financials midway through.\nWe'll then open the call to questions.\nAlthough we believe these statements to be reasonable, our actual results could differ materially.\nThe most significant risk factors that could affect our future results are described in our annual report on Form 10-K.\nWe encourage you to review those risk factors as well as other key information detailed in our SEC filings.\nWith that I'd like to now turn over the call to Melinda Whittington, La-Z-Boy's President and Chief Executive Officer.\nWe are delivering on plan and controlling the controllables even in these times of significant widespread global supply chain disruption.\nAcross the La-Z-Boy enterprise, we delivered all-time record high sales of $576 million with sales 29% ahead of the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 second quarter.\nOur business is much larger today than pre-pandemic, and we believe our momentum is sustainable.\nWe are poised to grow on this base of nearly $2.1 billion in trailing 12 month sales.\nAlso as expected, operating margins improved sequentially as our delivered sales for the quarter reflected pricing and surcharge actions taken to offset unprecedented rising raw material costs.\nAll in all, we are pleased with the momentum and growth we are experiencing during these challenging times.\nLooking forward, demand continues to be strong across the enterprise and our backlog remains at all time highs, even as we continue to increase capacity to service our customers and consumers.\nDuring Q2 of last year, businesses were just reopening and consumers were resuming furniture purchases.\nAt the time, written same-store sales for the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries network were unusually strong, up 34%.\nOff that base, written same-store sales for the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries network decreased 6% in the fiscal '22 second quarter.\nHowever, comparing this quarter to the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 second quarter written same-store sales for the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries network increased an impressive 26% for a compounded annual growth rate of 12% across the two years.\nSimilarly, while written same-store sales for our company-owned retail segment decreased 7% versus the unusual prior-year period written sales increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 12% across the last two years.\nFor Joybird, primarily an e-commerce business, it continued its strong growth trajectory accelerating to rate 56% more business this Q2 than in last year's second quarter and delivering an extremely impressive compounded annual growth rate of 40% across the last two years.\nAs we focus on addressing this strong ongoing demand and accumulated backlog, we continue to make strategic investments to increase capacity and improve capabilities and are producing more units than ever to service customers.\nWe're continuing to add manufacturing cells and now employ almost 40% more manufacturing personnel in pre-pandemic.\nIn Mexico, additional cells are coming online at our SLR facility and the first cells at our new [Indecipherable] plants are expected to begin operations in January, with that location of fully operational by fiscal year end.\nAnd we continue to work to minimize supply chain disruptions from those associated with lack of component parts such as electronic chips to those inherent in hiring and training new workers until they reach normal productivity levels.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, where possible, our procurement team is significantly increasing inventory for key components to minimize disruption while also working to diversify our supply chain with multiple sources in various geographies to protect against continued supply chain volatility.\nIn addition, early in Q3, we acquired the Furnico upholstery manufacturing business in the UK.\nFurnico has been manufacturing La-Z-Boy product for sale in the UK and Ireland since 2008.\nThis expansion of in-house manufacturing capability will provide greater certainty of supply to our customers in the UK and is a key step in building an integrated supply chain network for La-Z-Boy International.\nAlso during the quarter, we continued to return value to shareholders with a dividend payment and $15 million in share repurchases, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders in the first half of the year to $64 million across dividends and share repurchase.\nAnd finally, we were pleased to announce last month, the expansion of our Board of Directors to 12 members with the addition of Erika Alexander, who serves as the Chief Global Officer, Global Operations for Marriott International.\nErika has held various leadership roles for several of Marriott's largest brands and will bring a wealth of operational experience perspective and expertise to La-Z-Boy.\nImportantly, as we manage the current operational challenges across the business, we're also addressing the long term with our work on Century Vision, our winning strategy for growth through our Centennial anniversary in 2027 and beyond.\nAs I noted last quarter, Century Vision includes three key pillars.\nThe first is to leverage and reinvigorate the La-Z-Boy brand.\nThis includes leveraging the La-Z-Boy comfort message, a renewed focus on aging down the core consumer and accelerating our omnichannel offering.\nTo date, our marketing platform featuring Kristen Bell, has been successful in driving brand recognition including young -- including among younger consumers who say the La-Z-Boy brand is relevant to them.\nOur objective is to build on this sentiment and last month we produced a new series of commercials that showcase how La-Z-Boy's range of products meet our consumers' needs.\nAt the same time throughout the course of Century Vision will expand the vibrant La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries store base to approximately 400 locations across North America and will strengthen the entire network to remodels and relocations with some 30 projects on tap for this fiscal year.\nWhile the purchase journey may start digitally, our consumers like to visit our stores to shop providing us with a great opportunity to deliver the flagship La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries store experience.\nMost importantly, our goal is to connect with consumers along their purchase journey through multiple means whether that's online or in person.\nWith respect to the Company-owned stores, we've become very successful running our retail business where we benefit from the integrated wholesale-retail margin.\nWe continue to acquire independent La-Z-Boy Furniture Gallery stores to round out our portfolio where it makes sense for us and the dealer.\nWe recently signed an agreement to purchase five stores in the Alabama and Tennessee markets from the retiring dealer that will be accretive as we quickly and seamlessly integrate them into our portfolio when we close the transaction later in the third quarter.\nThe second pillar of Century Vision relates to Joybird where we have a sustainably profitable direct-to-consumer model, an exciting and relevant brand with significant potential.\nWe are fueling Joybird to drive disproportionate profitable growth through an increase in digital marketing spend to drive awareness and customer acquisition, ongoing investments in technology and expansion of product assortment and additional small format urban stores in high traffic areas.\nWe are excited to open a new store in LA, this month and have an additional stores slated to open by the end of this fiscal year.\nIn markets where we have Joybird small format stores, we consistently see a geo lift in the online sales, demonstrating the appeal of an omnichannel model across all brands and retail formats.\nWe also recently opened a virtual store at Joybird's LA headquarters for online shoppers to chat, call and video conference into a dedicated retail environment which has proven to be very successful both in terms of consumer satisfaction and closing sales.\nAnd the third pillar of Century Vision is to leverage and enhance our enterprise capabilities to support the growth of our consumer brands as well as enable the potential for tack-on acquisitions that can benefit from our supply chain expertise and accelerate the La-Z-Boy Incorporated growth story.\nStrengthening digital capabilities across the entire La-Z-Boy enterprise and improving the agility of our supply chain, so that it can more broadly support all our customer brands will be key focus areas moving forward.\nAll in, as we execute Century Vision, we expect to grow the topline higher-than-industry averages and deliver double-digit operating margins.\nWe are proud of our near term results and excited for our future.\nOn a consolidated basis, fiscal '22 second quarter sales increased 25% to a record $576 million versus the prior year quarter, an increase sequentially from the fiscal '22 first quarter reflecting continued strong demand and ongoing capacity increases as well as the effects of pricing and surcharges.\nCompared with the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 second quarter, sales were 29% higher for a compounded annual growth rate of about 14% over the last two years.\nConsolidated GAAP operating income increased $54 million versus the prior year period and non-GAAP operating income increased to $52 million.\nConsolidated GAAP operating margin was 9.4% and non-GAAP operating margin was 9% up sequentially from the first quarter.\nGAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.89 for the fiscal '22 second quarter versus $0.75 in the prior year quarter.\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.85 in the current year quarter versus $0.82 in last year's quarter.\nMy comments from here will focus on our non-GAAP reporting unless specifically stated otherwise.\nI will now review our results by segment.\nDemand for product across all businesses remains strong.\nStarting with our wholesale segment, delivered sales for the quarter grew 28% to $439 million compared with the prior year period and increased 12% sequentially from Q1.\nCompared with the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 second quarter, sales were 25% higher for a compounded annual growth rate of 12%.\nNon-GAAP operating margin for the wholesale segment was 9.1% versus 12.2% in last year's second quarter, primarily reflecting higher raw material and freight costs, start-up costs for new facilities and labor challenges, partially offset by pricing and surcharges, fixed cost leverage on higher volume and lower marketing spend as a percentage of sales.\nAll in, we were pleased with the results and the progress we made sequentially from the first quarter operating margin of 4.7%.\nTurning to the retail segment.\nFor the quarter, delivered sales increased 19% to $192 million.\nDelivered same-store sales increased 17% versus the year-ago quarter.\nCompared with the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 second quarter, delivered sales increased 30% for a compounded annual growth rate of 14%, again demonstrating the strength of the La-Z-Boy brand and our furniture gallery store system in this environment as well as ongoing strong execution at the store level with sales metrics positive across the board.\nNon-GAAP operating margin increased to a second quarter record of 12.5% versus 9.4% in the prior year quarter, driven primarily by fixed cost leverage on the higher delivered sales volume as well as expense management.\nSales for Joybird which are reported in corporate and other increased 37% to $40 million versus the prior year quarter.\nOn a two-year basis, compared with a -- the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 second quarter delivered sales increased in impressive 93% for a compounded annual growth rate of 39%, reflecting the momentum Joybird is building and the direct to consumer marketplace as we continue to acquire customers and strengthen brand awareness through new digital marketing channels.\nFor the quarter, Joybird increased both its web and in-store traffic, conversion and average ticket.\nJoybird's sustaining profitability and with a focus on accelerating disproportionate growth, we will continue to invest in Joybird marketing to drive broader brand awareness and customer acquisition.\nPulling all of this together, consolidated non-GAAP gross margin for the entire Company for the fiscal '22 second quarter decreased 500 basis points versus the prior year quarter, primarily driven by significant increases in raw material and freight costs, start-up costs associated with the expansion of our manufacturing capacity and labor challenges in our wholesale businesses.\nThese items were partially offset by pricing and surcharges in our wholesale business.\nConsolidated non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of sales for the quarter decreased 280 basis points, primarily reflecting fixed cost leverage on the higher sales volume, mainly in our retail segment as well as lower marketing spend as a percentage of sales.\nOur effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for the fiscal '22 second quarter was 26.6% versus 26% in the second quarter of fiscal '21.\nOur effective tax rate varies from the 21% federal statutory rate, primarily due to state taxes.\nWe expect our effective tax rate for the full fiscal '22 year to be between 25.5% and 26.5%.\nYear-to-date, we generated $15 million in cash from operating activities.\nWe ended the period with $297 million in cash and no debt and held $31 million in investments to enhance returns on cash.\nYear-to-date, we invested $59 million and higher inventory levels to protect against supply chain disruptions and support increased production and delivered sales.\nWe also spent $33 million in capital year-to-date, primarily related to improvements to our retail stores, plant upgrades at our manufacturing distribution facilities, new upholstery manufacturing capacity in Mexico and technology upgrades.\nAs a note, last month we entered into a new five-year $200 million unsecured revolving credit facility which replaced our $150 million ABL facility.\nThe new facility has a $100 million accordion feature, allowing us to expand our borrowing capacity to support future growth.\nIt also provides the option to request to extend the term beyond five years for two additional periods of one year, each.\nBorrowings under the facility may be used for general corporate purposes and working capital.\nAs of today, we have no borrowings against the facility.\nRegarding cash returned to shareholders, during the quarter, we continued to buy back shares, spending $15 million repurchasing more than 400,000 shares of stock in the open market leaving 8.6 million shares in our existing authorized share repurchase program.\nYear-to-date we have returned $51 million to shareholders via share repurchase.\nWe also paid $6.6 million in dividends to shareholders in the second quarter.\nAnd subsequent to quarter end, demonstrating its confidence in the Company's long-term growth prospects, the Board of Directors increased the regular quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.165 per share.\nAs we looked at the future, from a capital allocation perspective, over the long term, we will target to invest roughly half of operating cash flow back into the business via capex and M&A and return the remainder to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.\nBefore turning the call back to Melinda, let me highlight several important items for the remainder of fiscal 2022.\nAs noted, demand trends were strong across the business and remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels with the high backlog and plants for a continued increase in capacity as new assembly cells come online, we expect a strong year of shipments.\nAccordingly, we expect to continued increase in production capacity, particularly in Q4.\nRaw material and freight costs remain high and global supply chain disruptions continue.\nIndustry experts predict it will take multiple quarters before we see resolution of the West Coast shipping backups.\nElectronic chip shortages continue which impact our power furniture.\nAcross multiple areas, we expect to face continued supply chain disruptions with respect to having all component parts available to finished units and complete orders, particularly for our Company-owned retail segment, which tends to disproportionately sell our higher end products.\nGiven the COVID-related shutdown of Vietnam, we expect our case goods business to experience a significant temporary decline in sales and margin in the third quarter reflecting a delay in shipments as manufacturing facilities restart there and product gets on the water.\nFinally, we will continue to monitor the escalating freight environment to determine if further pricing actions needed.\nPulling all this together, we are actively managing supply inputs and recognize that we will likely continue to experience uncertainty and disruption for the foreseeable future, particularly in the third quarter.\nQuarterly trends will also be impacted by our third and fourth quarters containing 12 and 14 production weeks respectively compared to 13 production weeks in our second quarter.\nRecall fiscal 2022 will include 53 weeks of results.\nTaking all of these factors into consideration, we expect sales and margin in Q3 to be similar to Q2 and expect sales and margin to accelerate in the fourth quarter to enable consolidated La-Z-Boy results to finish the fiscal year with a full year non-GAAP operating margin at or near double digits.\nFinally, as we make investments in the business to strengthen the Company for the future, including work related to our Century Vision strategy, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $75 million to $85 million for fiscal '22.\nSpending will support updating our La-Z-Boy Furniture Gallery stores; updates to our plants and distribution facilities in Neosho, Missouri; new upholstery manufacturing capacity in Mexico; and investments and technology solutions across the organization.\nI'm extremely proud of our organization and our business partners for delivering these strong results in very challenging times.\nThe team is doing a great job navigating the uncertain environment and is setting us up for strong business growth as we move forward both in the near term and as we execute our Century Vision.\nThe best is yet to come for La-Z-Boy Incorporated as we deliver profitable growth and long-term value for all stakeholders.\nWe'll begin the question-and-answer period now.\nMatt, please review the instructions for getting into the queue to ask questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Please note that this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay.\nFor information on how to access the replay, please visit our website at mdcholdings.com.\nThese and other factors that could impact the Company's actual performance are set forth in the Company's third quarter 2020 Form 10-Q, which is expected to be filed with the SEC today.\nIt should also be noted that SEC Regulation G requires that certain information accompany the use of non-GAAP financial measures.\nM.D.C. Holdings posted another quarter of strong operating results, highlighted by year-over-year home sales revenue growth of 33%, homebuilding operating margin expansion of 370 basis points and net income growth of 96%.\nNet new order growth for the quarter increased 73% as compared to last year on a sales pace of 6.1 homes per community per month.\nThese results underscore the excellent homebuilding fundamentals we are currently experiencing across our markets and demonstrate our ability to grow our operations while continuing to improve our profit margins.\nHomes increasingly serve as offices, classrooms and places of entertainment for the family, and as a result, people have gravitated to a living environment then can be accommodated in this new reality.\nWhile this trend has been a positive development for the overall housing market, it has been particularly beneficial to the new home market for several reasons.\nFirst, there is a limited existing inventory for consumers to choose from.\nAccording to the National Association of Realtors, total housing inventory at the end of September totaled 1.4 million units, which was down 19% from a year ago and represents less than a three-month supply of homes.\nSecond, a newly constructed home gives consumers the peace of mind that they will be living in a home that no one else has lived in, which is a real selling point for many families during these uncertain times.\nSupplementing the demand we've experienced as the pandemic, is the demographic shift toward home buying that we believe will serve as the tailwind for industry moving forward.\nMillennials are increasingly aging into their prime home buying years, while baby boomers and empty nesters are looking to downsize into homes that fit their new lifestyles.\nMDC is well positioned to take advantage of these demographic shifts due to our strategic focus on opening communities with affordable products.\nHomebuyers of all ages are looking for value when it comes to buying a home, and we have found ways to accommodate the desires through more efficient floor plans, while the combination of lower rates and pandemic-related buying has spurred demand across all product types, we believe the more affordable segments of the market will be the most resilient over time.\nWe have been fortunate in having a deep bench at MDC.\nAnd to that end, I am pleased that Rebecca Givens has agreed to step into Michael's role as Senior Vice President and General Counsel.\nOn the operations side, David Viger has moved into the important role as Chief Operating Officer of our homebuilding operations.\nAnthony Berris has been promoted to President of our Financial Service operations.\nAnd Dawn Huth has taken on additional responsibilities as Senior Vice President of National Finance.\nAll of these individuals have proven themselves to be highly capable leaders during their time at MDC, and I look forward to them contributing to our continued success in the future.\nFinally, I'd like to congratulate David Mandarich, who has been elected as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.\nDavid has been associated with the Company since 1977, most recently as our President and Chief Operating Officer.\nAnd he is widely regarded as one of the most skilled leaders within the homebuilding industry.\nHis move into the CEO role is a key step in the evolution of our Company.\nAnd I look forward to continued collaboration with him on strategic directions of the Company.\nDavid will be participating with me in our earning calls going forward.\nWe experienced strong topline growth for the quarter as home sale revenues increased by 33% year-over-year to $1 billion.\nHomebuilding operating margin improved by 370 basis points from the prior year quarter, resulting in a 109% increase in pre-tax income from our homebuilding operations to $101.7 million.\nIn addition, our financial services pre-tax income increased $10.3 million, or 73%.\nThe increase was due to our mortgage business, which continued to benefit from a higher interest rate lock volume and increased capture rate and better net interest income on loans originated during the quarter.\nAs a result, net income increased 96% to $98.9 million, or $1.49 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2020.\nOur tax rate increased from 19.5% to 21.5% for the 2020 third quarter.\nThe increase in rate was primarily due to changes in the estimated amount of energy tax credits to be received during the respective quarters.\nFor the fourth quarter, we currently estimate a 25% tax rate, excluding any discrete items.\nHomes delivered increased 25% year-over-year to 2,147, driven by an increase in the number of homes we had in backlog to start the quarter, and to a lesser extent, an increase in our backlog conversion rate.\nThe average selling price of homes delivered during the quarter increased 6% to about $466,000.\nThe increase was the result of price increases implemented across the majority of our communities over the past 12 months, as well as a shift in the mix of homes closed from Nevada to Southern California.\nWe are anticipating home deliveries for the fourth quarter of 2020 to reach between 2,400 and 2,600 units.\nBacklog conversion for the fourth quarter will be significantly lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of the considerable year-over-year increase in orders during the 2020 third quarter, many of which are unlikely to deliver this year.\nWe expect the average selling price for 2020 fourth quarter unit deliveries to again exceed $460,000.\nGross margin from home sales improved by 170 basis points year-over-year to 20.5%.\nWhile we have seen an increase in certain building costs, most notably lumber, as a result of the pandemic and other factors, we have been successful to this point in recouping these increased costs through home price increases.\nThis has resulted in improved gross margins on both build-to-order and speculative home deliveries across each of our homebuilding segments.\nGross margin from home sales for the 2020 fourth quarter is expected to approach 21%, excluding impairments and warranty adjustments.\nWe continued to demonstrate solid operating leverage during the third quarter as our SG&A expense as a percentage of home sale revenues decreased 200 basis points year-over-year to 10.4%.\nOur total dollar SG&A expense for the 2020 third quarter increased $10.9 million year-over-year, mostly due to variable commissions and marketing expenses that increased in line with our 33% increase in home sale revenues during the period.\nOur general and administrative expense was down slightly when compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation that was largely offset by an increase in salaries and other compensation-related expenses.\nOur overall headcount has increased by 5% year-over-year as we work to support the Company's strong growth trajectory.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2020, we may see our general and administrative expense increase to between $50 million and $55 million due to the 5% year-over-year increase in headcount I just mentioned, additional bonus accruals in line with strong operating results, and a potential charitable contribution to our Foundation.\nAs I previously mentioned, as a result of the continued expansion of our gross margin and our improved operating leverage, our homebuilding operating margin, defined as gross margin from home sales minus our SG&A rate, grew by 370 basis points year-over-year to 10.1%.\nOn the strength of this improvement, our last 12 months pre-tax return on equity increased 560 basis points year-over-year to 21.8%, which is our highest level in 15 years.\nLet's look at our net new home order information for the quarter on Slide 9.\nThe dollar value of our net orders increased 89% year-over-year to $1.65 billion, and unit net orders increased by 73%, driven by a 70% increase in our monthly absorption rate to 6.1.\nThe average selling price of our net orders increased by 10% year-over-year, driven by price increases implemented over the past 12 months, as well as a shift in mix to California, which has our highest average price.\nDuring the third quarter, our California markets had nearly as many net new orders as our Colorado markets.\nI'd like to note that we ended the quarter with 194 active subdivisions, which is slightly higher than a year ago.\nWith the strong sales activity we've experienced during the third quarter, we have a number of subdivisions that are approaching closeout earlier than expected.\nAs a result, we anticipate roughly 185 active subdivisions at year-end.\nAlthough this would be a decrease from the end of the third quarter, it would be unchanged from where we started the year.\nOn Slide 10, we provided further net new order detail by month since April.\nYou can see that sales activity ramped up significantly after the initial slowdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe saw order activity peak during the month of August, but September remained strong and well above the prior year, even after we increased prices in most of our subdivisions.\nWe also saw the rate of cancellations continue to decrease as the months progressed.\nWe expect some seasonality to kick in during the fourth quarter.\nHowever, October has remained very strong relative to the prior year.\nBased on the activity we've seen to date, we expect our October 2020 net orders to exceed our October 2019 orders by at least 50%.\nAs a result of our strong sales, we ended the quarter with an estimated sales value for our homes in backlog of $3.1 billion, which was up 47% year-over-year.\nThe average selling price of homes in backlog increased 4% due to price increases implemented over the past 12 months, decreased incentives, and a shift in mix to California.\nThese factors were slightly offset by a shift in mix to lower-priced communities consistent with our ongoing strategy of offering more affordable home plans.\nI will now turn to land activity on Slide 12.\nThe number of lots we acquired this quarter increased 63% year-over-year, reflecting our confidence in market conditions and our focus on continuing to grow our business.\nWhile the number of lots we approved earlier this year were down due to the uncertainty created by COVID-19, we approved over 3,800 lots for purchase during the third quarter of 2020.\nIn the end, in spite of immense volatility, the number of lots approved over the last 12 months has increased by 34% compared to the prior year period.\nAs a result, our total lot supply to end the quarter was 8% higher than at the same point in 2019, supporting our growth potential for future periods.\nWe expect to see strong lot approval and acquisition activity continue into the fourth quarter given the robust demand that we have seen in recent months and our conviction about growth prospects for housing in future years.\nIn summary, clearly, we are encouraged by the resilience the housing market has shown in the third quarter given the immense challenges our country has faced in 2020, and we believe that we have executed our operating strategy well in this volatile environment.\nMore importantly, we see an opportunity to sustain growth well into the future, supported by solid demographics and changing customer preferences.\nOur current backlog, not only puts us in position for a strong end to 2020, but also provides us with the opportunity for significant year-over-year increases in home sale revenues and pre-tax income to start 2021.\nWith our strong balance sheet and current land pipeline, we are well positioned to grow community count significantly in 2021 and have a preliminary target of at least 10,000 home deliveries for the coming fiscal year.\nWe are mindful that there are many risks to achieving this target, especially with COVID-19 still impacting our daily lives.\nThese risks will be closely monitored as we work to grow our Company and the safety of our employees, subcontractors and customers will remain top priority.\nFollowing our strong third quarter, our Board of Directors has declared a 21% increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.33 to $0.40 per share.\nThis represents a 33% increase from the prior year and demonstrates our commitment to rewarding our shareholders for their continued support.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We will reference this information during today's call.\nToday's earnings call will begin with Ward Nye, whose remarks will focus on the state of our business in light of the Coronavirus pandemic, the actions we have and are taking and the strength of our positioning to manage the current environment.\nJim Nickolas will then review our first quarter 2020 financial results and liquidity position, and then Ward will provide some closing comments.\nA question-and-answer session will follow Ward's closing remarks.\nFirst and foremost, we hope that you and your families are and remain safe and healthy as we confront the challenges and uncertainties presented by COVID-19.\nI also want to extend my sincere gratitude to our Martin Marietta team.\nI'm tremendously proud of how everyone is working together to manage through this unprecedented time and how the character of our employees has shown through.\nDay after day, Martin Marietta employees are safely and resolutely meeting the critical needs of our customers.\nThey're also supporting their local communities in both large and small ways donating vital supplies and equipment to healthcare workers and first responders, helping neighbors by picking up groceries and ensuring our colleagues are well cared for and safe.\nOur team has shown great courage, determination and resilience as we successfully meet our stakeholders' needs while never losing sight of our core values of safety, integrity, excellence, community and stewardship.\nThese values define us and our character.\nWe look at these foundational principles to guide our daily and long-term actions and decisions, particularly during difficult times.\nMartin Marietta remains open as an essential business.\nThat designation means we're continuing to provide heavy building materials and services to our customers even in those areas with shelter-in-place orders.\nCommunities across the nation must maintain their vital infrastructure and we're working hard to support that objective in a safe, efficient and responsible way.\nThrough the end of April, our workforce, operations and supply chains have seen little disruption.\nWe believe this is largely due to our company's decisive steps early to respond quickly to this pandemic, our domestic focused approach to sourcing supplies and materials and our expanded safety procedures, all of which are designed to protect Martin Marietta employees and the organizational health of the company.\nDuring this pivotal time, our focus is threefold: communication, resource management and business continuity.\nWe've implemented new robust protocols and practices, including remote working, social distancing and enhanced equipment and facility cleaning, consistent with guidelines for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the medical professionals who partner with the industrial hygienist familiar with our operations.\nThese protocols were updated on an ongoing basis as public experts provide additional guidance.\nWe also established a COVID-19 Planning and Communications task force, canceled all nonessential business travel and in-person meetings and established contingency plans with respect to staffing, and we've been actively engaged enterprisewide to enhance the substance and frequency of our communications to ensure the flow of the most accurate and timely information about our operations, thus enabling our employees, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders to stay fully informed.\nOur operations teams have shown considerable agility, flexibility and perseverance while keeping our business running smoothly.\nAmong other things, they've taken timely and responsible steps to clean and disinfect their facilities, while carefully screening necessary third-party visitors to minimize any COVID-19 exposure.\nAdditionally, for our colleagues that typically work in doors in close proximity to one another, we're utilizing a combination of social distancing as well as work-from-home protocols.\nOur employees are dutifully meeting their job responsibilities and remaining fully accessible.\nImportantly, whether working at an operating site, an office or remotely, our employees are empowered and encouraged to look out for one another.\nWith our team's safe and employee engagement high, we can be attentive to our other stakeholders, our customers, suppliers, creditors, shareholders and communities as we have an essential business to run.\nJim will discuss these results with you shortly.\nLet me first say that we're proud of these results, which underscore our commitment to operational excellence and to our disciplined strategies.\nWhile we had a promising start of what we believe would have been a record-setting 2020, we recognize this year will now be filled with an unprecedented level of uncertainty as the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic and societal outcomes continue to unfold.\nAccordingly, while we remain confident in the fundamental strength and underlying drivers of our business, we have withdrawn our 2020 full year guidance issued back in February.\nWe've not yet seen contractors and customers delaying or canceling building projects in a material way.\nWhile we typically do not comment on intra-quarter trends, these are atypical times.\nWe're making an exception and as highlighted on our supplemental information slides 13 and 14, we are sharing preliminary April shipment and pricing trends to provide greater transparency as to what we're now seeing in a COVID-19-impacted month.\nSpecifically, for the month of April, aggregate shipments remained elevated in most areas but did not match the near-record April 2019 volumes.\nWe saw notable growth in North Texas, Colorado and Indiana.\nCement shipments continue to be strong and are currently trending close to prior year levels.\nThe one notable exception is oil well cement shipments as demand continues to decline due to volatile and historically low oil prices.\nReady mixed concrete shipments are also trending near April 2019 levels, even as some homebuilders temporarily pause construction activity.\nApril revenues for the Magnesia Specialties business are $10 million lower than the comparable prior year period.\nDemand for our lime and periclase products has slowed dramatically as steel-producing customers temporarily idled their facilities in response to the COVID-19-induced shutdown of certain domestic auto manufacturers beginning in mid-March.\nIn terms of April pricing trends, aggregates pricing improved mid-single digits over April 2019 as announced increases were broadly implemented earlier in the year.\nCement pricing is up, even with several competitors announcing plans to delay price increases until June 1.\nPrior to the COVID-19 outbreak, we were highly confident in realizing the full announced increase of $8 per ton implemented April 1, given overwhelming market support in a tight Texas cement environment.\nReady mixed concrete pricing is slightly higher than April 2019 levels.\nWe'll have a clearer picture of ready mixed concrete pricing trends for the remainder of the year as the phased reopening of the Texas and Colorado economies unfold.\nThough ours is a basic and durable industry, it does not mean that we're immune to the disruptions caused by the pandemic.\nOur economy is interconnected and dislocations in consumer behavior or other industries may impact Martin Marietta.\nAs such, looking beyond April, we anticipate product demand will soften in the coming months, with the private sector feeling the effects sooner than the public sector.\nThe timing, duration and extent of weaker demand levels are presently unknown.\nInfrastructure, particularly for aggregates-intensive highways and streets, is expected to be the most resilient of the company's three primary end uses in the near term.\nThe vast majority of state departments of transportation are operational and continue to advertise and award projects.\nNonetheless, we expect many state DOT budgets will face temporary headwinds from lower fuel taxes, tolls, user fees and other related revenue collections as much of the nation has been sheltered in place.\nThe impact of lower funding levels is expected to become more meaningful in the second half of 2020, absent congressional action and will vary considerably among the states.\nFlorida DOT, for example, has accelerated over $2 billion of critical transportation projects to leverage construction efficiencies resulting from lower vehicle traffic, including closing additional travel lanes and performing more daytime hours work.\nTo help mitigate state DOT funding risks, industry representatives are actively engaging with Congress to address surface transportation in the Phase four emergency relief and economic recovery COVID-19 legislation.\nThe first recommendation is the federal backstop of nearly $50 billion in immediate flexible funding to offset the estimated 30% loss in state transportation revenues over the next 18 months.\nThe second recommendation is the passage of a comprehensive major surface transportation reauthorization package.\nWe believe our industry is better equipped than in recent history to execute on an infrastructure build given the backlog of fully designed projects.\nNonresidential construction activity on existing projects has broadly continued in most regions.\nHowever, many commercial projects and the engineering or planning stages are being delayed or canceled, particularly for office, retail and hospitality.\nSome industrial activity, on the other hand, is not expected to experience significant near-term disruption from COVID-19, warehouses, distribution centers and data centers are expected to perform relatively well in the current environment, as businesses increase e-commerce activity, secure regional supply chains and become more reliant on cloud and network services.\nSimilarly, large energy sector projects along the Gulf Coast of Texas that are already under way are expected to continue.\nThe residential market is expected to experience the most rapid and perhaps steepest decline from the impacts of COVID-19 as unemployment and general economic instability of home buyers and home developers to delay plans.\nHowever, in contrast to the Great Recession, we do not anticipate a prolonged period of reduced residential activity.\nToday's housing inventories remain near all-time lows despite notable population gains in Martin Marietta states and to benefit from historically low interest rates.\nAs we prepare for the secondary effects of the economic fallout from the Coronavirus, we rely on our values-driven culture.\nAs I emphasized earlier, the safety, health and well-being of our employees, customers, communities and other stakeholders remains our top priority.\nWith established protections in place to accomplish this, we're focused on our business priorities of generating cash flow, preserving liquidity and adjusting costs to align with product demand.\nOur team has developed extensive plans for a variety of economic scenarios, and we're ready to implement them with immediacy and integrity as warranted.\nIn addition to strengthening our balance sheet through a timely $500 million bond offering in early March, we've cut nonessential costs, reduced capital spending for discretionary projects and implemented hiring restrictions.\nWe're tightening our belts and aligning our capacity with demand consistent with our commitment to being prudent stewards of shareholders' capital.\nWe will reevaluate these actions as visibility improves.\nHaving the right strategy, making the right decisions at the right time, and being able to safely execute them does matter a lot.\nAnd Martin Marietta will do just that.\nWe're well positioned geographically, financially and otherwise to successfully manage through today's unprecedented environment and emerge more resilient and capable.\nFirst, Martin Marietta has a much stronger geographic and competitive position today compared with any previous downturn in our more than 25 years as a public company.\nThis is noteworthy, considering we navigated through the Great Recession and remain profitable throughout, never suspended or cut a dividend and emerged with a healthy balance sheet.\nToday, we continue to generate record profitability on aggregate shipment levels much lower than our peak volumes in 2005, and with a geographic footprint that we've not only considerably expanded but also improved.\nMoreover, we continue to thoughtfully execute on our strategic plans, carefully positioning our business through aggregates-led expansion in high-growth markets with attractive fundamentals and leveraging strategic cement and targeted downstream opportunities.\nThese strategic plans not only provide Martin Marietta with new growth platforms, but also opportunities to expand our footprint to complement existing operations and build critical mass.\nWe now have leading positions in 90% of our markets, up from 65% a decade ago, which supports favorable pricing trends, economies of scale and cost flexibility.\nSecond, we have experienced teams with decades of collective industry knowledge and expertise.\nTogether, their leadership and contributions have produced strong and sustained financial returns for Martin Marietta and our shareholders as recently demonstrated by our one, five and 10-year cumulative shareholder return performance.\nThis is largely the same leadership team that successfully formulated our operational response and prudently addressed our business needs during the Great Recession, the most challenging economic environment our industry ever experienced.\nIn uncertain evolving times, proven cycle tested leadership and experience is critical.\nIn brief, Martin Marietta has the right strategies, priorities, experience and teams to responsibly manage us through these challenging times.\nI will briefly highlight our first quarter results as well as provide a summary of our financial and liquidity positions, both of which support our near- and long-term strategies.\nAs detailed in today's release, our first quarter financial and operational performance exceeded our expectations, particularly considering the record-setting prior year quarter that benefited from carryover work from an extraordinarily wet 2018.\nOn a consolidated basis, total revenues increased 2% to $958 million, a first quarter record.\nGross profit was relatively flat.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses improved 10 basis points as a percent of total revenues.\nDiluted earnings per share was $0.41 and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, decreased 6% to $149 million.\nThe Building Materials business achieved record first quarter revenues.\nAcross our geographic footprint, product demand trends remain strong, even in the Texas and North Georgia markets that experienced record or near-record precipitation levels.\nAggregates, cement and ready mixed concrete pricing also improved, with all divisions contributing to the solid growth, a testament to the strength of our markets, and the disciplined execution of our locally driven pricing strategy.\nBuilding Materials gross profit improved slightly.\nKey takeaways include the following: aggregates product gross profit decreased $5 million, largely due to our quarterly update of inventory standard costs.\nOur per ton production costs have been trending downward over the last 12 months as cost control measures and operating efficiencies have their desired effect.\nAll else equal, this would result in higher operating margins going forward.\nBut in this quarter, it also resulted in a $4 million expense as we reflected the lower cost in our updated inventory valuation.\nIn contrast, during the first quarter of 2019, we recorded an $11 million inventory valuation adjustment to reflect the higher production costs experienced during the weather-impacted year in 2018.\nWhile this cumulative $15 million year-over-year inventory standard variance reduced quarterly product gross margin by 260 basis points, lower unit production costs will provide future benefits.\nCement product gross margin expanded 1,170 basis points driven by improved cost absorption from higher production levels as well as increased shipments to the San Antonio, Austin and Houston markets.\nPricing gains, combined with lower maintenance and energy expenses also contributed to the improved margin.\nGross profit for the ready mixed concrete business declined $9 million.\nPricing improvements and double-digit shipment growth in Colorado were more than offset by lower Texas volumes from record rainfall, delaying projects in the Dallas/Fort Worth area as well as increased raw material costs.\nFor the Magnesia Specialties business, product revenues decreased 13%, consistent with expectations as chemicals customers continue to reduce inventory levels for reasons unrelated to COVID-19.\nNotably, product gross margin improved 500 basis points despite lower revenues, driven by ongoing cost control measures and lower energy costs.\nWe still currently anticipate the destocking trend of our chemicals customers to be transitory in nature.\nOur consolidated results included several items that affect comparability with the prior year quarter.\nTo provide additional clarity, we included a slide in the Q1 2020 supplemental information posted on our website that provides a normalized view of pre-tax earnings with the items affecting comparability removed from both current and prior year quarters.\nIn addition to the aggregates inventory standard adjustments discussed earlier, these items also included $6 million of other nonoperating expenses to finance third-party railroad maintenance in exchange for a federal income tax benefit of approximately $7 million, which drove the low-income tax rate for the first quarter 2020.\nLastly, we incurred a noncash expense of $2 million to implement a new paid time-off policy for our employees.\nAs you will see on slide five, first quarter 2020 earnings before income tax, absent items affecting comparability, improved $15 million.\nMoving on now to our capital structure.\nThroughout our history, Martin Marietta has operated with a growth mindset, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet to preserve our financial flexibility.\nAs a result, we have ample liquidity for the foreseeable future.\nGiven today's environment, that is an enviable place to be.\nWe will continue to balance our long-standing, disciplined capital allocation priorities to maintain that flexibility.\nOur priorities remain value-enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment and the opportunistic return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, all while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating profile.\nOur approach is intended to ensure our cash flows are sufficient for a range of scenarios.\nIn today's uncertain environment, that range of scenarios is broader and actions to enhance cash flows and preserve liquidity are even more important.\nBefore the extent of the economic disruption became better understood, we repurchased 211,000 shares during the first quarter.\nSince then, we have temporarily paused share repurchases.\nWe will continue to closely monitor the situation and as circumstances change, we will revisit this pause in our share repurchase program.\nTo further bolster cash flows, as Ward mentioned, we are reducing our capital spending for discretionary projects.\nWe now estimate full year capital expenditures will be $325 million to $350 million, down from our original guidance of $425 million to $475 million.\nWe demonstrated our ability to pull back on capital spending in safe and prudent ways that did not damage the business in the long run during the Great Recession.\nWe are doing that again now as appropriate.\nWe've strengthened the company's balance sheet and cash position with our timely bond offering in early March, issuing $500 million of 10-year senior notes at a 2.5% coupon.\nProceeds will be used to repay the $300 million of floating rate notes that mature later this month, with the bulk of the remaining cash preserved on the balance sheet.\nLooking forward, as you can see in our supplemental information slides, after satisfying the May repayment, we will have no additional bond maturities for more than four years.\nWe are confident in our liquidity position.\nNet cash, combined with the nearly $760 million available on our existing revolving facilities, provided total liquidity of approximately $880 million at the end of the quarter.\nAdditionally, at 2.3 times net debt to the consolidated adjusted EBITDA, we remain well within our target leverage ratio of two to 2.5 times at the end of the first quarter.\nIn summary, we are pleased with our solid first quarter performance and enhanced liquidity.\nIn regards to our 2020 full year guidance, we will reinstate earnings guidance once we have sufficient visibility to do so.\nThat said, we remain confident that the attractive underlying market fundamentals and long-term secular growth trends in our key geographies, both of which underpin the company's record 2019 performance and strong first quarter 2020 results, remain intact and will be evident once again as the U.S. economy stabilizes and recovers.\nMartin Marietta is well positioned geographically, financially and otherwise to responsibly navigate today's extraordinary environment and drive sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value as we move forward.\nWe have thoughtfully developed and consistently executed on our strategic plans positioning our business as an aggregates leader in attractive high-growth geographies, aligning our product offerings to leverage strategic cement and

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Ward and I will begin today's earnings call with a discussion of our full year operating performance.\nJim Nickolas will then review our 2020 financial results and liquidity position, after which Ward will discuss market trends and our 2021 outlook.\nA question-and-answer session will follow.\nWe sincerely hope that you and your families remain safe and healthy.\nBy all accounts, 2020 was extraordinary for Martin Marietta.\nWe're proud to have extended our long track record of financial, operational and safety excellence, particularly in a year filled with unprecedented disruption.\nMartin Marietta set new performance records, delivering our most profitable year and the best safety performance in our company's history.\nThese impressive results demonstrate our resilient business model and our team's commitment to Martin Marietta's vision and successful execution of our proven strategic operating analysis and review or store plan.\nAs noted, today's discussion focuses on our full year results and 2021 outlook.\nBefore doing so, I'll highlight a few notable takeaways from our record-setting fourth quarter.\nImportantly, we achieved solid shipment and pricing growth across all product lines as construction activity stabilized from the spring and summer months when we saw a greater impact from COVID-19.\nThese top line improvements, along with our steadfast focus on cost controls, resulted in 7% growth in consolidated total revenues; 20% growth in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or adjusted EBITDA; and a 40% increase in diluted earnings per share.\nFor the full year, we established new records for products and services revenues, profitability and adjusted EBITDA.\nSpecifically, full year consolidated products and services revenues increased to $4.4 billion.\nConsolidated gross profit increased 6% to $1.3 billion.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 11% to nearly $1.4 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $11.54, an 18% improvement.\nMartin Marietta's 2020 results marked the ninth consecutive year of growth in these financial metrics.\nOperating our business safely sets the foundation for our long-standing financial success.\nMartin Marietta's industry-leading safety performance continues to trend near or exceed world-class safety levels.\nWe achieved a 25% reduction in total reportable incidents across the enterprise in 2020, and for the fourth consecutive year, we achieved a companywide world-class lost time incident rate.\nThese superior financial and safety results are directly attributable to the dedication and agility of our nearly 9,000 talented employees.\nI'm extraordinarily proud of how our team managed the challenges and disruptions caused by the pandemic, while remaining focused on being good wingmen, working safely and efficiently together and seamlessly meeting our diverse stakeholders' needs.\nWith that overview, let's now turn to our full year operating performance.\nAggregate shipments declined 2% to nearly 187 million tons, reflecting anticipated lower infrastructure shipments in portions of North Carolina, reduced energy sector demand and headwinds from COVID-19 disruptions.\nHowever, in line with broader macroeconomic trends, full year aggregate shipments to the residential market increased, benefiting from healthy single-family housing activity.\nAggregates average selling price increased 4% on a mix adjusted basis, in line with our expectations.\nImportantly, all divisions contributed to this solid growth, a testament to this product line's resilient pricing power and our leading market positions in attractive geographies.\nThe disciplined execution of our locally driven pricing strategy, along with attractive underlying market fundamentals will continue to support sustainable pricing growth moving forward.\nOur cement operations established new records for shipments, which increased 2% to nearly four million tons.\nLarge project activity supported underlying product demand in both North and South Texas throughout the year, offsetting weakness in the energy sector.\nPricing increased 3% on a mix adjusted basis, demonstrating the resilient price fundamentals of core products in the state of Texas.\nWe expect our cement business will continue to benefit from favorable shipment and pricing trends, supported by tight supply and healthy demand in Texas, diversified customer backlogs and April 2021 price increases.\nTurning to our targeted downstream businesses.\nReady mixed concrete shipments increased 3%, excluding shipments from acquired operations and from our Southwest division's former concrete business in Arkansas, Louisiana and Eastern Texas, which we divested in January 2020.\nConcrete pricing increased 2%.\nOur Colorado asphalt and paving business established a new record for asphalt shipments, increasing 15% to three million tons.\nThis growth reflected solid underlying product demand together with carryover work following a weather challenged 2019.\nAsphalt pricing increased nearly 3%.\nWe concluded 2020 with the highest full year adjusted EBITDA margin in Martin Marietta's history.\nDriving this achievement was our Building Materials business, which delivered record products and services revenues of $4.2 billion, a 1% increase, and record product gross profit of $1.2 billion, a 7% increase.\nOur Upstream Materials businesses, namely, aggregates and cement, established all-time records for both full year product revenues and gross profit.\nAggregates product gross margin expanded 130 basis points to 30.6%, a new record, and unit profitability improved 8%.\nThese accomplishments, which resulted from strong pricing gains, disciplined cost management and lower diesel fuel costs demonstrate the cost flexibility and resiliency of our aggregates-led business.\nThe Cement business benefited from the planned kiln maintenance outage that occurred through the end of 2019.\nThe timing of that outage resulted in some expenses being recognized in 2019 versus early in 2020.\nMore importantly, that and other capital investments have dramatically improved our cement operations.\nWe achieved 90% kiln reliability this year, up from 82% in 2019, which facilitated increased throughput and fixed cost absorption at both our Midlothian and Hunter plants.\nThese factors, combined with mix adjusted pricing strength and lower fuel costs contributed to the 510 basis point improvement in cement product gross margin to 37.8%.\nOur targeted downstream businesses also delivered solid full year financial results.\nReady mixed concrete product gross margin increased 10 basis points to 8.4% as pricing growth offset higher raw material costs.\nAsphalt and paving achieved gross profit of $60 million and a 100 basis point improvement in gross margin, driven by double-digit revenue growth.\nOur Magnesia Specialties business returned to revenue and profitability growth during the fourth quarter.\nThe 12% top line improvement in the quarter, however, was not enough to offset demand declines experienced earlier in the year.\nAs a result, full year product revenues decreased 12% to $221 million.\nWe anticipate fourth quarter strength in line with chemicals demand to continue in 2021, now that steel utilization has rebounded from last summer's COVID-19-driven trough and our cobalt customers are resuming activity.\nImpressively, product gross margin improved 80 basis points to 40.6% as we proactively responded to lower shipments with effective cost control measures.\nTurning now to cash generation, capital allocation and liquidity.\nMartin Marietta ended 2020 with the strongest cash generation in our history.\nOperating cash flow of $1.05 billion increased 9%, driven by earnings growth.\nWe continue to balance our long-standing disciplined capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and preserving financial flexibility to further enhance shareholder value.\nOur priorities remain focused on value-enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment and the consistent return of capital to shareholders while maintaining our investment-grade rating profile.\nFor 2020, we invested $360 million of capital into our business and returned $190 million to shareholders through both an increased dividend and the first quarter repurchase of 211,000 shares of our common stock.\nIn August 2020, our Board approved a 4% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, underscoring its continued confidence in our future performance and continuing Martin Marietta's track record of dividend growth.\nSince our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned more than $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases.\nWe ended 2020 with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.9 times, slightly below our target leverage range of two to 2.5 times, which offers us the flexibility to pursue accretive investment opportunities.\nOur solid balance sheet, combined with $1.1 billion of availability on our credit facilities, provides the financial strength for Martin Marietta to respond to, then execute on disciplined capital allocation priorities and continue profitably growing our business.\nLooking ahead, we believe 2021 will be a year in which we see a return to a more normalized state as underlying demand fundamentals reset and the nation's economy regains momentum.\nWe remain confident in Martin Marietta's attractive business drivers and are encouraged by accelerating long-term secular trends across our three primary end-use markets and key geographies.\nWe expect these trends to drive construction-led aggregates intensive growth.\nInfrastructure activity, particularly for aggregates-intensive highways, roads and streets, continues to prove resilient.\nWith the One year extension of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, or FAST Act, at current funding levels, state and local governments have the visibility needed to plan, design and award transportation projects through the 2021 construction season.\nImportantly, estimated fiscal 2021 lettings for our top five departments of transportation, or DOTs, are currently above or near prior year levels.\nKeep in mind, our top five states: Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, are disproportionately important to us, representing 71% of our 2020 Building Materials business total revenues.\nAdditionally, DOTs were recently granted nearly $10 billion of targeted relief as part of the Coronavirus Response and Relief Act passed in December 2020 to help offset pandemic-driven transportation revenue shortfalls.\nThis funding assistance has the benefit of no state matching requirements.\nBased on preliminary estimates, over $2 billion of this assistance will be apportioned to Martin Marietta's top five states.\nOver the medium to long term, we anticipate voter-approved state and local transportation measures and passage of a comprehensive federal transportation program package to promote multiyear growth in product demand.\nIn November 2020, voters sent a powerful message of support for state and local transportation investment, approving 94% of ballot measures, the highest ever approval rating.\nThese initiatives are estimated to generate an additional $14 billion in onetime and recurring transportation funding, of which 82% is in Texas, our top revenue-generating state.\nBipartisan support exists for new surface transportation legislation aimed at increasing funding levels not seen in over 15 years, with both the United States House of Representatives and Senate previously advancing proposed bills.\nWe believe this 117th Congress creates a path toward advancing a notable increase in funding over the FAST Act.\nWe're optimistic that agreement on a new bill could be reached this summer, generating meaningful benefits in 2022 and beyond.\nWe expect increased infrastructure investment to provide volume stability and drive aggregate shipments in that end-use closer to our 10-year historical average of 43% of our total shipments.\nFor reference, aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 36% of 2020 shipments.\nNonresidential construction should continue to benefit from accelerating e-commerce and remote work trends that require increased investment in heavy industrial warehouses and data centers, particularly in our key metros of Dallas/Fort Worth, San Antonio, Austin, Denver, Des Moines, Indianapolis, Charlotte and Atlanta.\nImportantly, this type of construction tends to be more aggregates-intensive than light commercial construction due to the size, scale and structure of these projects.\nLight commercial and retail construction will remain comparatively challenged until COVID-19 vaccines are more widely distributed.\nOver the longer term, light nonresidential activity will benefit from the attractive collateral effects of strong single-family residential trends.\nAggregate shipments to the nonresidential market accounted for 34% of 2020 shipments.\nSingle-family housing is poised for multiyear growth returning to more normalized levels during this economic cycle.\nWe believe Martin Marietta's leading southeastern and southwestern footprint positions the company to be a notable beneficiary of these trends given underbuilt conditions, favorable population and employment dynamics, land availability, mild climates and lower cost of living in these regions.\nSingle-family housing is two to three times more aggregates-intensive than multifamily construction, given the ancillary nonresidential and infrastructure needs of new suburban communities.\nAggregates to the residential market accounted for 24% of 2020 shipments.\nIn summary, we're confident in the fundamental strength and underlying drivers of our business.\nAs disclosed in today's release, we've returned to providing full year annual guidance.\nWe currently expect 2021 aggregates shipment growth to range from up 1% to up 4%, reflecting single-family housing strength, expanded infrastructure investment and heavy industrial projects of scale that will support our near-term shipment levels.\nWe remain confident that our favorable pricing trends are sustainable, supported by improved contractor confidence and healthy customer backlogs.\nFor 2021, we expect annual aggregates price increases, which become effective from January one to April 1, to increase in a range of up 3% to up 5%.\nCombined with contributions from our Cement, Downstream and Magnesia Specialties businesses, on a consolidated basis, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.350 billion to $1.450 billion.\nKeep in mind, when comparing this guidance range to prior year, we're not anticipating the same level of nonrecurring gains from land sales and divested surplus assets as seen in 2020.\nTo conclude, we're proud of our 2020 record financial results and industry-leading safety performance.\nWe're also extremely optimistic about our future.\nDue to our work over the last several years, Martin Marietta is uniquely well positioned to capitalize on the emerging growth trends that are expected to support steady and sustainable construction activity over the long term.\nImportantly, the disciplined execution of our strategic plan, coupled with our pricing discipline, operational excellence, prudent capital allocation and adherence to robust health protocols will continue to enhance Martin Marietta's solid foundation for enduring success.\nAs we move forward, we have the resources, team and capabilities to drive value-enhancing growth.\nWe're confident in Martin Marietta's opportunities to build on our successful track record of strong financial, operational and safety performance and remain focused on delivering superior returns for investors while meeting and exceeding our commitments to our other stakeholders, including our customers, employees and communities.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO; and other members of the executive team.\nWe invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2.\nActual results may differ.\nBefore we get into our results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the business.\nDuring the second quarter, we saw gradual improvements in the demand for our products as the rollout of COVID vaccinations and the removal of mobility restrictions have led to more economic activity and increased demand for transportation fuels.\nThat said, we're close to the end of the summer driving season, which is typically our strongest part of the year.\nGasoline demand is currently 2% to 5% below 2019 levels, with the West Coast still lagging at about 10% down.\nDiesel demand continues to hold up well and is flat to 2019.\nDespite the growing levels of personal passenger traffic, we continue to see an absence of the longer-haul international flights and business travel.\nOverall, jet demand remains down nearly 30% below pre-pandemic levels.\nThe full return of aviation fuel demand will likely still take some time, particularly with the recent increasing spread of the COVID-19 variants.\nAs we head into the second half of the year, we remain hopeful but cautious in the recovery and so we'll remain focused on the elements of our business within our control.\nSlide 4 highlights progress on our strategic priorities for the quarter.\nFirst, on May 14, we closed the sale of our Speedway business to 7-Eleven.\nIn conjunction with the close, we announced our plans to return $10 billion of sale proceeds to shareholders through share repurchases.\nAs part of our commitment to quickly return capital, we immediately launched a modified Dutch auction tender offer in which we were able to repurchase nearly $1 billion worth of shares.\nSecond, we continue to take steps to reposition our portfolio.\nDickinson reached full design capacity during the quarter.\nAt approximately 180 million gallons per year, Dickinson is the second largest renewable diesel facility in the United States.\nAt Martinez, we're progressing detailed engineering and permitting to convert that oil refinery to a renewable diesel facility.\nBased on our progress and discussion with feedstock suppliers, we're confident in the time line we have set to begin producing renewable diesel in the second half of 2022, with approximately 260 million gallons per year of capacity.\nAdditionally, we expect to reach full capacity of approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of '23.\nThird, we continue to keep a diligent focus on cost and capital in a challenging commodity business such as ours, being a low-cost operator ensures we will remain competitive.\nWe have continued to challenge ourselves to examine all aspects of spend, and as a result, have delivered incremental progress.\nIn the first half of 2021, our operating results reflect our goal to reduce overall refining cost structure by $1 billion.\nImportantly, I want to note that in June, we published our two annual ESG-related reports.\nOur sustainability report provides an in-depth look at the company's sustainability approach and performance consistent with the reporting guidance from SASB and GRI.\nOur perspectives on climate-related scenarios follows guidance from TCFD and analyzes the company's resiliency relative to climate scenarios put forth by the IEA.\nOn Slide 5, I would like to take a moment to go over some of the ways we're challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy.\nFrom a strategic standpoint, our focus is to balance the needs of today while investing in a sustainable energy diverse future.\nThat includes strengthening resiliency by lowering our carbon intensity and conservative natural resources, developing for the future by investing in renewables and emerging technologies, and embedding sustainability and decision-making in all aspects of engagement with our people and many stakeholders.\nWe currently have three companywide targets many of our investors know well.\nFirst, a 30% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 2030.\nSecond, a 50% reduction in midstream methane intensity by 2025.\nAnd lastly, a 20% reduction in our fresh water withdrawal intensity by 2030.\nThe evolving energy landscape presents us with meaningful opportunities for innovation.\nWe've allocated 40% of our growth capital in 2021 to help advance two significant renewable fuels projects.\nIn late '20, we began renewable diesel production at our Dickinson, North Dakota facility, second largest of its kind in the United States and are progressing the conversion of our Martinez, California refinery to a renewable diesel facility.\nFinally, to demonstrate our focus on making sustainability pervasive in all we do for executives and employees, we link a portion of the annual bonus program to an ESG metric.\nWe recently introduced a diversity, equity and inclusion component to these metrics as well, making us the first U.S. independent downstream company to link improving diversity to compensation in the same way we led the industry in linking GHG intensity reductions to our compensation last year.\nSafety in our operations is another key to sustainable operations.\nIn 2020, our teams demonstrated strong safety and environmental performance, including a nearly 40% reduction in the most significant process safety events and a 40% reduction in designated environmental incidents over 2019.\nOur personal safety performance continues to be better than industry average for the U.S. refining and midstream sectors.\nSlide 6 provides a summary of our second-quarter financial results.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $2.194 billion for the quarter.\nThis includes the results from both continuing and discontinued operations.\nCash from continuing operations, excluding working capital, was $1.535 billion, which is approximately $1 billion increase from the prior quarter.\nAnd for the first time in nearly 18 months, we generated ongoing operating cash flow that exceeded the needs of the business, capital commitments, as well as covered our dividend and distributions.\nFinally, we returned nearly $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter through dividend payments and share repurchases.\nThe close of the Speedway sale marked a significant milestone in our ongoing commitment to strengthen the competitive position of our portfolio.\nSo we wanted to call out some of the key points on Slide 7.\nWe received total proceeds for the sale of Speedway of $21 billion.\nBased on our tax basis, our cash taxes, current and deferred, will be approximately $4.2 billion, which is lower than our original $4.5 billion estimate.\nWe have accrued for this on the balance sheet.\nIn addition, we had closing adjustments of approximately $400 million.\nTherefore, the after-tax proceeds from the sale will be $17.2 billion.\nTo be clear, this number is higher than our initial $16.5 billion estimate.\nOn Slide 8, we present an overview of the use of the proceeds.\nSince the close of the transaction, we have reduced structural debt by $2.5 billion and purchased approximately $1 billion of stock.\nIn the post-tender period, we did not repurchase any incremental shares in light of a couple of regulatory constraints: first, a post-tender cooling off-period; and second, our routine quarterly restricted period in the lead up to the release of our earnings information.\nThat said, not repurchasing during that limited window is not indicative of any deviation from our commitment to complete within 12 to 16 months.\nConsistent with that commitment, as Mike mentioned earlier, we are commencing the next steps to complete the remaining $9 billion return of capital.\nSpecifically, we are entering into an open-market repurchase program that will allow us to buy for a period of time, including when the company may have information that otherwise precludes us from trading, and we will provide updates on the progress during our earnings calls.\nSlide 9 illustrates the progress we have made, lowering our cost structure.\nSince the beginning of 2020, we have made a step change in our refining operating cost and decreased our overall cost profile by approximately $1 billion.\nWhile there is quarter-to-quarter variability, our refining operating cost in 2020 began at $6 per barrel and are now trending at a quarterly average of roughly $5 per barrel for 2021.\nWe have applied the same cost discipline framework that we use for refining operating costs to our corporate costs as well.\nThere may be variations in these corporate costs quarter to quarter.\nWe believe we have lowered our overall cost structure by more than $100 million, and we are committed to challenging ourselves every day on ways to reduce expenses.\nAs you know, natural gas is a variable cost in operating a refinery.\nThese costs have recently increased nearly $1 per MMBtu, and we anticipate this being a headwind for the third quarter.\nWhile our results reflect our focus on cost discipline, every day, we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees, customers and the communities in which we operate.\nAs we have shared with you previously, our cost reductions should be sustainable, not impact revenue opportunities, and in no way, jeopardize the safety of our people or our operations.\nSlide 10 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA, as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from first-quarter 2021 to second-quarter 2021.\nAdjusted EBITDA was more than $600 million higher quarter over quarter, driven primarily by refining and marketing.\nAs we previously mentioned, this quarter's results include the impacts of closing the Speedway sale.\nHere, you can see the $11.7 billion pre-tax gain on the sale reflected in the adjustments column of $11.6 billion, which includes other adjustments of $79 million for impairment and transaction-related costs.\nThe $3.7 billion financial tax -- excuse me, financial tax provision reflects the net impact of cash taxes and deferred tax impact.\nThe resulting $8 billion gain on sale is reflected in our quarterly net income.\nSlide 18 in our appendix walk through the specific impacts of the Speedway sale across the three financial statements.\nMoving to our segment slide results.\nSlide 11 provides an overview of our refining and marketing segment.\nThe business recorded the second consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA since the start of the COVID pandemic with adjusted EBITDA of $751 million.\nThis was an increase of $728 million when compared to the first quarter of 2021.\nThe increase was driven primarily by higher refining margins, especially in the Mid-Con region as that region's cracks improved 57% from the first quarter.\nAlso contributing to the improved results was higher utilization, which was 94% for the second quarter versus 83% in the first quarter.\nIt's important to recall that we idled two high-cost refineries in 2020.\nIf adjusted to include that capacity idled in 2020, utilization would have been approximately 78% in the first quarter of '21 and subsequently increased to 89% in the second quarter of '21.\nOperating expenses were relatively flat with the previous quarter despite the increase in utilization, reflecting the team's commitment to cost discipline despite rising variable cost.\nSlide 12 shows the change in our midstream EBITDA versus the first quarter of 2021.\nOur midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter.\nHere again, the team continues to make excellent progress executing on the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, lowering the cost structure and portfolio optimization.\nBy the end of 2021, we estimate that MPLX will have decreased their structural cost by $300 million.\nSlide 13 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter.\nIt reflects both our continuing and discontinued operations.\nWe have also specifically called out items related to the Speedway close.\nWithin continuing operations, operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $1.5 billion in the quarter.\nChanges in working capital were flat this quarter.\nIncreasing crude prices provided a source of more than $500 million, which was mostly offset by the large receivable balance with Speedway becoming a third-party customer and typical seasonal refined product inventory builds.\nDuring the quarter, MPC decreased debt by $3.3 billion.\nAdditionally, MPLX reduced third-party debt by approximately $800 million during the quarter.\nWith respect to capital return, MPC returned $380 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased $981 million worth of shares using Speedway proceeds.\nAt the end of the quarter, NPC had $17.3 billion in cash and higher returning short-term investments, such as commercial paper and certificates of deposits.\nOn Slide 14, we provide our third-quarter outlook.\nWe expect total throughput volumes of roughly 2.8 million barrels per day.\nPlanned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $195 million in the third quarter.\nThe majority of the activity will be at our Robinson and Mandan refineries in the Mid-Con region.\nAs we have previously mentioned, our turnaround activity is back half-weighted this year.\nOther operating expenses are coordinated to occur during these time periods as well.\nAnd so you are seeing the impact in our guided cost trends for the third quarter.\nTotal operating costs are projected to be $5.05 per barrel for the quarter.\nDistribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter.\nCorporate costs are expected to be $175 million, consistent with the second quarter and reflecting the approximately $100 billion -- $100 million, excuse me, in cost that have been removed on an annual basis.\nWe will be prompt for additional questions.\nWe will now open the call to questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Kelly will join for Q&A.\nThese materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference.\nThese statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties.\nInformation about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC.\nI'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through results and our outlook.\nFirst, Q1 was an excellent quarter.\nWe achieved Q1 records for sales, operating earnings and cash flow.\nWe expanded operating margins by 220 basis points and ended the quarter with backlog of $11.3 billion, up 8% versus last year.\nAdditionally, demand remains strong, resulting in orders that were higher than any other first quarter in our history.\nSecond, our Software and Services segment had another outstanding quarter and continues to drive revenue growth and operating margin expansion.\nSales for the quarter were up 15%, driven by growth across our LMR, video security and command center software technologies.\nAnd the segment also finished with operating margins up 310 basis points versus last year.\nAnd finally, based on the increased demand we're seeing across our business and our strong backlog position, we're raising our full year guidance for both sales and earnings per share for the full year.\nOur Q1 results included revenue of $1.8 billion, up 7%, including $48 million from acquisitions and $32 million from favorable currency.\nGAAP operating earnings of $298 million and operating margins of 16.8% of sales compared to 15.6% in the year ago quarter.\nNon-GAAP operating earnings of $411 million, up $64 million or 18%, and non-GAAP operating margins of 23.2% of sales, up from 21%, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments.\nGAAP earnings per share of $1.41 compared to $1.12 in the year ago quarter.\nThe increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, improved operating leverage and lower legal fees, partially offset by the gain from the sale of a manufacturing facility recognized in the prior year.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share of $1.87 compared to $1.49 last year, primarily due to higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments, higher pension income and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate.\nopex in Q1 was $455 million, up $4 million versus last year, primarily due to costs related to acquisitions, partially offset by lower discretionary spend.\nTurning to cash flow.\nOur Q1 operating cash flow was $370 million compared with $308 million in the prior year, and free cash flow was $318 million compared with $260 million in the prior year.\nThe increase in cash flow was primarily due to higher sales and improved working capital, partially offset by higher cash taxes.\nCapital allocation for Q1 included $170 million of share repurchases at an average price of $175.53, $121 million in cash dividends and $52 million of capex.\nDuring the quarter, we entered into a new five year $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, replacing our prior $2.2 billion facility.\nAnd subsequent to quarter end, the Board of Directors approved a $2 billion increase to the share repurchase program.\nMoving to our segment results.\nQ1 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1 billion, up 2%, primarily driven by growth in video security and professional and commercial radio, partially offset by lower sales of public safety LMR, which were impacted by supply constraints.\nRevenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $35 million.\nOperating earnings were $131 million or 12.9% of sales, up from 12.4% in the year prior on higher sales and improved leverage.\nSome notable Q1 wins and achievements in this segment include a $300 million frame agreement with the German MOD to meet their TETRA LMR requirements with an initial order of $154 million recorded in Q1.\n$72 million of video sales with government customers, up 32% from last year.\nA $37 million P25 upgrade for a government agency in Canada.\nA $33 million TETRA upgrade for a large customer in Europe.\nAnd a $12 million P25 order with a large U.S. federal customer.\nMoving to the Software and Services segment.\nQ1 revenue was $758 million, up 15% from last year, driven by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software.\nRevenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $13 million.\nOperating earnings were $280 million or 36.9% of sales, up 310 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved leverage.\nSome notable Q1 wins in the segment include, over $40 million of orders for P25 services, upgrades and body-worn cameras with Nashville, Tennessee.\nA $35 million push-to-talk over broadband multiyear contract with a large U.S. customer, a $22 million P25 and push-to-talk over broadband contract from a large middle eastern customer.\nThe $13 million of body-worn cameras with multiple U.K. customers and our largest cloud-based command center software win to date.\nA $5 million contract with St. Lucie, Florida.\nAdditionally, we announced a new product integration between our V300 body-worn camera and our APX P25 radio platform.\nLooking at our regional results.\nNorth America Q1 revenue was $1.2 billion, up 6% on growth in LMR, video security and command center software.\nInternational Q1 revenue of $588 million, was up 9%, with growth in EMEA, Asia Pac and Latin America.\nThe growth was driven by video security and LMR. Moving to backlog.\nEnding backlog was a Q1 record of $11.3 billion, up $866 million compared to last year, driven by $639 million of growth in North America and $227 million of growth internationally.\nSequentially, backlog was down $130 million, driven by revenue recognition on the Airwave and ESN contracts, partially offset with international growth in LMR products.\nSoftware and Services backlog was up $548 million compared to last year, driven by $491 million of growth in multiyear LMR services and command center software contracts in North America, and $58 million of international software growth.\nThe favorable impact of FX to backlog was offset by revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN.\nSequentially, backlog was down $269 million, also driven by revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN.\nProducts and SI backlog was $318 million compared -- up $318 million compared to last year.\nPrimarily driven by LMR growth in both regions.\nSequentially, backlog was up $139 million, driven by international LMR growth.\nTurning to our outlook.\nWe expect Q2 sales to be up between 19% and 20%, with non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.90 and $1.95 per share.\nThis assumes FX at current spot rates, weighted average diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%.\nAnd for the full year, we now expect sales to be up between 8% and 9%, an increase from our prior guide of 7.25% to 8%.\nAnd we expect full year non-GAAP earnings per share between $8.70 and $8.80 per share, up from our prior guidance of $8.50 to $8.62 per share.\nThis increased outlook includes the ongoing supply chain constraints, primarily in LMR products and assumes FX at current spot rates.\nA weighted average diluted share count of 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of 22.5% to 23%.\nAnd now I'd like to end with a few thoughts on the business.\nFirst, our results for the quarter were outstanding.\nWe achieved Q1 record sales, orders, operating earnings and cash flow.\nExpanded both gross and operating margins, achieved double-digit growth in video security, command center software and LMR services and our PCR business returned to growth.\nAdditionally, we exited the quarter with a record Q1 backlog and continued strong demand that we expect will drive growth for the remainder of the year, inclusive of the supply challenges that we have.\nWe also announced today that the Board approved a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase program.\nThe second thing I would say is demand in our video security business is really strong.\nAnd we now expect full year growth to be 20% plus, up from the high teens we referenced on our last call.\nIn fixed video, which makes up approximately 70% of the total video security revenue, our investments in AI analytics, cloud services, access control and NDAA-compliant manufacturing is differentiating us from our competitors and driving growth faster than the overall market.\nAnd in mobile video, the call for more transparency is driving growth for our purpose-built body-worn and in-car camera solutions, and we're gaining share in a market that has predominantly been served by one vendor.\nDuring the quarter, we had several large body-worn camera wins, both in the U.S. and internationally.\nAdditionally, during the quarter, we announced two new offerings, the integration of our V300 body-worn camera with our APX P25 radios, which allow us to leverage our market-leading LMR installed base and our $49 per month body-worn camera as a service offering, which offers every police agency in the U.S. with affordable access to a video solution that's fully integrated with our command central software suite.\nAnd finally, I'm very pleased with our progress in leveraging our leading installed base in LMR to expand into command center software, video security and LMR services.\nToday, almost half our revenue is generated from these higher growth areas, up from 20% five years ago, and our addressable market has tripled over that same period of time.\nAnd while we've made significant progress, I absolutely believe we still have a long runway ahead as we continue to deploy capital both organically and inorganically in these areas to drive revenue, margin and cash flow for the company.\n[Operator Instructions] Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question?\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Today's remarks also include certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nSo with that said, let's turn to our fiscal 2022 second quarter results.\nWe are pleased with our financial performance for the quarter.\nVisitation trends and demand for the experience at our resorts remains encouraging, particularly with destination guests, with results improving post holidays as conditions improved, more terrain was opened and the impact of the COVID-19 Omicron variant receded.\nAs expected, results for the quarter significantly outperformed the results from the prior year due to the greater impact of COVID-19 and related limitations and restrictions on results in the prior-year period.\nThe 2021/2022 North American ski season got off to a slow start.\nThe confluence of storm cycles, staffing challenges, and the spike in Omicron variant cases created challenges through the holiday period, impacting our resorts' ability to fully open terrain as planned and negatively impacting the guest experience during that time.\nDespite numerous measures taken ahead of the season, including an investment in wages, available staffing was below targeted levels heading into the holidays, consistent with challenges faced by the broader travel and leisure industry at that time.\nDuring the holidays, COVID-19 cases associated with the Omicron variant dramatically accelerated, impacting both travel plans and staffing exclusions despite having a vaccinated workforce.\nAt some resorts, more than 10% of our employees were unable to work due to COVID-19 at one time.\nTo address these challenges, the company increased hourly compensation during the holidays and for the remainder of the ski season at a cost of $20 million in fiscal 2022.\nFollowing the holiday period, the experience across our resorts improved markedly with better snowfall, a stabilization and ultimately reduction in cases of COVID-19, and overall better staffing, allowing us to open terrain across our resorts that was close to normal levels for that time period.\nski resorts, which exceeded our expectations in January in particular.\nWhistler Blackcomb was, as anticipated, disproportionately impacted by COVID-19-related travel restrictions, creating challenging results for U.S. destinations and international visitation to the resort.\nExcluding the Seven Springs Resorts, total visitation for the quarter increased 2% compared to the second fiscal quarter of 2020.\nRelative to the second fiscal quarter of 2020, our ancillary lines of business experienced revenue declines, particularly in food and beverage, which was disproportionately impacted by numerous operational restrictions associated with COVID-19 and overall staffing challenges.\nResort net revenue for the second fiscal quarter of 2022 decreased 2% relative to the comparable period in fiscal year 2020, primarily as a result of the headwinds in our ancillary lines of business and approximately $33 million of past revenue that would have been recognized in the second fiscal quarter of 2022, but was deferred to the third quarter as a result of delayed openings for a number of our resorts.\nOur lodging business experienced strong results during the quarter, with average daily rates exceeding our expectations, partially offset by lower-than-expected occupancy rates during the early season.\nRelative to the second fiscal quarter of 2020, resort reported EBITDA increased 5% despite the challenging early season conditions and COVID-19-related dynamics.\nResort reported EBITDA margin for the second quarter was 43.9%, an increase from 40.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.\nAs Kirsten mentioned, we're pleased with our performance for the quarter, particularly given the slow start to the season.\nNet income attributable to Vail Resorts was $223.4 million or $5.47 per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to net income attributable to Vail Resorts of $147.8 million or $3.62 per diluted share in the prior year.\nResort reported EBITDA was $397.9 million in the second fiscal quarter, which compares to resort reported EBITDA of $276.1 million in the same period in the prior year.\nThe increase was primarily due to the greater impact of COVID-19 and related limitations and restrictions on results in the prior year.\nResort reported EBITDA for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 was $378.3 million.\nTurning now to our season-to-date metrics for the period from the beginning of the ski season through Sunday, March 6, 2022, compared to each of the two prior-year periods through March 7, 2021, and March 8, 2020.\nGiven the significant impacts of COVID-19 in the prior-year period, including significant capacity restrictions that limited skier visits and ancillary revenue, we're also providing metrics relative to the comparable fiscal year 2020 season-to-date period, which was prior to our announcement to close our resorts on March 15, 2020, for the remainder of the 2019/2020 season.\nThe reported ski season metrics are for our North American destination mountain resorts and regional ski areas and exclude the results of our recently acquired Seven Springs resorts and our Australian ski areas in all periods.\nThe reported ski season metrics include growth for season pass revenue based on estimated fiscal year 2022 North American season pass revenue compared to both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 North American season pass revenue.\nThe data mentioned in this release is interim period data and is subject to fiscal quarter-end review and adjustments.\nWe are pleased with the positive momentum we have seen throughout the post-Christmas period.\nSeason-to-date total skier visits were up 2.8% compared to the fiscal year 2020 season-to-date period.\nSeason-to-date total lift ticket revenue, including an allocated portion of season pass revenue for each applicable period, was up 10.3% compared to the fiscal year 2020 season-to-date period.\nCompared to the fiscal year 2020 season-to-date period, season-to-date ski school revenue was down 8.9%, dining revenue was down 27% and retail rental for North American resort and ski area store locations was down 2.8%.\nCompany performance has continued to improve throughout the post-Christmas period, with particular strength in destination visitation and lift ticket sales.\nDespite significant growth of our pass program this year, visitation for the season-to-date period was modestly up 2.8% compared to fiscal 2020, given the company's strategy to shift lift ticket guests into an advance commitment pass product.\nWhistler Blackcomb was negatively impacted by COVID-19-related travel restrictions, creating challenging results for U.S. destination and international visitation to the resort.\nThe ancillary lines of business continued to experience revenue declines, particularly in food and beverage, which is disproportionately impacted by numerous operational restrictions associated with staffing and COVID-19.\nIt is important to highlight that our season pass unit growth of 47% for fiscal year 2022 created significant revenue stability in a period with challenging early season conditions and COVID-19 impacts.\nThe growth in pass units did not drive dramatic increases in visitation as the company is shifting lift ticket guests into advance commitment products.\nIn fact, the growth we saw in visitation in the period ending March 6, 2022, compared to fiscal 2020 occurred on weekdays and non-holiday periods, which were up approximately 9% in visits compared to weekend and holiday periods, which were approximately flat in visits.\nWe also saw peak daily visitation at our resorts during the period that were very consistent with prior -- with previous years.\nFor the season-to-date period ending March 6, 2022, 69% of our visits came from season pass holders, compared to 56% of visits for the same period in fiscal year 2020.\nWe remain committed to our strategy to move lift ticket purchasers into advance commitment products, which offers benefits to our guests and stability to our employees, our communities and our company.\nNow turning to our outlook for fiscal 2022.\nDespite the challenging start to the season through the holidays, we have increased the midpoint of our Resort reported EBITDA guidance as compared to our original guidance provided in September, demonstrating the resilience of our business model and the benefits of our advance commitment strategy.\nThe update to guidance is primarily driven by the strong demand from destination guests at our Western U.S. resorts, particularly with regard to lift ticket sales, which we expect will continue through the remainder of the season, as well as the contribution from the Seven Springs resorts.\nAdditionally, our lodging business is expected to significantly outperform our original expectations in the remainder of the year with strong results on both occupancy and ADR across our properties and the addition of the Seven Springs Resorts.\ndestination and international visitation trends at Whistler Blackcomb, the $20 million investment in frontline staff bonuses, increased wages for our summer operations, and the inclusion of an estimated $6 million in acquisition and integration-related expenses specific to the Seven Springs resorts.\nWe now expect net income attributable to Vail Resorts for fiscal 2022 to be between $304 million and $350 million, and resort reported EBITDA to be between $813 million and $837 million.\nWe estimate resort EBITDA margin for fiscal 2022 to be approximately 32.9% using the midpoint of the guidance range.\nThe updated outlook for fiscal year 2022 assumes normal conditions and operations across our resorts for the remainder of the ski season and no incremental travel or operating restrictions associated with COVID-19 that could negatively impact our results, including for our Australian resorts in the fourth quarter.\nThe guidance assumes an exchange rate of $0.79 between the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar related to the operations of Whistler Blackcomb in Canada and an exchange rate of $0.72 between the Australian dollar and U.S. dollar related to the operations of Perisher, Falls Creek, and Hotham in Australia.\nOur liquidity position remains strong.\nOur total cash and revolver availability as of January 31, 2022, was approximately $2 billion, with $1.4 billion of cash on hand, $417 million of U.S. revolver availability under the Vail Holdings credit agreement, and $214 million of revolver availability under the Whistler Credit Agreement.\nAs of January 31, 2022, our net debt was 2.1 times trailing 12 months total reported EBITDA.\nWe are pleased to announce that our board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on Vail Resorts common stock of $1.91 per share.\nThe dividend will be payable on April 14, 2022, to shareholders of record as of March 30, 2022.\nWe will continue to be disciplined stewards of our capital and remain committed to prioritizing investments in our guest and employee experience, high-return capacity expanding capital projects, strategic acquisition opportunities, and returning capital to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend and share repurchase programs.\nAs we turn our attention to the 2022/2023 ski season and beyond, the company will be making its largest ever investment in both its employees and its resorts to ensure we continue to deliver our company mission of an experience of a lifetime.\nThe experience of our employees and our guests is core to our business model, and the company intends to use its financial resources and stability it has created through its season pass program to continue to aggressively reinvest to deliver that experience.\nWe believe our business model allows us to make these investments and achieve our short- and long-term financial growth objectives.\nOur employees are the core of Vail Resorts' mission of creating an experience of a lifetime.\nWe are pleased to announce a significant investment in our employees for the 2022/2023 North American ski season with an increase in the minimum hourly wage offered across all 37 of our North American resorts to USD 20 per hour for all U.S. employees and CAD 20 per hour for all Canadian employees, as well as an increase in wage rates for hourly employees, as we maintain all leadership and career stage differentials.\nRoles that have specific experiences or certification as prerequisites, such as entry-level patrol, commercial drivers, and maintenance technicians, will start at $21 per hour.\nTipped employees will be guaranteed a minimum of $20 per hour.\nThe company will also be assessing targeted increases beyond inflation for our salaried employees.\nAnd we'll be making a significant investment in our human resources department to ensure the right level of employee support, development, and recruiting.\nTalent is our most important asset and our strategic priority at all levels of the company.\nAnd we expect these investments will be an important step to enhance the experience for our employees through increased hiring, retention, and talent development.\nOur employee investments are intended to help us achieve normal staffing levels and, in turn, deliver an outstanding guest experience, which supports our advanced commitment strategy and, in turn, provides greater stability to our business model and the ability to drive long-term growth.\nThe increase in wages and the return to normal staffing levels will represent an approximately $175 million increase in expected labor expense in fiscal 2023 compared to the fiscal 2022 expected labor expense, including inflationary adjustments.\nWe remain dedicated to delivering an exceptional guest experience and will continue to prioritize investments to enhance the experience at our resorts.\nWe are committed to continually increasing capacity through lift, terrain, and food and beverage expansion projects and are making a significant one-time incremental investment this year to accelerate that strategy.\nAs previously announced on September 23, 2021, we are excited to be proceeding with our ambitious capital investment plan for calendar year 2022 of approximately $315 million to $325 million across our resorts, excluding one-time investments related to integration activities, employee housing development projects and real estate-related projects.\nThe plan includes approximately $180 million for the installation of 21 new or replacement lifts across 14 of our resorts and a transformational lift served terrain expansion at Keystone.\nIn addition to the two brand-new lift configurations at Vail and Keystone, the replacement lift will collectively increase lift capacity at those lift locations by more than 45%.\nAll of the projects in the plan are subject to regulatory approvals and expected to be completed in time for the 2022/2023 North American winter season.\nThe core capital plan is approximately $150 million, above our typical annual capital plan, based on inflation and previous additions for acquisitions and includes approximately $20 million of incremental spending to complete the one-time capital plans associated with the Peak Resorts and Triple Peak acquisitions and $3 million for the addition of annual capital expenditures associated with the Seven Springs Resorts.\nWe continue to remain highly focused on developing and leveraging our data-driven approach to marketing and operating the business.\nOur planned investments include networkwide scalable technology that will enhance our analytics, e-commerce, and guest engagement tools to improve our ability to target our guests, personalize messages and improve conversion.\nWe will also be investing in broader self-service capabilities to improve guests' online experience and engagement.\nIn addition, we have announced a $4 million capital investment plan in Vail Resorts Commitment to Zero initiative, which includes targeted investments in high-efficiency snowmaking, heating and cooling infrastructure, and lighting to further improve our energy efficiency and make meaningful progress toward our 2030 goal.\nWe plan to spend approximately $9 million on integration activities related to the recent acquired Seven Springs Resorts, including one-time investments related to integration activities and $3 million associated with real estate-related projects.\nOur total capital plan is expected to be approximately $327 million to $337 million.\nIncluding our calendar year 2022 capital plan, Vail Resorts will have invested over $2 billion in capital investments since launching the Epic Pass, increasing capacity, improving the guest experience, and creating an integrated resort network.\nAs we begin to plan for fiscal 2023, there are a number of dynamics related to COVID-19 and unusual weather that are negatively impacting fiscal 2022 and are important to highlight.\nTravel trends at Whistler Blackcomb, our Australian resorts, and our group business were all materially negatively impacted by COVID-19 in fiscal 2022.\nAnd early season results across our resorts this year were depressed with challenging snow falling conditions.\nReturning to normalized levels would result in estimated incremental resort reported EBITDA of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2022.\nThe Seven Springs Resorts did not have a full year of operating results and were impacted by acquisition and integration-related expenses.\nFull year results with no acquisition or integration-related expenses would result in estimated incremental resort reported EBITDA of approximately $7 million in fiscal 2022.\nFinally, our ancillary businesses were capacity-constrained in fiscal 2022 by staffing and, in the case of dining, by operational restrictions associated with COVID-19.\nReturning our ancillary business to normalized levels would result in estimated incremental resort reported EBITDA of approximately $75 million in fiscal 2022, which includes the incremental revenue and operating expense associated with normal capacity, but excludes incremental labor expense.\nThe normalized labor expense for the ancillary businesses is included in the approximate $175 million labor investment.\nAll of these estimates assume normal conditions throughout our ski seasons, continued strength in consumer demand, consistent economic dynamics relative to what exists today, and no material ongoing impacts from COVID-19.\nOffsetting the estimated $182 million of expected favorable resort reported EBITDA impact from returning the business to normal levels relative to projected fiscal 2022 results is the approximate $175 million labor increase from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023 that is expected to be necessary to return the company to normal staffing levels, giving the shortages in fiscal 2022 and the current labor market dynamics in our resort communities.\nThese estimates do not take into account any fiscal 2023 projections for volume, price or expense growth, which will be evaluated and incorporated in our full year 2023 guidance that we plan to outline in September 2022.\nI'll pass it back to Kirsten now.\nWe are fully committed to delivering an experience of a lifetime to our employees and our guests.\nOur team is at the core of Vail Resorts' mission.\nI am deeply grateful for the commitment demonstrated day in and day out.\nAnd I'm excited about the path ahead as we make these important investments in our team and the guest experience.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Participating on the call are Aaron Ravenscroft, president and chief executive officer; and Dave Antoniuk, executive vice president and chief financial officer.\nHowever, actual results could differ materially from any implied or actual projections due to one or more of the factors, among others, described in the company's latest SEC filings.\n2020 was an extremely challenging year.\nAt the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we identified three key priorities: one, ensure the health and safety of our team; two, maintain the strength of our balance sheet; and three, position the company for long-term growth.\nI'm very proud of how the team managed through these unprecedented times and how well we executed on these three priorities.\nFirst, with regards to safety.\nWe continue to see low incidence of COVID cases throughout our operations.\nIn addition, we achieved the lowest recordable injury rate in the history of the company.\nThe recordable rate was 1.34.\nSecondly, we ended the year with a strong balance sheet.\nWe have $120 million of cash and over $400 million of liquidity.\nAnd thirdly, we strengthened our foundation for future growth.\nIn the face of the pandemic, we continue to develop the future leaders of our organization.\nDuring the year, approximately 200 frontline supervisors completed a 12-month leadership program that covered safety, leadership skills, and LEAN.\nWe also kicked off a mentoring program for our key female leaders, which has already resulted in a few promotions.\nOur LEAN journey continued in 2020, with almost 900 entries in our global Manitowoc Way Lessons Learned Competition.\nThere were many deserving submissions, but our Wilhelmshaven, Germany facility took home the prize.\nThe team is in the middle of a multi-year initiative to improve production flow on the campus.\nDuring 2020, the team developed a robotic measuring device that proved to be a major breakthrough in our boom assembly process and cleared the path for us to make further progress on several other elements of this initiative.\nIn addition, this year, we rolled out the Manitowoc Way CEO Award to recognize a team member who exemplified not just LEAN thinking, but LEAN action.\nI would like to recognize Saleem Ahmed, test field supervisor in Wilhelmshaven.\nSaleem self-engineered a systems-convert manual boom cable drum alignment on the test field to an electronic process during assembly.\nThis type of behavior embodies our values and culture within the Manitowoc Way business system.\nTurning to the financials.\nOur performance during the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations.\nTaking a closer look, it's really a tale of two stories.\nOur profitability for the fourth quarter was significantly better than our forecast primarily due to a favorable product mix.\nWe had higher-than-anticipated book and ship demand for our tower cranes in Europe.\nThis also has the added benefit of higher factory absorption in those related sites.\nHowever, while our orders and backlog exceeded our forecast, they were heavily influenced by a couple of sizable crawler orders and favorable exchange rates.\nIn terms of our balance sheet, we reached our second-half target to reduce inventory by $80 million on a currency-neutral basis.\nWith that, I'll pass it to Dave to provide more color on the financial results and after which time I'll conclude with some comments on our outlook.\nLet's move to Slide 4.\nOur fourth-quarter orders totaled $509 million, an increase of 8% compared to $472 million of orders last year.\nOn a currency-neutral basis, Q4 orders were up $22 million or 5%.\nAs Aaron previously mentioned, the increase in orders was primarily driven by a couple of large crawler orders in the U.S.\nOur 2020 ending backlog of $543 million was up 14% over the prior year and up 10% on a currency-neutral basis.\nThe increase in backlog was mainly due to the increased crawler crane orders and the timing of shipments in Q4.\nNet sales in the fourth quarter of $430 million were in line with our expectations and decreased $33 million or 7% from a year ago.\nA decline in the Americas segment was partly offset by stronger results in the EURAF and MEAP segments.\nNet sales were favorably impacted by approximately 4% from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $34 million, an increase of approximately 11% year over year.\nA favorable product mix, along with reduced discretionary spending, allowed us to exceed the prior year and our expectations for the quarter.\nAs a percentage of sales, adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 7.9%, an improvement of 120 basis points over the prior year.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we incurred approximately $1 million of restructuring expenses predominantly related to severance costs in India and Europe.\nOur GAAP diluted earnings per share in the quarter was $0.05.\nOn an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share declined $0.16 from the prior year to $0.19 per diluted share.\nHigher income tax expense due to our jurisdictional mix and the impact from net foreign currency losses were the main contributors to the year-over-year decrease in adjusted diluted earnings per share, partly offset by improved operating income.\nWe generated $36 million of cash from operating activities in the quarter.\nOn a currency-neutral basis, we achieved our inventory-reduction target of $80 million in the second half of the year.\nMost of this improvement occurred in Q4, which was the main source of our cash flow generation in the quarter.\nYear over year, our cash flow from operating activities declined due to the timing of collections on accounts receivable.\nWe ended the year with a cash balance of $129 million, a decline of approximately $70 million year over year.\nHowever, our total liquidity remained strong at $412 million with no borrowings outstanding on our ABL.\nNow, I'll recap the financial results for the full year.\nOrders totaled roughly $1.5 billion, down $127 million or 8% from the prior year.\nForeign currency exchange rates benefited 2020 orders by approximately 1%.\nLower orders in the Americas and EURAF segments were partly offset by gains in the MEAP segment.\nOur net sales for the year totaled approximately $1.4 billion, a 21% decrease from 2019, and were positively impacted by $12 million or 1% due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe year-over-year decrease was primarily attributable to entering the year with a lower shippable backlog, coupled with a reduction in demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur adjusted EBITDA declined $74 million or 47% from the prior year, resulting in a 19% decremental margin on nearly $400 million of less revenue.\nThis better-than-expected flow through result is a testament to the efforts of our team members throughout the world during these unprecedented times.\nWe were able to limit our discretionary spending while continuing to invest in our new product development and growth strategies.\nCongratulations to the team for a job well done.\nOur full-year 2020 adjusted net loss was $12 million, compared to net income of $67 million in 2019.\nAdjusted diluted net loss per share of $0.35 was impacted by approximately $0.01 from our first-quarter share repurchases.\nAs mentioned previously, we suspended our share repurchase program during Q1, and we do not anticipate repurchasing additional shares in 2021.\nFull-year cash flows from operating activities were a use of $35 million, primarily driven by the timing of accounts receivable collections and the net loss recorded in the year.\nAs I previously mentioned, we ended the year with ample liquidity and a strong balance sheet.\nLet's please move to Slide 5.\nTurning our focus to 2021, I see this as a year of transition, one step forward, one step back.\nOverall, while we believe that we are beyond the economic trough brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect the recovery to be choppy.\nThe recently enacted stimulus packages by many countries and the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines are all favorable developments.\nHowever, there is still a long way to go to get back to normal.\nAnd unfortunately, some of these actions will have unintended consequences.\nFirst and foremost, while economic stimulus packages are essential to the recovery, fiscal spending has a tendency to create inflation, and we are already seeing this in steel pricing.\nMoreover, the heavy debt burden that this has created in the United States has resulted in a weaker dollar.\nGiven the speed at which both these variables are changing, I am concerned that we will see a dislocation in the market, which will create a short-term cost challenge for us.\nSecondly, Manitowoc benefited from substantial cost containment actions during 2020 that will not repeat in 2021.\nBetween our discretionary spending restrictions, bonus program costs, social claim benefits, and increases in insurance costs, we will easily see more than a $15 million cost headwind.\nThirdly, with the increase in crawlers, our mix is shifting toward lower-margin products, and we continue to suffer from low-production levels at our German factory, where we manufacture all-terrain cranes.\nPlease move to Slide 6.\nWe continue to invest in our future.\nWe have earmarked $15 million of capex to further expand our European tower crane rental fleet in 2021.\nWe continue to scale up our Chinese tower crane business that serves the Belt and Road regions.\nWe are accelerating our product development programs and our all-terrain product line, which we will showcase at Bauma in 2022.\nAnd we continue to pursue acquisitions.\nThese growth initiatives require more investment than we've made over the last couple of years, but we are confident that these strategic initiatives will fuel our future growth as the crane industry rebounds.\nIn closing, the current economic environment is extremely dynamic in terms of demand and costs.\nAnd therefore, we will not provide specific financial guidance for 2021.\nDirectionally, we believe that our revenue will be up modestly, but there are some clear indicators that we will see margin pressure from cost headwinds and product mix while we are investing in the future.\n2021 will be a year of transition.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm joined here today by Steve Westhoven, our President and CEO; Pat Migliaccio, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of our senior management team.\nThis could cause results to materially differ from our expectations, as found in slide one.\nWe will also be referring to certain non-GAAP measures such as net financial earnings or NFE.\nWe believe that NFE provides a more complete understanding of our financial performance.\nHowever, it is not intended to be a substitute for GAAP.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are discussed more fully in Item seven of our 10-K.\nOur agenda for today is found on slide two.\nSteve will begin today's call with highlights from the quarter, followed by Pat, who will review our financial results.\nNew Jersey Resources delivered strong performance in the first quarter.\nAnd on slide three, I'll take you through the highlights.\nWe reported NFE of $0.46 per share, driven by the performance of our core business, New Jersey Natural Gas.\nWe are also reaffirming our NFE guidance for fiscal 2021 of $1.55 to $1.65 per share and increasing our fiscal 2022 NFE guidance to $2.20 to $2.30 per share, an increase of $0.15 per share from prior guidance.\nAt New Jersey Natural Gas, we completed almost 90% of the Southern Reliability Link and expect to place the project into service this year.\nWe received approval to move forward with our infrastructure Investment Program, a 5-year, $150 million accelerated recovery program that will improve the resiliency and reliability of our natural gas infrastructure.\nAnd we filed for SAVEGREEN 2020, a new energy efficiency program that is designed to help our customers reduce their energy consumption and save money.\nAt Clean Energy Ventures, we acquired the 2.9 megawatt Mt. Laurel Solar Facility, which is part of our plan to invest $165 million this year.\nIn our Storage & Transportation business, we've begun to construct -- to convert the Southern portion of Adelphia Gateway to natural gas and expect it to be in service later this calendar year.\nAnd just yesterday, the U.S. Supreme Court granted PennEast petition to hear its appeal.\nBut despite this positive news, we are still excluding PennEast for our long term projections until there's more clarity on the project.\nAnd at NJR Energy Services we entered into an asset management agreements, which will result in contracted cash proceeds of $501 million over a 10-year period.\nI'll take you through the transaction in more detail on the next slide.\nTurning to slide four.\nEnergy Services entered into a series of AMAs with an investment-grade public utility.\nThese transactions illustrate the value of our portfolio of natural gas storage and transportation contracts that are a testament to the hard work of our talented team.\nThe transactions assist our counterparty in securing needed supply, while Energy Services monetizes the value of a portion of the assets it controls.\nLet me walk you through some of the specifics.\nBeginning in November of 2021, which is our fiscal year 2022, NJRES will begin to release portions of our pipeline capacity.\nUnder the terms of the agreements, NJRES will receive payments of $261 million over the first three years of the AMAs.\nAfter FY 2024, NJRES will receive additional payments of approximately $34 million per year through 2031.\nThe benefits for NJRES include, extracting value from our assets without the need for weather-related price volatility and reducing operational risks associated with the direct management of these transportation assets.\nThe result will be more predictable earnings and cash flows and a lower risk Energy Services business.\nThese transactions also allow us to increase our fiscal 2022 guidance by $0.15 per share, as we'll see on the next slide.\nAnd later in the call, Pat will take you through other financial impacts of these transactions.\nTurning to our NFE guidance for fiscal 2022 on slide five, we are increasing our overall guidance to a range of $2.20 to $2.30 per share.\nThis reflects the impact of the AMAs and the expected cash settlement of our equity forward.\nHowever, our long term annual growth rate of 6% to 10% remains based off our originally communicated guidance of $2.05 to $2.15 per share, which excludes the impact of the AMAs and any other contribution from Energy Services.\nAs Pat will discuss later, the NFE benefits of AMAs will not be the same every year.\nAnd on slide six, I'll take you through some of the operational highlights.\nLooking at the top left, we invested $89 million in New Jersey Natural Gas during the first quarter, with about 1/3 of the capex providing near real-time returns.\nDespite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we added over 1,900 new customers, only slightly below the customer additions from the same period a year ago, which was pre-pandemic.\nThis is due to the favorable growth demographics in our service territories.\nConstruction on the Southern Reliability Link continues to progress, and we now have almost 90% of the project complete with an in-service date expected this year.\nWe plan to file our rate case to recover the costs associated with the project in fiscal 2021.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, we received approval for our IIP program and filed for SAVEGREEN 2020.\nOn slide seven, I'll take you through the operational highlights of our other core business, Clean Energy Ventures.\nWe added 2.9 megawatts of capacity this quarter.\nAnd as you can see on the top right, we now have 360 megawatts of installed capacity.\nWe have a strong project pipeline with about $260 million worth of investments, either under contract or exclusivity that are targeted for commercial operation in fiscal 2021 and 2022.\nTotal invested capital at CEV this quarter was $23 million with $17 million of commercial projects and $6 million at Sunlight Advantage.\nThe bottom right shows our expected CEV revenue for fiscal 2021, a significant portion of which is secured through our SREC hedging program.\nThe sustainability agenda we've outlined for our company focuses on innovation, emissions reductions, energy efficiency and transparency.\nBut I'm pleased to report NJR has made significant progress.\nLast quarter, we announced that NJR achieved our goal of reducing our New Jersey operational emissions by 50% of 2006 levels, well ahead of schedule.\nAnd we set a new higher target of 60% reduction by 2030.\nThis is a significant accomplishment that reflects the decades of investment in safety and environmental responsibility.\nIt reflects our strong commitment to sustainability and the hard work of our team.\nOur new target ensures our company's goals are aligned with the state's 2050 statutory goals for emissions reduction.\nLast month, we issued our 12th Annual Corporate Sustainability Report, which is available on our website.\nFor the first time, this year's report includes ESG reporting and disclosures established by SASB, which is another step to increase transparency and strengthen our communications with our investors in the financial communities on these issues.\nSlide 10 shows the main drivers of our NFE for the first quarter.\nAs we communicated at our Analyst Day in November, this is the first quarter where we're utilizing the deferral method of accounting for CEV.\nAnd as such, we've recast our financials for the comparable periods.\nReported NFE of $44.7 million or $0.46 per share compared to NFE of $34.9 million or $0.38 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.\nNew Jersey Natural Gas saw an NFE improvement of $5.6 million due primarily to a full quarter of higher base rates from NJNG's fiscal 2020 rate case settlement as compared to a partial quarter a year ago.\nCEV was down $2, primarily due to increased O&M expenses related to project maintenance costs, especially with new projects placed in service, which is partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense.\nStorage & Transportation saw a modest increase during the quarter, mostly related to increased operating income from Leaf River, and was offset by interest expense related to the acquisitions of Leaf River and Adelphia Gateway.\nEnergy services improved $6.6 million, primarily due to higher financial margin compared to last year, due to increased natural gas pricing spreads.\nHome Services and Other saw slightly lower operating revenue and slightly higher interest expense.\nAs Steve mentioned, we reaffirmed our NFE guidance of $1.55 to $1.65 per share for fiscal 2021.\nOn slide 11, you can see the segment contributions with our core businesses, NJNG and CEV, accounting for 80% of total NFE.\nTo help understand the distribution of our net financial earnings by quarter, let me walk you through how we expect NJNG's utility gross margin and CEV's revenues will occur.\nFor NJNG, we expect to recognize approximately 70% of our utility gross margin in the first half of the year, in line with our historical trends.\nAt CEV, the majority of our revenue will come in the second half of the year, in particular the fourth quarter, when we expect to recognize the majority of our SREC revenue.\nWe expect the net financial earnings contributions of our Storage & Transportation business to be fairly consistent throughout the year, because of the fixed price contracts.\nOn slide 12, we've highlighted the details of our SREC hedging program.\nWe continue to actively hedge to ensure SREC revenues are largely unaffected by future changes in SREC prices.\nEnergy year 2023, we increased our hedge level to 75%.\nComparing year 2024, market fundamentals and pricing remained strong with SREC trading at over 85% of SACP.\nAnd we now have 49% of our 2024 volumes hedged.\nTurning to slide 13.\nI'll explain some of the nuances to achieve the revenue recognition for the AMAs.\nUnder the terms of the agreements, NJR will initially release the transportation capacity to our counterparty, and later on, will permanently release the contracts to the utility.\nThe accounting standard requires to allocate revenue to both the initial and permanent release.\nWith the disproportionate amount of revenue signed to the permanent releases that occur in fiscal years 2024 and 2032.\nSubsequently, this allocation will generate a mismatch between revenue and cash proceeds.\nFinally, I will note that while the revenue provides some general indication of the NFE, it does not reflect the impact of taxes, demand charges and other items.\nImportantly, though, the cash proceeds provides us with additional benefits that I'll detail shortly.\nAs you can see on slide 14, we now expect our cash flows from operations to grow the CAGR of approximately 25% from fiscal 2020 to 2024 compared to our previous estimate of 20%.\nAnd as you can see from the chart on the right, the strength of our cash flows implies that our dividends are expected to become a smaller percentage, supporting our long term dividend growth rate of 6% to 10%.\nAnother benefit from the AMAs is the improvement to our credit metrics, which you can see on slide 15.\nAs we reported at our Analyst Day, our FFO to adjusted debt ratio is rising from fiscal 2022 to 2024.\nAnd when you have the positive impact of the AMAs, our metrics are expected to increase to the high teens in fiscal 2022, and reach about 20% by fiscal 2024.\nAnd because of these strong credit metrics, we will cash settle the equity forward we put in place during our December 2019 equity issuance.\nAt that time, we issued 5.3 million shares, and we entered into an equity forward to issue an additional 1.2 million shares at a later date, which we no longer need to do.\nAlso, as we mentioned during our Analyst Day, we have no block equity needs in foreseeable future.\nBefore I open the call to questions, I'd like to summarize the quarter.\nNJR is off to a good start for fiscal 2021 and on track to meet our NFEPS guidance for this fiscal year.\nWe increased our fiscal 2022 NFEPS guidance by $0.15 per share, and we expect strong cash flow to support our dividend growth.\nOur key infrastructure projects, SRL and Adelphia Gateway, continue to make progress, and we expect both to be in service this calendar year.\nOur improved credit metrics allow us to cash settle our equity forward.\nAnd as we said in our Investor Day, we have no need for further block equity issuances.\nAnd we've made substantial progress in our commitment to de-risk the Energy Services business by providing more stable fee based revenue.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:They involve risks and uncertainty, and actual results may differ materially.\nOur comments also include non-GAAP measures.\nOn a U.S. GAAP basis for the first quarter of 2021, NOV reported revenues of $1.25 billion and a net loss of $115 million.\nLater in the call, we will host a question-and-answer session.\n2020 is 1-2 punch of an oil supply price war, followed closely by an oil demand crushing global pandemic led to a sharp decline in demand for oilfield equipment and consumables through the year.\nNOV's results for its first quarter of 2021 reflect the full impact of the shock wave emanating from the combination of these events that led to this historically painful downturn in an industry noted for painful downturns.\nAs we reported in our operational update on March 16, the quarter was further impacted by other factors: severe winter weather and power outages in Texas and Oklahoma led to 63 NOV facilities being shuttered for a week or more.\nAdditionally, new pandemic control measures flared up overseas, which shut down another couple of large plants and disrupted our supply chains for certain raw materials, notably fiberglass and resin.\nAnd as if that weren't enough, the quarter also ended up being impacted by higher costs on two projects related to poor execution on our part.\nIn one case, a new pipe design has proven more expensive to manufacture than expected.\nAnd another, an offshore platform component was delayed because our engineering took longer than expected.\nBoth have been corrected.\nDespite these, the final quarterly results, slightly exceeded our March forecast due to better progress on cost reductions overall as well as, and this is important, more and more green shoots emerging in the oil field, particularly in Wellbore Technologies and particularly in North America.\nAlthough we would still face headwinds in many markets, our confidence continues to mount that the worst is behind us.\nNorth American oilfield activity continued its recovery during the quarter, with March revenues up sharply from January for certain of our earlier cycle domestic businesses, while international results began to point to early signs of a recovery as well.\nNevertheless, the first quarter sequential decline in capital equipment revenues reflect the pummeling our backlog took in 2020, which led to consolidated revenue declines of 6%.\nEBITDA fell to breakeven, which is unacceptable and is prompting further cost reductions.\nAs a provider of capital equipment and spares to the oilfield, our results lag those of our customers, generally speaking.\nThe first quarter of 2021 reflects the preceding nine months of crashing oil demand and a virtual cessation of capital spending, offset by substantial downsizing and cost reductions.\nWe believe this down cycle is the worst our industry has ever seen.\nOil prices went negative in April.\nIn August, the U.S. rig count hit its lowest level since records began in World War II.\nNorth American frac fleet utilization hit single digits.\nBy year-end, more than 100 North American oil and gas companies had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with a combined debt of over $100 billion.\nWere not for a couple of large projects that were awarded before the lockdown, FIDs for offshore projects in 2020 would have marked the lowest since 1960.\nAlthough the recovery has begun taking hold in many markets, average first quarter rig counts were down 46% for North America land, 36% for international land and down 31% for offshore year-over-year.\nWhen I say that it has been a historically bad downturn, what I mean is that it has been a measurably provably historically bad downturn.\nIn this environment, our oilfield service customers are sticking to the tried and true survivor playbook of cannibalizing equipment, spares and consumables, deferring maintenance, reducing spending to bear substance levels and hoarding precious cash.\nNOV's largest competitor in this environment is idled equipment.\nBy fall, every stacked rig had become an incremental source of drill pipe, shaker screens, handling tools, etc at same dynamic applies across all categories of oilfield equipment when utilization collapses and service companies fight to keep the lights on.\nA year ago, day rates began racing to find bottom at daily cash costs, which were insufficient to cover long-term maintenance cash costs, much less the capital consumption costs represented by depreciation.\nFor many sectors, year-end 2020 day rates reflected desperation.\nCompanies discounting to keep some assets and crews working and spending cash only as a last resort.\nConsequently, NOV's oilfield backlogs fell throughout the year and first quarter annualized revenue run rate is down 45% from just five quarters ago.\nHere's the good news.\n160 years of oilfield history demonstrates that this dynamic is always temporary.\nThe amount of idled equipment available to be parted out falls as activity resumes and dwindling spares and consumables must be restocked as utilization improves.\nWe're beginning to see the early signs of this in certain areas as rigs and frac fleets go back to work.\nIdled stripped drilling rigs must have cannibalized pumps and handling tools replaced to go back into service.\nAnd this rebuilding, restocking and reactivation phenomenon occurs at a time when service company desperation is evaporating and optimism is growing with rising oilfield activity.\nWe know this because NOV has lived it through recovery cycles like this in the past.\nAs the oilfield goes back to work, customers will soon start to worry about nontrivial cash investment required to reactivate rigs and equipment.\nThink about the courage required to put your precious cash into the business that almost killed you last year.\nThat's what these customers face when it comes to reactivations.\nWe believe our customers will require higher pricing on their incremental assets going back to work in order to mitigate risk by achieving quicker paybacks on their reactivation investments.\nPlus they'll need to cover rising wage pressures and other inflationary forces and more on that in just a moment.\nAnd if oil prices remain constructive, pricing momentum will lift margins and return significantly, such is the nature of the cyclical business we serve.\nNOV will be a key recipient of this unit reactivation investment.\nAs various basins and categories of equipment pass through the inflection to emerge into higher day rate regimes, their orders for capital equipment will accelerate.\nThis is the sweet spot of our business model.\nThe historical oilfield events of 2020 have led predictably to an enormous disassembly of well construction capability by the oilfield services industry, the tried and true playbook I referred to earlier.\nEvery surviving oilfield service company on the planet has made it this far by downsizing extraordinarily well.\nCollectively, our surviving customers are the dream team of cost-cutters.\nAnd they have been hard at it for several years before, tripling their cost-cutting ferocity in 2020.\nIt stands to reason that the aggregate capacity to construct wells has been materially diminished in our view.\nIf the global economies continue to recover out of COVID and demand more oil, the oilfield services industry will be tested to get back to normalized levels of wellbore construction sufficient to meet rising oil demand.\nWe think that's more likely than not.\nFirst, governments around the world responded to the economic turmoil of the pandemic with unprecedented stimulus packages.\nFor instance, the G10 plus China passed more than $20 trillion of stimulus in the aggregate.\nThis has led to stunning money supply growth.\nThe U.S. M2 is up 27% year-over-year, as an example.\nGenerally, money supply growth and low interest rates inflate asset prices, including commodity prices like oil.\nNext, drug companies invented a vaccine, several, actually.\nWhile there are fits and starts, global vaccination efforts are progressing, positioning the world to emerge from the pandemic lockdown.\nHuge economic stimulus and a powerful catalyst, vaccines, to more or less simultaneously open economies, coupled with sharply improved household balance sheets and a widespread desire to get our lives back to normal, well, I cannot conceptualize a more compelling recipe for a synchronized global economic recovery of a size that we have not seen since the 1950s post-war boom.\nWe believe this synchronized recovery will lead to rising oil consumption.\nIn fact, leading demand indicators for crude oil, gasoline and distillate already point to a stronger recovery than many economists expected, and global inventory levels appear to be normalizing ahead of schedule.\nOn the whole, this is a highly constructive backdrop for oil prices for the next few years in our view.\nKey risk to this thesis include excess Saudi and OPEC capacity, which is scheduled to trickle in over the next several months, and the possibility of the return of Iranian crude production.\nHowever, record levels of crude inventories achieved through the first half of 2020 have, to the extent we have visibility into them, largely dissipated.\nThat only happens because withdrawals have exceeded additions.\nSo supply, held artificially low by OPEC, has been less than demand, held artificially low by the pandemic lockdown.\nAnd the key question is, what will the picture look like as artificial constraints on both ease.\nAnother risk is the productivity of U.S. shales which achieved extraordinary levels of growth off and on throughout the past decade.\nSimul fracs and other advancements point to the relentless march of the domestic E&P industry toward greater efficiencies.\nBut to be fair, the domestic E&P industry was helped in the prior era by, one, gobs of cheap capital that fuel drilling programs seeking production growth; and two, duress in oilfield services that held pricing below that required to replace, let alone earn a return on the capital consumed in the construction of these wellbores.\nCapital, when they can get it, is far, far more expensive now.\nAnd it feels like it is becoming even more so as ESG factors play a more prominent role in investment decisions.\nAnd the incremental investments that will be required to restore oilfield service well construction capabilities will also demand higher returns.\nLayer in on top of that, the consolidation among domestic E&P operators, the higher cost of attracting labor back to the oilfield while a major economic expansion is under way, giving workers a lot of other high-paying options, and well, you get the picture; a return to material production growth from U.S. shales will be more challenging this time around from where we sit.\nBehind the artificial production constraints imposed by OPEC, Russia and Saudi Arabia, the artificial consumption restraints imposed by COVID economic lockdowns lies impressive depletion math.\nAll oil wells decline.\nTo what level has the aggregate natural decline of oil well has been obscured by these artificial constraints.\nWe can debate about what the true supply demand picture looks like, but one thing we can all agree on is that both are far more opaque in 2021 than any prior year.\nAfter all, we've never had an economic shutdown like this before.\nMy point is this, when the industry materially cuts its expiration, its development, it's steady construction of the platforms, projects and wells that produce the oil that our global economy relies on, and further, eviscerates the tools of the oilfield services industry that actually do the work, there will be a day of reckoning.\nThroughout this historic period, NOV has been steadfast in: one, reducing our costs, which are down $12.6 billion since 2014, including approximately $2 billion in annual fixed cost reductions; two, improving our cash flow, which has delevered our balance sheet; and three, investing in the next-generation of technologies, both for the oilfield as well as emerging renewables opportunities.\nWhether it's the next-generation of rig floor technology, like our robotic pipe handling system controlled in our NOVOS digital environment; our ideal e-frac fleet, outfitted with our QuickLatch system and FlexConnect frac host system to remove both emissions and manpower from the completion process; or NOV Max, our digital platform that brings out -- brings all the disparate data sources together for the operator to utilize as he or she sees fit.\nNOV remains at the forefront of the next-generation of oilfield technology.\nOur push into supporting the energy transition focuses on areas where we believe we can carve out significant competitive advantages while delivering superior economic returns for our customers in wind, solar, geothermal and other emerging energy sources.\nseven out of eight Wellbore Technologies business units posted sequential growth in the first quarter, reflecting surging demand for certain products.\nConsequently, we began to add shifts to manufacturing, and we achieved the highest level of absorption we've seen since the first quarter of 2020.\nNOV witnessed share gains for our ReedHycalog bits in West Texas and Saudi Arabia, despite increasing prices due to strong performance and rising activity.\nDrilling motor demand is also increasing and downhole friction reduction tools are completely sold out in certain North American markets as revenues were up more than 30% sequentially.\nWe pushed drilling motor pricing up double digits in some areas.\nNorth American rig instrumentation and solids control services pricing is up double digits on new work back to pre-COVID levels and poised to rise further.\nIn our international markets, we expect our wired drill pipe jobs to increase over 25% in the second quarter.\nAs operators become increasingly convinced of the value of real time, high bandwidth data from the bottom of their drill strings, something that's only available through our proprietary IntelliServ Wired Drill Pipe technology.\nGlobal OCTG demand appears to be picking up, which led to double-digit sequential growth in NOV Tuboscope's pipe inspection services worldwide.\nAnd despite continuing day rate pressure on drilling contractors, Grant Prideco posted a book-to-bill greater than 100% as operators are requiring larger 5.5-inch drill pipe to accommodate better hydraulic performance, leading drilling contractors to purchase this pipe with our proprietary Delta premium connections.\nOn the whole, higher oil prices and higher rig counts, particularly in North America, placed Wellbore Technologies at the forefront of the oilfield recovery.\nOn the other hand, Completion & Production Solutions and Rig Technology segments continue to battle through low capital equipment backlogs and stingy customer spending.\nHowever, the CAPS segment saw its book-to-bill for new capital equipment orders above 100% for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2019, an indication of better results to come.\nThe group's North American quick turn businesses began to see improvement.\nNorth American production chokes backlog popped 30% and our reciprocating pump backlog grew 69% sequentially.\nWe won another Tier four dual fuel fleet upgrade for a domestic pressure pumping service provider and demand for coiled tubing strings tripled from its low point in the second quarter of last year.\nWhile we lost a large project in Alaska, we did win another large project for Brazil, and both projects are evidence that perhaps operators are moving forward with some decisions after protracted COVID-related malaise.\nRig technology sees challenging conditions for rig capex in the near term, but it did see double-digit growth in spare parts orders, followed by two record low spare parts order quarters in a row.\nIt is also seeing rising inquiries for rig engineering around offshore drilling rig reactivations.\nSo while our first quarter results were terrible, I'm growing increasingly confident that results will improve significantly as the year progresses.\nOur spare parts, consumables and services businesses tied to activity are seeing it already, and our sales force is wasting no time repairing pricing to acceptable levels.\nAnd healing for our capital equipment businesses always begins with rising orders, which we started to see in many businesses for the first time in 1.5 years.\nYou skillfully position the company to support our customers and to capitalize on opportunities to serve them better.\nMost importantly, through a year that has thrown a lot at our team, you've taken care of each other.\nI'm incredibly proud to serve with you and appreciate all that you do.\nJose, Blake and I look forward to better days with you as things improve through 2021.\nNOV's consolidated revenue fell $78 million or 6% sequentially to $1.25 billion during the first quarter of 2021.\nThe sequential decline was the result of ongoing austerity from our customer base, operational disruptions from severe weather and COVID-19 challenges, which continue to play global supply chains.\nA simple way to summarize the quarter is that January was extremely slow, February was a frozen disaster and in March, orders began to pour in, and we made up a lot of lost ground, giving us confidence that our results will improve through the rest of the year.\nOngoing cost-out initiatives, a higher-margin revenue mix and better pricing, limited sequential decremental margins to 22%.\nHowever, we take no comfort in this performance, given that we are breakeven EBITDA, which is unacceptable in any market environment.\nWe continue to challenge our organization to look for new ways to drive incremental efficiencies.\nDuring Q1, we realized $52 million in annualized cost savings and identified an additional $31 million in opportunities, bringing the total we expect to achieve in 2021 to $106 million.\nDuring the first quarter, our operations used $27 million in cash and capital expenditures totaled $49 million.\nIt's typical for the organization to consume cash in the first quarter, and we expect to be free cash flow positive for the year.\nWe ended the first quarter with $1.61 billion in cash and $1.85 billion in gross debt or net debt of $244 million.\nFollowing the end of the quarter, we fully redeemed the remaining $183 million of our senior notes due in December 2022 with cash on hand.\nAs a result, our next bond maturity does not occur until December 2029, and interest expense should decline roughly $1 million per quarter.\nMoving on to our segment results.\nOur Wellbore Technologies segment generated $413 million in revenue during the first quarter, an increase of $40 million or 11% sequentially.\nCost cutting, improved absorption in our manufacturing plants, a more favorable sales mix and better pricing drove 55% incremental margins and a $22 million increase in EBITDA to $34 million or 8.2% of sales.\nOur ReedHycalog drill bit business achieved 20% revenue growth with strong improvements across the Western Hemisphere.\nReedHycalog's technology leadership is driving market share gains in most markets, and the gains helped drive modest revenue growth in the Eastern Hemisphere during a quarter in which we typically see a seasonal slowdown.\nShare gains, improved absorption, better pricing and cost-cutting drove incremental margins of almost 50%.\nWe expect our ReedHycalog business to post another solid sequential improvement in Q2, led by growing activity in the Middle East and Asia Pacific markets.\nOur Downhole Tool business realized a 13% sequential improvement in revenue, led by sales growth that meaningfully outpaced the increase in drilling activity in the Western Hemisphere, partially offset by seasonal declines in the Eastern Hemisphere.\nOperators working to reduce trips, maximize hydraulic flow and reduce friction are driving improved demand for our SelectShift drilling motor, fluid hammer, impulse axial pulse technology and agitator tools.\nA more favorable sales mix, higher volumes, improved operational efficiencies and better pricing allowed the business to deliver 50% incremental margins during the quarter.\nOur WellSite Services business realized a 16% sequential increase in revenue, primarily from improving results in its solid control operations.\nThe business unit has steadily recaptured market share in North America from desperate competitors that have fallen out of the market over the last several quarters and is now starting to claw back pricing.\nOur M/D Totco business realized low single-digit revenue growth in the first quarter.\nRevenue from surface sensor and data acquisition offerings in the Western Hemisphere improved in line with drilling activity but was partially offset by the seasonal falloff in capital equipment sales to the Eastern Hemisphere.\nThe business unit's eVolve wire drill pipe optimization services achieved record rental service revenue, and as Clay mentioned, picked up additional jobs for Q2.\nOur track record of improving drilling efficiencies for operators is driving an increasing rate of adoption.\nHowever, the relatively high cost of wire drill pipe in a capital-constrained market has mostly restricted the service offering to operators that have complex wells with tight drilling parameters.\nWe believe our new low-cost, next-generation wire drill pipe technology could significantly expand the market and accelerate the adoption of our wired drill pipe enabled services.\nOur Tuboscope pipe coating and inspection business posted a 10% sequential increase in revenue.\nDemand for inspection services improved globally and was particularly strong in the U.S., where piece counts from steel mills and outside processors improved 43%.\nRevenue from coating operations fell due to seasonal declines in the Eastern Hemisphere, which more than offset improving demand in North America.\nOur Grant Prideco drill pipe business achieved a high single-digit sequential increase in revenue.\nA higher proportion of large-diameter premium pipe in our sales mix drove outsized incremental margins despite meaningful costs associated with the winter storm, which included facility repairs, overtime pay and scrapping costs from power outages that occurred during sensitive heat-treating operations.\nThe business unit achieved a 104% book-to-bill, which should allow for another sequential improvement in Q2.\n31% of our orders came from North America, the highest percentage in quite a while.\nAs Clay mentioned, we saw strong demand for 5.5-inch pipe driven by operators seeking greater hydraulic efficiencies consistent with the driver we're seeing for our high flow rate drilling tools at a time when there continues to be ample supplies of 4.5- and 5-inch customer-owned drill pipe in the U.S. For our Wellbore Technologies segment, we expect activity gains in the U.S. and Latin America to moderate and activity in the Eastern Hemisphere to recover, resulting in sequential revenue growth of 8% to 10% during the second quarter.\nWe also expect continued improvement in the segment's cost structure and better pricing, which should allow incremental EBITDA margins near 50%.\nOur Completion & Production Solutions segment generated $439 million in revenue during the first quarter, a decrease of $107 million or 20% sequentially.\nThe sharp decline was primarily due to depleted backlogs, severe weather-related disruptions and supply chain challenges.\nEfforts to reduce costs and improve operational efficiencies limited decremental margins to 30% and EBITDA declined $32 million to a loss of $4 million.\nOrders for the segment improved $57 million sequentially to $338 million, resulting in a book-to-bill of 127%; the segment's first book-to-bill greater than 100% since the fourth quarter of 2019.\nDuring the quarter, we began to include orders for subsurface fiberglass fuel storage tanks in our capital equipment backlog.\nExcluding this addition, our book-to-bill would have been 115%.\nOur Fiber Glass Systems business realized a 25% sequential decline in revenue.\nDifficulties faced by the unit were emblematic of what we saw in most of our capital equipment businesses during the first quarter.\nWe anticipated absorption challenges resulting from five straight quarters with a book-to-bill below 1, but severe COVID-19 and weather-related disruptions also impacted operations.\nCOVID outbreak shut down our two large manufacturing facilities in Malaysia for three weeks, and the pandemic's impact on global supply chains resulted in shortages of epoxy resin and glass fiber, which limited manufacturing output at our facilities.\nSevere winter weather further hampered operations and caused customers to defer deliveries due to transportation constraints and difficulties installing large subsurface storage tanks and frozen soil.\nDespite demonstrating the near-perfect case study for Murphy's law, our team did everything within reason to protect the bottom line and was able to maintain positive EBITDA margins.\nWhile ongoing supply challenges may not be fully resolved until August, the outlook for this business seems to be improving with each passing day.\nA significant pickup in orders in March for our fuel handling products allowed the unit to post a book-to-bill north of 100%.\nWe're also seeing demand return from marine scrubbers in Asia and fiberglass pipe in the Middle East, providing us with confidence that the business should realize steady improvement in its results throughout the remainder of 2021.\nOur Intervention & Stimulation Equipment business realized a mid-single-digit sequential decline in the first quarter, its fifth straight quarter of declining revenue.\nDespite continued weakness in the North American market, the segment achieved its second straight quarter with a book-to-bill greater than 1.\nDemand for wireline equipment, particularly in the Middle East, Europe and Africa, has been a bright spot.\nAnd while our global coiled tubing business experienced a sharp falloff in Q1, quoting activity from international markets remains healthy and improving completions activity in the U.S. is driving greater demand for consumables.\nIn the pressure pumping space, activity levels have increased significantly, but pricing for our customer services remain well below pre-COVID levels, forcing cannibalization and low-cost purchases of distressed equipment to sustain operations.\nOpportunities to cannibalize are limited.\nAnd while equipment auctions continue, the quality of iron on the auction block is quickly deteriorating.\nAs a result, we're seeing a significant increase in quotes, albeit off extremely low levels for new equipment.\nOur Q1 cementing equipment orders were double the amount we received the entire second half of 2020.\nAnd we're also seeing increasing demand for stimulation equipment with enhanced capabilities and reduced emissions.\nDuring Q1, we booked an order to convert 16 Tier two frac pumps to new Tier four DGB dual fuel units that can run on a combination of diesel fuel and natural gas, lowering operating costs and emissions.\nAdditionally, we're seeing growing interest in our ideal e-frac stimulation equipment, which recently finished its first field trial where our pump completed more than 200 stages at rates up to 22 barrels per minute, nearly 3 times that of a traditional 2,500 horsepower unit.\nWith improved bookings and growing demand for aftermarket services, we expect our Intervention & Stimulation Equipment business will realize a meaningful pickup in revenue during the second quarter.\nOur XL Systems conductor pipe business experienced a sharp sequential decline in revenue during the quarter, resulting from a backlog that was depleted after eight straight quarters with a book-to-bill of less than 1.\nOur team limited decremental margins to only 17%, and we achieved a 143% book-to-bill indicative of improving market conditions.\nInterestingly, we've seen certain customers award work then delay deliveries, while other customers are scrambling hard with urgent orders for newly established near-term spud dates.\nSo sentiment remains mixed, if not a little unusual, but we take the current dynamics as a net positive.\nMeanwhile, competition remains fierce with desperate competitors offering pricing and payment terms that we will not match.\nFortunately, our technological and quality differentiation allows us to win a sufficient number of projects that are not entirely driven by pricing, such as the award we received associated with the industry's first 20,000-psi well development project.\nOur Subsea flexible pipe business realized a low double-digit sequential revenue decline with outsized decremental margins resulting from lower volumes, a less favorable product mix and the manufacturing challenges associated with the new pipe design that Clay mentioned.\nWhile bookings remained light, customer dialogue and order outlook has improved, particularly in Brazil, where we expect large projects to advance later this year.\nHowever, exact timing remains somewhat uncertain as extreme COVID-19-related challenges in the country make it difficult to coordinate efforts and complete essential engineering work required to advance projects.\nWe believe the offshore production-oriented components of our CAPS segment are at or near bottom.\nOn our last several calls, we've mentioned how we've been pursuing a large number of offshore production-related projects that continue to push out quarter after quarter.\nWe finally started to see some of these projects shake loose and remain hopeful that stronger oil prices could support more FIDs through the year.\nFor the second quarter of 2021, we anticipate revenue from our Completion & Production Solutions segment will improve between 15% to 25% sequentially, with incremental margins in the mid-20% range.\nOur Rig Technologies segment generated revenues of $431 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $6 million or 1% sequentially.\nA small increase in capital equipment sales related to offshore wind was more than offset by the seasonal falloff in aftermarket services.\nA less favorable revenue mix and weather-related disruptions resulted in a $6 million decline in EBITDA to $13 million or 3% of sales.\nOrders for the segment declined $78 million sequentially to $112 million, yielding a book-to-bill of 59%; the segment's sixth quarter out of the last seven with a book-to-bill of less than 1.\nOrders for rig capital equipment remained weak as drilling contractors continued to cannibalize idle equipment and minimize spend.\nDespite improving activity and dialogue, there remains a distinct lack of urgency from our customers.\nQuotation levels increased 25% sequentially, and the conversion of quotes to orders also improved, however, only quotes for small orders converted to bookings.\nWe aren't losing larger orders to competitors and customers are not canceling projects.\nThere's simply just a lack of urgency and potential orders keep sliding to the right.\nOngoing waves of COVID-19 outbreaks in international markets do not inspire confidence and neither does uncertainty around the timing of when several of our offshore drilling contractor customers will exit bankruptcy.\nWhile customers in the Middle East and Asia continue to express the need for newbuild rigs and offshore customers require meaningful upgrades for reactivations, we expect the lack of urgency will keep the book-to-bill for our traditional rig equipment business below 1 times.\nHowever, we are optimistic that a few additional quarters of stability in commodity prices and improving activity levels will do quite a bit to move projects forward.\nOn a more positive note, we began manufacturing the first two rigs from our new manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia.\nNear-term revenue from these projects will help offset the expected weakness in our rig equipment order book.\nAs a reminder, the plant has a commitment for 50 drilling rigs over the next 10 years and accounted for $1.8 billion in backlog.\nWe expect to deliver the first rig at the end of this year, a rig in each quarter during 2022 and five rigs per year beginning in 2023.\nIn our Aftermarket business, spare part bookings increased 22%, led by demand from the Middle East and U.S. land markets as the ability to cannibalize stacked rigs has nearly run its course.\nAs previously mentioned, several of our larger offshore customers are in the late stages of restructuring processes, and we currently have a large amount of their equipment sitting in the -- in our shops.\nWe're optimistic that once capital structures are reset and more FIDs advance, we will realize a meaningful pickup in service repair and recertification-related work.\nOur renewables business has a completely different field than our traditional rig business.\nDuring the quarter, we booked an order for the design, jacking systems and crane for a European wind turbine installation vessel.\nOur Q1 offshore wind order intake was modest relative to the opportunities we are pursuing, which include over $400 million in potential projects that could be awarded before the end of the year.\nLooking ahead to Q2, we expect growth in our renewables business, improving aftermarket activity and progress on the rigs in Saudi Arabia to offset the impact of weak orders from our rig capital equipment business, which should lead to results for our Rig Technology segment that are in line with the first quarter.\nWith that, we'll now open the call up to questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Joining me are Bill McDermott, our president and chief executive officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our chief financial officer.\nDuring today's call, we will review our third-quarter 2021 financial results and discuss our financial guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021 and full-year 2021.\nWe'd also like to point out that we present non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nA replay of today's call will also be posted on our website.\nWhile a beat-and-raise headline from ServiceNow is familiar, it is no less extraordinary.\nOur team delivered another outstanding quarter, yet again significantly exceeding the high end of our guidance across all metrics.\nSubscription revenues were up 31% organically.\nThis is unprecedented in our industry.\nCRPO was up 32%, subscription billings were up 28%, operating margin was 26%.\nWe again have raised our guidance for the full year, strengthening our clear path to $15 billion-plus in revenue by 2026.\nI was introduced as ServiceNow's CEO more than two years ago.\nWe've all seen a lot since then.\nWhat we've never seen is such consistent innovation and execution at global scale.\nAnd we're only getting started.\nBefore Gina gives you a complete report, let's talk about this dramatic structural incline at ServiceNow.\nThe pace of digital investment is accelerating.\nIDC has consistently sized this opportunity at $7.8 trillion over a four-year period.\nWith this massive addressable market, ServiceNow is at the intersection of two generational opportunities: First, the need for a new technology foundation is supercharging our close partnership with CIOs.\nA recent Wall Street Journal report highlighted the role of CIOs as the architects of digital business.\nOngoing advances in public cloud and machine learning are forging a new era of software innovation.\nTechnology teams want a fully integrated software cycle: planning, development, deployment, operations and service.\nServiceNow is leading this 20th to 21st century migration for our customers.\nThe Now Platform, with its immense versatility and scalability, has become the control tower for digital transformation.\nThe second dimension fueling ServiceNow is the reordering of the enterprise application platforms for hyperautomation.\nLeaders today recognize their technology architecture is their business architecture.\nOver several decades, enterprise has invested trillions into on-premise and first-generation SaaS applications.\nThese applications satisfy the business process needs of the 20th century.\nToday, new business models require a fully connected value chain.\nLegacy environments are not adaptive enough to enable this change.\nAs the pioneer of modern digital workflows, ServiceNow is leading the renaissance.\nThe Now Platform connects different applications and data sources to create intuitive mobile experiences, all at a consumer grade.\nWe don't ask businesses to bet everything on a single system or collaboration tool.\nWe give choice, which not only unlocks value from our platform but from other platform investments as well.\nServiceNow also empowers anyone to build applications on our platform.\nIn its low-code development technologies report, Gartner estimates that 70% of new applications developed by 2025 will use low-code or no-code technologies.\nGartner also named ServiceNow as a leader in its Magic Quadrant.\nThese tailwinds are driving fast organic growth across our entire solutions portfolio.\nThe number of deals greater than $1 million was 63, up 50% year over year, signaling substantial adoption of our platform strategy.\nIn Q3, IT workflows remained very strong.\nITSM was in 18 of our top 20 deals while IT Operations Management had 10 deals over $1 million.\nInternal Revenue Service is in a multiyear digital transformation effort.\nIn Q3, they chose ServiceNow to consolidate 12 complex systems into a single platform to support the agency's mission-critical operations.\nDemand for our entire IT portfolio is strong.\nAnd with the launch of Lightstep Incident Response in Q3, we are unlocking a new wave of product-led growth in application monitoring and observability.\nEmployee Workflows also had a fantastic quarter with HR in 13 of our top 20 deals.\nIn Q3, NTT Data will leverage the Now Platform to create an employee experience portal, enhancing productivity for hybrid work and managing vaccine administration for its entire workforce.\nMomentum continues for Customer Workflows with CSM in 12 of our top 20 deals and eight deals over $1 million.\nIndustry vertical solutions are leading the way with major brands.\nVerizon is adopting our telco solution, American Century, our financial services solution, and Sunbelt Health, our healthcare solution.\nCreator Workflows, which helps businesses build their own applications, was exceptional in Q3 in 18 of our top 20 deals.\nWe're partnering with Stanley Black & Decker to bring ServiceNow's new manufacturing vertical solution with App Engine to change how they serve their customers.\nTogether, we're maximizing facility uptime and delivering great experiences for distributors, dealers and end consumers.\nFujitsu will also expand its use of the Now Platform to drive its own digital transformation.\nWe couldn't be prouder that Uber, Honeywell, Telia and many others all chose ServiceNow in Q3.\nThis is a complete performance for the company, strong growth across the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific/Japan.\nAs we look to a strong finish in 2021 and beyond, here are a few of the many factors giving us great confidence in this business.\nFirst, while lots of talent is raging out there, we're highly encouraged by the colleagues choosing ServiceNow in record numbers.\nOur new joiners, together with our amazing global workforce, are building a uniquely inclusive, driven, and happy culture.\nWe're also seeing major developments in our partner ecosystem.\nJust three weeks ago, we announced a new partnership with Celonis.\nCelonis will deliver process mining insights, ServiceNow will build better workflows, our customers will gain from the integrated approach.\nWe also deepened our long-standing partnership with Microsoft.\nServiceNow's Employee Center can now be directly embedded in Microsoft Teams, reaching 250 million monthly users.\nTogether with our expanding partner community, we will reduce complexity to make work better for people.\nFinally, innovation without disruption is a hallmark of our best-in-class engineering tradition.\nWhen we say without disruption, we mean invisible, a seamless upgrade experience for our customers.\nIn our Now Platform Rome release, we delivered countless new features to customers, including Mobile App Builder, an Automation Discovery tool, Employee Journey Management and new Customer Service Playbooks.\nEvery business leader in the world is looking at the future of work.\nThese new features give the Now Platform even more capability to build that hybrid future.\nI'll defer to a comment made by industry analyst Josh Bersin, who said on our Rome Platform release, \"This company seems to be able to build and deploy enterprise software faster than almost any I've ever seen, and that's why they're a juggernaut\".\nJosh, naturally, I agree.\nIn closing, the company is firing on all cylinders.\nThe quarter speaks for itself.\nWe beat again, we raised again.\nThe secular tailwinds are at our back.\nOur customer base is expanding just as our customer NPS is increasing.\nOur partner ecosystem is fired up.\nWe accelerated our timeline to be net zero.\nWe help businesses drive their own ESG initiatives on our platform with a major release.\nThe list goes on and on.\nOverall, our message to the market couldn't be any clearer.\nWhatever systems, challenges or opportunities you have, however fast you need to move, you have a trusted innovator in ServiceNow.\nWe want to make the world work better for everyone, and we'll never lose our focus on the privilege that comes with saying, the world works with ServiceNow.\nGina, over to you.\nQ3 was another fantastic quarter with continued outperformance across all of our growth and profitability guidance metrics.\nDemand was strong globally across all three of our geos.\nThe consistency of our results quarter after quarter exemplifies the strength of our product portfolio and the team's focus on building deep customer relationships.\nQ3 subscription revenues were $1.43 billion, $22 million above the high end of our guidance range and growing 31% year over year, inclusive of 100 basis points tailwind from FX.\nRPO ended the quarter at approximately $9.7 billion, representing 34% year-over-year growth.\nCurrent RPO was approximately $5 billion, representing 32% year-over-year growth and a 2-point beat versus our guidance.\nCurrency did not have an impact on year-over-year growth.\nQ3 subscription billings were $1.38 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth and a $55 million beat versus the high end of our guidance.\nFX and duration were 150 basis points tailwind year over year.\nWe saw broad-based strength across the industries we serve, with transportation and logistics and business services seeing particularly robust net new ACV growth.\nOur renewal rate was a healthy 98% in Q3, a testament to the value ServiceNow delivers to our customers.\nWe view our relationships with customers as long-term partnerships, and we continually innovate to provide new solutions to address their evolving business needs.\nThat land-and-expand motion has manifested into a base of 1,266 customers paying us over $1 million in ACV, up 25% year over year.\nAs the breadth of our portfolio and the addressable opportunities have expanded, so too have our deal sizes.\nWe closed 63 deals greater than $1 million net new ACV in the quarter, up over 50% year over year.\nAnd in Q3, all of our top 20 deals included four or more products.\nOperating margin was 26%, 3 points above our guidance, primarily driven by the strong revenue beat.\nWe also saw savings from the delay in return to work and lower travel.\nOur free cash flow margin was 15%.\nTogether, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability.\nWe're delivering great experiences that drive powerful employee engagement, fierce customer loyalty, and significant productivity gains.\nBy delivering more intelligent automation that provides even better experiences, we are well-positioned as the workflow standard on our journey to becoming a $15 billion-plus revenue company.\nWe're raising our guidance for the full year.\nWe're raising our subscription revenue outlook by $32 million at the midpoint to a range of $5.565 billion to $5.57 billion, representing 30% year-over-year growth, including 200 basis points of FX tailwinds.\nWe are raising our subscription billings outlook by $61 million at the midpoint to a range of $6.379 billion to $6.384 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth.\nExcluding the early customer payments in 2020, our normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 32% year over year at the midpoint.\nGrowth includes a net tailwind from FX and duration of 200 basis points.\nWe continue to expect 2021 subscription gross margin of 85%, and we're raising our full-year 2021 operating margin from 24.5% to 25%.\nThis reflects the increase in our top-line growth and savings from the delay in return to work and lower travel.\nWe're also raising our full-year 2021 free cash flow margin by 50 basis points from 31% to 31.5%.\nAnd we expect diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 202 million.\nFor Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $1.515 billion and $1.52 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth, including a negligible impact from FX.\nWe expect CRPO growth of 27% year over year.\nThis includes a 150-basis-point FX headwind due to sharp movements recently in the euro and pound.\nOn a constant currency basis, we expect CRPO growth to be 28.5%.\nWe expect subscription billings between $2.305 billion and $2.31 billion, representing 26% year-over-year growth.\nExcluding the early customer payments in Q4 of 2020, our normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 32% year over year at the midpoint.\nGrowth includes a net headwind from FX and duration of 50 basis points.\nWe expect an operating margin of 22%, which includes accelerated demand generation spend in the quarter to set us up for a strong start in 2022, and we expect 203 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter.\nIn summary, the pace of digital investment is accelerating, and ServiceNow is rising up to seize the opportunities before us.\nThe team has never been more engaged and focused on serving the enormous needs of our customers.\nAnd as ServiceNow becomes the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century, we are also remaining steadfast in our goal to create positive impact in the world.\nI'm happy to announce that in September, we committed to reaching our net-zero emissions goal by 2030, two decades earlier than our previous goal.\nWe've never been prouder of our employees and their continued focus on serving our customers, partners, and communities as we make not only work, work better but the world work better, too.\nOur hungry and humble culture is stronger than ever.\nAnd with that, I'll open it up for Q&A.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including impacts from the pandemic and related governmental responses and their impact on the general economy, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are described in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.\nAlso during the call, we will reference a number of non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe impact of foreign exchange rate changes subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter, interest rate increases differing from assumptions outlined in guidance, impact from the further spread of COVID-19 or other variants, and environmental and litigation charges.\nIt was a successful year across EnPro as we continue to rise to the occasion to meet the challenges and opportunities that have arisen over the past 12 months.\nTo begin, I will provide financial and strategic highlights for the full year, and then Milt will share details on our fourth quarter results.\n2021 represented another transformational year at EnPro.\nWe continue to successfully reshape our portfolio and shift toward our growth markets with products and services that command higher margins and cash flow returns.\nWith the acquisition of NxEdge and the divestiture of CPI in December, as well as the divestiture of the polymer components business in the third quarter, we achieved meaningful strides in our portfolio reshaping strategy, which is positioning our company for a very promising future.\nAs volumes recovered from the 2020 pandemic lows, we saw positive momentum across the organization.\nFor the year, sales grew 6.3% to $1.14 billion.\nOrganic sales grew 14.4%.\nWe saw strong demand in most markets, including general industrial, semiconductor, heavy-duty truck, petrochemical, food and pharma, and aerospace.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $208.4 million, increased by 23.8% compared to 2020.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin of 18.3%, increased 260 basis points, driven primarily by organic sales increases.\nSelect product, select price actions, and the net benefit of strategic portfolio reshaping completed in both 2020 and 2021, partially offset by raw material inflation, as well as supply chain labor and logistics constraints.\nAs we said last quarter, we still expect raw material inflation and supply chain challenges to continue.\nAnd we will see uncertainty and volatility in the macro environment as we enter 2022.\nOur commercial and supply chain teams continue to evaluate all opportunities to mitigate these current circumstances, while meeting the needs of our customers in the Strong demand environment.\nWe are realizing the substantial benefits of our portfolio reshaping actions, which have enabled us to capture incremental margin expansion in 2021 while keeping a close eye on cost and further simplifying our already agile organization.\nOur strong order trends continued during the fourth quarter and we are beginning 2022 with solid demand.\nIn particular, we continue to see broad-based strength across our businesses and are encouraged by what we are hearing from our customers, particularly in semiconductor, heavy-duty truck, aerospace, nuclear, and food and pharma markets.\nAs we look forward, we continue to invest both organically and inorganically in our Advanced Surface Technologies and Sealing Technologies segments, while driving cost and return improvements in the Engineered Materials segment.\nWe will build upon this core industrial technology foundation, now in place, maintaining our focus on margins and cash flow returns.\nFurther, we expect to maintain our strong recurring revenue streams with aftermarket revenue across our businesses approaching 50% of total company revenue.\nFinally, we remain focused on driving long-term shareholder returns through a disciplined approach to capital allocation supported by our steady cash flows and also through our commitment to sustainability and diversity.\n2022 marks our 20th year as an independent public company.\nAs I enter my first year as EnPro CEO, I marvel at how far we have come and could not be more excited for what the future will hold for all of our stakeholders.\nI will now hand the call over to Milt for a deeper dive into our financial results for the fourth quarter.\nWe had another solid quarter despite the well-publicized headwinds we and many others faced.\nAs reported, sales of $280.8 million in the fourth quarter, increased 1.7% year over year.\nWe saw strong demand in the semiconductor, heavy-duty truck, aerospace, general industrial, and food and pharma markets, as well as contributions from the acquisitions of Alluxa and NxEdge, which were largely offset by the reduction in sales due to divestitures and weakness in the automotive market.\nOrganic sales for the fourth quarter increased 10.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $47.7 million, decreased 0.8% compared to the prior-year period.\nAdjusted EBITDA was impacted by inflationary pressures affecting raw materials, freight and labor costs, and higher SG&A, more than offsetting pricing initiatives and the benefit of the reshaping actions completed in 2020 and 2021.\nCorporate expenses of $26.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 were up from $10.6 million a year prior, driven primarily by acquisition-related expenses associated with the NxEdge transaction, as well as increased incentive compensation expenses, driven mainly by our fourth quarter share price performance.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.23 was essentially flat compared to the prior-year period.\nSuch amortization -- amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets in the fourth quarter was $12.7 million, compared to $10.9 million in the prior-year period, reflecting the additions of Alluxa and NxEdge.\nNow, let's move to a discussion of segment performance for the fourth quarter of last year.\nDue to the impact of divestitures, Sealing Technology sales of $143.9 million, decreased 7% versus the prior year.\nExcluding the impact of divested businesses and foreign exchange translation, sales increased 12% versus the prior-year period, driven primarily by strong demand in heavy-duty truck, aerospace, nuclear, and food and pharma markets.\nAlso due to businesses divested in 2020 and 2021, adjusted segment EBITDA decreased 12.3% versus the prior-year period.\nExcluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange translation, adjusted segment EBITDA increased 3% compared to the prior-year period.\nResults in the quarter were also impacted by inflationary pressures affecting raw materials, labor and freight costs with such pressures concentrated in our trucking business.\nThese costs were offset by pricing initiatives and leverage on the organic volume increase in the segment.\nTurning now to Advanced Surface Technologies.\nFourth quarter sales of $69.1 million, increased 38.5% versus the prior-year period, driven by strong demand in the semiconductor market and the acquisitions of Alluxa and NxEdge.\nExcluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange translation, sales increased 16.6% versus the prior-year period.\nFor the fourth quarter, adjusted segment EBITDA increased 35.7% versus the prior-year period, driven by the acquisitions and strong organic sales growth.\nExcluding the impact of the acquisitions and foreign exchange translation, adjusted segment EBITDA increased 10.4% compared to the prior-year period.\nThe growth in EBITDA while strong was partially impacted by timing delays and the launch of advanced node chips.\nMoving forward, our qualification and production work with semiconductor customers gives us confidence in the organic growth and profitability profile for our semi business, both in the coming year and over the long term.\nIn Engineered Materials, sales decreased 7.3% versus the prior-year period, driven by the divestitures of the GGB bushing block and CPI businesses.\nFor the quarter, sales to the automotive market were weak due to chip shortages affecting auto production, particularly in comparison to a strong auto market in the fourth quarter of 2020 that continued in the first half of 2021.\nExcluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange translation, sales were flat.\nFourth quarter adjusted segment EBITDA decreased 21.9% versus the prior-year period, driven by raw material inflation and supply chain headwinds, as well as the decline in automotive production in Europe and the United States.\nExcluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange translation, adjusted segment EBITDA decreased by a comparable amount around 20.2% compared to the prior-year period.\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow.\nWe ended the fourth quarter with cash of $338.1 million, $310 million of which is located outside the United States.\nWe have initiated efforts to repatriate portions of this cash for use in debt reduction, where it makes sense to do so from a tax efficiency perspective.\nAt December 31, we had $213.6 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility.\nFree cash flow in 2021 was $123.2 million, up from $39.3 million in the prior year, driven by higher operating profits and lower cash taxes resulting from a tax refund associated with a federal income tax audit resolution, partially offset by working capital investments supporting stronger demand.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we paid a $0.27 per share quarterly dividend.\nFor the year, dividend payments totaled $22.4 million.\nOur board of directors voted to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share effective with the March payment representing our 7th consecutive annual increase in our quarterly dividend since we began paying dividends in 2015.\nMoving now to 2022 guidance.\nTaking into consideration all the factors that we know at this time, we expect low double-digit revenue growth over reported 2021 sales of $1.14 billion and we expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $263 million to $275 million, implying adjusted EBITDA margins north of 20%.\nFurther, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $6.70 to $7.25 using a normalized 27% tax rate, reduced from 30% last year.\nThe reduction in our normalized tax rate assumption for 2022 results from the portfolio actions completed late in 2021 which tilt our portfolio to a higher portion of earnings in the United States.\nOur guidance assumes depreciation and amortization expense, excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $37 million to $39 million and net interest expense of $30 million to $33 million.\nOur net interest expense estimate factors in 425-basis-point increases in our variable borrowing rate as 2022 progresses.\nUnderlying demand and order trends remain strong as we enter 2022, even as inflationary raw material cost, the impact of the omicron variant on labor availability, and supply chain and logistics constraints that put early year pressure on growth and margins.\nWe will be implementing additional pricing actions across the company as the year progresses in response to inflationary headwinds.\nFinally, I want to note that we continue to monitor the current COVID situation and will remain attentive to the safety and well-being of our colleagues, who have demonstrated great resilience in the face of the very challenging conditions over the past two years.\nEnPro had a remarkable year.\nI am proud of our team and our many accomplishments as we perceive and doing what we said we would do, execute on our multi-year strategy to transform EnPro into a leading industrial technology company, leaning into our best businesses, while investing in markets with faster growth, higher margins, and higher cash flow returns.\nOur 2022 guidance implies adjusted EBITDA margins around 21%, up from the 14% in 2019 when we first began our portfolio reshaping strategy.\nAll the while remaining steadfast in our dual purpose of delivering outstanding financial results and enabling and supporting development of our colleagues and the communities in which we operate.\nOur journey is just beginning.\nWe appreciate your interest in our company.\nNow I'll open the line to questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Along those lines, recall that in the third quarter of 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of $99 million related to an equity method investment.\nSo we will speak to the quarterly results excluding that charge.\nA full transcript and download will be posted after the call.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires.\nOur third quarter results reflect a strong performance from the team as we delivered third quarter records for operating ratio, net income, income from railway operations and earnings per share.\nWhile volume held steady with last year, revenue grew an impressive 14% and our 60.2% operating ratio reflects a 230-point improvement on a year-over-year adjusted basis, our second-best OR performance ever, outpaced only by last quarter's 58.3% mark.\nIn the midst of significant supply chain disruptions and labor shortages across the country, we're delivering upon our commitments.\nAnd we could not have achieved those milestones without the tireless work of our employees who day in and day out, keep our customers' goods moving safely and efficiently.\nNow let's turn to Cindy to go through our operations.\nIn the quarter, we continued to successfully drive productivity improvement throughout the network.\nWe worked to be as efficient as possible as we adjusted to accommodate demand shifts in many of our markets.\nThis quarter shows continued progress as we attack our cost structure while positioning ourselves for further improvement in both cost and service levels.\nThe quarterly operating metrics on slide six clearly show that, once again, we generated positive operating leverage on flat unit volumes and GTMs that were up 5%.\nWhile we are proactively hiring train crews, efficiency in all areas of our operations, including engineering, mechanical and communications and signals, enabled us to run the network with 7% fewer people in the quarter compared to a year ago.\nBecause assets drive activity, reducing the number of active locomotives was an important lever in managing the size of the workforce.\nBoth train weight and train length continue to improve, driven by a focus on improving the productivity in our bulk network.\nCoal, grain and other single commodity unit trains offer real opportunity for gains through collaborating with our customers on operating trains with more cars per set and by doubling up existing trains over portions of their route.\nI expect we will show continued progress in the fourth quarter as we see the fruits of our efforts.\nWhile strong coal traffic helped drive train weight more than length, train length continued to improve and set another quarterly record.\nAfter seven consecutive quarters of fuel efficiency improvements, we saw a modest deterioration this quarter despite the increase in train size as our horsepower leverage was challenged at times due to volatile traffic flows and we had modestly fewer of the very heavy, highly fuel-efficient trains.\nI am pushing the team to respond more quickly in the face of change, and we are committed to closing the gap with our peers over time and are redoubling our efforts in this critical area.\nAs you can see on slide seven, train speed and terminal dwell were generally flat versus second quarter and do not reflect performance at desired levels.\nWhile there were some effects from Hurricane Ida, those impacts were localized, and I'm extremely proud of how the team, especially engineering and our signal forces, helped us return our routes in Louisiana to operation and reopen the New Orleans Gateway very quickly.\nAs I mentioned last quarter, we are experiencing hiring and retention conditions that are increasingly challenging, especially in some of our more critical locations, and it is having an impact on our network.\nDespite hiring all year long, attrition has been accelerating in each of the last two quarters in several of those critical areas.\nIn many of these locations, we've been able to absorb the impact by executing upon productivity initiatives, and this will be very much a part of the equation going forward as we grow capacity, which I'll talk about more in a moment.\nSome of the things we are doing to create relief: we've more than tripled our conductor trainee rank since the first quarter so that we can effectively backfill in critical areas; we've implemented tools such as perfect attendance bonuses, referral bonuses and signing incentives to improve the stickiness of our current and future workforce; and we continue to leverage the valuable Go Teams to quickly respond to business opportunities where needed.\nPeople are the backbone of the railroad, and we need to make progress on these initiatives to better manage the effects of a tight labor market.\nWe are committed to having the right amount of resources in the right place at the right time, which will drive both cost control and service quality.\nAs our business mix continues to evolve, creating capacity across our market segments has become an even more significant area of focus as highlighted on slide eight.\nSome shippers are looking to take advantage of unexpected market opportunities by shipping extra volume.\nOthers are looking for us to help them adjust to volatility coming from other parts of their supply chains, and of course, all place a high value and service predictability.\nWe're adjusting our network and operations to generate the various types of capacity that customers are looking for.\nFor example, increases in both train sizes give shippers extra lift without further demands on our crew base.\nTrain size increases often require connecting railroads, customers and Norfolk Southern to change processes, and we have found those process changes are worth the effort because they improve asset turns and capacity.\nWe also continue to focus on terminal efficiency, whether helping to drive dwell at our biggest hump yard, Elkhart, to very low levels or tactically redirecting trains to intermodal terminals that have the capacity to unload quickly.\nMoving to slide nine.\nI want to show how we can use these capacity efforts to drive productivity.\nWe've had great success over the past two years driving train size and, in doing so, have addressed a handful of infrastructure bottlenecks.\nWe're fast-tracking a set of siding improvements, the first of which went into service at the end of the third quarter so we can keep making progress.\nBigger trains unlocked by siding extensions helped drive locomotive utilization because it allows us to fully match train size to available pulling power.\nAnd because locomotives are at their most efficient when pulling hard, this is a key lever to our fuel efficiency improvement.\nWhile I've used locomotives and fuel as my primary example, capacity additions have a similar effect on our crew productivity: more cars per crew, asset turns, keeping trains moving with greater train capacity, and also helps our customers with improved train and car performance.\nOn slide 10, we are complementing our investment in physical capacity with a comprehensive technology strategy that makes our crews more efficient and our assets more productive.\nVirtually all of our routine signal and track maintenance is now scheduled via the mobile track authority app, a process that used to be measured in minutes can now be accomplished in seconds.\nIt is inherently more efficient than the radio process of the past, and most importantly, safer because it reduces transcription errors.\nIn the words of our chief engineer, the app has been a game changer for the productivity of his forces.\nWe're doing the same with our mobile train reporting app, which enables our train crews to quickly report completed work and to receive updated customer work requests while in route.\nThis takes a lot of hands out of the process, including significant retyping and delay and enables our crews to be more productive.\nWe're still early in the deployment of this application with rollout to the local trains that do the preponderance of pickups and setoffs just beginning.\nThe use cases for this technology in the field are numerous, and driving adoption and innovation around this platform is a focal point that will allow us to capture additional benefit.\nThe common use thread in these apps is that better information allows people to plan.\nOur track supervisors can better plan their schedule knowing the availability of track time, and our customers can better plan their plant operations and product pipeline with up-to-date shipment information.\nIn the third quarter, we continued to execute on our growth plan, yielding double-digit revenue gains in each of our three markets, further demonstrating our ability to deliver value for our customers and shareholders.\nBeginning on slide 12, I will highlight our results for the third quarter.\nWe achieved total revenue of $2.9 billion, representing a 14% increase from the same period last year despite flat volumes.\nOur revenue performance this quarter was driven by significant gains in revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel, both reaching record levels with double-digit year-over-year growth.\nThis reflects the success of our ongoing efforts to yield up and improve revenue quality, a strategy that enhances our long-term potential for revenue and margin growth as conditions improve.\nRevenue in our merchandise segment improved 10% year-over-year, while volume increased to 5%.\nGrowth was led by our Chemicals franchise that benefited from recovering energy demand that drove higher shipments of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\nAlso contributing to merchandise growth was sustained strength in steel markets due to record-high commodity prices and growth in manufacturing activity.\nSteel shipments were up an impressive 34% from the same period a year ago.\nPartially offsetting these gains were declines in shipments of finished vehicles and vehicle parts due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage.\nThis limited automotive production activity and further depleted finished vehicle inventories to new lows.\nBoth revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel improved year-over-year due to price increases.\nOur intermodal franchise experienced several headwinds related to supply chain disruptions that negatively impacted volume in our domestic and international business lines.\nIn both segments, unprecedented demand from inventory restocking and consumer spending outpaced available capacity in the supply chain ecosystem.\nThe combination of drayage shortages, warehouse productivity, equipment availability, labor force participation and rail network fluidity pressured intermodal volume throughout the quarter, resulting in a 4% year-over-year decline.\nOvercoming these headwinds, we delivered revenue growth of 16% in the third quarter due to higher revenue from storage services, increased fuel surcharge revenue and price strength.\nCoal revenue increased 32% in the third quarter as both domestic and global economies continued to recover from the pandemic and drive demand for electric power.\nExport coal shipments increased significantly as strong demand and record high seaborne prices increased opportunities for US.\nUtility volumes declined in the third quarter as coal supply was limited and some crossover tons moved into the higher-rated export market.\nThe mix shift from utility to export, coupled with price gains, led to a 20% increase in revenue per unit less fuel for coal in the third quarter, a new record for the franchise.\nMoving to our outlook on slide 13.\nWe expect the third quarter environment to continue through the end of the year.\nStrong consumer demand will continue, while pressures from material shortages and labor issues remain challenging global supply chains.\nInventory levels remain at historic lows despite the continued push to replenish stock, providing a boost to transportation demand.\nWe remain confident in our ability to leverage our strengths in these market conditions and deliver robust revenue growth for the full year.\nWe expect merchandise business will continue to benefit from recovering economic activity as conditions that limited business and recreational activities in the fourth quarter of last year have been much less impactful in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nWe anticipate our markets for crude oil, natural gas liquids and waste to experience higher volume as a result.\nOngoing demand for steel will also be a growth driver, with forecast for industrial production up more than 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and steel prices currently above $1,900 a ton.\nA projected 4% year-over-year fourth quarter decline in US.\nlight vehicle production will remain a headwind as the industry remains challenged by the chip shortage.\nWithin intermodal, we continue to see strong demand from consumer spending and tightness in the truck sector.\nThese favorable conditions are offset by constraints from supply chain congestion and equipment availability.\nWe are working closely with our customers and our channel partners to mitigate these challenges.\nHowever, we do not see meaningful improvement in these headwinds before the end of the year.\nCoal demand is expected to remain strong with extremely favorable market conditions, although coal supply will be the governor on year-over-year growth.\nNatural gas prices continue to climb, and declining inventory levels leading into the winter months are the current focus of utility customers.\nSeaborne prices are at decades-long highs in the export market, creating demand beyond capacity and supply abilities.\nOverall, we are optimistic about the opportunities in the fourth quarter and confident in our ability to execute our plan to generate value and grow our business.\nTurning to slide 14.\nThere are several factors impacting the supply chain in which we participate.\nThis includes external factors, such as the chip shortage and intensifying congestion in the intermodal supply chain.\nCoal supply availability continues to be a constraint to meet the higher demand in every market as both thermal and met production remain tight.\nNS has taken action to mitigate some of these factors and effectively position us for revenue growth.\nAs drayage challenges affected international intermodal, we provided an alternative storage solution to our customers.\nWe're working diligently to add chassis capacity to support demand and alleviate shortages across the supply chain.\nLast quarter, we outlined our plan to repair a portion of our chassis fleet that was impacted by a manufacturing defect.\nI appreciate the quick action and effort from our team, and I'm pleased to report that this issue is effectively behind us as we have repaired and returned approximately 95% of the recall chassis back to service.\nWe are also in the process of taking delivery of leased chassis to augment our fleet.\nWe've added terminal capacity to support growth driven by e-commerce and a recovering economy as well as reduced terminal congestion and improved network fluidity.\nWe remain focused on growth opportunities across our network.\nWe are continuously innovating to compete in the $800 billion plus truck and logistics market, as shown by our Thoroughbred Freight Transfer or TFT service launched earlier this year.\nTFT is one of our initiatives to drive growth by targeting opportunities for highway conversions to rail.\nThis service combines the efficiency of our intermodal trains, the capacity of our boxcar assets and the last mile flexibility of trucks to provide an innovative door-to-door service.\nWe're also leveraging our sustainability advantage to propel long-term growth.\nThe choice of transportation mode is one of the most powerful levers any shipper has to reduce the size of its carbon footprint, and we are working closely with our customers to deliver additional value through sustainability.\nWe have proven our ability to deliver results despite challenging market conditions by providing innovative solutions that our customers value and position us for future market demands.\nOn slide 16, as Alan just detailed, revenues were up 14% on flat volumes.\nWith operating expenses up 10%, we delivered strong incremental margins leading to 230 basis points of operating ratio improvement, driving us to a Q3 record of 60.2%.\nThe improvement Alan detailed in RPU, coupled with strong productivity, led to record Q3 operating income, with growth of 21% or nearly $200 million.\nAnd our free cash flow is also at record levels, a 33% increase during these nine months compared to last year.\nMoving to slide 17, let's drill down into the change in operating expenses.\nWhile operating expenses grew $149 million or 10%, it's up only 4% or $67 million, apart from fuel cost increases.\nThe fuel cost increase of $82 million is driven mainly by price, but the 5% increase in GTMs also drove more consumption.\nYou'll see purchase services up $35 million, with the majority of the year-over-year increase in areas.\nWe have an increase in technology spend, which is consistent with our technology strategy, and you've heard a couple of project examples in Cindy's remarks.\nThere are also headwinds from Conrail operating expenses.\nAnd there are increases in intermodal costs.\nMore specifically, we had trucking costs associated with shuttling longer dwell containers to satellite parking lots in order to reduce congestion at our terminals and keep the freight moving.\nLift expenses were actually up in the quarter despite fewer lifts, and that is primarily because of inflation we absorbed on lift rates associated with contractor labor availability.\nThis is an area we do expect to see continued inflationary pressure going forward.\nAnd we also absorbed costs in the quarter related to our chassis repairs.\nMoving on to compensation and benefits.\nIt is up 5%, but you'll note the $40 million in savings from 7% lower headcount that more than offset increases in pay rates and over time.\nMeanwhile, incentive compensation comparisons in the quarter are a headwind of $43 million, similar to what we reported in the second quarter, reflecting our strong 2021 financial outlook compared to lower accrual rates last year.\nMaterials, claims and other expenses were all down year-over-year.\nTurning now to slide 18 and looking at the rest of the P&L below operating income.\nYou'll see that other income of $14 million is $25 million unfavorable year-over-year, and that is due almost entirely to lower net returns from company-owned life insurance.\nOur effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.6%, close to our federal and state statutory rates, but unlike Q3 last year where the rate was 21.9% and benefited from tax advantages related to both COLI investment gains and higher stock-based compensation.\nNet income increased by 17% and while earnings per share grew by 22%, supported by 3.6 million shares we repurchased in the quarter.\nWrapping up with our free cash flow on slide 19.\nAs I have mentioned, free cash flow is a record through nine months of 2021 at $2.3 billion, buoyed by very strong operating cash generation, and that translates into a 102% free cash flow conversion.\nWhile property additions are trending a bit lower than run rate for our $1.6 billion guidance number, capital spend is never linear, and we expect fourth quarter property additions will get us close to the $1.6 billion.\nWe first demonstrated our commitment to sustainability with our visionary appointment of a Chief Sustainability Officer back in 2007, the first in the industry.\nAnd our efforts to support a low-carbon supply chain have greatly accelerated since then.\nBuilding upon the momentum earlier this year with the approval of our science-based targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction and our launch of $500 million in green bonds in the second quarter, we're excited to report another set of milestones on our sustainability journey.\nIn August, we released our 2021 ESG report, our 14th annual report on corporate responsibility, highlighting the transformational role sustainability is having on our business as we further integrate sustainable practices into daily operations.\nWe celebrated our 500th modernized locomotive unit in partnership with Wabtec in August and announced our collaboration with Progress Rail in September on a first of its kind Tier four locomotive prototype for yard and terminal operations.\nAnd just earlier this month, we announced our decision to purchase 100% renewable energy to power company operations in Altoona in Reading, Pennsylvania.\nOur commercial and sustainability teams work hand in hand to provide demonstrable low-carbon solutions to a wide variety of current and prospective customers, providing a compelling value proposition as we convert more freight from truck to rail, simultaneously benefiting our customers, our communities and our shareholders.\nBefore we open the call to Q&A, I'll take a moment to provide an update to our outlook based on the current economic environment.\nAs shared previously, we expect to achieve an operating ratio improvement above 400 basis points for the full year versus our adjusted 2020 result.\nAnd there's likely upside to the 12% year-over-year revenue growth, as strength in our consumer-oriented and manufacturing markets drive the majority of the growth.\nNear-term upside in coal markets provides a boost for the balance of the year as well, though coal remains challenged in the long term.\nWe are delivering on our financial commitments and remain focused on creating long-term sustainable value for our customers and shareholders.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We appreciate you joining us.\nFirst, I'm going to discuss the details behind our third quarter 2020 financial results.\nPaul will then comment on the key drivers behind our Q3 results, our outlook for the remainder of 2020 and some general comments on 2021.\nI will return to provide our financial guidance for the fourth quarter and an update to the full year 2020 guidance.\nWe'll then end the call with a question-and-answer session.\nIn addition, some of our discussion may include non-GAAP financial measures.\nNow, let's discuss our third quarter results in which we achieved $0.91 in adjusted earnings per share, a 21% increase over Q3 of 2019 and adjusted EBITDA of $58 million, a 13% increase.\nThese results reflect outperformance in worksite employee growth and pricing relative to our expectations in this uncertain and challenging business environment and upside in our direct cost programs brought about by the dynamics of the pandemic and the structure and ongoing management of these programs.\nAs for our growth metric, the average number of paid worksite employees in Q3 of 2020 increased by 1.7% sequentially over the Q2 period to 231,750, which was above the high-end of our expected range.\nNow you may recall that employee layoffs in our client base drove a 6% reduction in paid worksite employees from the outset of the pandemic in March through the low point in May of this year.\nSince then, worksite employees have grown sequentially as employees returning to work and being hired by our clients have outpaced any further layoffs.\nAdditionally, client retention for both Q2 and Q3 has remained at our historical level of 99% and worksite employees continue to be added from new client sales.\nGiven these recent positive trends, we now expect paid worksite employees to return to near pre-pandemic levels by the end of this year.\nNow let's move on to gross profit, which increased by 8% over Q3 of 2019.\nWorksite employee volume and pricing above target levels, combined with upside in our benefit and workers' compensation programs, resulted in significantly higher-than-expected gross profit.\nThis quarter's benefit costs included some favorable development from Q2, a period of highly unusual claim activity due to the impact of the shutdown orders.\nIn addition, healthcare utilization began trending toward more normalized levels in the third quarter, although not to the degree of our expectations.\nGoing forward, we expect further normalization along with the resumption of some deferred care in COVID-19 testing and treatment costs, the extent and timing of which is still uncertain.\nOur workers' compensation program continues to perform well due to ongoing management of safety practices and claims.\nRecent favorable claims development has been associated primarily with periods prior to the pandemic.\nAnd any favorable impact from the reduction in severity of workers' compensation claims associated with the work-from-home status of many of our clients' employees would likely favorably impact our costs in future periods as this claim experience develops over time.\nAs for our pricing, we charge our clients a comprehensive service fee, inclusive of our HR services and direct cost programs.\nWe entered 2020 with certain pricing targets set prior to the offset of the pandemic.\nAnd we continued to manage toward these budgeted targets.\nAs you may recall, certain savings resulting from the disruption caused by the pandemic were negotiated with our vendors and were passed along to our clients in the form of a comprehensive service fee credit as reflected in our Q2 financials.\nNow turning to operating expenses, Q3 operating expenses included continued investment in our growth, including costs associated with a 10% increase in the average number of trained business performance advisors.\nOther corporate employee head count has remained level over the past three quarters due to the effort and effectiveness of our staff in the face of increased HR service demands from within our client base.\nCost savings have been realized in other areas of the business, including travel, training and other G&A costs, as we manage through the current business environment.\nThe Q3 year-over-year increase in total operating expenses of 15% was impacted by increased stock-based compensation costs.\nNow this increase was driven by a few items: first, our outperformance in the level of paid worksite employees and earnings during the pandemic; second, the shift in the weighting to performance stock awards from the performance cash awards for 2020 to further align our employees' interest with shareholders during these challenging times; third, the acceleration of expense for employees meeting retirement eligibility requirements under recent modifications to our plan; and fourth, a comparison to prior year's quarter in which earnings and related performance-based compensation were adversely impacted by large healthcare claim activity.\nNow operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization increased just 4.6% over Q3 of 2019.\nNow, as far as our financial position and liquidity, it remains strong as we manage through the pandemic conditions, continue investments in our growth and provide returns to our shareholders.\nAdjusted cash has increased from $108 million at December 31, 2019 to $213 million at September 30th, while repurchasing 1.3 million shares of stock at a cost of $91 million, paying now $47 million in cash dividends and investing $69 million in capital expenditures to-date during 2020.\nBorrowings increased by $100 million over the nine months and $130 million remains available under our credit facility.\nToday, I'll provide comments on three topics, starting with some thoughts on our significant outperformance in the recent quarter.\nI will then discuss how the primary drivers to our business model reacted to the pandemic, resulting in the opportunity implied by the guidance we are providing today to attain double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA this year.\nI'll finish with some comments on our view of these factors going forward, which will ultimately drive our outlook for 2021.\nWe are certainly pleased with our execution in the third quarter, which resulted in a variety of factors contributing to better-than-expected results.\nThe resiliency of our client base supported by our dedicated service providers combined with solid sales and retention to drive a nice rebound in sequential growth in our key metric paid worksite employees.\nNet gain in worksite employees from within our client base exceeded our expectation as client hiring of furloughed and new employees occurred sooner and at a faster pace.\nAs Doug mentioned, client retention continued at historical levels of 99%, despite the economic pressure on small businesses in the current environment.\nIn addition, our booked sales since the pandemic have been approximately 70% of our pre-pandemic sales budget, which we believe is solid performance in a virtual selling environment.\nIn the third quarter, paid worksite employees from previously booked sales was 92% compared to the same period last year, demonstrating continued demand for our services and strong execution in enrolling new clients.\nAnother highlight of the quarter was our strong pricing of both new and renewing accounts in service fees and allocations for direct costs, including our benefit programs.\nThe matching of price and direct cost is critical to our model and exceeding our targets in this area is important as direct cost affected by the pandemic normalize.\nWe've also been able to continue to grow and develop our BPA team through this quarter.\nDuring this period, we virtually trained over 350 BPAs in our Level 1, 2 and 3 and our certified Business Performance Advisor programs.\nOur trained BPA count increased 10% over the same period last year, positioning us well for our fall selling season.\nThis quarter, we were also able to divert some operating expense savings to develop client testimonial videos and increase advertising to support our fall selling season and our retention campaign.\nThese videos captured the emotion we were hoping for demonstrating the value of a sophisticated HR function in a crisis.\nWe were also able to continue important technology development beyond responding to the many compliance needs that emerged earlier this year.\nWe are extending our People Analytics platform, which has been very well-received by our mid-market and enterprise clients to our emerging growth segment just in time for our critical renewal period.\nWe are continuing to make strides improving in Insperity Premier, our proprietary human capital management system, rolling out a new time and attendance user interface and using new behavioral analytics tool to guide road maps making premier easier and more efficient for clients.\nThe bottom line for the third quarter was that we experienced the ideal combination of higher volume and pricing and lower direct and operating costs.\nEach of these elements contributed to our strong outperformance in the quarter.\nSo we have responded quickly and effectively to the unusual events we've experienced in 2020 meeting client needs and achieving better-than-expected growth and profitability.\nWe've also kept our eye on the long-term making progress on many important initiatives.\nNow that we have three quarters under our belt and our estimate for Q4, we can evaluate how our business model has reacted during the pandemic.\nWhen the pandemic hit, we did not expect our business model would have the potential to generate double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA that we have within the guidance we're providing today.\nThe effects for the pandemic on our business model ran the full gamut from obvious expected negatives to completely unexpected positives.\nIt's worth taking a moment to summarize these factors that drive the model since, as we all know too well, this pandemic is not over and it appears the effects will carry into 2021.\nFor example, one would think the pandemic a health issue would increase health costs.\nHowever, what we've seen is that rising COVID cases created the need to protect hospital capacity and limit elective procedures, which combined with people's behavioral tendency to avoid hospitals as much as possible, healthcare expenses have actually declined significantly in the short-term.\nLonger-term healthcare costs may be elevated due to the deferral of [Phonetic]care or cost associated with treatment of COVID or vaccines.\nTo this point, we have not seen these cost increases to actually increase the overall trend as other offsets like telemedicine and some level of deferral of care [Phonetic] continues.\nIn addition, many experts, including the CDC, are anticipating that the precautions currently being taken to reduce the spread of COVID could substantially reduce the incidence of flu this year.\nAn obvious negative factor we experienced from the pandemic related to lockdowns was the economic effect on small and medium-sized businesses, which affects us in the form of layoffs in our client base.\nWe saw a drop in paid worksite employees of approximately 6% in two months, followed by a steady rebound over the following four months, supported by fiscal stimulus and easing restrictions.\nIn retrospect, the CARES Act and specifically the Paycheck Protection Program was effective in mitigating some level of layoffs.\nFurther, we believe our quick and effective support of our clients to take advantage of these programs played a role in fewer layoffs occurring and a faster rebound.\nThe effects of the shutdown also highlighted one specific advantage in our business model, which is our client selection strategy.\nDue to our risk-based client selection process, we have a very small percentage of our client base in industries most affected by the pandemic and shutdowns such as entertainment, hospitality, travel and restaurants.\nAnother surprise somewhat due to our client selection strategy has been the nominal business closings we have experienced in our client base.\nAlthough we expected to see an increase, our strategy of targeting the best small and mid-sized businesses across a wide range of industries proved to provide some insulation from this factor as we saw no significant increase in business failures.\nAnother dramatic effect we experienced was the increased workload as many issues arising from the pandemic landed in the HR department.\nAs I mentioned last quarter, client interactions increased 300% and the average length of time of these interactions doubled.\nThis five-fold increase in workload has diminished somewhat, but remains elevated.\nOn the flip side, lockdowns led to working from home.\nIn our case, this resulted in improved productivity and our dedicated staff performed heroically in response to the increased demand for our services.\nOur experience leads us to believe working from home is effective for ongoing routine activities.\nHowever, innovation and collaboration may suffer in the longer-term.\nA hybrid scenario of working from home and coming into the office may provide optimal productivity, efficiency and innovation going forward.\nAnother upside in our model from the lockdowns and work-from-home environment across our client base is a substantial decrease in the incident rate of workers' compensation claims.\nThis impact is yet to be reflected in our cost, but -- and should benefit future periods to some degree.\nHowever, these lower costs may be offset by COVID-related claims that may be covered by workers' compensation in some states.\nAn additional upside surprise to me has been our effectiveness, continuing to sell in a virtual environment with a service offering as comprehensive and complex as ours.\nWe now know the range of sales efficiency under these conditions.\nAnd as we integrate face-to-face meetings back into the mix, we could see a longer-term efficiency gain.\nOne final observation is the success we've had during the pandemic in retaining clients even as financial considerations prevailed on our client base.\nOur services simply were invaluable and clients have continued our premium services despite the need to tighten their belts.\nSo now that we have a better understanding of the factors driving our business model during a pandemic, what does that mean as we look ahead to 2021?\nWell, first, it means planning will be dependent on these factors and drivers that are likely to ebb and flow based upon the state of the pandemic.\nWe will be monitoring these new inputs very closely and we'll finalize a budget later than usual to include the most recent information.\nMaking estimates at an early stage makes little sense in view of the number and range of possibilities, especially when considering the timing and degree of severity of the pandemic or the actions that may occur to mitigate its effects.\nFor example, COVID cases are on the rise now, but one or more vaccines may be available by 2021 or an anticipated economic downturn from additional lockdowns may occur.\nAdditionally, small businesses may be bolstered by additional fiscal stimulus.\nWhat we have learned is there are many moving parts and offsets in our business model in this environment.\nIf the pandemic intensifies, our direct costs may be below our historical trends as we experienced this year, but growth may suffer.\nConversely, if the pandemic is mitigated or under control, direct costs may be elevated, but growth may accelerate as an offset.\nWhat I do know with the degree of certainty today is, we have an amazing organization with the necessary curiosity and brainpower to provide the agility and capability to manage through a crisis and come out with impressive results for shareholders clients and other stakeholders.\nThis year we have demonstrated the depth and breadth of our competence and level of care for our clients to execute on matters within our control, along with inspiring ingenuity and resourcefulness to respond to unexpected events.\nWe are certainly pleased with our 2020 results today and our outlook for the balance of the year and we look ahead with confidence in the future whatever we face next year.\nAt this time, I'd like to pass the call back to Doug.\nNow let me provide our guidance for the fourth quarter and an update for the full year of 2020.\nAs you're aware, there continues to be uncertainty as to duration and the conditions of the pandemic and the trajectory of the economy.\nThe current political environment and the timing and details of any further government stimulus add to this uncertainty.\nWe have taken this into account when providing our financial guidance over the remainder of 2020 and we will be considering these factors in our budgeting process for the upcoming year.\nWe typically do not provide formal guidance for the upcoming year at this time and, therefore, we'll consider any further developments in these areas and the outcome of our year-end selling and renewal season [Phonetic] when providing 2021 guidance in our next earnings call.\nNow based upon the details that Paul just shared, we continue to expect sequential worksite employee growth over the remainder of 2020.\nFor the fourth quarter, we are forecasting average paid worksite employees in a range of 236,500 to 238,500, a sequential increase of 2% to 3% over Q3 of 2020.\nThis equates to an expected decrease in average paid worksite employees of only 1% for the full year 2020 in the face of significant challenges for the small business community caused by the pandemic and its impact on the economy.\nWith an improved outlook for Q4 worksite employee growth, our current pricing strength and a range around expectations in our direct cost programs, particularly our benefits program, we're now forecasting Q4 adjusted EBITDA of $21 million to $30 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.20 to $0.38.\nWhen combined with our Q3 outperformance, we're raising our full year 2020 earnings guidance and now forecasting adjusted EBITDA of $271 million to $281 million, an increase of 8% to 12% when compared to 2019.\nAs for full year 2020 adjusted EPS, we are now forecasting a range of $4.35 to $4.53, up from our previous guidance of $3.67 to $4.04.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:They are based on management's assumptions, which may or may not occur.\nIn addition, some of our comments today reference non-GAAP adjusted measures.\nWe expect to file our 10-K later today.\nAs mentioned, this teleconference is being recorded and will be available on our website following the call.\nPlease note these calls are designed for the financial community.\nWell, years come and go but 2020, as we all know, was unforgettable.\nThe pandemic affected many aspects of our daily lives, and I'm proud of the way our employees pulled together to provide our customers with superior service.\nWe successfully navigated a number of challenges while still achieving our key financial and operational goals.\nWe reported net income from continuing operations of $2.30 per share for 2020.\nThat's driven by solid performance at the gas utility and a strong contribution from our new platform of water utilities.\nOn the gas operations front, our field crews successfully handled everything from wildfires to restoring service in several towns over Christmas to navigating COVID, social unrest, etc.\nJust a few weeks ago, our employees in the natural gas system once again rose to the occasion and provided a reliable service through an extreme weather event.\nOur storage facilities and overall hedge positions worked to mitigate the amount of gas purchased on the spot market and helped to minimize the impact to our customers' bills.\nThis was incredibly important as prices, as everybody knows, spiked across the country from the widespread cold snap.\nOur balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity.\nIn 2020, we also executed on one of the largest capital programs in the Company's history aimed at supporting reliability.\nWe continue to operate one of the most modern and tightest systems in the nation, a system that has no cast iron and no bare steel.\nIn 2020, we invested over $270 million in our natural gas infrastructure.\nFrom an economic perspective, 2020 was truly unprecedented.\nPrior to the pandemic, we had a very fundamentally sound sustainable growing economy with record low unemployment both nationally and in our service territories.\nWe continue to see economic recovery and steady growth in several important areas.\nPortland's unemployment right now is 6.1% in December, actually, essentially matching the national rate that's down from a 14.9% high in April.\nSingle-family housing activity remains strong.\nIn the Portland metro region, home sales were at 8.3% from 2019, with price growth of about 12%.\nAnd new single-family permits issued last year were up 4% compared to 2019 levels.\nAt Northwest Natural, we continue to see good customer growth.\nNew construction plus conversions translated in connecting over 13,000 meters during the last 12 months ended December 31.\nOur overall customer growth rate as a result was 1.5% for the same period, based on this strong single-family home construction, partially offset by the loss of some commercial customers due to the pandemic.\nThe rollout of vaccines is expected to ease pandemic related restrictions and allow businesses to reopen.\nStill, we know these are difficult times for some customers and we've worked very closely with commissions, staff and stakeholders to determine the best way to return to normal business practices.\nWe've agreed to timelines for resuming collection processes and continue to evaluate the parties what makes sense for customers given the economic conditions, while also providing financial assistance and payment plans to vulnerable customers.\nEnhancing the system includes a bill forgiveness program and working with the Oregon Legislature to provide additional funding for bill relief.\nThrough a variety of programs and agencies, we've provided over $4 million to over 10,000 households to pay their bills and stay warm during the last heating season.\nWe also donated about $1 million to nonprofits in our communities and initiated a special COVID-19 employee giving campaign.\nFor Oregon, previously approved new rates took effect on November 1 last year.\nGas bills continue to remain low.\nOur customers are paying about 40% less today for their bills than they did 15 years ago.\nIn addition, in June, we passed back a record $17 million in storage bill credits to Oregon gas customers.\nSafety, reliability and affordability make natural gas a preferred fuel source.\nEight out of 10 homeowners in our service territory prefer natural gas according to a study conducted in December 2020.\nThere's a strong recognition that natural gas is affordable, efficient and preferable to electricity for heating and cooking.\nIn fact, over 80% of respondents said they would pay $50,000 more for a home that has gas amenities over an all-electric home.\nCustomers also showed their appreciation by ranking Northwest Natural second in the West among large utilities in the 2020 JD Power's residential customer satisfaction survey.\nAnd then finally, our Board approved the dividend increase in the fourth quarter back in 2020, the 65th consecutive year of annual dividend increases.\nWe are proud to provide the return to shareholders and be one of only three companies on the NYSE with that long record.\nI will begin by discussing the financial impacts of COVID-19 and the highlights of the fourth quarter and full year 2020 results and then conclude with guidance for 2021.\nIn 2020, our utility commissions approved COVID deferrals and term sheets that outlined the types of revenues and costs that may be recovered.\nThese include PPE, bad debt expense, financing costs associated with additional liquidity and certain loss revenues.\nDirect expense reductions such as lower travel and meals and entertainment are to be netted against the deferral.\nPrudency review and recovery of the deferral accounts will be determined in future proceedings.\nWhile our business model is resilient, we are experiencing some financial impacts related to the pandemic.\nThrough December 31, we incurred an estimated $10 million pre-tax of incremental costs and lower revenues due to the effects of COVID-19.\nOf this, $4.8 million were deferred to regulatory accounts.\nIn addition, $1.3 million of late fee revenue that has not been charged to customers since the suspension of normal collection processes will be recognized in a future period when we begin to recover the foregone fees through rates.\nThe remaining $3.8 million that cannot be recovered through rates are primarily due to lower natural gas utility margin from customers that stopped service and slightly lower usage from customers that are not decoupled.\nIn order to further mitigate the financial effects of the pandemic, we initiated temporary cost savings measures which provided approximately $3.5 million of savings in 2020.\nIn summary, the total P&L impact of COVID in 2020 was $1.6 million.\nTurning to our detailed financial results.\nNote, I'll describe earnings drivers on an after-tax basis using the statutory tax rate of 26.5%.\nAlso note that year-to-date earnings per share comparisons reflect the successful issuance of 1.4 million shares in June 2019 as we raised equity to fund investment in our gas and water utilities.\nAs a reminder, Northwest Natural's earnings are seasonal with a majority of revenues and earnings generated in the first and fourth quarters during the winter heating season.\nFor the quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $45.8 million or $1.50 per share compared to $38.3 million or $1.26 per share for the same period in 2019.\nThe gas utility posted an increase of $0.19 per share related to new rates in Oregon beginning November 1, 2020, offset in part by higher depreciation and general tax expense and the impacts of COVID-19.\nContribution from our other businesses increased $0.05 per share from the water assets we acquired in Washington and Texas and lower expenses at the holding company.\nUtility margin in the gas distribution segment increased $11.5 million from the benefit of new rates in Oregon and customer growth, partly offset by the effects of COVID-19.\nUtility O&M decreased $500,000 in the quarter, reflecting cost savings efforts.\nI am proud of our employees whose hard work and commitment allowed us to accomplish this while still providing exceptional service.\nDepreciation expense and general taxes increased $2.9 million related to the ongoing investment in our system.\nFor the full year 2020, we reported net income from continuing operations of $70.3 million or $2.30 per share compared to net income of $65.3 million or $2.19 per share for 2019.\n2019 results included a regulatory disallowance of $0.22 per share related to an Oregon Commission order on tax reform and pension expense.\nExcluding that disallowance on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.41 for 2019.\nThe $0.11 per share decline is largely due to year-over-year growth in expenses, the effects of COVID and the positive effects of weather and pipeline constraints on 2019 results.\nIn the gas distribution segment, utility margin increased $11.3 million.\nHigher customer rates in Oregon and Washington, customer growth and revenues from the Northwest expansion project contributed an additional $21.5 million.\nThis was offset by lower entitlement and curtailment fees related to pipeline constraints in 2019 and warmer weather in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, which collectively reduced margin by $4.5 million.\nUtility margin also declined $1 million due to lower revenues from late fees as we suspended normal collection processes.\nThe remaining $5.2 million decline in utility margin is a result of the 2019 Oregon order.\nWith the exception of the first quarter pension disallowance, this order has no impact on net income as offsetting adjustments were recognized through expenses and income taxes, as I'll describe in a moment.\nUtility O&M and other expenses declined $5.4 million.\nThis decrease is associated with the Oregon order which resulted in $14 million of additional expense in the first quarter of 2019, as discussed previously.\nThis was offset by a $6 million increase in underlying O&M related to higher compensation costs, contractor and professional service expenses as well as moving costs.\nThis was partially offset by the management driven cost savings measures I described earlier.\nPension expenses, included in other expense, increased $2.8 million.\nHowever, this expense is now recovered in rates.\nOver the last several years, we have invested in our gas system at historically high levels.\nAs a result, depreciation expense and general taxes increased $10.2 million.\nFinally, utility segment tax expense in 2019 included a $5.9 million benefit related to the implementation of the Oregon order, with no significant resulting effect on net income.\nNet income from our other businesses increased $2.2 million from higher earnings from the wastewater, water and wastewater utilities and lower expenses at our holding companies, partially offset by lower asset management revenues.\nA note on capex.\nWe invested $294 million into the business, with $273 million of gas utility capital expenditures and $38 million for water acquisitions.\nOur balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity.\nWith regards to the ongoing effects of COVID-19, approximately 97% of our commercial and industrial customers are current with their bills.\nNonetheless, we have seen some commercial customers go out of business and shut off their meters as they have been negatively impacted.\nWe will continue to monitor -- closely monitor usage levels and commercial customer losses.\nWe will also continue to be disciplined regarding cost management in an effort to mitigate these circumstances.\nMoving on to 2021 financial guidance.\nGas utility capital expenditures for the year are expected to be in the $280 million to $320 million range, including significant projects related to system reinforcement, resource center renovations across our service territory and technology upgrades.\nThe Company initiated 2021 earnings guidance today in the range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share.\nGuidance assumes continued customer growth, average weather conditions and no significant changes in prevailing regulatory policies, mechanisms or outcomes or significant changes in laws, legislation or regulations.\nWhile the past year held challenges, our focus remains the same: providing superior customer service, maximizing returns from our strong and growing regulated natural gas utility and diversifying our business by investing in the water sector.\nWe made progress on that last front with the sale of two investments that were no longer central to our strategy.\nIn August, we sold our interest in the Trail West pipeline project, and in December we completed the sale of the Gill Ranch storage facility in California.\nProceeds from the sales are expected to be reinvested in our gas and water businesses.\nThis past year reinforced our decision to build a water and wastewater utility platform and highlighted the value we bring and can create in this sector.\nOur water and wastewater utilities experienced organic customer growth of almost 3%, 2.8% to be exact, over the 12 months ended December 31, 2020.\nWe also completed infrastructure improvements and filed our first water utility general rate case.\nAlthough COVID temporary slowed acquisition -- temporarily closed acquisition activity -- slowed -- excuse me, temporarily slowed acquisition activity, we were still able to add a water and wastewater utility in Washington to our portfolio and made our first acquisition in Texas.\nAnd we continued to make smaller acquisitions within our existing footprint while pursuing new expansion opportunities.\nI remain -- I continue to remain very excited about the investment potential in this business.\nAnother key pillar of our strategy is aggressively pursuing a renewable future and working to decarbonize our gas utility system.\nBefore I take you through our approach, it's important to remember our starting point.\nNorthwest Natural serves about 74% of the residential square footage in our service territory and meets 90% of our space and water heat customers' energy needs on our coldest days, yet the emissions associated with that use accounts for only 6% of Oregon's total greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn the Northwest, the gas and electric system have concurrent peaks in the winter.\nThe gas system delivers about twice as much energy during the peak than the electric system, with even more capacity available.\nThis advantage positions us well to help drive decarbonization in the region in a way that ensures reliability and affordability.\nAnd, as we have seen in recent weeks, one can never underestimate how important reliability is during the winter.\nLet me walk you through three components of our vision of carbon neutrality by 2050.\nFirst, we intend to continue to pursue aggressive energy efficiency to lower energy usage.\nIn the past 40 years, the number of residential natural gas customers in the US has grown by almost 90%, but demand has remained flat, which is a testament to the industry and how well they foster continued efficiency.\nOur residential customers today use half of the amount of natural gas that they used in 1970 despite consistent growth in the average size of homes and more clients as per home.\nSecond, we're striving to integrate renewable natural gas from a variety of waste streams into our system.\nThe technical potential of RNG supply in Oregon alone is estimated to be nearly 50 billion cubic feet, about the same amount as all of the residential gas throughput in our state.\nNationally, early estimates show about 14 trillion cubic feet of technical potential or about 88% of all throughput.\nClearly, there's vast technical potential.\nNow we need to collectively focus on getting as much as we can to market economically.\nWe also see the potential for hydrogen being added to the pipeline.\nWe believe there are three applications for -- of hydrogen from the power to gas process, blended, methanated and dedicated hydrogen systems.\nWe also envision the possibility of blue hydrogen, made from natural gas and paired with carbon capture, utilization and storage as playing a role in the US gas system.\nAnd we're watching Europe, Canada and Australia efforts -- Australia's efforts in this area.\nIn 2019, Northwest Natural sent a technical team to Europe to meet with government agencies, think tanks and gas companies.\nAnd we learned a lot about new technologies, projects and policy.\nIt was clear Europe was many years ahead of the US and they're thinking about the gas networks system and the role of green molecules in the energy transition that we're all going to go through.\nOnce [Phonetic] they realize gas infrastructure, which is already in place, is a huge advantage, and one great example of this is storage.\nThe natural gas infrastructure is built to provide long duration energy storage that doesn't degrade.\nIt can store RNG and methanated renewable hydrogen today in existing facilities.\nAnd when we think about decarbonization strategies across the energy sector, the fact that the infrastructure already exists and has significant cost advantages is incredibly important in my opinion.\nFor example, Northwest Natural has 20 billion cubic feet of underground storage today.\nThat's equivalent to storing about 6 million megawatt hours of renewables.\nIn today's cost, that would be about a $2 trillion lithium battery.\nAnd this is where policy is key to helping us leverage our existing infrastructure in new ways and accelerate our region's decarbonization efforts.\nIn Oregon, we have Senate Bill 98, the first of its kind renewable natural gas legislation that sets 30-year targets for gas utilities to procure R&D and renewable hydrogen for customers.\nWe just announced our first RNG investment under the bill and are actively working on more.\nNorthwest Natural has started hydrogen blending testing in our training facility, and we're working with Eugene Water And Electric Board in Oregon to propose a project that would include methanated hydrogen for our system.\nWe're excited about these early steps and are committed to pushing for solutions that include system resilience as part of the energy transition.\nNow, more than ever, it's clear to us how critical our gas infrastructure is to furthering our collective climate goals, while also ensuring energy system diversification and reliability for the communities we serve.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:They are based on management's assumptions, which may or may not occur.\nWe expect to file our 10-Q -- or 10-K, excuse me, later today.\nThis teleconference is being recorded and will be available on our website following the call.\nPlease note, these calls are designed for the financial community.\n2021 was a year of success for our company, and we continue to build on our fundamental strengths in our gas and water utilities group, and we launched a competitive renewable natural gas business.\nFor 2021, we reported net income of $2.56 per share, which is an 11% increase compared to net income from continuing operations of $2.30 per share in 2020.\nNew rates in Oregon drove results for the natural gas utility, along with solid customer growth, and we saw higher revenues at our interstate storage business.\nThis financial growth is a product of multiyear efforts, a keen focus on our long-term plan and proof that consistent progress yields positive results.\nWe also see positive momentum in our local Portland Metro Area economy.\nUnemployment rates in this area declined to 3.9% in December 2021, compared to 7.3% a year ago.\nAnd single-family housing activity remains very strong.\nHome sales were up 10% during 2021 compared to 2020, with the average sales price up 16%.\nAnd new single-family permits issued were up 12% with multifamily permits up 37% in Oregon this past year compared to the prior period.\nConstruction and development remained robust in our region.\nThis translated into over 11,000 new customers connecting to our gas system during 2021 for a growth rate of 1.5%.\nOur water and wastewater utilities also continued to grow.\nStrong residential housing construction, primarily in Idaho and Texas, translated into a 3% organic customer growth rate.\nWe also closed four acquisitions in 2021.\nMost notably, we acquired a stake in the largest privately held water company here in Oregon.\nThe combination of organic growth and acquisitions increased our water utility connections by nearly 30% last year.\nNow a few comments on gas facility.\nOn November 1, new rates for gas utility customers went into effect for the current heating season.\nThat included the impact of the general rate case we concluded in the State of Washington.\nDespite these increases, our customers continued to pay nearly 30% less for their natural gas today than they did 15 years ago.\nAnd this reflects the decline in commodity costs, energy efficiency efforts and prudent expense management, along with smart investments in gas storage assets that continue to reap benefits for customers.\nThe result, natural gas continues to maintain its competitive position of fuel of choice.\nAdded to its performance benefits, natural gas enjoys up to a 60% price advantage over an electric or oil formats for the typical home we serve.\nAnd our customers are central to our success at Northwest Natural.\nThat's why I'm thrilled Northwest Natural ranked second best among large natural gas utilities in the J.D. Power Residential Customer Satisfaction Study.\nThis continues a nearly 20-year legacy of outstanding results.\nI'm proud of all of our employees who make this exceptional service happen every day.\nAnd as you know, growth is not always linear, and in certain years, the focus will be on initiatives that set stage for future growth.\n2022 for us is such a year.\nTo that end, 2021 and 2022 include robust capex plans related to crucial spend for safety and reliability, technology system upgrades and cybersecurity investments.\nTo recover these long-planned project costs, we took the necessary step at the end of 2021 and filed in the rate case.\nThe request includes a revenue requirement increase of $73.5 million based on a 50-50 cap structure and ROE of 9.5% and a cost of capital of about 6.7%.\nWe filed an increase in average rate base of $294 million since the last rate case.\nThe Oregon Commission and stakeholders have 10 months to review the case, and we expect new rates to be effective November 1.\nAt the same time, we continue to make progress under the Landmark Oregon Senate Bill 98 Legislation, which supports renewable energy procurement and investment by natural gas utilities.\nI'm happy to report we signed an agreement with Archaea to procure RNG on behalf of our customers in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nNorthwest Natural also recently committed -- excuse me, completed commissioning the first of four RNG projects with Tyson Foods and BioCarbN.\nConstruction on our second facility began this month with commissioning slated for early 2023.\nTo date, we signed agreements with options to purchase or develop RNG on behalf of our customers, totaling about 3% of Northwest Natural's current annual sales volume in Oregon.\nI am very proud of the progress we've made in less than two years.\nTo put it in perspective, today, wind and solar account for about 11% of our total nation's electricity supply after decades of investment.\nWe intend to continue to take these critical steps to source more and more of our supply for renewables, knowing that our customers want a decarbonate system and a clean energy future.\nA new survey conducted by an independent leading opinion search -- research firm showed that 77% of Oregon and Southwest Washington voters want access to all forms of energy, renewable energy, hydro, wind, solar and renewable natural gas for a balanced low-carbon future.\nIn fact, 78% of voters value the natural gas system for its critical role in lowering emissions with both affordability and reliability and, of course, resiliency as top priorities.\nAnd nearly 80% of owners support local government's efforts to encourage the use of natural gas.\nCreating value across all of our businesses allowed our board of directors to increase our dividend for the 66th consecutive year.\nOur annual dividend -- indicated dividend rate is now $1.93 per share.\nWe are very proud to provide returns to our shareholders and be one of only three companies on the NYSE with this record.\nI will begin by discussing the highlights of the fourth quarter and full year 2021 results and conclude with guidance for 2022.\nI'll describe earnings drivers on an after-tax basis using the statutory tax rate of 26.5%.\nAs a reminder, Northwest Natural's earnings are seasonal with the majority of revenues and earnings generated in the first and fourth quarters during the winter heating months.\nFor the quarter, we reported net income of $40.5 million or $1.32 per share, compared to net income of $45.8 million or $1.50 from continuing operations for the same period in 2020.\nThe decrease in net income over last year was driven by results of our gas utility, which posted a $0.15 per share decline in earnings.\nThe other businesses posted a $0.03 per share decrease in earnings, driven by higher business development costs.\nLower earnings at the gas utility were primarily related to higher operations and maintenance and depreciation expenses, partially offset by new rates in Oregon and Washington.\nUtility margin in the gas distribution segment increased $4.5 million as a result of the new rates and customer growth.\nUtility O&M increased $5.7 million, reflecting higher levels of expense for payroll and benefits, contractor and professional services and information technology upgrades.\nUtility and depreciation and general taxes increased $1.6 million due to higher property, plant and equipment as we continue to invest in our system.\nFor the full year 2021, we reported net income of $78.7 million or $2.56 per share, compared to net income from continuing operations of $70.3 million or $2.30 per share for 2020.\nThis $0.26 per share increase was driven by both the gas utility, which contributed an additional $0.16; and our other businesses that contributed an additional $0.10 per share.\nHigher earnings at the gas utility were primarily related to new rates in Oregon and Washington, along with customer growth.\nUtility margin increased $30.7 million as higher customer rates and customer growth contributed $30.9 million.\nThis was partially offset by a loss from the gas cost incentive sharing mechanism as we purchased higher-priced gas during the February '21 cold weather event.\nUtility O&M increased $14.2 million, driven by higher employee compensation and benefit costs, lease expenses for our new operations and headquarters building and higher costs related to information technology system upgrades.\nDepreciation and general taxes increased $9 million.\nNet income from our other businesses increased $3 million, largely due to higher asset management revenues from the cold weather event in February.\nFor 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $160 million, an increase of $15 million compared to last year.\nWe invested $300 million into the business, most of which was for the gas utility capital expenditures.\nOur balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity.\nMoving on to 2022 financial guidance.\nGas utility capital expenditures for the year are expected to be in the $310 million to $350 million range, including significant projects related to system reinforcement and technology upgrades.\nThese capital investments, coupled with higher forecasted expenses from technology and payroll, supported our decision to file the Oregon rate case with rates effective in November of this year.\nConsistent with these business drivers, the company initiated 2022 earnings guidance today for net income in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 per share.\nGuidance assumes continued customer growth, average weather conditions and no significant changes in prevailing regulatory policies, mechanisms or outcomes or significant changes in loss legislation or regulations.\nWe continue to see solid long-term growth in our natural gas and water utilities.\nAnd as discussed last quarter, we've launched our competitive renewable natural gas business.\nAs a result, we are now targeting a long-term earnings-per-share growth rate of 4% to 6% from 2022 to 2027.\nThis past year, we made significant progress on our business strategy.\nOur focus moving forward is clear: maximizing returns from our strong and growing regulated gas utility and positioning our business for incremental long-term growth by investing in water utilities and the competitive renewable natural gas business.\nWe'll keep our focus on the future, making sound investments today to ensure sustainable growth for tomorrow.\nAnd to that end, we released our Destination Zero scenario report for the gas facility in November last year.\nThis report illustrates different possible scenarios to transform into a provider of carbon-neutral energy by 2050.\nKim Heiting, our senior vice president of operation, will touch on the details of this work in a minute.\nBut central to it is our belief that diversified energy system is more affordable, more reliable and importantly, more resilient.\nEvents in Texas and California are stark reminders of why two energy systems are better than one.\nThe electric and gas systems depend on each other to serve our communities, and each system provides different benefits.\nIn fact, by their nature, each system complements the other and hedges against certain risks, with wires above ground delivering renewable electrons and pipes below ground delivering renewable molecules.\nThis diversification helps us effectively meet different energy needs and will be even more important going forward as climate change and the potential for more severe weather post new risk.\nWith that, let me turn it to Kim to give a little bit more details on Destination Zero analysis.\nOur Destination Zero analysis is the next evolution for us and built off our 2016 carbon savings goal for our customers' use, and the 2019 study we commissioned with the Environmental Consultant E3, Paris Climate Accord reduction targets by 2050.\nSince then, we've continued to build on our internal carbon-modeling capabilities and evaluate new developments that allow us to evolve our thinking about the possibilities for our system.\nIn this new work, we evaluated multiple scenarios with technologies that exist today, some of which are further along the development path in Europe, but all of which are considered viable tools that we are either actively pursuing or evaluating now.\nThe three scenarios we modeled use both supply and demand side levers designed to achieve carbon neutrality for the emissions associated with our sales customers' energy use and future customer growth.\nAll of them use varying levels of renewable natural gas, clean hydrogen, synthetic gas and enhanced energy efficiency, including gas heat pumps and hybrid heating systems, as well as a conservative level of offsets and carbon capture.\nWe use different assumptions to tackle these components to stress test our ability to achieve carbon neutrality under different conditions and views of future technology adoption and availability of renewable supply.\nWe believe the most likely scenario will be a combination of activities that make usage more efficient and also reduce the carbon intensity of the energy we deliver.\nAnd of course, all scenarios rely on the adoption of supportive policies over time to lower costs for technology innovations like renewable or clean hydrogen.\nDriving that policy support is a focus of Northwest Natural and our industry going forward.\nWhile our analysis and modeling continues to evolve as we progress through this transition, our view of the future remains consistent, which is a transformed gas system distributing renewable molecules, enabling our region's ability to achieve its ambitious climate goal in a reliable, resilient and more affordable way.\nI'm very proud of our team and their efforts.\nAnd under Kim's leadership, we're in a great place there.\nI believe this is one of the first in-depth decarbonization scenario reports by gas utility, and it's a critical planning tool that helps us continue to make progress.\nIn addition to moving our gas utility toward a renewable future, last year, we also launched a competitive renewable natural gas strategy and formed a new non-regulated subsidiary, Northwest Natural Renewables.\nBy forming this new organization, we are committed to leading the energy transition and providing renewable natural gas to the utility, commercial, industrial and transportation sectors.\nWe're focused on providing cost-effective solutions to help these sectors decarbonize using existing waste streams and renewable energy resources.\nAs you know, we're in the beginning of a historic energy system transformation, and we're confident the demand for renewable fuels is going to continue to grow.\nWe project the substantial increase in renewable natural gas demand to meet voluntary and compliance-driven targets instituted by states and utilities.\nWe see promising investment potential in RNG and believe we're well-positioned to help fulfill this need as it aligns with our core competencies and is a natural extension of our sustainability efforts.\nWe're also an attractive counterparty for developers and feedstock owners seeking a reliable, long-term strategic partner.\nMost RNG projects are sized right for us to effectively transact and to provide meaningful growth and cash flow.\nAnd as you know, we've already taken our first steps with a 20-year RNG supply agreement and a total of $50 million investment.\nI'm excited to announce that as of the end of January, Mike Kotyk joined our team to lead our competitive RNG efforts.\nMike brings more than 25 years of experience in this sector, and I know we're ready and resourced to pursue these opportunities.\nIn conclusion, we intend to remain disciplined and focused as we assess other RNG investments to support the energy transition and provide additional earnings and cash flow growth for the company.\nTurning to our water utility business.\nSince announcing our initial transaction four years ago, we solidified our water strategy and increased the number of customers we serve fivefold through nearly 20 acquisitions across four states.\nAnd we're not stopping there.\nLast year, we signed purchase agreements that will more than double our total number of connections.\nAnd most notably, we signed our largest acquisition today to acquire Far West Water and wastewater utilities in Yuma, Arizona, which serves approximately 25,000 customers.\nI'm pleased to expand into our fifth state and in a region that is fast growing.\nThe acquisition, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year and be accretive to earnings per share after its full -- first full year of operations.\nJust this month, we also announced additional agreements to acquire two water utilities near our existing systems in Texas.\nAnd central to the water utility business is strong and collaborative relationship with regulators, and we've been pleased with their support to consolidate this fragmented industry with final approval of acquisitions and recovery for prudent investments for safety and reliability.\nWe remain excited about the investment potential for this business, and we look forward to more announcements soon.\nSo in conclusion, your company is financially strong, and I'm pleased the opportunities in the renewables and water sectors have allowed us to increase our long-term earnings-per-share growth rate of 4% to 6%.\nWe intend to continue working on your behalf to pursue sustainable growth.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Please turn to Page 3.\nLike other banks, we faced a number of COVID-19 related challenges during the second quarter.\nBut for us at OFG, the pandemic also followed the earthquakes we experienced in January and occurred while we were in the process of integrating the Scotiabank acquisition.\nCertainly, no small challenge.\nBut by acting quickly and with foresight, we produced excellent results for our customers, communities and people, and continue to help them build better financial futures.\nIn March, governments in Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands shut down businesses and personal activities.\nRestrictions were eased in late May.\nBut recent spikes in new cases have forced Puerto Rico to reduce some of the flexibility.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank cut rates 150 basis points in March, following the 75 basis points reduction in the second half of 2019.\nOur commitment and preparation enabled us to successfully manage these challenges facil, rapido, hecho; easy, fast, done, as we say at OFG.\nAll our branches operated safely throughout the quarter, enhanced by our technology platform.\nOur full-service ATMs and ITMs, mobile app, and online bill paying tools facilitated routine transactions in a contactless manner.\nOnline and mobile appointment scheduling helped make COVID safe customer meetings possible at branches.\nWe deployed a 100% digital client-friendly application and funds disbursement process for PPP loans.\nAbout half of our team members are still working remote.\nWe also implemented extensive new safety protocols for our customers and people on site.\nAnd we continued to offer new benefits for our people such as free COVID on-site testing and daily online health check-ins, as well as incentives.\nThe results speak for themselves.\nWe provided high levels of customer service, safety and knowledge throughout all channels.\nLoan production in the second quarter totaled more than $500 million.\nCustomer deposits increased $760 million.\nOur online loan deferral tool and call centers processed relief for more than 44,000 retail customers.\nWe reduced higher-cost wholesale funding, maintained a strong level of net interest margin and continued to build liquidity and capital.\nAnd we secured $100,000 in Federal Home Loan Bank of New York grants to support local non-profit and small businesses in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.\nPlease turn to Page 4.\nWe have continued to see strong technology utilization trends among both our retail and business customers since the beginning of the year and, in particular, since March.\nOnline bill enrollment -- bill pay enrollments were up 12% as of March and 24% as of June.\nMobile banking users jumped 17% by the end of the second quarter from the beginning of the first.\nThe number of remote deposit capture users are up 68% from the end of March.\nIn another area of success for us, during the second quarter, we scheduled more than 18,000 COVID safe appointments with our customers through our online and mobile tool.\nWe are very pleased with this -- to see these trends.\nTechnology is a core part of our overall corporate strategy.\nWe continue to look into new ways and innovative ways to use it to help our customers.\nPlease turn to Page 5.\nLooking at our SBA PPP program, we continue to exceed our market share in Puerto Rico.\nWe generated a total of $286 million in new loans.\nThis enabled us to help more than 4,000 small businesses save more than 50,000 jobs.\nIt also enabled us to attract new accounts in this strategically important customer base.\nAnd we were able to distribute these funds electronically within five days of application approval.\nThis is a great example of our ability to act quickly in response to changing conditions to the benefit of both existing and new customers and the communities we serve.\nLet's talk about our results on Page 6.\nWe reported earnings per share of $0.39, and $0.37 on a non-GAAP basis.\nTotal core revenues were $128 million.\nMost of that was due to a large increase in interest earning assets, chiefly loans and cash.\nThis was partially offset by a decline in yield due to significantly lower rates on cash and lower yields on variable rate commercial loans.\nIn addition, we have lower investment security balances.\nAs a result, we generated net interest income of $105 million with a net interest margin of 4.78%.\nBanking and wealth management revenues totaled $23 million.\nNon-interest expenses were $86 million, primarily due to the addition of the Scotiabank acquisition.\nSecond quarter results included several items.\n$9.5 million in revenues from Scotia Bank interest recoveries and bargain purchase gain.\nWe added $5 million in provision for the pandemic.\nAnd within non-interest expenses, we had a $5 million in merger and restructuring charges and COVID-related operating costs.\nPlease turn to Page 7.\nThe effects of these results is that we're building tangible book value, and our return on asset and return on equity continued to improve sequentially from the fourth quarter.\nPlease turn to Page 8 for operational highlights.\nAverage loan balances increased 52% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter.\nAverage core deposits, excluding brokered, increased 76% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter.\nLoan generation was strong.\nIncreased production from PPP and other commercial loans was partially offset by reduced production in our retail categories, primarily due to the economic shutdown.\nWe ended the quarter with good momentum and good pipelines in the mortgages and auto businesses.\nLoan yield at 6.97% continued to hold up well despite the recent Federal Reserve cuts.\nThe cost of core deposits declined 4% -- 4 basis points year-over-year.\nNet interest margin declined to 4.78%.\nPlease turn to Page 9 to review credit quality.\nThe net charge-off and non-performing loan rate declined year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, reflecting loan paydowns and the effects of deferrals.\nProvision for credit losses of $18 million was level with last year.\nI'd like to note the year-ago provision included an extra $9 million related to loans transferred to held for sale.\nPlease turn to Page 10 to review our loan deferrals.\nAfter disruptions in economic condition caused by COVID-19, we offered several loan payment deferral programs ranging from one to four months.\nAs I've mentioned, we've enhanced this effort by quickly developing unique and first-to-market digital tools to help consumers apply for forbearance on an individual basis.\nOur online loan deferral tool and call centers processed relief for more than 44,000 retail customers.\nIn total, we have about $1.4 billion or 32% of our retail loans on deferral.\nThe pace of retail requests is significantly slow.\nIn addition, we have about $685 million or 26% of our commercial loans on deferral.\nPlease turn to Page 11.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses of $233 million increased $70 million year-over-year.\nAnd we have almost doubled the level of reserves from December 31, 2019.\nCompared to March 31, 2020, the allowance increased $2 million.\nExcluding SBA guaranteed PPP loans, second quarter 2020 allowance was 3.49% of loans, 8 basis points higher than the first quarter.\nPlease turn to Page 12.\nWe are in a strong capital position.\nOur CET capital ratio, as you see on that slide, of 12.03% is up 112 basis points since last year.\nPlease turn to Page 13.\nWhile we still face much uncertainty regarding COVID and the economy, we are in a strong financial position, ready to help our customers during these trying times.\nOnce we get through this, Puerto Rico stands to benefit significantly from COVID stimulus and still unspent and undistributed Maria and earthquake-related stimulus programs.\nAt OFG, we believe our results and our history demonstrate our ability to quickly respond and adapt to changing economic environments.\nDuring the second quarter, we continued to build momentum in our core businesses and developed a good pipeline of new loans.\nFrom a liquidity, capital and balance sheet point of view, we are well positioned both financially and strategically.\nOur agenda going forward is clear.\nWe plan to continue integrating the former Scotiabank operations and finish by the end of this year.\nAt the same time, we must achieve the full benefits of the acquisition by the end of 2021.\nWe also plan to continue to invest in the future to further simplify our operations and enhance our ability to serve customers.\nAnd ultimately, we intend to continue to play a significant role in the recovery in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.\nCrises bring out the best in people to help others.\nOur people demonstrate that with purpose every single day.\nOperator, please open the call for the Q&A session.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Also during the course of today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom's performance.\nWe will begin the call with an overview of our business from John, then Phil will review our financial results for the quarter.\nWe're very pleased to report that in the third quarter, we continued our year-over-year double-digit growth in our key financial performance metrics, led by a very robust top line.\nThe top line results were broad-based across our agencies, geographies and disciplines.\nOur growth was especially strong in CRM Precision at 24%.\nOur CRM Precision Group is helping clients on their MarTech transformation, digital and e-commerce communications and direct-to-consumer marketing.\nThe group has played a key role in many of our recent new business wins where, overall, we continued our very strong momentum in Q3.\nBroadly, across our group, growth was driven by improved economic conditions.\nOmnicom's suite of services and capabilities are positioning us to be extremely competitive in the marketplace to: reimagine and strengthen our clients' brands, seamlessly connect them with their customers across their marketing journey, transform their marketing technology platforms and innovate in e-commerce and new media channels.\nOur revenue performance flowed through to our operating profit in bottom line.\nOur EBIT margins for the third quarter were 15.8%, which exceeded our 2020 margins and significantly outpaced the comparable period in 2019.\nNet income and earnings per share for the quarter grew by more than 13% versus 2020 and were also significantly above our 2019 results.\nAs we head into the fourth quarter, we are well positioned competitively and expect to benefit as economic growth continues to improve globally and from ongoing cost management.\nWe currently expect our full year organic growth to be approximately 9% and our full year EBIT margin to exceed our year-to-date margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 of 15.1%.\nGoing forward, we remain focused on our key strategic initiatives, which is centered around our talent, dedication to creativity and building on our already strong capabilities in precision marketing and MarTech consulting, e-commerce, digital and performance media and predictive data-driven insights.\nIn the third quarter, we made progress across these strategic initiatives as we announced three acquisitions.\nOmnicom Media Group acquired Jump 450 Media, a performance marketing agency.\nThe company leverages algorithmic scaling strategies, rapid creative testing and data analytics to optimize digital media spend and drive customer acquisition.\nJump 450 will form the foundation for a dedicated performance media platform and business operation within OMG.\nIts focus on e-commerce and pure performance marketing will strengthen and add a distinct set of capabilities to OMG's existing performance media offerings.\nAlso in late September, we announced the acquisition of two German-based companies: antoni and OSK.\nantoni is one of the most innovative and creative agencies in Europe and was born with data and digital capabilities at its core.\nantoni's creative leadership and depth of talent will significantly strengthen our capabilities in Europe and around the globe.\nOSK has been in the top-10 of PR and comms agencies in Germany since 2008 and is the undisputed number-one for automotive.\nIt provides a broad portfolio of services at the intersection of PR and social media and excels in the convergence of technology, mobility and communications.\nOur ability to bring together the brightest talent and data-driven consumer insights from across our organization to deliver holistic and integrated brand experiences is proving to be highly successful in our new business opportunities as well as in servicing our existing clients.\nFollowing on the heels of Philips naming Omnicom their global integrated service partner for creative and media communications, in the third quarter, Mercedes-Benz appointed Omnicom its global marketing communications partner.\nOne of the world's most iconic brands, Mercedes-Benz is today the leading luxury automotive experience company.\nTMX, a dedicated team from across our groups, will bring together the best-in-class talent and capabilities across Mercedes-Benz' customer journey with expertise in media and CRM, brand and performance creator, web personalization and content automation, public relations and events as well as paid and organic social.\nAnd just last week, we won the Chanel media business globally, adding another iconic global brand.\nAs in all our significant wins as well as for our existing clients, our teams are able to showcase our creativity, better analysis and predictive insights and technology capabilities to deliver connected, personalized and seamless brand experiences for their respective customers at all touch points of the consumer journey.\nOne key differentiator for Omnicom in servicing our clients is our cohesive culture that binds us together.\nIt's a culture of creativity, flexibility and caring that are common values shared across our group.\nI often hear from clients that a deciding factor in their decision to hire Omnicom is that our people who bring distinct specialized skills to them, know and respect one another and genuinely collaborate.\nOur ability to integrate services from across our marketing disciplines is underpinned by Omni, our open operating system that orchestrates better outcomes.\nOmni is built for collaboration, acting as a conductor between different specialists using a single processing workflow from insights to execution.\nIt empowers our people and our clients to make better and faster decisions, maximizing efficiency and ROI.\nOmni also provides better intelligence by orchestrating first-, second- and third-party data sets to present a single comprehensive view of consumers.\nOur teams can then develop insights to create, plan and deliver the most impactful messages, content and communications to them at each stage of that consumer journey.\nOmni is a unique and powerful tool for us, and we now have over 40,000 Omnicom colleagues provisioned on the platform in over 60 countries.\nHundreds of our clients, including all of our top-20, utilized Omni.\nMoreover, the open-source system enables our practice areas like commerce, health and PR to customize Omni with different data sources for their clients.\nFor example, Omnicom Health Group created a custom offering called Omni Health.\nSince rolling it out in April of this year, OHG has leveraged the platform to play a key role in expanding the group's omnichannel offering with new and existing clients, including AstraZeneca and Janssen, XARELTO, to name a few.\nIn summary, even during the pandemic, we accelerated the strength of our services, capabilities and organization to deliver better outcomes for our clients and win new business.\nOur offering is powerful and differentiated.\nWe have best-in-class talent and creativity using best-in-class operating systems and technologies.\nIt's a formula that will continue to win for us.\nThroughout one of the most difficult times in recent history, our people have shown ingenuity, resilience and strength.\nWe continue to spend and invest in training and development programs for all of our people from basic skills training all the way through the advanced programs of Omnicom University.\nWe recently expanded the curriculum for our DE&I and OPEN2.0 strategies.\nAs the pandemic continues to present a substantial health risk, the well-being of our colleagues remains our top priority.\nWe are ensuring we have a safe work environment and are offering a variety of programs for managers and individuals to support their wellness, resilience and health at work.\nI recently traveled to several of our U.S. and European offices and have met with many colleagues and clients who are happy to be back in the office.\nWe are looking at many alternatives to provide our people a safe return back to the office.\nFor example, this week, we're testing a private transportation service for New York City-based colleagues.\nIn the months ahead, we look forward to welcoming more of our staff back with a continuing priority on their safety and flexibility.\nIt is truly our world-class talent and our dedication to creativity and innovative solutions that drive real business outcomes for our clients.\nA key recent proof point reflecting the quality of our talent is Omnicom being named the Most Effective Holding Company in the U.S. by the 2020 [Technical Issues] report.\nOverall, we're extremely pleased with the third quarter.\nI'm proud to see that our strategic focus and the decisions we made throughout the pandemic are now leading to positive results.\nOur results once again reflect Omnicom's ability to adapt and respond to the changes in the market and deliver through economic cycles.\nWhile the impact of the pandemic continues to be felt across the globe, that impact has continued to moderate significantly as evidenced by our continued growth in the third quarter.\nSlide 3 shows our third quarter improvement across our income statement, where our revenue growth and expense control drove an 8% increase in operating profit.\nOur effective tax rate for the third quarter was 24.1%, down from our estimated effective rate for 2021 of between 26.5% and 27%.\nThis was primarily due to the favorable settlement of uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions, the impact of which was approximately $10 million.\nThese items positively impacted net income and diluted earnings per share, which was $1.65, up $0.20 or 13.8% versus Q3 of last year and up $0.33 versus the third quarter of 2019.\nSo our growth continues on this important metric as well.\nAnd finally, our $0.70 quarterly dividend, which was raised back in February, is 7.7% higher than last year.\nLet's now flip to Slide 4 and look at the quarter in more detail, beginning with revenues.\nOur total revenue growth was 7.1%.\nOrganic growth for the quarter was 11.5% or $367 million, which represents a significant improvement compared to Q3 of 2020 when the pandemic drove an organic revenue decline of 11.7%.\nThe impact of foreign exchange rates increased our revenue by 1.6% in the quarter as the dollar continued to weaken against most of our larger currencies compared to the prior year.\nIf FX rates stay where they were on October 15, we expect foreign exchange to decrease our reported revenue by approximately 1% for the fourth quarter and increase our reported revenue by 2% for the full year.\nThe impact on revenue from net acquisitions and dispositions decreased revenue by 5.9%.\nBased on transactions that have been completed through September 30, 2021, our estimate is the net impact of our acquisition and disposition activity for the balance of the year will decrease reported revenue by approximately 7% in the fourth quarter and by approximately 4% for the full year.\nWhile we will continue our process of evaluating our portfolio of businesses as part of our strategic planning, as John has said regarding dispositions, we are substantially complete.\nAdvertising, our largest discipline at 53% of our total revenues, posted 8.6% organic growth with very strong performance from both our creative agencies and our media agencies.\nPlease note that reported Advertising growth is down 0.4%, due primarily to the disposition of ICON in Q2 of 2021.\nOur agencies focused on direct, digital and marketing transformation consulting services in our precision marketing discipline also posted strong organic growth at 24.3%.\nWith the exception of the second quarter of 2020, this discipline has been a consistent grower for some time and has become a larger portion of our business each quarter.\nCRM Commerce and Brand Consulting was up 18%, with our branding agencies leading the discipline's performance.\nCRM Experiential was up 50%.\nThis business declined far more than our other disciplines in the third quarter of last year during the pandemic and has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels due to various global restrictions.\nHowever, this remains an important area for our clients, and we look forward to further growth as global economies continue lifting social distancing restrictions.\nCRM Execution & Support was up 8.3%, reflecting a recovery in client spend compared to the prior year in our field marketing businesses, while our research businesses continued to lag.\nPR was up 10.5%.\nWe have a positive outlook for the discipline, especially within our global agencies, as clients adjust to the new post pandemic realities.\nAnd finally, our Healthcare discipline was up 6.6% organically.\nHealthcare was the only one of our service disciplines that had positive organic growth during the depths of the pandemic and continue to perform well.\nFlipping to Slide 6, our revenue by region.\nThe key takeaway is that all of our geographies again posted solid organic growth.\nThis growth was driven by virtually every discipline within each region.\nOutside the U.S., where total organic growth was 16%.\nDouble-digit growth in each region was led by Germany, the U.K., Canada and Australia.\nOur advertising, media and PR agencies performed well with double-digit growth, and our precision marketing agencies were sizable contributors and also posted strong double-digit growth.\nIn addition, experiential growth outside the U.S. was over 100% in total.\nIn the U.S., we generated 7.7% organic growth, which was boosted by strong double-digit growth in our precision marketing and PR disciplines as well as solid growth at our healthcare agencies.\nThe last revenue view I'd like to share with you is by industry sector on Slide 7.\nThe change in mix by sector in the portfolio was small on a year-to-date basis when compared to last year.\nIn summary, our revenue performance was very strong across the board on both a reported and organic basis and when analyzed by discipline, geography or industry sector.\nTo make the analysis more relevant, we have also included a supplemental slide in the appendix that shows the 2021 amounts presented in constant dollars.\nBeginning with our largest category, salary and service costs.\nThese costs increased by 7.6% in total, and they tend to fluctuate with the change in revenue.\nWe would also note that Q3 2020 salary and service cost amounts were reduced by reimbursements received from government programs of $68.7 million.\nAs we continue to look forward, we expect a healthy advertising and marketing spending outlook, and strong demand from our clients will necessitate an increase in staffing.\nThe tight labor market will create challenges in the near term that we are confident our management teams will overcome.\nMoving down the P&L.\nThird-party service costs, which fluctuate with changes in revenue, decreased 6.9% during the quarter due to our net disposition activity, primarily related to the disposition of ICON and partially offset by the organic growth in revenue as well as the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes.\nOccupancy and other costs, which are not directly linked to changes in revenue, were up 4.5% year-on-year or 2.9% when excluding foreign exchange rate translation impacts.\nAs expected, these good results continue to reflect our efforts to reduce infrastructure costs and also benefited from a decrease in general office expenses as the majority of our staff continue to work remotely in Q3.\nSG&A expense levels were up 5.3% on a year-over-year basis or 4.2% when excluding foreign exchange rate translation impacts.\nWe are beginning to see a return of travel and certain other addressable spend costs as pandemic-related government restrictions ease.\nHowever, based on our use of technology during the pandemic, we're developing practices, particularly with respect to travel, that we expect will allow us to continue to retain some of the benefits we achieved in reducing addressable spend during the pandemic.\nOverall, we expect that the increase in addressable spend for the balance of the year will be mitigated in part by the benefits we will continue to achieve from a hybrid and agile workforce.\nAs we think about our future expense levels, we certainly expect that some areas will increase in line with our business as activity picks up and life returns to normal.\nBut at the same time, we will also continue to evaluate ways to improve efficiently throughout the organization by continuing to focus on real estate portfolio management, back-office services, procurement and IT services.\nWith the strong revenue growth we discussed earlier, coupled with good expense control, you can see a notable improvement in our operating profit on a year-over-year basis at the bottom of the slide, up 8% for the quarter and 60.1% year-to-date.\nGrowing our operating profit dollars remains one of our most important areas of focus.\nThis strong growth in operating profit was also accompanied by improved margins, which you can see on Slide 9.\nFor the third quarter, our operating profit margin was 15.8% as expressed in terms of our reported total revenues.\nWe continue to see operating margin improvement year-over-year, resulting from the proactive management of our discretionary addressable spend cost categories, including a reduction in travel and related costs, reductions in certain costs of operating our offices given the continued remote work environment, as well as benefits from some of the repositioning actions taken back in the second quarter of 2020.\nLastly, on this slide, our reported EBITDA for the quarter was $560.3 million, up 7.4% for the quarter and 56.3% year-to-date.\nEBITDA margins also remained strong for the quarter and have expanded nicely year-to-date compared to last year, and we expect this strong performance to continue through the rest of this year.\nLet's now turn to our cash flow performance on Slide 10, where you can see that in the first nine months of 2021, we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow excluding changes in working capital, a $114 million or 10% increase versus the same period last year.\nThere were no material year-over-year changes for capex or acquisitions as we continue to conservatively manage our cash.\nWhile stock repurchases are down relative to pre-pandemic periods due to curtailment during the pandemic, we resumed our activity during the second and third quarters of this year, and we expect to continue in Q4 and beyond.\nYou should not expect a change in our historical approach to capital allocation and the use of our free cash flow in the future.\nWe will continue to pay an attractive dividend.\nWe have indicated that we increased our focus on acquisition opportunities and are in the process of closing on several acquisitions.\nImportantly, our acquisition strategy is focusing on the faster-growing disciplines in our portfolio and driving future organic growth for the company.\nAnd we will use the balance of our free cash flow to repurchase our stock.\nOur strong cash generation again enhanced our credit and liquidity, which you can see summarized on Slide 11.\nOur total debt was down about $500 million since this time last year as we eliminated the extra liquidity we added early on in the pandemic.\nWe did this through the early retirement in Q2 of $1.25 billion of our 3.65% senior notes, which were due next year, partially replaced with the issuance of $800 million of 2.6% 10-year notes due in 2031.\nAs you can see in the slide, our maturities are well laddered with nothing due until late 2024 as we delevered to pre-pandemic levels.\nAs for our debt ratios, due to our overall operating improvement versus Q3 of 2020 and our recent refinancing activity, we've reduced our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.2 times and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 0.4 times.\nBoth metrics increased substantially over the 2020

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Due to the material impact of COVID-19 on our business in fiscal 2020, we will also include comparisons to our fiscal 2019 results.\nBefore I begin reviewing third quarter results, I want to remind everyone of Oxford's core operating philosophies.\nOur objective is always to deliver long-term shareholder value.\nOur strategy for delivering this value is to own a portfolio of powerful lifestyle brands that can drive sustained profitable growth.\nAnd our purpose as a company and in each of our brands is to make people happy.\nWith that, we're delighted to be reporting record sales and earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2021.\nThese outstanding results are directly attributable to the power of our brand portfolio, the strength of our product offerings and our ability to connect with and serve customers across channels, combined with the great work our teams have done to fortify these foundational cornerstones during the pandemic.\nAs compared to the same quarter last year, our sales increased 41%.\nAnd even more importantly, our sales also increased as compared to pre-COVID fiscal 2019 levels.\nExcluding Lanier Apparel, where operations were effectively exited during the third quarter of fiscal 2021, net sales increased 15% over the same period of fiscal 2019.\nThe robust sales growth that we experienced during the third quarter was driven by 40% growth in our full price direct-to-consumer business, with growth in each of our brands compared to fiscal 2019, including a 13% increase in full-price retail and a 100% gain in full-price e-commerce.\nRestaurant sales also contributed to our top-line improvement, growing 14% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019 fueled by strong increases at existing locations, as well as the addition of five new Marlin Bar locations.\nAt the same time, adjusted gross margin increased an impressive 710 basis points to 62% during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2019.\nScott will elaborate on all these excellent metrics in more detail momentarily.\nBut I will mention that they drove record third quarter earnings of $1.19 per share on an adjusted basis compared to an adjusted loss of $0.44 per share last year and adjusted earnings per share, up $0.10 during the third quarter of fiscal 2019.\nWhile our third quarter results no doubt benefited from a very strong consumer market, we believe the primary driver of our outperformance was the excellent execution of our strategy and purpose.\nThe exit of Lanier Apparel during the third quarter mark an important milestone in our long-term strategy as Lanier was the last of our legacy private label businesses.\nOur current portfolio consists of five excellent lifestyle brands: Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, Southern Tide, The Beaufort Bonnet Company and Duck Head.\nThese brands are 100% focused on the consumer and making that consumer happy with powerful clear brand messages, exceptional differentiated product, superior customer experiences, including our e-commerce websites, our stores and restaurants and strategic wholesale accounts.\nOver the last two years, across our brands, we have redoubled our commitment to delivering our positive upbeat brand messages through beautiful creative content in imagery.\nThose brand messages are resonating with our consumers and are a big part of the excellent results that we are delivering.\nThe predominant mix of direct-to-consumer, which is expected to be over 80% of our business enhances our ability to deliver happiness to our customers.\nThe direct model gives us significant agility and flexibility in managing the flow of product to our customers.\nThis flexibility has proven especially useful this year, as industrywide supply chain challenges had required our merchants to be highly adaptable as to what product we are featuring on the floor and on our websites at any particular point in time.\nThe direct business also provides us with significant margin power and is responsible for a large portion of the gain in gross margin that we achieved during the quarter.\nFinally, the direct-to-consumer model gives us the opportunity to deliver an unparalleled customer experience that is consistent with the aspirational positioning of our brands.\nAnd our incredible people have continued to provide that elevated experience through all the challenges of the last two years.\nOne of our strategic priorities over the last couple of years has been to enhance our digital marketing capabilities by improving our ability to assimilate and analyze data, use that data to develop insights about existing in potential customers, create campaigns designed to reach those consumers and measure the effectiveness of those campaigns with the goals of increasing our customer account, retaining existing customers and driving higher spend across all customers.\nI'm pleased to report that on a trailing 12-month basis, customer metrics at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2021, including customer accounts, rate of new customer additions, retention rates and customer lifetime value were all strong relative to pre-pandemic numbers.\nFrom a product perspective, we continued to see strength in the casual, easy and cozy styles, that are a hallmark of all our brands.\nGreat examples of this are continued strength in Tommy Bahama knits and shorts, women's lounge and sleepwear, and Lilly Pulitzer's Luxletic athleisure collection.\nAt the same time, we saw a nice rebound in some of the occasion-driven categories that were most challenged last year including men's pants and woven shirts and women's dresses, as people reengaged in more social events.\nAs we head into the final stretch of the year, I'm pleased to report that the holiday selling to-date has been robust and I firmly believe that we will deliver a strong finish to a fantastic year.\nI'm incredibly grateful to our team, and share their pride in what we have delivered for our customers and our shareholders.\nAs Tom just mentioned, we had outstanding performances in each of our brands during the third quarter, which resulted in significant sales, gross margin, operating margin and earnings growth to levels exceeding pre-pandemic results.\nOn the top line, demand for our products remained high and revenue exceeded 2019 at our direct-to-consumer channels and in each of our brands.\nExcluding Lanier Apparel where operations were effectively exited during the third quarter of fiscal 2021, consolidated sales increased 15% to $243 million.\nWe had improvements in all regions, with particular strength in Florida, the Southeast and Texas.\nHawaii has been positive overall with strength, except on the island of Oahu, which is more dependent on foreign tourists, than the other islands.\nOur gross margin continued to track significantly higher than 2019.\nOn an adjusted basis, gross margin expanded 710 basis points over 2019 to 62% in the third quarter.\nDriving this improvement was the higher proportion of full price sales, our overall shift in our sales mix to higher margin direct-to-consumer channels of distribution and improved IMUs.\nApproximately 270 basis points of higher freight cost, including the use of air freight partially offset some of the margin improvement.\nOn an adjusted basis, we gained 260 basis points of SG&A leverage in the third quarter, improving from 56% of sales in 2019 to 53% of sales in 2021.\nAdjusted SG&A dollars decreased modestly from 2019 levels but decreases in employment costs due to headcount reductions and lower occupancy cost, partially offset by increases in marketing expense.\nAs a result, our consolidated operating margin expanded 970 basis points from 1% in 2019, to 11%.\nTommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide all experienced operating margin expansion.\nMoving to the balance sheet, our liquidity position is strong.\nWe ended the third quarter with $188 million of cash and short-term investments and no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility.\nFIFO inventory decreased 17% compared to fiscal 2020 excluding Lanier Apparel due to higher-than-expected sales during the first nine months of 2021, ongoing enhancements to enterprise order management systems and prudent seasonal purchases.\nWe believe our inventory is well positioned to meet forecasted demand throughout the remainder of the holiday selling season.\nLooking ahead, we are pleased with our holiday season results to-date and are confident we can deliver a solid fourth quarter.\nOur outlook reflects our expectation of continued strength in full price direct-to-consumer business.\nWe expect full price direct-to-consumer sales growth and consolidated gross margin expansion over 2019.\nWhile we raised our outlook for the year, year-over-year improvement in our full price direct business is expected to be partially offset by a handful of specific items in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.\nWe expect sales from Lanier Apparel to be approximately $20 million lower than 2019's fourth quarter as we exited the business in Q3 of this year.\nIn addition, we expect our branded wholesale business to be approximately $15 million lower than 2019.\nThis is impacted by the shift to certain initial spring wholesale shipments.\nThese have historically shipped in the fourth quarter, but are expected to ship in the first quarter of 2022, as we reduced our reliance on air freight for warmer weather product.\nWe also expect the Lilly Pulitzer fourth quarter flash clearance sale, to be lower compared to 2019, due to strong year-to-date full price sales resulting in less available inventory for the flash sale.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be between $285 million and $295 million compared to sales of $298 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.\nAgain Lanier Apparel generated $20 million in net sales in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect earnings of $1.20 to $1.35 per share on an adjusted basis, compared to earnings of $1.09 per share on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nOur outlook includes strong quarter-to-date results with a solid start to the holiday selling season.\nFor the full year, we now expect sales in a range of $1.127 billion to $1.137 billion as compared to sales of $1.123 billion in 2019.\nFor the full year, sales from Lanier Apparel are expected to be $25 million in 2021, compared to $95 million in 2019.\nAdjusted earnings per share is expected to be between $7.52 and $7.67.\nThis compared to earnings of $4.32 per share on an adjusted basis in 2019.\nOur effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2021 is expected to be approximately 22%.\nWe continue to support our business with investments for future growth.\nCapital expenditures are expected to be between $35 million and $40 million in fiscal 2021, primarily reflecting investments in information technology initiatives, new Marlin Bars and retail stores.\nWe're excited to open our first company-owned Beaufort Bonnet Company store in Grand Boulevard at Sandestin later this quarter.\nWe continue to generate strong cash flow from operations, including a $157 million year-to-date.\nOur capital allocation priorities include investing in our businesses, acquisitions and the return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nWe remain in a strong position to return cash to shareholders and are proud of our long history of returning value through dividends, which we have paid every quarter since going public in 1960.\nThis quarter, our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $0.42 per share.\nAdditionally, in assessing our capital allocation plan, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of $150 million.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Again, I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA.\nAnd with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.\nWithout a doubt, these may be the most unpredictable and unprecedented times that hopefully we will ever encounter.\nThere is no reference manual for managing through a public health crisis with severe economic ramifications, such as what has occurred with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur routines, habits, personal preferences, work and social activity and many other aspects of our lives are sure to change forever as a result of this.\nPCA's operations qualify as an essential or critical element under the various state and local shelter-in-place orders.\nOur leadership team is in constant communication discussing safety, the state of our operations, business continuity and other critical management topics.\nIt is our responsibility at PCA to ensure that, first and foremost, we help provide for the well-being of our more than 15,000 employees and their families.\nWe must do everything in our power to assist our customers and suppliers as well.\nWe have implemented various procedures and safeguards at all our manufacturing, converting and office locations across the country to help keep our employees safe and healthy as we provide the goods and services considered essential for assisting with our country's response to the pandemic.\nWe have also put measures in place to assist them with the economic ramifications that have resulted from these response measures.\nTo date, we have not experienced any significant interruptions at our operations or in our supply chain due to the virus.\nOur network of mills, converting facilities and distribution operations strategically located throughout the United States gives PCA asset flexibility to manufacture and ship products to multiple locations.\nWe will continue to closely monitor developments, take proactive measures to protect our employees, and provide our customers with the products and services they require.\nI could not be more proud of the effort, responsiveness and sacrifices displayed by all PCA employees as well as our customers and suppliers.\nIt has truly been an inspiring observation.\nI'll then wrap things up, and we'll be glad to take some questions.\nYesterday, we reported first quarter net income of $142 million or $1.49 per share.\nFirst quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.01 per share, related primarily to costs and expenses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nExcluding special items, first quarter 2020 net income was $143 million or $1.50 per share compared to the first quarter of 2019 net income of $187 million or $1.98 per share.\nFirst quarter net sales were $1.7 billion in both 2020 and 2019.\nTotal company EBITDA for the first quarter, excluding special items, was $311 million in 2020 and $371 million in 2019.\nExcluding special items, the $0.48 per share decrease in first quarter 2020 earnings compared to the first quarter of 2019 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our Packaging segment of $0.64 and Paper segment of $0.05; lower volumes in our Paper segment of $0.03; higher annual outage expenses, $0.04; higher depreciation expense, $0.04; other expenses, $0.01; and higher tax rate, $0.01.\nThe items were partially offset by higher volumes in our Packaging segment of $0.14; lower operating costs of $0.09; lower converting costs, $0.04; lower freight and logistics costs, $0.01; and lower interest expense, $0.04; and nonoperating pension expense, $0.02.\nThe results were $0.30 above the first quarter guidance of $1.20 per share, primarily due to higher volumes in our Packaging segment of $0.03 and our Paper segment of $0.01, higher prices and mix in the Packaging segment of $0.02 and lower operating costs of $0.15, resulting from the excellent fiber and energy usage and lower input prices in our mills.\nFreight and logistics costs were lower than expected by $0.03, as were converting costs, annual outage costs and other expenses, each lower than expectations by $0.02 per share.\nLooking at our Packaging business.\nEBITDA, excluding special items in the first quarter of 2020 of $290 million with sales of $1.5 billion resulted in a margin of 20% versus last year's EBITDA of $334 million and sales of $1.5 billion or a 23% margin.\nOur containerboard mills established a new first quarter volume record, even while performing scheduled annual maintenance outage work at four of the mills.\nOur containerboard production allowed us to maintain our industry-leading integration rate of approximately 95% by supplying the necessary containerboard to our box plants, who achieved an all-time record for total box shipments as well as a new first quarter shipments per day record.\nWe were able to meet this greater-than-anticipated demand through proactive management, changing the sequencing of our scheduled maintenance outages as well as outstanding execution of the work performed during these outages.\nOur enhanced capabilities to optimize the mix, freight and logistics costs, inventory levels and internal and external customer needs of the customer of the containerboard system provided to us by our machine conversion at Wallula Mill were a key component as well.\nWe ended the quarter with containerboard inventories at their lowest levels since the acquisition of Boise's packaging business in 2013.\nCorrugated products and containerboard demand were very strong during the quarter.\nAs Mark indicated, our corrugated products plants achieved a new all-time record for total box shipments, which were up 5.6% over last year as well as a new first quarter record in shipments per day, which were up 3.9% compared to last year's first quarter.\nOutside sales volume of containerboard was 13% above last year's first quarter, primarily attributable to increased domestic demand with export demand slightly higher as well.\nDomestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.54 per share below the first quarter of 2019 and down $0.06 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.\nExport containerboard prices were down about $0.10 per share versus last year's first quarter and flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.\nLooking at our Paper segment.\nEBITDA, excluding special items in the first quarter of $42 million with sales of $217 million or 19% margin compared to the first quarter of 2019 EBITDA of $55 million and sales of $240 million or 23% margin.\nFirst quarter paper prices and mix were below last year as expected, however, they were flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.\nOur Paper volume was also lower as expected, primarily due to the scheduled maintenance outage at our Jackson, Alabama mill; however, it was about 3% higher than we had assumed.\nAlthough we ended the quarter with our inventory slightly lower than planned, on April 1, we announced downtime at our Jackson, Alabama mill for the months of May and June to ensure we manage the supply according to our demand outlook for the second quarter.\nThroughout the quarter, the mills did an outstanding job, managing fiber and chemical usage and maintained tight control over indirect and fixed expenses.\nWe had record first quarter cash generation with cash provided by operations of $237 million and record first quarter free cash flow of $166 million.\nThe primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $71 million and common stock dividends of $75 million.\nWe ended the quarter with $764 million of cash on hand or $913 million, including the cash we recently moved to marketable securities.\nOur liquidity at March 31 of over $1.2 billion is the highest ever for our company.\nAnd with the refinancing we completed in the fourth quarter of 2019, we have no debt maturities for the next 3.5 years.\nRegarding our announcement of taking our paper mill in Jackson, Alabama down for the months of May and June, our estimated second quarter financial impact of this decision is approximately $30 million or $0.24 per share.\nI want to update you on our full year guidance for certain items that we provided on last quarter's call.\nAs Mark alluded to earlier, we managed through a very strong first quarter demand in our Packaging business, partly by altering the sequencing of the scheduled maintenance outages at our containerboard mills as well as the containerboard machines impacted versus what we discussed during last quarter's call.\nThere are no changes to the scheduled outages at our white paper mills.\nThe actual impact in the first quarter was $0.22 per share, and the estimated impact by quarter for the remainder of the year is now $0.09 per share in the second quarter, $0.16 in the third and $0.34 per share in the fourth quarter.\nThe full year estimate remains at $0.81 per share, as we mentioned previously.\nAlso, our full year interest expense is now expected to be $88 million versus $81 million.\nAnd our net cash interest is now estimated to be $92 million versus $84 million, primarily due to lower expected interest income.\nOur cash tax rate estimate is now slightly lower than our earlier estimate of 19%, partially due to the downtime we announced at our Jackson mill, and our effective tax rate remains at approximately 25%.\nAfter a thorough review of our capital spending plans, we are not changing the range of spending we provided previously, which was between $400 million to $425 million, nor are we changing our full year outlook for pension contributions or depreciation.\nAs I mentioned earlier, these may be the most unpredictable and unprecedented times that hopefully we will ever encounter.\nNot a day passes that we realize something new being impacted in a way we had never thought of or imagined of before.\nOur consistent approach toward prudent capital allocation and sound financial governance has served us well for many, many years and is certainly helpful in times like this.\nPCA entered this uncertain period of time brought on by the COVID-19 crisis from a position of financial and balance sheet strength.\nOur focus has been and will remain on preserving that strength through the actions and decisions we make as a management team.\nAs Bob mentioned, our company's liquidity position has never been higher nor has our confidence in the future success of PCA.\nWe are well positioned to manage through whatever lies ahead, while ensuring we take care of the needs and expectations of our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders.\nHowever, the confidence does not translate to the same degree short-term predictability or guidance specifics that we normally provide at this time.\nHowever, due to the uncertain scope and duration of the pandemic and the timing of the global recovery and economic normalization, we're not able to properly quantify our guidance for the second quarter.\nWe've already announced the actions being taken in our Paper business, and we believe these actions will position us properly for what we anticipate right now for the second half of 2020.\nHowever, nothing is certain, especially now, and it may require further action to be taken.\nWe know that we experienced a demand surge in our Packaging business in the first quarter, and the second quarter has also begun quite strong as well.\nOur containerboard inventory is at the lowest levels, both in total and in weeks of supply since our acquisition of the Packaging business from Boise.\nAnd while recycled fiber prices began moving significantly higher during the first quarter, our position as a primarily virgin fiber producer minimizes its impact compared to other producers.\nHowever, it only makes logical sense that demand in certain end markets will return to more normal growth trends at some point, although we've been successful at securing new business in end markets with a stronger demand outlook versus markets whose demand may be impacted more negatively.\nAlso, it is impossible to predict what additional health-related measures will be or must be taken or dictated to us by the various state and local governments where we operate.\nSuch events and actions could adversely impact the operation of not only our facilities, but also the availability of services and products we rely upon from our suppliers.\nThat being said, it is also a fact that the products our company provides are essential to the response efforts, the recovery and the well-being of our country.\nThe needs for our cost-effective, sustainable and renewable products will continue.\nWhile no one knows the severity or longevity of the virus' impact on global economy, it is my belief that this need will be even more in demand as the world recovers from this crisis.\nThe statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company, and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Then Tom Dineen, our Chief Financial Officer, will give an overview of the third quarter 2021 financial results, and then I will discuss our operations and the state of the market.\nCopy of these documents may be obtained by contacting the company or the SEC or on the company website at ruger.com/corporate or, of course, the SEC website at sec.gov.\nWe do reference non-GAAP EBITDA.\nNow Tom will discuss the company's third quarter 2021 results.\nFor the third quarter of 2021, net sales were $178.2 million and diluted earnings were $1.98 per share.\nFor the comparable prior year period, net sales were $145.7 million and diluted earnings were $1.39 per share.\nFor the first nine months of 2021, net sales were $562.7 million and diluted earnings were $6.64 per share.\nFor the corresponding period in 2020, net sales were $399.6 million and diluted earnings were $3.31 per share.\nThe substantial increase in profitability for the third quarter compared to the third quarter of 2020 was primarily attributable to the increase in sales and production, resulting in favorable leveraging of fixed costs including depreciation, engineering and other indirect labor expenses.\nCompared to the second quarter of 2021, profitability declined principally due to three factors: First, all of our firearms facilities took a very well-deserved shutdown week in July, which reduced the number of workdays in the quarter to 59 compared to 64 workdays in Q2.\nThis decrease in production reduced sales and resulted in some unfavorable deleveraging of fixed costs.\nSecond, after a relatively quiet second quarter, COVID positive cases in our plants were then tripled in the third quarter.\nThis resulted in significant increases in lost production.\nAnd third, following six quarters of exceptional demand, excess resales decreased from the second quarter, adversely impacting our overall profitability.\nOur strong financial results yielded significant cash generation.\nDuring the first nine months of 2021, we generated $117 million of cash from operations.\nWe reinvested $15.6 million of that back into the company in the form of capital expenditures.\nWe estimate that 2021 capital expenditures will be approximately $20 million, predominantly related to new product development.\nOur ability to shift manufacturing equipment between cells and between facilities improves our overall utilization and allows for reduced capital investment.\nOur balance sheet at October 2, 2021, remain strong.\nOur cash and short-term investments, which are invested in U.S. T-bills totaled $192.7 million.\nOur current ratio was 3.8:1, and we had no debt.\nOur stockholders' equity was $338.1 million, which equates to a book value of $19.21 per share, of which $10.95 per share was cash and short-term investments.\nIn the first nine months of 2021, we returned $45.2 million to our shareholders through the payment of dividends.\nOur Board of Directors declared a $0.79 per share quarterly dividend for shareholders of record as of November 15, 2021, payable on November 30, 2021.\nUpon receiving this $0.79 quarterly dividend, shareholders will have received $3.36 of dividends per share in 2021.\nAs a reminder, our quarterly dividend is approximately 40% of net income, and therefore, it varies quarter-to-quarter.\nThat's the financial update for the quarter.\nDemand for our products has remained strong.\nDespite a moderation of overall industry demand, as reflected in the last two quarters of adjusted NICS, we shipped all of the firearms that we built this quarter without the need to aggressively promote or discount any of our products.\nWe've just begun to replenish the distributor and retail inventories that were largely depleted over the past 18 months, putting us in a great position as we head into the fourth quarter, which has traditionally been a period of strong demand.\nThe estimated unit sell-through of the company's products from the independent distributors to retailers increased 9% in the first nine months of 2021 compared to the prior-year period.\nFor the same period, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, background checks, as adjusted by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, commonly referred to as NICS checks, decreased 11%.\nThe increase in the sell-through of the company's products compared favorably to the decrease in adjusted NICS background checks, and may be attributable to strong consumer demand for Ruger products, increased production in 2021 and the introduction of new products that have been met with strong demand.\nNew product development continues to drive results.\nThe MAX-9 pistol and the Ruger LCP MAX pistol, which were both launched in 2021 remain in strong demand.\nIn the first nine months of 2021, new product sales represented $116 million or 22% of firearm sales compared to $88 million or 24% of firearm sales in the first nine months of 2020.\nAs a reminder, we include only major products introduced in the past eight quarters in our new product sales metric.\nDerivatives, product line extensions of mature product families and models introduced more than two years ago are not included.\nWe are hard at work on some exciting new product initiatives, including the return of Marlin lever action rifles, which we begin -- plan to begin shipping later in the fourth quarter.\nSince March of 2020, our workforce has been strengthened by 370 folks, an increase of just over 20%, and our quarterly unit production has increased by more than 160,000 units or 45% during that period.\nA 20% increase in personnel yielding a 45% increase in production.\nThat is a tremendous accomplishment by our operations teams at all of our manufacturing plants.\nDespite the growth in production at the end of third quarter 2021, our finished goods inventories remained near historic lows and distributor inventories of Ruger products were 150,000 units lower than they were at the end of 2019, the last time inventories were at what we would consider normal or expected pre-COVID-19 levels.\nAs Tom mentioned earlier, after an unprecedented 16-month run of seemingly insatiable product demand and continual monthly production increases, we took a one week shutdown during the first week of July.\nThis is our first shutdown in two years, which gave our workforce a very well-deserved break and allowed us to perform some routine maintenance and reconfigure some of our manufacturing operations.\nThe shutdown reduced our third quarter production sales and earnings, but that was a small price to pay.\nIt was the right thing to do, and I'm glad we did it.\nOur dedicated and hard-working folks deserved and needed a break.\nAnd after the shutdown, we are better prepared as we head into what we expect will be a busy fourth quarter and 2022.\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, we have remained proactive in maintaining the health and safety of our employees and mitigating its impact on our business.\nWe provide all hourly employees with additional paid time off and offer incentives to any employee who becomes vaccinated.\nIf practical, we allow employees to work remotely.\nAnd we continue to follow robust cleaning, sanitizing and social distancing protocols to maintain a cleaner and safer workplace.\nWith the United States once again seeing a rise in COVID-19 cases in positivity rates, we remain vigilant and are proactively adjusting our plan accordingly to keep our associates healthy and safe and to minimize any disruption to our business.\nOur financial strength, evidenced by our debt-free balance sheet provides financial security and flexibility as we manage through the challenges like COVID-19 and remain focused on our long-term goals and the creation of shareholder value.\nIn the third quarter, we added a 225,000 square foot facility in Mayodan, North Carolina, about 1.5 miles down the road from our original Mayodan building that we purchased in 2013.\nThis new facility doubles the size of our footprint in Mayodan and provide some room for expansion.\nWe moved our finished goods inventory, our ShopRuger operations and our customer service call center into the new facility.\nThis freed up some manufacturing space in our original building in addition to the overall -- excuse me, to the available space in the new facility.\nThose are the highlights of the third quarter of 2021.\nOperator, may we have the first question?\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We appreciate your time and interest in Raymond James Financial.\nWith us on the call today are Paul Reilly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Shoukry, Chief Financial Officer.\nCalling your attention to slide two.\nThese statements include, but are not limited to, information concerning future strategic objectives, business prospects, financial results, anticipated timing and benefits of our acquisitions, including our proposed acquisitions of Charles Stanley PLC and TriState Capital Holdings, and our level of success in integrating acquired businesses, anticipated results of litigation and regulatory developments, impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or general economic conditions.\nWe urge you to consider the risks described in our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and Forms 8-K, which are available on our Investor Relations website.\nDuring today's call, we will also use certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide information pertinent to our management's view of ongoing business performance.\nI want to first, by apologizing, I'll sound like a broken record, using the word record over and over again.\nIt really was an outstanding year and quarter.\nI wish management could take credit, but it is really the work of our advisors and associates that delivered these results.\nTheir dedication and perseverance during the fiscal year was amazing.\nWe've proven once again that focusing on our time-tested client-first strategy and providing outstanding service to our advisors and their clients will guide us through uncertain economic and global conditions, in this case, in record-setting fashion.\nThe record results we generated would not have been possible without everyone's contribution.\nStarting on slide four with our quarterly results.\nThe fiscal fourth quarter capped off what was a record fiscal year on a number of fronts.\nThe firm reported record quarterly net revenues of $2.7 billion and record quarterly net income of $429 million, or earnings per diluted share of $2.02, which reflects the impact of the three for two stock split in September.\nExcluding the $10 million of acquisition-related expenses, quarterly adjusted net income was $437 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share equaled $2.06.\nThe increase in quarterly net revenues was largely driven by record investment banking revenues and record assets under management and related administrative fees, primarily due to higher private client group assets and fee-based accounts.\nAnnualized return on equity for the quarter was 21.3% and adjusted annualized return on tangible common equity was 24.1%, a very impressive result, especially in the near zero-rate environment and given our strong capital position.\nMoving to slide five.\nWe ended the quarter with record total client assets under administration of $1.18 trillion, up 27% on a year-over-year basis and 1% sequentially.\nWe also achieved record PCG assets and fee-based accounts of $627 billion and record financial assets under management of $192 billion.\nWe continue to focus on supporting advisors and their clients through leading technology solutions and a client-focused culture.\nAs a result, we had a fantastic year in terms of advisor retention as well as record results in recruiting new advisors to the Raymond James platform through our multiple affiliation options.\nWe ended the quarter with records of 8482 financial advisors, net increases of 243 over the prior period and 69% over the preceding quarter, representing a new record during the fiscal year we recruited financial advisors with approximately $330 million of trailing 12-month production and approximately $54 billion of client assets to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels.\nAlso in the Private Client Group, advisors generated domestic net new assets of approximately $83 billion in fiscal 2021, representing 10% of domestic PCG assets at the beginning of the fiscal year, a very strong result reflecting our excellent retention and record recruiting.\nAdditionally, this year, new account openings and advisor productivity were very strong contributing to the excellent net new asset results.\nAlso worth noting on the slide is the impressive loan growth at Raymond James Bank during the quarter, up 5% sequentially to a record $25 billion.\nThis growth was driven by securities-based loans to the Private Client Group clients as well as a strong corporate loan growth.\nMoving to segment results on slide six.\nThe Private Client Group generated record quarterly net revenues of $1.8 billion and pre-tax income of $222 million, a 12.3% pre-tax margin reflecting significant operating leverage over the past year.\nThe Capital Markets segment generated record quarterly net revenues of $554 million and pre-tax income of $183 million, representing an extremely impressive 33% pre-tax margin to net revenues.\nThese record results were driven by record investment banking revenues, strong tax credit fund revenues and solid fixed income brokerage revenues.\nThe Asset Management segment generated record net revenues of $238 million and record pre-tax income of $114 million, up 29% and 46% over the year ago period respectively.\nThese results were primarily due to growth in financial assets under management, driven by net inflows to fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group partially offset by market depreciation and net outflows for the Carillon Tower Advisers during the quarter.\nRaymond James Bank generated quarterly net revenues of $176 million and pre-tax income of $81 million.\nQuarterly net revenues increased 9% over the year ago quarter, as higher levels of earning assets offset year-over-year compression in the bank's net interest margin.\nSequentially, net revenues grew 4% due to higher asset balances during the quarter.\nThe pre-tax income growth year-over-year was due to the aforementioned revenue growth and lower bank loan provision for credit losses in the current quarter.\nCompared to the preceding quarter, the bank's pre-tax income declined largely due to a reserve release in the preceding quarter compared to a loan loss provision, primarily associated with the strong loan growth during the fiscal fourth quarter.\nLooking at the fiscal year 2021 results on slide seven, we generated record net revenues of $9.76 billion, up 22% over fiscal year 2020 and record net income of $1.4 billion, up 73% over fiscal 2020.\nExcluding losses on the extinguishment of debt and acquisition-related expenses during the year, adjusted net income was $1.49 billion, up 74% over adjusted net income in fiscal 2020.\nMoving to the fiscal year results on slide eight.\nThe Private Client Group, Capital Markets and Asset Management segments, generated record net revenues and record pre-tax income and all of our segments realized substantial operating leverage during the fiscal year.\nOnce again, these results reinforce the value of our diverse and complementary businesses.\nI'll begin with consolidated revenues on slide 10.\nRecord quarterly net revenues of $2.7 billion grew 30% year-over-year and 9% sequentially.\nRecord asset management fees grew 8% sequentially, commensurate with the sequential increase in the beginning of the quarter balance of fee-based assets.\nPrivate Client Group assets and fee-based accounts were up 2% during the fiscal fourth quarter, providing a modest tailwind for this line item for the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nConsolidated brokerage revenues of $541 million grew 9% over the prior year, but declined 2% from the preceding quarter.\nInstitutional fixed income brokerage revenues remain solid, albeit down from the strong levels of the comparison periods.\nBrokerage revenues in PCG were up 17% on a year-over-year basis, but flat sequentially due to lower trading volumes, which offset the benefit from higher asset balances and associated trailing commissions.\nFor the fiscal year, brokerage revenues were up 13% to a record $2.2 billion, reflecting records for both PCG and fixed income, which had a fantastic year that was a testament to their leading position in the depository segment.\nAccount and service fees of $170 million increased 21% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, largely due to higher average mutual fund assets driving higher associated service fees.\nPaul already discussed our record investment banking results this quarter.\nSo let me touch on other revenues.\nOther revenues of $74 million were up 35% sequentially, primarily due to higher tax credit funds revenues.\nWe also had $18 million of private equity valuation gains during the quarter of which approximately $5 million were attributable to non-controlling interest reflected in other expenses.\nMoving to slide 11.\nClients' domestic cash sweep balances, which are the primary source of funding for our interest-earning assets and the balances with third-party banks that generate RJBDP fees ended the quarter at a record $66.7 billion, up 6% over the preceding quarter and representing 6.3% of domestic PCG client assets.\nAs we continue to experience growing cash balances and less demand from third-party banks during fiscal 2021, $10.8 billion of client cash is being held in the client interest program at the broker dealer.\nOver time that cash could be redeployed to our bank or third-party banks as capacity becomes available, which would hopefully earn a higher spread than we currently earn on short-term treasuries.\nOn slide 12, it was great to see an 8% sequential increase in the combined net interest income and BDP fees from third-party banks to $198 million.\nThis growth was largely attributable to strong asset growth and a resilient net interest margin at Raymond James Bank, which remained right at 1.92% for the quarter.\nWe expect the bank's NIM to settle right around 1.9% over the next couple of quarters.\nThe average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks remained flat at 29 basis points in the quarter.\nIf banks demand for deposits doesn't improve from current levels, we believe there will be downward pressure on this yield in fiscal 2022, especially in the back half of the fiscal year, which is why we have been so focused on generating on-balance sheet growth in assets that could deliver good risk-adjusted returns.\nMoving to consolidated expenses on slide 13.\nFirst our largest expense compensation.\nThe compensation ratio decreased sequentially from 67.2% to 65.8% largely due to record revenues in the capital markets segment, which had a very low 52% compensation ratio during the quarter.\nGiven our current revenue mix and disciplined management of expenses, we are confident we can maintain a compensation ratio of 70% or lower in this near-zero short-term interest rate environment.\nAnd as we experienced in fiscal 2021, we can do meaningfully better than 70% with Capital Markets revenues at or near these record levels, which is our expectation for at least the next quarter or two.\nNon-compensation expenses of $361 million decreased 15% sequentially, primarily driven by the $98 million loss, on extinguishment of debt in the fiscal third quarter.\nSomewhat offsetting this favorable variance, we had a modest provision for credit losses during the quarter, compared with a bank loan loss reserve release in the fiscal third quarter.\nOverall, our results in fiscal 2021 show, we have remained focused on managing controllable expenses, while still investing in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisors and their clients.\nWhile we are still finalizing our fiscal 2022 budget, we do expect expenses to increase meaningfully in fiscal 2022, for a variety of reasons.\nFirst and foremost, we are going to continue investing in people and technology, to support the phenomenal growth of our business over the past year, ensuring we maintain very high service levels and leading technology solutions for advisors and their clients.\nWe also expect business development expenses to pick-up, as travel recognition trips and conferences have already started resuming in the fiscal first quarter, which our advisors and associates are really excited about.\nJust as a reminder, business development expenses totaled about $200 million in fiscal 2019, before the start of the pandemic.\nAdditionally, whereas we had a $32 million net benefit for credit losses in fiscal 2021, we would expect bank loan loss provisions for credit losses associated with net loan growth, in fiscal 2022.\nSlide 14 shows the pre-tax margin trend over the past five quarters.\nPre-tax margin was 20.8% in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021.\nAnd adjusted pre-tax margin was 21.2%, which was boosted by record revenues and still relatively subdued business development expenses.\nAt our Analyst and Investor Day in June, we outlined a pre-tax margin target of 15% to 16% in this near-zero interest rate environments.\nAnd right now, we believe, the top end of that range is an appropriate target given the aforementioned expense growth, we currently expect in fiscal 2022.\nBut, as we experienced during the fiscal year, there is a meaningful upside to our margins, when Capital Markets revenues are as strong as they have been in fiscal 2021.\nOn slide 15, at the end of the quarter, total assets were approximately $61.9 billion an 8% sequential increase, reflecting solid growth of loans at Raymond James Bank as well as a substantial increase in client cash balances being held on the balance sheet.\nLiquidity and capital remained very strong.\nThe total capital ratio of 26.2% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.6% are both over double the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized, giving us significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and grow the business.\nYou can see that RJF corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $1.15 billion, decreasing 26% during the quarter, as we have restricted the cash that we plan on using to close on the Charles Stanley acquisition, which we currently expect to close in the first or second quarter of fiscal 2022, for as soon as we receive the requisite regulatory approvals.\nSlide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions, over the past five quarters.\nDuring the fiscal year, we repurchased nearly 1.5 million shares, split adjusted for $118 million.\nAs of October 27th, $632 million remained under the current share repurchase authorization.\nDue to the restrictions following our announced acquisition of TriState Capital Holdings, we do not expect to repurchase common shares until after closing.\nLastly, on slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank.\nThe credit quality of the bank's loan portfolio remains healthy with most trends continuing to improve.\nCriticized loans declined and non-performing assets remain low at just 20 basis points.\nThe bank loan loss provision of $5 million was primarily driven by strong loan growth during the quarter.\nThe bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percent of loans held for investment, declined from 1.34% in the preceding quarter to 1.27% at quarter end.\nFor the corporate portfolios these allowances are higher at around 2.25%.\nOverall, I'm very pleased with our fantastic results for this quarter and the fiscal year, which exceeded many records.\nAs for our outlook, we are well positioned entering fiscal 2022 with strong capital ratios, quarter-end records for all of our key business metrics and strong activity levels for financial advisor recruiting and investment banking.\nIn the Private Client Group segment, results will benefit modestly by starting the fiscal first quarter with a 2% sequential increase of assets in fee-based accounts.\nAdditionally, based on our robust recruiting pipeline, we hope to continue our current recruiting trend as prospective advisors are attracted to our client-focused values and leading technology platforms.\nIn the Capital Markets segment, the investment banking pipeline remains very strong and we expect a solid fixed income brokerage results, driven by demand from the depository client segment.\nIn the Asset Management segment, if equity markets remain resilient, we expect results will be positively impacted by higher financial assets under management.\nAnd Raymond James Bank should continue to grow, as we have ample funding and capital to grow the balance sheet.\nWe will continue to focus on lending to PCG clients through our securities-based loans and mortgages and we will continue to be selective and deliberate in growing our corporate loan and agency-backed securities portfolio.\nAs we look ahead, we remain focused on the long-term and our long-term growth.\nAnd as we've outlined at our recent Analyst and Investor Day, those key growth initiatives include driving organic growth across our core businesses continuing to expand our investments in technology and sharpening our focus on strategic M&A.\nOur recent announcements to acquire TriState Capital and Charles Stanley Group demonstrate our focus on these initiatives and our commitment to deploy excess capital over time.\nWe believe these acquisitions stay true to our long-standing criteria, which is a good cultural fit, a strategic purpose and makes sense for our shareholders.\nThese results are a testament to the dedication of everyone in the Raymond James family.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We're excited to share these strong results with you.\nBut before I turn things over to Jay Farner, I will read our disclaimers.\nToday's call is to provide you with information regarding our fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 performance in addition to our financial outlook.\nOur commentary today will also include non-GAAP financial measures.\nAnd with that, I'll turn things over to Jay Farner to get us started.\nThe excellent results that we're about to discuss and the innovations that drove them are a testament to your focus and dedication in what was an incredibly difficult year for the world.\nYour contributions to our clients and communities were a shining example of how successful our for-more-than-profit mindset can truly be.\nThe platform continues to be the key to our long-term success in the verticals where we operate as well as the record results that we've achieved in 2020.\nOver the next few minutes, you'll see how the technology that we've built and refined over decades will continue to drive success, not only in the products that you're familiar with today, but also in product extensions and entirely new verticals in the future.\nIf you were to ask us what our most important product is, we'd say it's the platform itself.\nIn walking through our results, I'll provide updates on each of the key pillars of the Rocket Platform, our technology, the strength of our brand, the Rocket Cloud Force, which I'll discuss later, and our data science foundation.\nI'll finish today's remarks by talking about how our platform allows us to continue to grow and become more efficient in our existing lines of business while also launching and rapidly scaling new businesses.\nOur mission over the last several decades has been to take the most complicated and stressful transactions in life and simplify them with technology.\nWhether those transactions are mortgage, real estate, auto sales, or any number of new initiatives we're currently incubating, we provide a simple digital process, exceptional client experience, and certainty.\nThis mission began in 1998 when our founder and Chairman, Dan Gilbert, wrote an email committing all of the company's resources to moving online.\nHis vision was simple, but decades ahead of its time.\nMost of the Internet companies of that era focused on problems like search, advertising, or basic e-commerce.\nDan saw things differently.\nHe spotted the potential to take the most complex transaction in a consumer's life, the buying and financing of a new home, and leverage technology to make it accessible online to consumers across the country.\nFor more than two decades, we've been quietly building our technology platform right here in Detroit to transform the way our clients experience life's most important events.\nWe've continued to strengthen our digital products and infrastructure in 2020, deploying nearly 4,500 product features throughout the year and delivering improvements to our platform every 28 minutes on average.\nSupporting our platform is our strong national brand that consumers and partners know and trust.\nAs we grow, we continue to invest and find new ways to extend our reach and expand our marketing channels we leverage, allowing us to connect with more and more clients.\nI'm pretty sure the majority of you were among the nearly 100 million fans who watched the Super Bowl a couple of weeks ago.\nIn that game, we ran two 60-second advertisements highlighting that \"certain\" is better when it comes to buying a home.\nWe aired one commercial, highlighting rocket mortgage and our technology that helps bring certainty to the home buying process, something that is needed now more than ever in today's red hot real estate market.\nThe second demonstrated the significant role mortgage brokers play in American homeownership.\nAs you know, brokers are important partners as we continue to extend the reach of our platform.\nThis massive exposure, the first-ever national advertisement showcasing brokers during a super Bowl allows them to align with the power of the Rocket brand to create differentiation in their local markets.\nOur ads were ranked Nos.\n1 and 2 on USA Today's ad meter, which I am certain is the most prestigious consumer ranking of top Super Bowl ads.\nThis means not only were our ads led by millions of consumers, but also received tremendous lift and visibility through social media, news articles, and TV networks playing our ads for free.\nAll told, our Super Bowl activation resulted in more than 3.3 billion consumer impressions.\nWhen you look at the areas where we continue to excel and set the standard, you see both a company and a brand that some of the most well-respected organizations in the world want to associate with.\nWe've talked about our relationship with American Express, with State Farm, Intuit, Charles Schwab, and others in the past.\nOn our last call, I also hinted that we would soon be announcing a new partnership.\nToday, I am happy to share that Morgan Stanley and E*TRADE have entered into a new agreement with Rocket Mortgage, where our company will originate, close, and service conforming mortgages for their clients.\nThis arrangement allows Morgan Stanley to continue focusing on its jumbo lending while allowing Rocket Mortgage to provide conforming loan options to the firm's millions of clients.\nWe are very excited about this opportunity, which will kick off this year.\nAnother pillar of our business model is the incredible Rocket Cloud Force, now consisting of more than 6,600 U.S.-based professionals trained to advise our clients on complex transactions.\nThe COVID pandemic truly proved that the power of our Rocket Cloud Force can be harnessed anywhere as our team members work from home in locations across the country.\nThe versatility and skill of this team allows us to continue exploring new verticals and services.\nOur ability to build, train and license large-scale sales teams provides us a significant competitive moat.\nToday's consumer expects simple, powerful digital experiences, backed by support and consultation from trusted advisors.\nThe Rocket Cloud Force's ability to seamlessly integrate into the online experience with timely, accurate, and actionable information is a game changer.\nIn markets where the legacy experience can be confusing and discouraging, like buying or selling a home, searching for a car, or considering a personal loan, our digital solutions and trusted advisors provide confidence and certainty.\nAlong with our powerful Rocket Cloud Force, our company also continues to rapidly grow its use of ethical, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to streamline the business.\nWe have the benefit of millions of clients working with us each year to buy a car, get a personal loan, buy a home or refinance a mortgage, and we've been able to leverage this information to build sophisticated models to ensure our brand is in front of our clients and top of mind when they're ready to transact.\nIn fact, since the beginning of 2019, data science has driven more than $75 billion in application volume.\nThe importance of data cannot be overstated.\nIt is this information that allows us to quickly innovate, anticipate the market and, in some cases, develop new companies altogether.\nThese real-time insights are a significant market advantage and consistently guide us to the right decisions with incredible efficiency.\nTogether, these pillars of our business: our scalable platform, our national brand, our Rocket Cloud Force, and our strategic use of data, combine to create a technology powerhouse that continues to accelerate at scale.\nIt took our company 25 years to close our first 1 million loans.\nIn 2020 alone, we have helped more than 1.1 million clients with their mortgage, automotive, real estate, or personal loan needs.\nInnovation and execution, paired with a highly trained Rocket Cloud Force, creates a flywheel that continues to rapidly accelerate.\nI'm even more excited about where we're going in the future.\nJust three years ago, we launched Rocket Auto with the belief that we can leverage our platform and Rocket Cloud Force to help simplify the process of purchasing a car.\nEveryone knows buying a car is complicated and intimidating.\nIt's an experience that few consumers look forward to, but we've been able to make it approachable and enjoyable.\nStarting from zero in 2017, we've organically scaled Rocket Auto to more than $750 million of gross merchandise value in 2020.\nNow that we've validated the model, we will continue to invest in accelerating the growth in 2021 and beyond.\nOur partner network is another increasingly important growth driver for Rocket Companies.\nWe continue to evolve and diversify from our original direct-to-consumer business model.\nPartner volume made up 38% of our closed loan volume in 2020, up from 23% just two years ago.\nWe view this evolution similar to Amazon's past decision to open up its marketplace to third-party sellers.\nLike Amazon, we've built a proprietary platform and have the capacity to process millions of transactions a year.\nThe partner network brings growth and diversification to our business.\nSupporting these efforts, in late January, we announced that we launched a directory of nearly every broker in the country on rocketmortgage.com.\nWe then promoted that directory with the Super Bowl ad that I mentioned earlier.\nThe impact has been tremendous.\nIn less than one month since launching, we've had tens of thousands of consumers visit the directory and click through to contact a broker.\nAll of these elements together have created an incredibly profitable company that has shown an ability to grow, strengthen and scale in any market environment.\nThe fourth quarter of 2020 was no exception.\nAll of our businesses performed above expectations, leading to a full-year adjusted revenue of $16.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $11.1 billion.\nAs a result of our exceptional financial performance, Rocket Companies has generated substantial capital.\nAnd today, we're excited to announce that we are sharing our success with our shareholders.\nAs Julie will soon explain, our Board has authorized a special dividend of $1.11 per share for holders of our stock as of March 9 to be paid on March 23.\nWe're also accelerating our long-term approach of launching and scaling new businesses from the ground up.\nI'm pleased to announce the creation of Rocket Labs.\nRocket Labs' mission is to incubate new businesses within Rocket Companies that leverage our platform and provide our clients with services that complement our existing core products.\nOur approach is to empower small, independent teams to work on big ideas and concepts, which form the core of our future products.\nWe are excited about Rocket Labs and the possibilities it represents.\nBefore I turn things over to Julie to share our financial results, I'm going to take a moment to give her a proper introduction.\nJulie and I have worked together inside this company for 17 years.\nDuring that time, she's led the finance and accounting teams and done a tremendous job managing all aspects of our liquidity.\nIt's Julie's foresight that has helped us continue to grow in all market cycles.\nNot only that, but there's nobody who knows the financial side of this industry better.\nWe're all lucky to be working alongside her.\nWith that introduction, Julie, take it away.\nI'm pleased to again report strong financial results for Rocket Companies.\nFor the full-year of 2020, Rocket Companies generated $16.9 billion of adjusted revenue and $11.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA as we wrapped up a record-setting year.\nIn discussing today's results, I'll walk through some of the key advantages of Rocket Companies' business model.\nIn particular, I'll highlight the power of our platform to unlock scale, drive efficiency and serve as a launchpad for new businesses focused on simplifying complicated transactions.\nI will also provide some insights on our capital allocation priorities.\nOur 2020 results demonstrate true growth at scale.\nFor the full-year 2020, we generated $320 billion of closed loan volume, representing an increase of 121% year over year.\nOur success in 2020 was broad-based, with consistent increases across both our direct-to-consumer and partner network channels.\nOur growth was so balanced between new and existing client relationships.\n2020 was also a year of robust growth across Rocket Companies, with particular strength at Amrock, our title company, with revenues increasing 124% to $1.3 billion during the year.\nRocket Auto, our automotive retail marketplace, also generated robust results orchestrating more than $750 million in gross merchandise value of automotive e-commerce transactions.\nThis equates to just over 32,000 auto units in 2020 up more than 60% as compared to 2019.\nWe finished 2020 on a particularly strong note, with fourth-quarter rate lock volume of $96 billion and closed loan volume of $107 billion, both significantly exceeding the high end of our expectations.\nMultiple drivers contributed to the outperformance in Q4.\nIn particular, we are seeing a consumer that is increasingly comfortable completing large complex transactions online.\nContinuing the trend, we've seen throughout 2020, our automated, self-serve, digital experience was our fastest-growing channel in Q4.\nWe also saw strength in Q4 from our branded partnerships and mortgage broker partners after launching the Rocket Pro TPO brands to the broker community and releasing multiple enhancements to our TPO software portal during the fourth quarter.\nRocket Homes also finished the year on a strong note as they assisted clients with nearly $1.6 billion of real estate transactions during the fourth quarter alone.\nWhile current industry estimates on market size very widely, it is clear that Rocket gained meaningful market share in 2020.\nOur full-year closed volume growth of 121% substantially exceeded any estimate of the overall industry's growth from third-party sources, which estimates 67% growth on average.\nOur Platform business model is the key to enabling our growth at scale that is truly unmatched.\nTo put this in perspective, Rocket Mortgage's incremental closed volume of $175 billion in 2020 and was more than double the growth of any other market participant.\nIn fact, our incremental gain in 2020 alone, was nearly large enough to eclipse the entire all-in closed loan volume of the nation's second largest originator last year.\nGrowing at this pace in a complex category like home loans requires a platform with broad reach scalable infrastructure and centralized software-driven operations.\nThe Rocket platform is built to perform and grow in the largest, most complex markets.\nOur infrastructure also leads to a highly efficient economic model with substantial operating leverage.\nOur 2020 results demonstrate Rocket's ability to drive increased scale from a single platform with limited incremental cost.\nFor the full-year 2020, a Rocket's adjusted revenue increased by $11 billion year over year.\nWe drove this revenue growth while only adding $2 billion of expenses during the year, or $3 billion of annualized operating expenses based on our fourth quarter.\nTo demonstrate the efficiency of the business model, Rocket's transactions per production team member in 2020 will roughly triple the industry average.\nWhile our low-cost platform model is driving record profitability, we're continuing our long-term strategy to reinvest in the business.\nKey targets for investment include our brand, product development, and initiatives to drive growth in the purchase market.\nWe continue to invest in talent growth, particularly in technical roles.\nAs an example, our data science team now includes over 300 professionals.\nWe're seeing high performers choose to join Rocket across multiple teams, including the ongoing expansion of our technology and product strategy teams.\nOur brand is another key investment priority, including our recent Super Bowl ads, which generated significant brand recognition and drove record traffic to our online and mobile properties.\nAmong our key product development priorities is Rocket Logic, the next generation of our core workflow management platform.\nThe new platform guides users through the next best action, resulting in faster, more accurate workflows.\nWe are very impressed with our initial pilot where we are seeing 20% improvement in turn times within the pilot group.\nWhat's even more exciting is that Rocket Logic can be applied to enhance processes beyond mortgage origination.\nWe expect Rocket Logic and our many automation initiatives to drive continued efficiency in the business model.\nThe core of our economic flywheel is that we are constantly leveraging our profitability advantages to reinvest in the business, further strengthening our competitive position.\nAnother key advantage of the Rocket Companies' platform is our ability to test, launch and rapidly scale new business models.\nThis entrepreneurial approach can be seen in our scaled mortgage operations.\nIn two years, our partner network has grown from less than $20 billion in closed loan volume to $120 billion on an annual basis.\nWe see similar opportunity within our early stage, rapidly expanding businesses such as Rocket Auto, Rocket Loans, and Rocket Homes.\nTo that end, and as Jay announced a few minutes ago, the launch of Rocket Labs will further accelerate our focus on expanding the business in ways that leverage our platform and serve our client base.\nWe believe our clients will be greatly served over time with these additional business lines.\nTurning to our first-quarter outlook.\nWe expect closed loan volume of $98 billion to $103 billion compared to $51.7 billion in the first quarter of 2020; net rate lock volume of $88 billion to $95 billion, up from $56 billion in the first quarter of 2020; and gain-on-sale margins of 3.6% to 3.9% compared to 3.25% in the first quarter of 2020.\nWe're excited about the continued strength and momentum of the Rocket platform.\nWe ended 2020 with an extremely strong balance sheet, including $2 billion of cash and $7.7 billion of total liquidity.\nTotal liquidity includes cash on hand, undrawn lines of credit, undrawn MSR lines, and corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations, which could be transferred to funding facilities at our option.\nAs we communicated at the time of our IPO last summer, our capital allocation priorities always start with properly capitalizing and reinvesting in the business.\nAs I discussed earlier, we are actively deploying capital with investments in our platform, our brand, and our talent.\nWe also want to deploy through add-on acquisitions that would be additive to our economic flywheel and bring value to our client base.\nOur next priority is to return capital to shareholders through dividends, opportunistic use of share buybacks, or a combination of the two.\nGiven our record level of profitability in 2020, the Board approved a special dividend of $1.11 per Class A common share funded by an equity distribution of $2.2 billion.\nOur substantial cash generation provides us significant optionality to drive long-term value for our shareholders.\nAdditionally, we remain authorized to repurchase up to $1 billion of Rocket Companies' common stock.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Listeners to any replay should understand that the passage of time by itself will diminish the quality of the statements made.\nI hope you and your families are all well.\n2020 will be a year not soon forgotten.\nThe health and economic impacts from COVID-19 have been unprecedented.\nAdd to this, the social and political unrest our country has experienced, and 2020 will no doubt go down as one of the most historic and difficult years in our lifetime.\nWhile the issues facing an open-air shopping center REIT are small in comparison to 2020's broader challenges, I am proud of RPT's response and execution this past year.\nFrom our tenant assistance program and charitable donations to our property-level safety and curbside pickup initiatives, RPT demonstrated its commitment to our purpose of turning commercial ground into common ground.\nWe also took swift and decisive actions to shore up our liquidity and preserve our access to capital with our first-time investment-grade credit rating from Fitch.\nIn addition, I was very pleased with the team's tireless effort in pursuit of rent collections, which improved to 91% in the fourth quarter.\nFollowing the payoff of our remaining $100 million balance on our revolver, we have over $100 million of cash and a fully undrawn $350 million revolver and are now positioned to take full advantage of our unique and valuable partnership with GIC and opportunistically execute on our external growth plans.\nWe continue to track a healthy pipeline of acquisitions and have started to see some improvement in activity in recent weeks.\nLet me just reemphasize that the underlying real estate is the primary driver of our acquisition strategy.\nWhat we then look for is growth.\nThat could come in a variety of ways from under-market rents and mismanaged assets to redevelopment opportunities.\nIt could also come in a variety of different retail formats from grocery anchored, lifestyle centers, power centers to community centers.\nAs previously reported, we had five deals in our GIC venture either signed or in negotiations in February of 2020.\nOnce the pandemic hit, we and our partners made the decision to get out of all of them.\nWe are now fortunate to have the liquidity and the deep pipeline within our core markets and believe the widening value gap between property types, tenant categories and markets is creating differentiated opportunities that we hope to take advantage of in 2021.\nOne thing we pride ourselves on is skating to where the puck is going, not to where it's been.\nLast year, we entered the Austin market with our off-market acquisitions of Lakehills Plaza.\nSince our acquisition, Tesla announced a new $1.1 billion assembly plant.\nGoogle, Oracle and Digital Realty, to name a few, each announced relocation or expansion plans to Austin.\nAnd Barshop & Oles announced plans for a new $1 billion mixed-use development directly across the highway from our property.\nIt's been a little over a year since our acquisition.\nAnd we are more convinced than ever about this dynamic market that truly represents where the puck is going.\nFrom a leasing perspective, we continue to make good progress on our grocery negotiations and are also in negotiations with tenant categories such as home improvement, wholesale club stores, off-price, QSR and medical-use tenants.\nThis quarter, we signed a total of 120,000 square feet, up 10% year-over-year.\nNotable signings this quarter included two new deals with a modern, tech-enabled healthcare provider.\nThese deals exemplify our enhanced focus on health and wellness tenants.\nWe also have good activity on the two Stein Mart boxes that we took back in the quarter, where we have an opportunity to significantly improve the tenancies of both boxes.\nAt under $11.50 of ABR per square foot, we also see a solid mark-to-market opportunity upon release of these spaces.\nOne Stein Mart box is already in lease and the other has multiple LOIs that are being negotiated with some very strong national brands.\nWe ended the fourth quarter with a signed but not open backlog of $3.2 million, up from $3 million last quarter.\nWe are currently tracking roughly $2 million of ABR that is currently in lease negotiation, up from about $1.5 million last quarter, giving us some visibility on offsets to potential future fallout.\nThe leasing pipeline is robust, and we are encouraged by the impact it will have on our future cash flows.\nAdditionally, we have a number of remerchandising opportunities that we are pursuing that are listed in our supplement.\nThese 11 projects consist of redemising, expanding or combining spaces similar to the 18 targeted remerchandising opportunities that we completed in 2019.\nAs we did on those projects, we expect to earn attractive returns on our capital of high single to low double digits on this next set of deals.\nDespite the end of year increase in reported COVID cases, our suburban portfolio was less impacted by additional lockdown measures taken since this summer.\n94% of our portfolio by ABR remains open, unchanged from last quarter, with 4% of our closures tied to our theaters.\nThe reopening of our theaters remains fluid.\nOur exposure is almost entirely tied to Regal, whose parent company, Cineworld, recently obtained additional financing they expect to provide liquidity through 2021 and beyond, which is a positive milestone for this tenant.\nWhile we continue to place a high premium on our cheapest source of capital, retained cash flows, we understand how important the dividend is as a component of our total return to shareholders.\nWith that in mind, we established a $0.075 per share common dividend for the first quarter of 2021.\nThe quarterly rate reflects a purposeful analysis of our expected taxable income and our liquidity needs.\nWe believe the new rate is sustainable and could be grown in conjunction with earnings while allowing us to preserve cash to support our growth opportunities and providing sufficient cushion to weather periodic future downturns.\nToday, I will discuss our fourth quarter results, our strong balance sheet and liquidity position, and end with commentary to help everyone understand our expectations on how our business will trend in 2021.\nFor the fourth quarter, our bad debt and abatements were $4.4 million, about the same as the third quarter.\nWe reserved about 89% of our uncollected fourth quarter recurring billings, leaving limited downside from these categories relative to our fourth quarter run rate.\nAs of year-end, $18.1 million of recurring billings for the period of April through December 2020 remain outstanding, of which $11.9 million have been reserved.\nWe expect most of the unreserved amount of $6.2 million to be paid back over the course of 2021 and 2022.\nWe continue to be quite pleased with the resiliency of our portfolio and our limited bankruptcy exposure as our leased rate of 92.8% held up well in the quarter, down just 50 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by the recapture of our two Stein Mart leases that I noted last quarter.\nBlended rent spreads for the quarter remained positive at 3.4%, impacted by a few flat strategic renewals.\nAlso, it's important to note that the releasing spread is just one factor in the organic growth profile.\nThe other factor that we heavily weigh in lease negotiations are the annual contractual rent increases.\nThe leases that we signed during the quarter, annual contractual rent increases, were about 150 basis points, which is a key contributor to creating a long-term sustainable NOI growth profile.\nAs we have noted consistently, we expect some volatility in our quarterly statistics given the size of our portfolio but see a continued mark-to-market opportunity as we cycle legacy leases over the next few years.\nAnd as Brian noted in his remarks regarding dividend policy, we have placed a premium on free cash flow, allowing us to utilize our cheapest form of capital to take advantage of these opportunities as we restabilize our portfolio to pre-COVID leased rate levels of nearly 95%.\nWe were very pleased with our first-ever investment-grade credit rating from Fitch, highlighting our balance sheet strength and flexibility.\nCouple this distinction with an increased confidence in our business and in our access to low-cost debt capital, we no longer felt the need to maintain an outsized cash balance and repaid the remaining revolver balance of $100 million last week.\nWe will also continue to mine our portfolio for additional capital-raising opportunities to further bolster our liquidity position and fuel our external growth plans.\nWe ended the fourth quarter with trailing 12-month net debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA of 7.4 times, up slightly from 7.2 times last quarter as another COVID-impacted quarter entered the calculation.\nWe remain committed to bringing leverage into our long-term target range of 5.5 to 6.5 times and expect to see steady improvement in EBITDA as we return to more normalized reserve levels and as our signed leasing backlog begins to kick in over the course of 2021.\nWe are establishing 2021 operating FFO per share guidance of $0.77 to $0.87, which is an expected improvement over the annualized 2020 fourth quarter operating FFO per share of $0.72.\nKey drivers from there are a favorable impact of $0.03 from interest expense, primarily due to the repayment of our revolving line of credit, and $0.02 from our signed not open backlog that we expect the vast majority to open ratably in 2021.\nFurther upside is based on favorable bad debt reserves, which we expect to be heavily influenced by the reopening of our theaters, which is a function of the trajectory of the vaccine rollout and movie productions.\nWhile our assumption is that these circumstances will improve over the course of '21, we felt establishing a wider range was appropriate given the potential varying outcomes for our theater exposure, which represent about $0.10 per share of earnings.\nIf our theaters remain closed and do not pay their contractual rent, our operating FFO could be at the low end of the range.\nAnd conversely, if they are open and paying, we should be near the high end, all else equal.\nIt is important to note that our guidance does not include the net impact of changes to 2020 estimates for bad debt and straight-line rent reserves.\nAlso, while acquisitions are not assumed in our guidance range, we intend to redeploy $100 million of cash on the balance sheet into opportunistic acquisitions that meet our strict underwriting standards, representing upside to our range.\nWhile the near-term COVID trajectory remains uncertain, we are cautiously optimistic that the worst is now behind us.\nAs we move closer to a more normalized environment and given the conflicting impacts of permanent move-outs and rent collection statistics, we hope to return our focus to more traditional measures of REIT operating performance like occupancy, rent spreads and same-property NOI growth.\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to improve our disclosures, this quarter we added a net asset value page to our supplemental on page 14 to help facilitate your analysis of our real estate value.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:You will also find our 10-Q on Range's website under the Investors tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system.\nFor additional information, we've posted supplemental tables on our website to assist in the calculation of EBITDAX, cash margins, and other non-GAAP measures.\nThe first quarter of 2021 saw Range made continued progress toward our key strategic objectives, improving margins through cost controls and thoughtful marketing, generating free cash flow, enhancing liquidity and extending our maturity profile, operating safely and efficiently, and ultimately positioning the company to return capital to shareholders as the most efficient natural gas and NGL producer in Appalachia.\nI'll touch briefly on each of these before turning it over to Dennis and Mark to cover in more detail.\nI'll start with unit costs and margin improvements.\nRange's unit costs for the quarter were right on track and ahead of our expectations with G&A, LOE, exploration expense, and production taxes, coming in at the low end of our guidance and expectations.\nAdditionally, we reported a significant gain in our marketing activities for the quarter.\nAs expected, GP&T increased versus the prior quarter but was more than offset by the significant improvements we saw in NGL and natural gas realizations, resulting in the vast improvements to Range's margins.\nIn fact Range's unhedged realized price for the quarter was approximately $3.20 per mcfe, which was $0.51 above the NYMEX Henry Hub equivalent price of $2.69.\nThis premium to Henry Hub is a result of our diversified marketing portfolio and liquids production.\nThis liquids uplift improve margins and reduces Range's breakeven costs when compared to producing only dry gas.\nIn fact Range's pre-hedge margin improved by over $1 per mcfe in the first quarter when compared to the 2020 average.\nGiven the improved fundamental backdrop for natural gas liquids with approximately 65% of our activity in the liquids-rich window this year, Range is very well positioned to continue to benefit from this dynamic.\nDuring the quarter, Range was also able to benefit from improved daily prices in the natural gas market, realizing a natural gas differentials that was $0.08 better than the midpoint of guidance only partially offset by higher transportation fuel costs, again benefiting margins and cash flow.\nOn the back with this improved pricing, Range generated $193 million in cash flow from operations before changes in working capital, and with capital spending, coming in at just $105 million for the quarter, Range generated solid free cash flow.\nAs shown on slide 14, we expect this to continue with significant growth in EBITDAX this year versus last.\nWhen combined with absolute debt reduction, this organic free cash flow generation puts us well on our way toward our longer-term balance sheet targets.\nTouching on the all-in capital investment of $105 million on the quarter, it's clear that the team's operational execution was superb.\nAnd we continue to find ways to lower costs, once again leveraging our large contiguous acreage position to find ways to complete the operational plan with peer-leading capital efficiency.\nAfter delivering on operational plans below budget for the last three years, Range remains on track to do the same for the fourth consecutive year in 2021.\nThe operational team safely delivered this capital-efficient plant with an eye toward our long-term environmental goals.\nRange closed out 2020 with class-leading emissions intensity, reducing greenhouse gas emissions intensity and putting us right on track toward our 2025 goal of net-zero.\nAs we strive for this goal, it all starts with efficient operations that minimize our operating footprint and importantly, generates competitive returns.\nWe believe Range's peer-leading capital efficiency and maintenance capital are key differentiators among peers.\nAs we've discussed in the past, Range's large blocky acreage position affords us operational and financial efficiencies on multiple fronts including water recycling, infrastructure, rig mobilization, and equally optimization, just to name a few.\nDennis will cover a good example of how this combination of these benefits, benefit range from both an ongoing development and corporate return standpoint in addition to strengthening our environmental efforts.\nWhen combining our low well costs, strong recoveries, and shallow base decline of under 20%, Range is operating at a high level of capital efficiency that provides a solid foundation for generating sustainable free cash flow, what further differentiate Range is our ability to deliver this level of efficiency for an extended period of time giving our multi-decade core inventory.\nFor some added context on our inventory, Range is turning to sales approximately 60 wells this year, but we have approximately 2,000 Marcellus locations with EURs that are greater than 2 Bcfe per 1,000 foot of lateral.\nThe average recovery of these wells is very similar to the wells Range has turned to sales for the last several years providing Range an unmatched runway of high-quality wells that's measured in decades.\nThis is not the case for many of our peers, which we believe positions Range as well as any upstream company to benefit from improving commodity price environment over the medium and long-term.\nBefore turning it over to Dennis and Mark, I'll just reiterate that Range remains committed to sustainable free cash flow.\nOver time, we believe Range will stand out among peers as a result of our low sustaining capital, competitive cost structure, marketing strategies, and importantly our multi-decade core inventory life, which will be an increasing competitive advantage in the years to come as other operators exhaust their core inventories.\nWe will continue to focus on safe, efficient, and environmentally sound operations, prudent capital allocation, and generating sustainable returns to shareholders.\nImportantly, these are all reflected in our updated compensation metrics that can be found in our most recent proxy statement.\nOver to you, Dennis.\nWhen we communicated the operational details for our 2021 program, our framework was built around improving both operational and capital efficiencies, enhancing margins, all while striving to further improve our environmental and safety performance.\nAs we look at our first quarter results, our operating teams are off to a strong start delivering on our objectives for the year, beginning with Q1 production above our communicated guidance and capital spending in line with our 2021 plan.\nFirst quarter capital spending came in at $105 million or approximately 25% of our 2021 program budget.\nAs we discussed on the prior call, our capital spending program is front-end loaded for the year and is a consistent approach with previous years.\nAs we look forward, our second quarter capital spending is expected to be approximately one-third of the annual budget for the year, mainly driven by activity timing for completions and turn in lines shifting to Q2.\nThe reduced capital investments in the second half of 2021 are aligned with our activity cadence reducing to one drilling rig and one frac crew during the third and fourth quarters.\nOur first quarter production level of 2.08 Bcf equivalent per day was a direct result of recent strong well results combined with exceptional field run time for the quarter due in large part to the near flawless winter operations planning and execution by our production operations team.\nUnderpinning our first quarter production including turning to sales, 16 wells spread across are dry, wet, and super-rich acreage.\nOur Q1 turn-in lines consisted of an average horizontal length in excess of 11,500 feet and added just under 200,000 producing lateral feet to Range's Appalachia assets.\nDuring the fourth quarter of last year, through the first quarter of 2021, our activity shifted toward wells located across our processable gas footprint.\nThe results of these turn-in lines increased Range's average oil production to a level exceeding 8,000 barrels per day in Q1 and, has increased overall liquids production in similar levels seen during the first half of 2020.\nThis level of wet production contribution is expected to continue through the end of this year with second quarter production projected at approximately 2.1 Bcfe per day.\nThis will position us to achieve our 2021 maintenance target of 2.15 Bcfe per day through additional margin enhancing liquids production while spending $425 million or less.\nShifting to our operational highlights.\nDuring the first quarter, 15 wells were drilled across our dry, wet, and super-rich footprint.\nFour of these wells are in the top 20 lateral links for Range's Marcellus program history with all four exceeding 17,800 feet.\nDrilling efficiencies continued with nearly three-quarters of the new wells drilled on pads with existing production, coupled with a 5% increase in daily lateral footage drilled compared to 2020.\nOn the completion side, 16 wells were completed during the quarter.\nOverall, the team completed just under 1,200 frac stages while setting a first quarter winter operations efficiency record by averaging over eight frac stages per day.\nThis efficiency level exceeds Range's previous best first quarter in winter operations record by 14%.\nThe water operations team built upon prior water recycling successes by utilizing nearly 2 million barrels of third-party produced water, a first quarter record and as a result, reduced overall completion costs for the quarter by more than $4.5 million.\nDespite cold weather conditions and heavy snowfalls, the team produced some of our best operational results in our program to date.\nAll while keeping safety and environmental performance at the forefront.\nLease operating expense for the first quarter was consistent with our prior year's Appalachia level and remained low at $0.09 per Mcfe.\nAchieving this LOE level is in large part due to a well-coordinated proactive winter operations plan with the objective of minimizing weather-related production impacts and associated costs.\nThese efforts generated a field runtime that exceeded 99% with a weather-related production impact of less than 0.5 million cubic feet per day for the quarter, a remarkable achievement.\nLooking at the operational successes and milestones achieved during the first quarter, involves a focused, continuous improvement approach, and it's anchored by four key areas.\nRange's water recycling program, long lateral development, utilization of existing infrastructure, and lastly optimize the use of drilling and completions equipment.\nEach of these are key drivers in delivering on our operational and capital efficiency and our integrated part of achieving our ESG or more specifically our environmental objectives.\nWe often touch on the benefits each of these bring to our program ranging from a reduction in operating costs, efficiency gains, minimizing our environmental footprint, and reductions in emissions.\nToday, I'd like to take a moment and walk through how these four strategies are being implemented by our operations and support teams along with the positive impacts.\nI'll use three of the wells that were turned to sales in the first quarter as an example.\nThese three wells were drilled on an existing surface location with producing wells that were originally developed and turn to sales in 2013.\nThe average lateral length of the original wells was just over 3,000 feet per well.\nIn stark contrast, the average lateral length of the new wells is nearly 16,000 feet per well, more than 5 times longer.\nNo additional earth disturbance was needed for 5 times the acreage development and no additional production, gathering, and processing infrastructure was required to add these new wells.\nTo put this into perspective, Range has close to 250 developed pads in Southwest PA and as of today, we've returned 84 of these locations to drill additional wells.\nAdditional wells are planned for these same pad sites along with the approximate other two-thirds of Range's pads that we've yet to return to for added activity.\nSimply put, we're only scratching the surface of this opportunity.\nThe three new wells were completed late last year, utilizing our contracted electric fracturing fleet which displaced 470,000 gallons of diesel fuel.\nThis reduced our cost by approximately $300,000 per well along with large reductions and associated emissions.\n40% of the water used to complete these new wells was recycled water from Range's producing wells along with third-party water, sourced from our water sharing process.\nThe balance of the water was pumped from our water pipeline network, which was installed nearly a decade ago, further reducing emissions associated with truck traffic by more than 13, 400 truck trips.\nThe average initial production of these wells exceeded 44 million cubic feet equivalent per day including more than 9,700 barrels per day of combined condensate and natural gas liquids per well, placing them in the top tier of wells in our Marcellus program history.\nThis is just one of many examples we could share from our development during the past several years with results such as this.\nThese efforts have underpinned our operational efficiency gains and give us confidence in the durability around keeping our drilling complete cost below $600 per foot, all while achieving our environmental goals and producing best-in-class wells.\nThese benefits highlight the importance and value of having a high- quality contiguous acreage position and forward-thinking technical team.\nBefore moving on to marketing, I'd like to touch on Range's environmental and safety performance.\nTo further reduce production facility emissions, in 2020, Range transitioned to a quarterly leak detection program doubling the number of inspections conducted.\nAs a result of this increased inspection frequency, an additional 7,400 metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions was removed from our program, resulting in a 67% reduction for those related components.\nThis effort along with the continued advancements in our production facility design and utilization of an electric frac fleet has resulted in further reductions in Range's reported emissions, reaching a new low CO2 equivalent level.\nThis level of performance is competitive with any natural gas play in North America and puts Range in an enviable position globally.\nConsistent with our environmental results, Range's safety performance saw similar improvements delivering an over 30% improvement in recordable incidents for the quarter, which was the best Q1 performance versus the prior five years.\nSwitching to marketing, Range's NGL and condensate business benefited from a strong first quarter.\nMarket prices improved across the board and our advantaged portfolio of contracts enabled Range to capture premium pricing and a pre-hedge NGL realization in Q1, that was the highest level since late 2018.\nThe primary driver for improved pricing across both NGLs and condensate was strong demand in a market that saw decreased supply.\nPreliminary results for US propane and butane or LPG reveal that Q1 2021 domestic demand was 13% higher year-on-year while supply decreased by 4%.\nSimilarly, condensate supply in the Northeast is estimated to have decreased by 15% to 20% year-on-year.\nAs a result of these improved fundamentals, the market average NGL barrel price improved significantly during the quarter.\nAt $24.83 per barrel, Range's Mont Belvieu equivalent barrel was at 38% over the prior quarter and 83% compared to the first quarter of 2020.\nPropane prices led the way, increasing nearly 60% versus the prior quarter and 140% versus Q1 of 2020.\nAdditionally Range's premium to a Mont Belvieu equivalent barrel increased by approximately $1.50 per barrel versus the prior quarter as Range realizes this highest premium to Mont Belvieu in the company's history.\nLooking forward, we see propane and butane market prices continuing to post strong year-on-year gains as storage balances of these NGLs are much tighter relative to last year.\nThis past winter, propane posted its largest seasonal withdrawal and well over a decade, leaving the end of March propane stocks at a 33% deficit to last year and a 17% deficit to the five-year average.\nGiven the strong international demand that we are seeing with new chemical capacity coming online and recovering global economies, we believe it will be challenging for propane to replenish US stocks to a comfortable level by fall.\nAs a result, we expect propane prices to transact at levels at or above 60% of WTI crude this fall and the upcoming winter.\nOn the commercial side, beginning April 1st, Range entered into a set of new and diverse LPG export-related contracts.\nThese contracts will add flexibility, reduce cost and further enhance realized propane and butane prices continuing Range's momentum of achieving strong price premiums, relative to the market.\nFinally, we continue to optimize Range's condensate sales portfolio by adding flexibility, improving margins, and assuring product placement.\nAs this year progresses and optimization continues via a diverse set of counterparties, we expect that our condensate differentials to WTI will continue to improve, further benefiting our liquids area development plan discussed earlier in the call.\nOn the natural gas side, cold weather during mid-Q1 equated to the third coldest February, when looking at the past 10 years.\nAnd despite milder conditions in both January and March, Q1 gas weighted heating degree days finished slightly above the five-year average.\nThrough utilization of our diverse transportation portfolio, Q1 resulted in a differential of $0.14 under NYMEX, including basis hedging.\nLooking ahead, we see potential for additional positive improvements for natural gas pricing, given that a high percentage of operators are targeting maintenance production levels this year, coupled with year-over-year improvements in storage, the fundamentals point toward an undersupplied natural gas market.\nWithin this constructive outlook for natural gas, Range is on track with its differential guidance of $0.30 to $0.40 for the year.\nAs we close out our operations and marketing updates, the first quarter results clearly reflect our operations are off to a strong start for the year with the team further building on our operational and capital efficiency performance, all while delivering on our environmental and safety objectives.\nConsistent delivery on stated objectives, that is Range's fundamental strategy.\nAnd as you've heard from Jeff and Dennis something the team successfully executed during the first quarter; efficient operations delivering production, efficient drilling and completions activity with capital spending trending in line to better than budget, combined with margin enhancing expense management, all resulted in significant free cash flow.\nOur ultimate goal is to repeat this quarter in and quarter out.\nResults for the first quarter reflect the benefits of reliable operations, productive wells, and diversity in sales points for natural gas, natural gas liquids, and condensate.\nCash flow from operations before working capital was $193 million compared to $105 million in capital spending.\nSignificant improvements in free cash flow compared to past periods were driven by a 50% improvement in pre-hedge realized prices per unit of production versus the prior-year period, which reached $3.20 per mcfe in the first quarter.\nThis realized price per unit is $0.51 above NYMEX Henry Hub, driven by improved natural gas basis and importantly further enhanced by a 77% increase in NGL price per barrel, which reached $26.35 pre-hedge.\nRealized NGL price on Mmcfe [Phonetic] basis equates to $4.39 per mcfe and condensate realizations equate to $8.17 per mcfe.\nHence the realized premium to Henry Hub.\nAdditionally, Range's NGL prices exceeded a Mont Belvieu NGL barrel by $1.52 due to our unique portfolio of domestic and international sales contracts.\nMargin enhancing focus on unit cost is a constant state of mind for Range.\nLease operating expenses declined over 40% year-over-year to $0.09 per unit on the back of consistent, efficient, Marcellus operations, despite the winter weather and the divestiture of higher-cost assets.\nCash G&A expenses declined to $28 million or $0.15 per unit in the first quarter.\nThe decline results primarily from lower compensation costs of a leaner organization, coupled with targeted value-focused spending on IT, data services, safety, environmental, and other essential areas.\nCash interest expense was roughly $55 million.\nHigher interest expense is the result of our most recent refinancing activity, which dramatically and positively reshaped the debt maturity profile of the company and enhanced liquidity.\nGathering, processing, and transportation expense increased, but it is important to keep in mind that this is a positive byproduct of strong NGL prices that resulted in significantly higher NGL margins.\nRecall that Range's processing costs are the percent of proceeds contracts such that we pay a percentage of NGL revenues as the fee.\nConsequently, a fraction of the material higher prices received for NGLs is paid as higher processing cost in that quarter.\nFor perspective, an increase of $1 per NGL barrel equates to approximately $0.01 per mcfe and cost.\nThis structure is unique to range in the Appalachian Basin and is a right way risk arrangement that has led to reduce costs for several quarters of lower prices and now continues to drive material margin expansion.\nAs a result of rising NGL prices in recent months, GP&T expense in 2021 is trending toward the high end of guidance.\nHowever, this is more than offset by expected higher NGL revenue, forecasted at current strip pricing relative to earlier this year.\nTurning to the balance sheet, Range has diligently and successfully managed the debt profile, such that liability management projects reduced bond maturities through 2024 by almost $1.2 billion while at the same time improving liquidity to nearly $2 billion.\nDuring the first quarter, we issued new bonds due 2029 in the amount of $600 million, which combined with the reaffirmation of our facilities, $3 billion borrowing base and $2.4 billion in commitments provide substantial liquidity and a strong evidence of what we believe is durable asset value.\nCash flows are expected to retire debt maturities in coming years and are backstopped by ample liquidity.\nDuring the first quarter, we called in $63 million in near-term maturities of senior and senior subordinated notes closing on the redemption in early April.\nThere has been substantial improvement in the debt markets, and it's evident in the trading levels of Range's bonds that both access to and cost of capital has improved.\nFuture debt retirement is expected to be funded primarily by organic free cash flow.\nWe will be cost-conscious in effectively managing debt retirement, while also being mindful of any potential refinancing risk of debt maturities.\nBeing opportunistic in bond redemptions, this prices in early redemption options become economic on a risk-adjusted basis.\nLiability management over the last two years has as expected temporarily increased interest expense, however, this avoided much higher cost forms of capital that would have diluted shareholder ownership and participation, and what we see is a steadily improving natural gas and natural gas liquids business.\nWhile we're proud of the steps taken to date, further improving our balance sheet remains a principal objective.\nAs can be seen in the recently filed proxy, leverage metrics have been incorporated into long-term compensation criteria with the target of 1.5 times debt to EBITDA were better.\nShareholder value creation through the generation of free cash flow and its prudent redeployment is our focus.\nTo be clear, we believe this is an achievable goal.\nAt current commodity prices by the end of 2022, Range's leverage is approaching target levels.\nOn the topic of hedging, we have a glide path or common range in which we add positions over the course of the year.\nWithin that path, we intentionally moved at a deliberate pace during 2020, as we added 2021 hedge positions.\nWe plan to follow similar principles this year in adding hedges for 2022 and beyond.\nBy that I mean, we'll seek to balance the twin goals of prudently derisking cash flows while not hedging away the improved supply demand balance into backward dated price curves.\nOur strategic actions over the last three years have been focused on reducing risk while maintaining and enhancing the intrinsic value of the asset base.\nWe believe Range holds the largest portfolio of quality inventory in Appalachia.\nExposure to that inventory on a per-share basis has been preserved and enhanced by our actions.\nWe believe steps taken represent material progress in positioning Range as a more resilient business and as evidenced by first quarter results primed to participate in improved market dynamics.\nJeff, back to you.\nOperator, we'll be happy to answer questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Despite the extraordinary challenges 2020 presented on a global scale, we are extremely pleased with the strong execution of our team -- that our team has shown, not only in the field, but by all of the employees within the family of companies, who demonstrated the true resiliency of the Reliance business model.\nI applaud each and every one of you for your tremendous efforts to quickly and nimbly adapt to the changing environments, ensure our customers were always taken care of, and most importantly, maintain your unwavering commitment to health and safety, our most important core value.\nSince 2017, our SMART Safety program has been focused on embedding our culture of safety across our entire family of companies.\nWorking together as one company, we focused on this initiative in 2020 like never before in response to the new and unique challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition to developing new policies and procedures to prevent the spread of the virus, we improved our safety performance in 2020 with an approximately 23% reduction in our incident rate compared to 2019.\nWhile this is a significant milestone, as I've stated in the past, we will not be satisfied until this rate reaches 0.\nI'd like to take a moment to congratulate both Karla Lewis and Arthur Ajemyan for the recently announced well-deserved promotions.\nConsistent with our Board's strategic executive leadership succession plan, Karla was promoted from CFO to President and was simultaneously appointed to our Board of Directors effective January 15.\nKarla has demonstrated excellent judgment and leadership in each role she has held since joining Reliance in 1992, and her unique abilities and talents have earned the respect of our employees and shareholders.\nKarla's promotion recognizes her significant contributions to Reliance.\nIt will allow her to broaden her knowledge of Reliance's field operations and increase the diversity of her experience.\nIn addition, Arthur Ajemyan was promoted to Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective January 15.\nArthur has held various positions in Reliance's finance and accounting department for over 15 years and has done a phenomenal job.\nI congratulate both Karla and Arthur on their promotions and look forward to continuing to work closely with them in their new roles.\nNow let's turn to our 2020 results.\nWe delivered a solid financial performance in 2020, driven by consistently strong operational execution despite considerable turbulence in the market.\nOur results demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our people and unique business model as well as our ability to execute through both good times and bad given the diversity of our products, end markets and geographies.\nOur decentralized structure allowed us to respond rapidly to fluid market conditions and demand trends.\nThese factors, combined with pricing discipline and continuous improvements to our value-added processing capabilities, enabled us to achieve our second consecutive year of record annual gross profit margins at 31.5%, up 120 basis points from 2019 and exceeding our estimated sustainable range of 28% to 30%.\nWe also maintained healthy profitability levels despite the extraordinarily volatile and challenging market conditions.\nFor the full year, we generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $7.71 as a result of the combination of strong margin discipline and effective expense control, which helped mitigate our decline in profitability.\nOn the heels of a record year in 2019, we maintained strong cash flow from operations of $1.17 billion in 2020 driven by our profitability and focus on working capital management.\nFueled by our ongoing focus on rightsizing our inventory to reflect current demand levels and our differentiating advantage of cross-selling inventory among our family of companies, we achieved our companywide inventory turn goal of 4.7 times based on tons for 2020.\nIn line with historical trends and the cornerstone of our business model, a significant portion of our metal we purchase is from domestic suppliers.\nAnd it is paramount that we continue to support our mill partners who, in turn, have consistently been there for Reliance during challenging times.\nOur countercyclical cash flow generation allows us to remain flexible and opportunistic in executing our growth initiatives while concurrently returning value to our stockholders.\nWe invested $172 million in our business through capital expenditures in 2020, including many growth opportunities such as our recent toll processing expansion in Texas and Kentucky.\nToday, we are introducing our 2021 capital expenditure budget of $245 million that includes new buildings and other projects to expand, upgrade and maintain many of our operating facilities.\nWe are installing energy-efficient lighting and solar panels in certain of our facilities.\nOur 2021 budget also includes innovative new processing equipment to provide our customers with the highest-quality products and services.\nAlthough COVID-19 has slowed the pace of acquisitions activity in general, we continue to see a healthy pipeline of potential candidates as we've begun to broaden our view on the universe of prospective growth opportunities.\nAs always, we evaluate opportunities based on a strict set of criteria to ensure a strong fit within the family of companies.\nNow turning to stockholder returns.\nIn 2020, we repurchased $337.3 million worth of our common stock at an average cost of $91.80 per share and paid $164.1 million in dividends to our shareholders.\nWe've maintained our payment of regularly quarterly dividends for 61 consecutive years without ever suspending payment or reducing our dividend rate.\nIn addition, we've increased our dividend 28 times since our 1994 IPO, including the most recent increase of 10% for the first quarter of 2021.\nLooking forward into the remainder of 2021.\nReliance will continue to execute and improve upon our tried-and-true model that has led us to industry-leading results for many decades.\nOver the past year, we've adapted to operate more efficiently than ever before without sacrificing our competitive edge and the critical elements of our business that make Reliance a trusted and reliable business partner.\nWe will maintain our focus on opportunities to enhance our products, end markets and geographical diversification, along with our ongoing commitment to strong pricing discipline, diligent expense control, when-needed inventory management, organic growth and innovation.\nAs was evident throughout the past year, our customers rely on Reliance to continue to support them through trying times, often in greater capacity and on a more frequent basis.\nAs I continue to say, and I will say again, America is going to need Reliance to rebuild.\nAs an essential business, we were able to continue operating throughout the pandemic, with our 2020 tons sold decreasing only 10.8% compared to 2019.\nOur average selling price was down 9.6% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to declining mill prices for most of the products we sell during the first nine months of the year.\nDespite these negative trends, we achieved record gross profit margin in 2020.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, healthy demand conditions in the majority of our end markets resulted in our tons sold declining only 1.3% compared to the prior quarter.\nThis was the lowest Q4 seasonal decline we've experienced in the last 10 years and exceeded our guidance by a significant margin.\nDespite customer holiday-related closures and less shipping days typical of the fourth quarter, we experienced solid demand trends throughout the fourth quarter as the economy continued to regain momentum.\nSupported by solid demand and rising input costs, metal pricing improved as mill price increases for many of the products we sell accelerated throughout the fourth quarter with prices for certain carbon steel products almost doubling, which led to our average selling price increasing 4.6% compared to the third quarter of 2020, again, exceeding our expectations.\nThe favorable demand and pricing conditions in the fourth quarter contributed to our record gross profit margin of 33%, a 60 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2020.\nAnd on a non-GAAP FIFO basis, which we believe is the best measure of our day-to-day operating performance, our gross profit margin of 33.6% increased 180 basis points from 31.8% in the third quarter of 2020.\nOur record gross profit margin reflects the outstanding performance by our managers in the field who effectively implemented price increases at the time of mill announcement prior to receiving the higher-cost metal into inventory, pushing our gross profit margin above already strong levels, resulting from our focus on higher-margin orders.\nWhile we are very pleased with our record Q4 and full year gross profit margin, we continue to believe our estimated sustainable gross profit margin range of 28% to 30% is appropriate as we navigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and operate through this uncertain environment.\nThat said, maintaining our strong gross profit margin remains a cornerstone of our business model.\nWe believe our managers will continue to successfully leverage the significant investments we have made to expand and improve our value-added processing capabilities.\nIn fact, one of the key factors contributing to our record gross profit margin for the full year was our value-added processing capabilities, which have increased in recent years as a result of our significant investments in state-of-the-art equipment.\nWhile the percentage of orders with value-added processing declined to approximately 49% from 51% in 2019 due to changes in product mix caused by the pandemic, process orders continue to serve as a stabilizer to our margins in challenging markets with declining demand and pricing trends.\nI'll now turn to a high-level overview of the conditions in our key end markets.\nDemand in nonresidential construction, the largest market we serve, remained relatively steady during the fourth quarter due to ongoing healthy bidding activity for new projects and the restart of projects that had been put on hold earlier in the year.\nWe've been seeing quoting activity in the areas you might expect such as infrastructure projects, schools, utilities, water and power, strip malls and data and distribution centers.\nDemand for the toll processing services we provide to the automotive market was strong, with activity back to pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter as automotive OEMs and steel and aluminum mills continued to ramp production as a result of reopenings following COVID-19 shutdowns in the second quarter of 2020.\nWe commenced operations at our new facility in Kentucky in late November and also recently broke ground on a new greenfield tolling facility in Texas, with both focused on carbon steel tolling to support increased capacity of our toll processing customers, who are primarily metal producers and their end users.\nDemand in heavy industry for both agricultural and construction equipment rebounded to solid levels in the fourth quarter as production schedules continued to ramp following customer reopenings from COVID-19-related shutdowns and to meet equipment dealer restocking needs.\nSemiconductor demand steadily improved from the third quarter of 2020, and the market continues to be one of our strongest.\nDemand in commercial aerospace further declined in the fourth quarter as a direct result of reduced air travel due to COVID-19, which has reduced airplane build rates.\nWe believe the fourth quarter represented the trough.\nThat said, demand in the military, defense and space portions of our aerospace business remained stable at solid levels throughout the fourth quarter.\nFinally, demand in the energy sector, which is mainly oil and natural gas, remained under pressure in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nAnd throughout 2020, we took prudent cost-reduction measures, including the closure of certain facilities, which helped strengthen our overall efficiency and position us to support a recovery in this market.\nWe are optimistic on both demand and pricing trends in the first quarter of 2021 as we have experienced strength in both so far in the first quarter.\nAnd Arthur will now review our financial results.\nI'll start with our sales discussion.\nFourth quarter 2020 sales were down 12.8% from the prior year period as our markets continued to recover following the reopening of the economy.\nApproximately half of the decline in our sales can be attributed to our businesses supporting the commercial aerospace and energy end markets, as evidenced by the disproportionately higher declines in our sales of aluminum and alloy products.\nFor the full year of 2020, sales were down 19.7% from 2019.\nApproximately half of the decline in sales was due to lower shipping volumes across all major end markets we sell to, and the remaining half was due to lower average selling prices.\nHowever, both recovering demand and pricing from the reopening of the economy in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 helped to mitigate the annual decline in our sales.\nAs Jim and Karla highlighted, we generated a record quarterly gross profit margin of 33% in the fourth quarter of 2020, up 60 basis points from both Q3 2020 and Q4 2019 and a record gross profit margin of 31.5% for the full year of 2020, up 120 basis points from our previous annual record of 30.3% in 2019.\nOur non-GAAP FIFO gross profit margin in the fourth quarter of 2020 was up 450 basis points from Q4 2019, and for the full year of 2020 was up to 280 basis points from 2019.\nWe incurred LIFO expense of $15.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 due to rapidly increasing mill costs for most of our products.\nHowever, for the full year of 2020, we still recognized LIFO income of $22 million as our cost of inventory on hand at the end of the year was still below the levels at the beginning of the year.\nThis compares to LIFO income in the fourth quarter and full year of 2019 of $81 million and $156 million, respectively.\nWe ended 2020 with a LIFO reserve of $115.6 million on our balance sheet.\nBased on current market conditions, we expect to incur an annual LIFO expense of $340 million in 2021.\nConsistent with our accounting policy, we allocate our annual estimate on a pro rata basis in each quarter.\nAs such, our current projected Q1 2021 LIFO expense is $85 million.\nAs in prior years, we will update our expectations each quarter based upon our inventory cost and metal pricing trends.\nOur fourth quarter non-GAAP SG&A expenses decreased $51 million or 9.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 on a 7.9% reduction in shipments.\nFor the full year, same-store SG&A expenses declined $241 million or 11.5% on a 10.8% reduction in shipments.\nThe decline in SG&A expenses was due to reduced spend across every major expense category.\nAs you've heard us say before, approximately 60% to 65% of our SG&A expenses are people related.\nWhen looking at the 11.5% year-over-year decline in same-store SG&A expenses, approximately half of the decrease was people-related as our headcount declined 14% compared to the prior year.\nIn addition, lower incentive pay due to lower gross profit and pre-tax income levels also contributed to the decline in our compensation costs.\nAlthough we are entering the first quarter of 2021 with a more efficient expense structure because of strong volume and pricing trends, we expect our expenses will increase in the first quarter of 2021 from the fourth quarter of 2020, consistent with seasonal trends.\nI will address our Q1 2021 outlook for demand and pricing shortly.\nFor the full year of 2020, our effective income tax rate declined to 22.1% from 24% in 2019 mainly due to our lower pre-tax income level in 2020.\nWe currently anticipate our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be 24%.\nOur strong gross profit margin and effective expense management resulted in $2.01 of earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2020, well above our outlook of $1.30 to $1.40 per diluted share but down 17.6% from $2.44 in the fourth quarter of 2019 mainly due to reduced demand levels related to the pandemic, with commercial aerospace and energy end market sales being significant contributors to the decline in our sales.\nIn comparison to the third quarter of 2020, fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.01 was up 7.5% from $1.87 due to improved pricing, strong gross profit margin and recovering demand in most end markets.\nTurning to our balance sheet and cash flow.\nWe generated strong cash flow from operations of $230.2 million during the fourth quarter due to our profitable operations and effective working capital management, including our focus on rightsizing our inventory levels.\nAt the end of the year, our total debt outstanding was $1.66 billion, resulting in net debt-to-EBITDA multiple of 1.1 times.\nAlso at the end of the year, no borrowings were outstanding on our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility.\nAs mentioned last quarter, we significantly strengthened our liquidity position through the successful completion of both our $900 million senior notes offering and amended/restated $1.5 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility.\nThe facility amendment, combined with the proceeds from the notes offering, provides us with ample liquidity and an improved debt maturity profile.\nI'll now turn to our outlook.\nWhile macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic continues, favorable market conditions have persisted so far into the first quarter of 2021, with improving demand and additional mill price increases on many carbon and stainless steel products.\nThis environment allows us to maintain higher gross profit margin levels as we increase our selling price prior to receiving the higher-cost metal in our inventory.\nWe expect these favorable conditions to continue for the remainder of the first quarter.\nAs a result of these favorable conditions and the normal seasonal improvement, we estimate our tons sold will be up 10% to 12% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.\nWe also expect our average selling price in the first quarter of 2021 will be up 12% to 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.\nBased on these expectations, we currently anticipate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $3.40 to $3.50 for the first quarter of 2021.\nIn closing, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter 2020 financial and operational results.\nOutstanding execution by all of our employees greatly contributed to our success in 2020.\nTheir efforts, coupled with our resilient business model and disciplined execution of our strategy, resulted in yet another quarter of solid profitability and cash flow, enabling us to continue supporting our growth and stockholder return priorities.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be utilized in isolation or considered as a substitute for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAlso note that the content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today.\nThe company does not intend and undertakes no obligation to update this information to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.\nFinally, today's call is being recorded and will be available on the company's website later today.\nThough we are closely monitoring the latest Delta variant of the coronavirus, the entire organization has been energized to see the reopening of the economy, continued strength in the housing market and exceptional performance and growth in our business.\nStrong operating income and rising portfolio valuations drove exceptional financial results for the second quarter, including GAAP earnings of $0.66 per diluted share, well in excess of our $0.18 per share dividend for the second quarter.\nThis contributed to a 6.5% increase in our GAAP book value to $11.46 per share at June 30th.\nThe results we've generated thus far in 2021 are reflective of a business that can expand profitably, while successfully serving it's mission of making quality housing accessible to all American households.\nAs you know this mission emphasizes borrowers whose needs are not well served by government loan programs or potentially not at all.\nOur residential and business purpose lending teams together target the non-agency mortgage market, the segment of the market that many who recently ignored in large part due to the absence of Federal Reserve stimulus.\nThe non-agency market represents the residential mortgage universe outside of government-backed mortgage programs.\nBy targeting this market rather than a specific borrower profile as we had in the past, our business is not tied to the direction of the homeownership rate.\nInstead Redwood now offers a comprehensive product mix that serves both non used to be consumers and housing investors alike, and it's a big market.\nMany of forecasted residential non-agency origination volumes have significantly increased in 2021 from the $435 billion of originations in 2020.\nThat's only beginning to reflect the potential from a regulatory pullback for non-owner occupied loans, something that can provide a significant tailwind to our sector going forward.\nOur results remain strong in the second quarter despite market conditions that were significantly more challenging than they were in the first quarter.\nRising interest rates reemerged in the residential lending space, largely as the result of uncertainty and whether the Fed will alter it's support for the agency mortgage market.\nThe sharp competitive forces that arose as a result along with the corresponding decline in refinance activity triggered a contraction in margins across the industry.\nExaggerating the effects of strong competition were signs of pro-cyclical and supply chain inflation with the shift in yield curve driving significant hedging and execution costs for those managing large mortgage pipelines including for us.\nAgainst this backdrop, in the second quarter, we still locked close to $4 billion of jumbo loans at margins in the high end of our historical target range.\nThe business purpose lending market also became more crowded in the second quarter with new competitor using the rate sheet to buy their way into the space, particularly for lower balance bridge and rental loan products.\nThe shift out of apartment living and toward single family detached homes as a trend had shown no sign of ebbing despite the recent reopening of most major metros.\nThis has led to a shortage of high quality homes with aggressive demand from both investors and consumers alike.\nIn many regions rent growth has been significantly outstripped by home price appreciation highlighting the scarcity value of quality housing in the multiple constituencies focused on acquiring single-family homes.\nLeveraging a well-earned reputation as a nimble and reliable lifecycle lender, CoreVest our BPL platform eclipse $500 million of fundings for the quarter and a balance of single family rental and bridge originations.\nThe sustained performance through this challenging backdrop showcased our strategic foundation and is the essence of what makes Redwood unique.\nOur mortgage banking businesses offer highly complementary products that drive durable earning streams.\nAnd our investment portfolio continues to offer significant upside as the economy recovers.\nOur credit discipline and ability to create our own assets remain key differentiators.\nOur strategic foundation has facilitated returns that are significantly outpacing our growing dividends.\nIn the first half of 2021 approximately 70% of Redwood's adjusted revenue was driven by our mortgage banking operations with the remaining 30% from our investment portfolio.\nWe expect mortgage banking and by extension our taxable subsidiaries to continue to be a strong earnings driver going forward.\nThe revenue generated through mortgage banking is nearly double the percentage contribution of recent years and highlights the ongoing shift in our business model as we adapt to changing market conditions.\nIt also supports continued expansion of book value over time, the retain earnings acting as a zero cost avenue for capital formation that has reduced our marginal need for funding and stands in contrast to others in the space, manage their balance sheets.\nBy continuing to reinvest in our infrastructure, both organically and through partnerships our path to realizing transformative scale is clear.\nAcross our enterprise, we've cultivated a talented and inspired workforce, we have embraced technology to serve our customers more quickly than ever before.\nOne great example of this approach is last quarter's launch of our early stage investment platform RWT Horizons.\nThis is something Dash will touch on in more detail.\nAs we look ahead, we continue to raise our game, invest in our people and infrastructure and attack our markets with the service standard that continues to separate us from our competition.\nWe're excited by recent changes in the regulatory landscape that have made the non-agency mortgage market more relevant than it's been in many years.\nOur goal is to build a business that serves an important public mission and scale profitably and generates a very attractive return profile for our shareholders.\nOur second quarter results reflect continued strategic progress and strong operating momentum.\nWhile our comprehensive non-agency market footprint benefited from ongoing strength in the housing and credit markets, we coupled these macro tailwinds with homegrown ingredients, both new and familiar.\nOur team's usual crisp execution was complemented by meaningful progress with our technology infrastructure, both organic and through new partnerships already bearing fruit.\nIn sum, the final product was another quarter of significant outperformance.\nAs Chris referenced, benchmark rates remain an area of acute focus for the markets.\nThe uptick in rates during the second quarter has almost fully retraced, however, uncertainty around the level of government support for agency mortgages may very well moderate the amount of borrower refinance activity, we typically see in this kind of rally.\nAgainst this backdrop, it's important to unpack the key drivers of profitability across our platforms.\nAs Chris noted, the markets we serve continue to grow as the path of home prices, evolution and consumer demand for housing, and important regulatory trends are driving an expansion of non-agencies true potential footprint.\nAnd while we're not immune from moves in MBS prices versus benchmark rates, our diverse distribution channels and unique product mix allow us to benefit from different drivers of demand.\nCase in point, while margins compressed elsewhere in the market during the second quarter we enjoyed durability in our margins with sustained strength in volume across both residential and business purpose lending.\nIn fact an ebb in demand for agency mortgages represents another potential tailwind for our business.\nMortgage originators are still ramping up capacity to address the pent-up demand from jumbo borrowers, and as home price appreciation has increased nationwide along with consumer preference for single-family detached rental housing, our suite of BPL offerings remains in high demand and our residential business geographic footprint continues to expand.\nOur equity is now at its highest level in at least a decade pushing more loan demand above the conforming loan limits and into Redwood's addressable market.\nAs we note in our updated investor supplement, there are now 13 states in which we have a lot more loans year-to-date than in each of the two years prior to the pandemic.\nCollectively, locks in these states represent 35% of our year-to-date volume, a trend we continue to track with great interest.\nOverall market observers now forecast single family home price appreciation for 2021 to be 14% and 16% for existing and new homes respectively.\nEven if this moderates is expected into 2022 we expect the trend to continue of more locations across the country evolving into non-agency markets.\nAnother key driver is the regulatory environment.\nThe evolving rules are likely to meaningfully increase the Qualified Mortgage or QM cohort a significant boon for high quality expanded credit borrowers.\nFurthermore, caps in place since earlier this year on GSE purchases of non owner-occupied loans could expand on non-agency market by an estimated $25 to $35 billion per year.\nAnd there is likely more of the non-agency market can do to help address broader access to credit and the associated impact on first time homebuyers and low-to-moderate income borrowers overall.\nAlso critical to the equation is the availability of high quality rental housing including single family detached, an issue solved in part by an increase in custom built projects.\nAs we discussed on prior calls, housing supply has not kept up with demand and building material costs moderating remain high contributing to significant price escalation on home.\nSingle-family homes for rent can meet the demand for expanded space in desirable neighborhood at a monthly payment that more consumers can afford.\nReflecting these supply demand dynamics, single-family rental occupancy rates remain at record highs with a weighted average of 95% for all US single-family rental homes, and single-family rents have remain meaningfully more than multifamily rents since early last year.\nOur second quarter results reinforce this broader backdrop.\nOperating highlights for the quarter included reaching our second highest level of jumbo locks ever and our highest BPL volume since late 2019.\nAs Brooke will elaborate on book value increased 6.5% driven by a mix of asset appreciation through fair value changes and retained earnings from mortgage banking income earned at our taxable REIT subsidiary.\nCollectively, our platforms distributed $3.6 billion of loans through direct loan sales and 4 securitizations.\nFollowing a historic first quarter, our residential business registered $3.9 billion of lock volume in Q2.\nAs anticipated, purchase money loans were a key driver and represented a 60% share of the quarter lock volume.\nDespite the interest rate backdrop and competitive pressures impacting GSE eligible production, the business delivered margins at the high end of our historical target range of 75 to 100 basis points reflecting the diversity of our distribution channels and strength of our pipeline management amid broader market volatility.\nDuring the second quarter, we sold $1.8 billion of loans and completed 3 Sequoia securitizations for $1.5 billion.\nWhile we saw moves in rates during the quarter and a dramatic flattening of the yield curve after the June Fed meeting, the end-to-end coordination and efficiency with which our teams function remain a true competitive advantage.\nThe flexibility of our securitization program coupled with whole-loan distribution facilitates further scale as collectively they allow us to be in the market consistently.\nDuring the second quarter, we were once again faster to market than the competition and distributing our pipeline.\nAnother encouraging metric was the contribution that Redwood Choice, our expanded prime product made to volumes.\nChoice represented 15% of our locks in the second quarter, up materially from 5% in Q1.\nChoice represented as much as 40% of our locks pre-pandemic, a reminder of how meaningful this channel can be.\nIn recent public remarks we continue to emphasize changes to the QM rules that we believe will be a key tailwind to Choice's reemergence.\nIf adopted safely the new roles focus on mortgage rate as the determinant of QM status will allow another sleeve of high quality borrowers to qualify more easily for competitive rates, an important step that underscores the true potential of the non-agency market to serve a deeper bench of consumers.\nWe are actively engaging with our seller base to bring this to fruition.\nThese macro trends also reflect meaningful talents for CoreVest, our business purpose lending platform.\nThe second quarter was particularly productive in BPL as we advanced several key initiatives, most notably completing our strategic investment in Churchill Finance.\nCoreVest originated $527 million overall in the second quarter, up 37% from Q1.\nOur funding mix consisted of $312 million of single family rental loans and $215 million of bridge loans.\nBridge production was up over 60% from Q1, an increase for the fourth consecutive quarter driven by increased usage by borrowers on lines of credit and several build-for-rent and multifamily loans coming online for funding.\nThe origination mix for BPL.\nIn the second quarter reflects the strength of our multi-product strategy, which results in high levels of repeat borrowers, including those that utilize more than one of our loan products.\nIn all, 67% of total originations in the second quarter were from repeat customers and the pipeline remains strong with a consistent mix of new loans and refinance opportunities.\nSFR production remains strong in the second quarter with fundings up 23% from Q1.\nAs we discussed on our last call, the pipeline remains robust and execution has benefited from increasingly constructive securitization market.\nWe completed our first broadly syndicated CoreVest securitization of the year in April.\nachieving all time tights on credit spreads with a deep bench of investors.\nThat record proved short-lived.\nLast week's follow on transaction once again priced at all time tights including a spread of 57 basis points on the AAA-rated securities.\nAs we've seen many times before, this type of execution inevitably breeds additional competition, which we view as an opportunity for CoreVest to continue differentiating itself as the BPL market's lender of choice.\nWe have high expectations for our forthcoming refresh client portal, especially it's new user interface, which will make it even easier for our clients to upload documents and track progress of their loans.\nAdditionally, we continue to press our advantages as a nimble lifecycle lender, we're finding a product suite to continue serving the end-to-end needs of a deepening cohort of sophisticated housing investors.\nHighlighting this progress is our partnership with Churchill which we expect will diversify our sourcing channels with a particular emphasis on smaller balanced single-family rental and bridge loans.\nWe have now closed our first purchase of bridge loans and SFR loans from Churchill and see an attractive near-term pipeline to complement our direct lending products.\nIn periods of increased competition, it's important to reinforce the value of an institutional platform like CoreVest in a market that in many ways is still developing.\nWe have now completed optional calls on two CoreVest securitizations, refinancing many of the underlying loans with a platform made 5 or more years ago.\nMany borrowers have now been with the platform for at least that long as CoreVest continues to support their growth and evolution.\nThat sort of track record matters and has immense intangible value on the field of play.\nOur newest initiative RWT Horizons is doing its part and keeping pace with our enterprisewide progress.\nSince formally launching Horizons earlier this year, we have completed 5 investments in our assessing an exciting pipeline of new opportunities.\nMost recently our direct investments include liquid mortgage, a platform focused on leveraging blockchain technology to bring efficiencies to the non-agency market, and a tech enabled residential construction management firm.\nAt this early stage, it's exciting to witness tangible progress with our new partners.\nLiquid mortgage recently procured a key patent covering the vast majority of its business plan, a big step in our collective efforts to apply blockchain technology to the non-agency ecosystem.\nRent room and rent butter also both had productive quarters and are meeting or exceeding their planned product development and rollout initiatives.\nMost critically these partnerships reflect the intellectual collaboration that drive true alpha for all parties involved.\nWe are engaging directly with liquid mortgage and developing the work streams required to safely put mortgages on blockchain, and together are working to engage other key stakeholders across the industry.\nFor rent room and rent butter two investments sourced through CoreVest borrower network, we are facilitating synergies with our broader client base.\nWe're thrilled to be working shoulder to shoulder with those standing on the frontier of innovation in our markets.\nAs previously noted, our second quarter 2021 results reflect the durability of our model and continued strength across our entire platform.\nWe reported GAAP book value per share of $11.46 at June 30th, a 6.5% increase relative to the prior quarter end.\nThe primary drivers of the $0.70 increase in book value per share or GAAP earnings of $90 million or $0.77 per basic share, partially offset by our quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share.\nWe are pleased to have maintained a strong momentum for the first quarter, generating a total economic return on book value of 19% for the first half of 2021.\nOur economic return spotlights not only our growth in book value, but also to our growth in our dividend which we raised by another 13% in the second quarter.\nThese are particularly strong results this quarter from our business purpose mortgage banking operations, which delivered a 52% after-tax operating return on capital with the net operating contribution of $20 million, which is up 80% from Q1 on a 37% increase in origination volumes.\nIncome from residential mortgage banking operations decreased from historic first quarter level while still delivering an after-tax operating return of 17%.\nEven as loan purchase commitments were down 22% Q2 still marks our second highest volume on record.\nTo reiterate Dash's point, gross margins remained at the high end of our historical target range despite a challenging macro backdrop the impacted securitization execution and increased hedging costs relative to the first quarter.\nTurning to the investment portfolio, we had $49 million of positive investment fair value changes primarily from our RPL assets, even further spread tightening, and improved credit performance this quarter which I'll expand upon shortly.\nNet interest income increased approximately 20% or nearly $5 million from the first quarter of 2021 due to higher average balance of loans and inventory at our operating businesses, higher yield maintenance income from SFR securities, growth in our bridge loan portfolio and a decline in interest expense from our investment portfolio.\nShifting to the tax side, we had retaxable income of $0.11 per share versus $0.09 in the first quarter, primarily on higher net interest income.\nOur taxable REIT subsidiaries earned $0.27 per share in Q2, down from $0.47 in Q1.\nThe decrease was primarily driven by lower mortgage banking income, partially offset by lower operating expenses and resulted in a $5 million lower tax provision for the quarter.\nOn a combined basis, our operating businesses generated an annualized after-tax return of over 28% in Q2, utilizing $483 million of average capital.\nAs a reminder, these earnings can either be reinvested back into our operating businesses or paid as a dividend to the REIT.\nThis quarter we continued our focus on higher margin businesses that produced strategic asset for our investment portfolio.\nSpecifically, we deployed $45 million of capital to Brisbane during the quarter and $50 million to SFR securities in core loans.\nYear-to-date we've net reduced the size of our third party investment portfolio through opportunistic sales.\nWorking capital for our mortgage banking businesses represented less than 30% of our allocated capital, but produced approximately 65% of our adjusted revenue for the second quarter.\nAs Chris mentioned, the proportion of adjusted revenue from our mortgage banking operations has been growing in recent years and has facilitated returns that are significantly outpacing our growing dividends.\nTotal portfolio returns rose by a combination of improved credit and faster prepayment speeds on securities we hold at a discount to face value.\nHigher prepayment speeds continue to benefit these portfolios and allow us to accelerate our call options within Sequoia and CoreVest Securities.\nWe settled the call rights on three Sequoia securitizations and one capital securitization during the second quarter, acquiring $83 million of seasoned jumbo loans and $45 million of seasoned SFR loans all at par, which benefited book value by $0.05 per share.\nWe estimate about $250 million to $300 million of expected call activity across capital and Sequoia through the remainder of the year and we estimate at current market conditions the underlying loans can generally be sold or resecuritized well above their par value creating further potential upside to earnings and book value of approximately $0.68 per share for 2021.\nFurthermore, we project another $2 billion of loans that could become callable by the end of 2024 with the majority of those currently expected to occur by the end of 2022, and that could potentially add another $0.63 to $0.65 per share on average to book value depending on execution.\nNet delinquencies in our portfolio continue to improve with new forbearance requests near zero.\nSpecifically Choice and RPL securities experience improved 90-day delinquencies during the quarter with select remaining flat from Q1 and absolute low levels of 80 basis points.\nIt's worth noting the improved delinquency trends with our RPL securities portfolio experiencing 60-day delinquencies now below pre-COVID levels, and voluntary prepayment speeds continue to well exceed our original modeled expectations.\nLTVs in the portfolio are low and continue to improve or hold stable and average coupons aren't excess of our current mortgage rate which should provide options to help distressed borrowers and keep actual losses low.\nAt quarter-end, our balance sheet and funding profile were in excellent shape following several liability and capital management actions taken during the quarter.\nWe added over $750 million of financing capacity to support growth of our operating platforms including the refinance of a $242 million bridge loan financing which contributed to a roughly 100 basis point cost of funds improvement for our overall investment portfolio.\nImportantly, the second quarter marked another record for Redwood with combined $3.3 billion of residential whole loan sales and securitizations underscoring our ability to source and distribute in side.\nOur recourse leverage was marginally higher at 2.2 times at the end of the second quarter as we incurred additional warehouse borrowings to finance higher loan inventory.\nAt June 30th our unrestricted cash was $421 million, which is over half the size of our outstanding marginable debt, and at quarter end, our investable capital was $175 million, not including $100 million of incremental capital generated from a secured term financing we closed in early July.\nI'll close with an update on our 2021 financial outlook.\nWe continue to see upside potential in our book value from here both from anticipated call activity in our investment portfolio and through our ability to grow and retain earnings at our taxable REIT subsidiary.\nWe encourage you to review the supplemental quarterly materials we published earlier today, which provide more detailed and refresh guidance for the remainder of the year to highlight some of the key inputs that support our financial narrative.\nConfidence in our ability to achieve our guidance of grounded in a sustainable trend we're seeing across our businesses.\nAs Chris and Dash have outlined, the key themes that will drive our performance include, increasing our wallet share using technology to drive efficiency, allocating more capital to our higher ROE operating platforms, continuing to create value through the investment portfolio and using partnerships M&A and other growth strategies to further efforts in our target markets.\nAs we look ahead, we remain on track to keep pace with the robust volumes we've seen through the first half of the year anticipating another $6 to $8 billion of jumbo lock and approximately $1 billion of BPL originations for the second half of the year, which would have nearly doubled the volume of that business year-over-year.\nFor perspective, the second half volumes on the residential front approach our full year volume just a couple of years ago.\nWe've demonstrated our ability to successfully grow not only our origination volume, but also our market share and we believe we can continue to do that across our platform and in each of their underlying channel.\nSmall changes in market share can have a meaningful impact to our overall profitability and scale and that's what we're planning to do over time.\nFor the remainder of the year, we anticipate generating an adjusted return on allocated capital between 20% to 25% from our mortgage banking operations, and 10% to 12% for the investment portfolio.\nAs credit spreads have tightened fairly significantly and fair values have since increased this forward yield on the investment portfolio, which is in line with our forecast at the beginning of the year reflects improvements in our financing costs and capital optimization.\nAnd finally, in terms of the potential sources and book value upside we began the year with $444 million of net accretable discount in our portfolio, and even after growing book value of $1.55 per share or roughly $175 million since that time we have approximately $2.60 per share or $300 million of remaining discount in the portfolio that we have the potential to recognize over time.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I will be presenting today with Eric Thornburg, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Gere, President and Chief Operating Officer of San Jose Water Company.\nFor those who would like to follow along, slides accompanying our remarks are available on our website at www.\nThese statements are based on estimates and assumptions made by the company in light of its experience, historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors that the company believes are appropriate under the circumstances.\nI will now turn over the call to Eric.\nI am Eric Thornburg, and it is my honor to serve as Chairman, President and CEO of SJW Group.\nWe're now more than 13 months into the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThere is a sense of cautious optimism that the worst is behind us, and we have begun planning for the safe return to our offices and work centers.\nOver the past year, we've learned much about our teams, our culture, how we can adapt and what we can achieve through remote work.\nDespite the challenges, our people have personified our mission, trusted professionals passionate about delivering life-sustaining, high-quality water and exceptional service to families and communities while protecting the environment and providing a fair return to shareholders.\nLooking ahead, we are preparing for a phased return to our offices and work sites, building on our established risk-based process that has served us well during the past year.\nWe will adhere to the safety guidelines provided by our national, state and local health authorities.\nOur goal remains the same as it has been throughout the pandemic to deliver on our public health mission as a water service provider and protect our employees, customers and communities.\nI and the rest of our executive leadership team are looking forward to the day when we can express our appreciation to all employees in-person and meet the new employees, who have joined our team over the past year without having set foot in our offices.\nWe are committed to a safe return that seizes the benefits of remote work while providing a safe physical environment to nurture collaboration and our culture.\nThe extreme cold and winter weather experienced in Texas last February proved the benefits of a pure-play water and wastewater utility with national scale, geographic diversity and locally focused operations.\nSJW Group was able to draw on resources from our operations on the East and West Coast to assist our Texas operation during the event.\nOur communications teams from both coasts assisted with customer notifications as well as website, social media and news media updates, while our operations and safety teams provided valuable incident support.\nThe direct experience of the Connecticut and Maine teams dealing with cold weather events added to our response.\nIn California, the rainfall season is largely behind us.\nWe have experienced lower-than-normal precipitation for the second consecutive year, and that is impacting available surface water supplies produced from our watershed.\nA very low precipitation that we have experienced in the Santa Cruz Mountains this winter has had a significant impact on our local surface water operations, both in terms of storm runoff collected at the creek intakes for immediate treatment as well as the volume of water that we've been able to impound in our Lake Elsman reservoir for release later in the year.\nFor the first time in my 25 years at San Jose Water, we are temporarily taking our Montevina Water Treatment Plant offline due to low supply.\nWe will bring the plant back into service when hydrologic conditions allow.\nTo provide some perspective, the chart on Slide 10 shows the historic surface water production in blue compared with the associated rainfall at Lake Elsman in red over the same period.\nAs you can see, there's been just one other year, 2014, where we saw such low levels of rainfall and surface water production.\nFortunately, the regional water supply picture is somewhat better, and despite the low rainfall and snowpack this winter, the total groundwater storage at the end of the first quarter remained at Stage one or normal of Valley Water's water shortage contingency plan.\nBased on available recharge and the current rate of withdrawal.\nValley Water reports that it is forecasting to remain in the normal range through year-end by supplementing normal supplies with additional imported water.\nThat bodes well for the upcoming summer months when demands are typically highest, and we anticipate adequate supplies to serve our customers.\nAs a result of the water supply situation in California, we anticipate increases in our operating costs through the reliance on purchase water from our wholesaler to meet our customers' needs in 2021.\nCurrently, every billion gallons of purchased water has an incremental cost to the company of $4.2 million more than using our own supply sources.\nAs a direct result of the water supply outlook and in full transparency, we are announcing guidance of $1.85 to $2.05 per diluted share in 2021.\nThis assumes no additional company produced surface water in California for the remainder of 2021.\nWe are in the process of updating our strategic water supply plan to evaluate current and future supply reliability and resiliency.\nOur current California general rate case proceeding will address the impact of surface water availability.\nThe prudent management of our business and financial resources continues to be fundamental to our growth and our ability to return capital to shareholders.\nWe are proud to have continuously paid a dividend for over 77 years and to have increased the annual dividend in each of the last 53 years, delivering value to our shareholders.\nAfter Jim's remarks, I will address regulatory and other business matters.\nOur first quarter operating results reflect new revenues authorized by our 2019 California general rate case.\nWater infrastructure conservation adjustment and water infrastructure surcharges authorized in Connecticut and Maine and customer growth in Texas.\nThese increases were offset by a decrease in customer usage, the impact of a February ice storm in Texas and a decrease in available low-cost surface water due to the dry weather conditions in California that Eric and Andy just discussed.\nFirst quarter revenue was $114.8 million, a 1% increase over the first quarter of 2020.\nNet income for the quarter was $2.6 million or $0.09 per diluted share, an 8% increase over net income of $2.4 million or $0.08 per diluted share reported in the first quarter of 2020.\nThe increase in diluted earnings per share for the quarter was primarily attributable to cumulative rate increases of $0.08 per share, cumulative cost savings of $0.04 per share, a tax benefit of $0.04 per share and an increase in nonregulated income of $0.03 per share.\nThe diluted per share increase was partially offset by a decrease in customer usage of $0.08 per share.\nCustomer credits in Texas totaling $0.02 per share issued in connection with the February Ice storm, a decrease in the availability of surface water of $0.02 per share and an increase in depreciation and amortization of $0.06 per share.\nOur revenue decrease was a result of $2.8 million in decreased customer usage.\nIn addition, customer credits in Texas reduced revenue by $700,000 and net changes in certain balancing and memorandum accounts reduced revenue by $600,000.\nThese decreases were partially offset by $2.8 million in cumulative rate increases and $500,000 in revenue from new customers.\nTotal 2021 first quarter water production costs were slightly lower when compared to the first quarter of 2020.\nThe minor reduction was primarily due to $800,000 in lower average per unit cost for purchased water, groundwater extraction and energy charges and lower usage, partially offset by a $700,000 increase due to the purchase of additional water supplies to supplement the lower level of surface water production we experienced during the quarter.\nOther operating expenses increased $1.6 million or 2% for the quarter, primarily due to $2.1 million in higher depreciation related to utility plant additions, and $200,000 in higher maintenance expenses, partially offset by $400,000 in lower general and administrative expenses.\nIn addition, in the first quarter of 2020 we incurred $400,000 in merger-related expenses.\nNo similar expenses were incurred in 2021.\nThe effective consolidated income tax rates were approximately negative 52% and 15% for the quarters ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe lower effective tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, was primarily due to excess tax benefits relating to share-based payment awards, state tax credits and other discrete tax items.\nTurning to our capital expenditure program.\nWe added $46.7 million in company-funded utility plant during the first quarter of 2021.\nThis represents 20% of our total 2021 planned capital expenditures.\nFrom a financing perspective, first quarter 2021 cash flows from operations increased 321% over the first quarter of 2020.\nThis change was primarily the result of a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $8.3 million, an increase in accounts receivable collections of $2.2 million and a $1.5 million increase in net income adjusted for noncash items.\nIn addition, in 2020, we made an upfront payment of $5 million to the city of Cupertino in connection with our service concession agreement and refunded $8.4 million to California rate payers that were accumulated in our 2017 Tax Act Memorandum Account.\nNo similar payments were made in 2021.\nIn March 2021, SJW Group issued approximately $1.2 million -- I'm sorry, 1.2 million of new shares in an offering that raised net proceeds of approximately $66.9 million.\nProceeds from the offering were used to repay outstanding balances on the company's credit facilities and for general corporate purposes.\nIn addition, in April 2021, the company's California subsidiary entered into a $140 million credit agreement, and the company's Texas subsidiary entered into a $5 million credit agreement, both with JPMorgan Chase Bank.\nThe new credit agreement replaced the existing JPMorgan Chase credit agreements, which have been paid off and were set to mature and expire on June 1, 2021.\nAt the end of the first quarter, we had $138 million available on our bank lines of credit for short-term financing of utility plant additions and operating activities.\nThe average borrowing rate on line of credit advances during the quarter was 1.42%.\nSJW Group continues to execute on our core growth strategy of investing in high-quality water systems to provide safe and reliable water service to customers and communities and earning a fair return on those investments.\nAs Jim just mentioned, we have already invested approximately 20% of our planned 2021 capital spending through the end of the first quarter.\nWe have high-quality water systems throughout our service areas and are investing to sustain them for the benefit of customers, communities and shareholders.\nOther regulatory developments in the first quarter include the filing of general rate cases for both San Jose Water and Connecticut Water in January.\nSan Jose Water's GRC application proposes a $435 million capital program for the years 2021 through 2023, supported by our award-winning enterprise asset management system.\nNew rates are expected to be effective in the first quarter of 2022.\nCalifornia employs a future test year, and thus, the level of capital spend is authorized during each general rate case cycle.\nConnecticut, Texas and Maine, employ a historical test year, where capital investments not otherwise recoverable through surcharge mechanisms and expenses are recovered in subsequent general rate case filings after they have been incurred.\nConnecticut Water's general rate case is the first since their last decision in 2010.\nA primary driver of the case is the $266 million in infrastructure investments that have been completed and are providing a benefit to customers, but are not yet covered in rates.\nThe Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, or PURA, is expected to issue a decision in the third quarter.\nConnecticut Water rate case also includes tiered rates for residential customers that promote water conservation.\nIn Connecticut, PURA-regulated water utilities are able to collect their authorized revenues regardless of usage through the water revenue adjustment mechanism, which mitigates risk of such a rate design and support state policy goals for conservation.\nA 1.1% increase in the Water Infrastructure and Conservation Adjustment surcharge, or WICA, was authorized by PURA earlier this year and went into effect on April 1.\nThis covers $8.7 million in qualified infrastructure investments that have been completed and will provide incremental annual revenue of about $1 million.\nThe current cumulative WICA surcharge will be rolled into base rates, and the surcharge will be reset to 0 as part of the general rate case.\nMaine Water filed a general rate case application for its Biddeford Saco rate division, requesting a $6.7 million increase in annual revenues with the Maine Public Utilities Commission, or PUC, in March.\nThe application is driven by a $60 million replacement of the 1,884 vintage drinking water treatment plant.\nMaine Water's application includes an innovative proposal that would spread the increase over three years in roughly equal amounts.\nA decision on the rate smoothing mechanism to authorize a customer surcharge, starting in the third quarter of 2021 is expected in the second quarter and a decision on the requested revenue increase is expected in the second quarter of 2022, in alignment with the completion of the new water treatment facility.\nThese various state regulatory filings include capital investments that over the long term benefit customers, communities and shareholders as they enhance our ability to deliver safe, high-quality and reliable water service while increasing rate base, the earnings engine for the company.\nWe are mindful of the economic impact that COVID has had on some of our customers over the past year.\nConnecticut Water is proposing a 15% discount on water bills for income-eligible customers that is similar to a program offered by San Jose Water since late 2005.\nMeanwhile, San Jose Water anticipates proposing a debt forgiveness plan for its Water Rate Assistance Plan, or WRAP, or low-income -- for low-income customers.\nThe proposal includes tracking the forgiven amount in San Jose Water's WRAP balancing account for potential future recovery.\nOn April 9, SJWTX, our Texas Water and Wastewater Utility, executed the closing agreement to acquire the Clear Water Estates Water System.\nThis is the first acquisition completed by a regulated water utility under the state's new fair value -- fair market value regulation.\nThe acquisition added 230 new customers, gained additional water supplies to serve current and future customers and added rate base that reflects market value for future rate making purposes.\nMore importantly, the acquisition demonstrated that the fair market value process worked as envisioned.\nThis was the 13th acquisition completed by SJWTX, which has tripled its customer base since 2006.\nThe company serves two of the top four fastest-growing counties in the United States.\nWith a diverse portfolio of letter supplies and continued additions to customer base through organic growth and acquisitions.\nWe remain optimistic about the prospects for SJWTX and its increased contributions to consolidated earnings.\nWe are committed to investing in our culture, diversity and the environment.\nOur diversity, equity and inclusion council has honestly and authentically guided our commitment to further build on our diverse and inclusive culture.\nWe have goals to expand our supplier diversity programs so we can extend our efforts into the broader community.\nAt the Board level, SJW Group is just one of 154 companies in the Russell 3000 to achieve a gender balanced board rating in 2020.\nAccording to the 50/50 Women on Boards Gender Diversity Index.\nWe've set the foundation for creating a comprehensive greenhouse gas inventory across all of our operations, understanding where we are now will allow us to set meaningful reduction goals for the future and develop prudent plans that will serve as a road map to achieve those goals.\nBob has served as a Director of the company since 2006 and as Lead Independent Director since 2015.\nBob's knowledge of the water industry is second to none and his contributions to our company and stockholders are too long to list.\nMoreover, you won't find a person in business with more integrity, character and a genuine commitment to serve our company, customers, employees and communities than Bob.\nOn behalf of the Board and all of our employees, we wish him the very best.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:This conference call is the property of SYNNEX Corporation and may not be recorded or rebroadcast without our prior permission.\nAnd so now, I'll cover some of the key highlights from Q3, and discuss Q4 guidance.\nIn the face of continuing economic uncertainty in these unprecedented times, our revenue, net income and diluted EPS, all exceeded our expectations, reflecting our resiliency and ability to do what we do best.\nOur GAAP results announced today, while continuing to be impacted by COVID, have not been adjusted for COVID-19 costs.\nWhere appropriate, I will reference the financial impact COVID-19 had on Q3 results.\nOn a consolidated basis, total revenue was a third quarter record of $6.5 billion, up 4% compared to $6.2 billion in the same quarter last year.\nOn a constant currency basis, revenue was up 5% compared to the prior year quarter.\nOur consolidated gross profit dollars totaled $708 million, down 2% or 18 million versus a year ago, and gross margin was 11% compared to 11.7% a year ago.\nTotal adjusted SG&A expense was $448 million or 7% of revenue, down $8 million compared to the year ago quarter.\nConsolidated non-GAAP operating income was $260 million, down $10 million or 4% compared to a year ago.\nNon-GAAP operating margin of 4% was lower by 34 basis points, compared to the prior year period.\nNow shifting gears to Q3 operating performance by business segment.\nFirst on Technology Solutions revenue was $5.3 billion, up 5% or $258 million over the prior year quarter.\nTechnology Solutions' gross margin was 5.6%, and that was 37 basis points lower than the prior year quarter, primarily due to product mix.\nOperating income of $132 million was down $6 million compared to a year ago.\nNon-GAAP operating income was $142 million, down 5% or $7 million compared to the prior year quarter.\nNon-GAAP operating margin was 2.7%, 29 basis points lower than a year ago.\nTechnology Solutions COVID-19 related net incremental expense was approximately $8 million for the quarter, primarily made up of an increase in allowance for doubtful accounts, staffing and work from home costs.\nNow to Concentrix; Concentrix revenue was $1.2 billion, up 24 basis points over the prior year quarter.\nConcentrix gross margin was 35.5%, up 308 basis points sequentially, and down 126 basis points compared to the year ago quarter, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19.\nNon-GAAP operating income in the quarter was $118 million, down $3 million in absolute dollars or 2% compared to a year ago.\nNon-GAAP operating margin was 10.1% compared to 5.9% in fiscal Q2 and 10.4% a year ago.\nNet Concentrix COVID-19 related incremental expenses were approximately $13 million for the quarter.\nNow moving back to our consolidated results; third quarter net total interest expense and finance charges were $29 million, a reduction of $14 million compared to a year ago quarter.\nThe decrease was driven by a reduction in our average outstanding borrowings, compared to the prior year quarter, as well as a lower interest rate environment.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect interest expense to be approximately $29 million.\nTotal non-GAAP net income was $173 million, up $3 million or 2% over the prior year period, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.33, up $0.03 or 1% over the same period a year ago.\nThe effective tax rate for the third quarter was 25.2% compared to 25.3% a year ago.\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 25%.\nTurning to the balance sheet, our accounts receivable totaled $3.6 billion and inventories totaled $2.8 billion on August 31, 2020.\nOur cash conversion cycle for the third quarter was 38 days, 11 days lower from a year ago and improved eight days from last quarter and led to a preliminary cash flow from operations of $321 million.\nThe improvement was supported by continued collaboration with our partners and faster churn on our inventory.\nAt the end of Q3, including our cash and credit facilities, SYNNEX had approximately $2.8 billion in total liquidity available to fund operations.\nI also wanted to provide an update regarding the Concentrix spin.\nWe remain on track for a calendar Q4 spin, and believe the most natural date for the spin to be December 1.\nAs is consistent with our year-end, and as a good clean start for 2020, for both Concentrix and SYNNEX.\nAs we see it today, the estimated the SYNNEX Corp gross debt will be approximately $2.6 billion with Concentrix receiving approximately $1.1 billion and SYNNEX receiving approximately $1.5 billion.\nThe majority of cash on hand, which we estimate will be approximately $700 million at spin, will be held by SYNNEX.\nThe use of cash in Q4 will be for normal seasonal use and debt pay down.\nAs we have previously discussed, we want both companies to be well positioned among its peers from a leverage and liquidity standpoint.\nThese debt balances are estimates and could change based on Q4 performance.\nWe are well down the path with our bankers in securing third party financing for Concentrix, and are confident in the capital structure of both businesses.\nSYNNEX and Concentrix will have the appropriate dry powder to support growth and M&A opportunities.\nNow moving to our fourth quarter outlook; we expect revenue to be in the range of $6.45 billion to $6.65 billion.\nNon-GAAP net income is expected to be in the range of $191 million to $204 million.\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $3.68 to $3.93 per diluted share, on weighted average shares of approximately $51.5 million.\nNon-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance excludes after-tax costs of approximately $37.5 million or $0.72 per share, related to the amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related and integration expenses.\nIn previous discussions with you, we've let you know about one of our valued [Phonetic] customers, that will be moving to a consignment model.\nThe transition date remains fluid and will not begin in early 2021.\nAs we learn more and have proper visibility to a start date, we will certainly let you know.\nI want to start off by expressing my appreciation to all our stakeholders across the globe for their continued commitment and dedication in partnering with us, as we have jointly faced a multitude of challenges and economic issues in 2020.\nOur associates delivered a phenomenal result in Q3, for which I am truly grateful.\nWe are all a bit worn down by the ongoing pandemic, but the SYNNEX spirit and determination continues to inspire me.\nI see the positive impact we are having on our communities and the strong support our teams are providing to each other, our partners and customers.\nAlong with executing a great quarter, the team also made significant progress on our proposed spin of Concentrix to a stand-alone public company.\nThe Concentrix F-10 document is available for your review.\nThird party financing is in final stages, and most of the remaining spend related activities are nearing completion.\nThus, we believe we are in a solid position to close this transaction in calendar Q4.\nNow moving to our third quarter results; in our TS distribution business, better-than-expected revenue was driven by strong demand in education, state and local, and e-commerce channels.\nThis was driven by ongoing work, learn and shop from home needs.\nWe also experienced a slight improvement from our second quarter in office environment and SMB sales.\nConsistent with Q2, we saw higher demand in notebooks, Chromebooks, cloud, collaboration and security products.\nFrom a year-over-year perspective, we experienced some softness in product support in the office environment, such as desktop, PCs, printers, supplies, and on-premise datacenter equipment.\nFrom a geographic perspective, North America was the strongest performer, but all geos net or performed better than expectations during the quarter.\nOverall, TS distribution grew year-over-year.\nIn our TS Hive business, we delivered a sequential improvement and a year-over-year increase in revenue, as we continue to support our largest customers in Q3.\nThe mix of programs delivered was more skewed toward higher volume, lower margin products, but overall we are pleased with the high results in Q3.\nOur Concentrix business also exceeded our expectations in Q3, despite the known challenges.\nI'm very pleased with how we have performed, and I will now turn over the call to Chris, to discuss Concentrix in more detail.\nWe are very pleased with our continued momentum, both on our business execution and on being ready to spin, as Marshall indicated early December.\nWe delivered very solid results, returning to a pre-COVID revenue growth trajectory and double digit adjusted operating margin.\nThe third quarter revenue for Concentrix totaled $1.16 billion, slightly higher than the same quarter last year.\nOn a sequential basis, third quarter revenue increased across all our delivery regions.\nThis would not have been possible, without addressing COVID-19 challenges across three separate areas aggressively.\nFirst, providing a flexible safe workplace that incorporates both at home and at-office elements, to nimbly meet our clients' demands.\nSecond, our strong technology solutions, that support clients regardless of the channels they choose.\nAnd third, driving a culture of security and integrity, backed up by innovations like our recently announced SecureCX offering.\nSecureCX is a proprietary platform that incorporates advanced technology, to ensure close to the same level of security at home, as available in an office.\nThis is just the latest innovation from our staff of well over 1,000 skilled engineers and developers.\nConcentrix has been enabling technology in few solutions like this, for well over a decade, and we will continue to lead by investing in this space.\nWe continue to be happy with our execution also around vertical mix.\nThe communication vertical is now approximately 21% of revenue, representing an impact of 4% to our year-over-year growth rate, but giving us a much more balanced portfolio.\nAs expected, our travel, transportation and tourism clients during the quarter have been impacted by COVID-19, resulting in an additional 2% impact on growth.\nMore than offsetting these headwinds was strong growth with clients in our technology, healthcare, financial services and e-commerce verticals, which represent about two-thirds of our business on a combined basis.\nNew business signings were very encouraging in the quarter, coming in at a record level of expected annualized contract revenue.\nThis heightened demand is based on the values that our clients place in the strengths of our best-in-class CX platform, and our ability to meet their evolving needs.\nWe continue to take share with strong signings across our strategic verticals, and win new business that has historically not been outsourced.\nEven with our record signings, our pipeline remains strong and growing.\nWe continue to watch the COVID developments daily, and are ready to recalibrate with our clients, as their needs change.\nNow moving to profitability; adjusted operating income for the quarter was $118 million or 10.1%, nearly reaching the year-ago level.\nThe return to double-digit operating margin reflects revenue over performance, with lower variable spend, despite $13 million of additional net COVID-19 cost impacts.\nCash flow from operations in the third quarter totaled approximately $91 million.\nCapital expenditures totaled approximately $37 million.\nWe generated positive free cash flow, despite the impact of prior quarter revenue reductions that reduced our collections in the third quarter.\nCapital expenditures we see trending slightly higher than historical norms to support growth and reconfiguring some of our facilities due to COVID-19.\nTurning to our outlook for the fourth quarter; we remain focused on keeping our staff safe, overdelivering for our clients, so that we remain their partner of choice, and emerging from the pandemic stronger, so that we can drive sequential improvement in both revenue and profitability.\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect more sequential revenue growth than last year, resulting from the strong new business signings in the third quarter, in addition to seasonal increases.\nAs a result, we expect fourth quarter revenue to increase by at least 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and we expect our adjusted operating margin to be above 12.5%.\nWe continue to feel confident in our ability to achieve and exceed industry growth rates, while increasing our adjusted operating margin over time.\nNow turning to our spin from SYNNEX, estimated to be on December 1, we believe that we are ready to go.\nWe intend to announce our Board of Directors in an updated Form 10 Registration Statement in early October.\nWe are very proud, that the Board will reflect the diversity we have in our business.\nAs Marshall indicated, we will have less than approximately two times debt to EBITDA when we separate, giving a strong liquidity and meaningful flexibility to invest in organic and inorganic growth.\nAs always, we have a disciplined approach to both.\nWe believe the spin-off would result in benefits for the shareholders, our team members and our clients.\nA pre spin event will be held for analysts early November, with one-on-one meetings with investors shortly thereafter.\nI look forward to updating you in the coming weeks on the incredible opportunity and our superior ability to lead in the customer experience industry.\nThe effort, resourcefulness and dedication are a tribute to our people, our culture and our diversity that we'll be able to take advantage of, as we enter this new chapter of Concentrix.\nTurning to our fourth quarter outlook.\nOur priority continues to be on the safety and health of our associates.\nFor our business, in general, we see positive signs of continued recovery, as economies open further.\nHowever, we are still cautious, as there are many differences from geo to geo and within geos.\nFor Technology Solutions, we expect an overall seasonal improvement for Q4.\nWe anticipate TS distribution will be up sequentially, partially offset by a decline in TS Hive.\nTS distribution will be driven by continued strength in remote enablement, the federal buying season, improvement in delayed on-premise projects, and overall continued investment in digital transformation.\nWe expect a solid quarter for TS Hive, though we will be comparing to an exceptional Q4 last year.\nAs well, given the unpredictability of this business, we tend to use the low end of internal expectations in our guidance calculations.\nAs Marshall indicated, COVID related expenses declined in Q3 and are expected to decline in Q4.\nAs we stated in our last call, a portion of these costs will be part of our normal TS run rate going forward.\nOver time, we expect to find ways to offset these amounts, while running in the most effective and efficient business possible.\nFor Concentrix, as Chris indicated, we expect to have a seasonally strong Q4.\nOur return to growth, positive cash flow, and a solid pipeline, are among many aspects that I am pleased about, as Concentrix moves toward becoming an independent business.\nI'm also pleased and excited for the independent TS as well, our ongoing opportunities to improve our core operation, the many investments we have in place to organically grow our business, and the opportunities that exist for inorganic investments, give me confidence in our business, and the services we provide to our partners.\nAs well, our goal of growing faster than the market and increasing our profit at a higher rate will continue.\nWe appreciate everything you have done for SYNNEX during this challenging period.\nOur thoughts continue to be with those who have been affected by COVID-19, please stay safe and healthy.\nAs well, we are, with all those who are working for positive change on social issues.\nI appreciate the SYNNEX team members, who have been of service in these and other important areas.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Such statements are based on certain estimates and expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.\nWe encourage you to read the risks described in the company's public filings and reports, which are available on the SEC's or the company's corporate website.\nNow I would like to turn the conference over to Karen Colonias, Simpson's President and Chief Executive Officer.\nI'll begin with a summary of our full-year 2020 results before turning to a discussion on our key fourth quarter performance drivers and initiatives.\nBrian will then walk you through our financials and fiscal 2021 business outlook in greater detail.\nI am extremely proud of our strong financial and operational performance in 2020 which we delivered in a highly challenging operating environment amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur net sales improved 11.6% over 2019 to $1.28 billion, the highest in the company's history, driven by strong sales volume.\nAs a result, we generated record earnings of $4.27 per diluted share, up 43.3% over 2019.\nThese results would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of all our Simpson employees.\nTheir diligence including strict adherence to protocols to help minimize the spread of COVID-19 has enabled us to continue operating our business with minimal disruptions from the pandemic.\nOn behalf of the entire Simpson management team, we applaud them for their tremendous efforts.\nThe health, safety and well-being of all our employees remains our Number 1 priority and we will strive for continuous improvement to ensure Simpson remains a safe and rewarding place to work.\nOur record 2020 results were further supported by our commitment to position Simpson for long-term sustainable and increasingly profitable growth.\nIn October of 2017, we unveiled a three-year 2020 plan with aggressive targets to maximize our operating efficiencies and drive long-term shareholder value.\nSince then, we've made significant progress against our goal, some of which we updated in July of 2019 to reflect changes in the macroeconomic landscape.\nWhile we elected to withdraw these financial targets in April 2020 due to the significant level of uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, we continued to execute based on the same underlying principles, focusing on operating efficiencies and cost savings to guide us through the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAt the same time, we did experience certain tailwinds in our business as a result of the COVID-19 related macroeconomic conditions, namely we had favorable steel prices, temporary reduction in travel and related operating expenses, and an increase in repair and remodel activity.\nDue to the culmination of these factors, we were able to meet or exceed nearly all of our ambitious 2020 plan objectives.\nWe are very proud of these accomplishments and I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing those with you.\nOur first 2020 plan objective was a continued focus on organic growth.\nOur goal was to achieve a compounded annual growth rate in net sales of approximately 8% from 2016 to 2020.\nAs of the year end of 2020, we had well exceeded this target, achieving a compounded annual growth rate over 10% relative to our 2016 baseline.\nMilestones that helped support this goal included price increase for the majority of our US wood connector products in the third quarter of 2018, the signing of one of our largest US homebuilding companies onto our builder program resulting in 23 of the Top 25 US builders now engaged on our program, strong repair and remodel trends associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the return of Lowe's as the home center customer in mid-2020.\nOur second objective involved rationalizing our cost structure to improve companywide profitability.\nWe aimed to reduce our total operating expense as a percent of net sales from 31.3% in 2016 to a range of 26% to 27% by the end of 2020.\nWe tackled this through a combination of zero based budgeting, lowering our indirect procurement costs and other cost reduction measures we took in both Europe and in our concrete business.\nIn addition, specifically in 2020, we experienced solid cost savings from our expense management practices as well as one-time benefits from the reduced travel and trade show costs as a result of the COVID-19 restriction.\nThese factors combined with strong topline growth enabled us to exceed our operating expense target.\nFor the full year of 2020, we recorded operating expenses as a percent of net sales of 25.6%, representing 570 [Phonetic] basis points of improvement compared to 2016.\nOur next plan was to improve our operating income margin to a range of 16% to 17% by the end of 2020.\nWe exceeded this target as our gross margin significantly benefit from lower material costs and limited spending on operating expenses due to the COVID-19 restrictions.\nWe reported an operating income margin of 19.9% for 2020, a 350 basis point improvement compared to 16.4% in 2016.\nAt the consolidated level, our gross margin improvement was supported by enhanced gross margins in our concrete business, another 2020 plan goal.\nFollowing the unveiling of the 2020 plan, we implemented a new concrete strategy in late 2017 by narrowing our concentration to six distinct product categories.\nBy focusing on these higher margin products to increase profitability, we exceeded our goal of improving our global concrete gross margin from 34.7% in 2016 42% in 2020.\nOur final profitability goal was to improve our operating income margin in Europe.\nWe've made substantial progress in Europe over the past few years, including rolling out our fastener lines in the Nordic region and in France, the consolidation of our European management team to create efficiencies as well as significant cost cutting initiatives.\nAs a result, we achieved an operating income margin of 7% excluding our SAP costs of approximately $2.5 million in 2020.\nWhile this is lower than our original target range of 8% to 9%, we are pleased with the results, which reflect approximately 350 basis points of improvement versus the 2016 numbers.\nOur third objective focused on improving our working capital management and overall balance sheet discipline.\nSince the onset of the 2020 plan, we've made headway on this front, primarily through inventory reductions and the implementation of lean principles throughout our operation.\nWe've completed a three-phase SKU reduction program, eliminating upwards of 12,000 non-moving or slow-moving items and converted our customers over to replacement products.\nIn addition, we carried out rapid improvement events at many of our US production facilities, resulting in efficiency enhancements as well as improved management of inventory and purchasing practices.\nAs we move forward, we remain committed to driving continuous cost management and improved efficiencies through our lean initiatives.\nHowever, consistent with our strategy, it is critical that we balance our inventory purchases with our liquidity needs in order to maintain our commitment to product availability standards and an exceptional customer service experience.\nThe final element of our 2020 plan was focused on maximizing shareholder value with the goal of improving our return on invested capital from 10.5% in 2016 to a range of 15% to 16% by the end of 2020.\nThrough our solid operational execution, combined with the enactment of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which lowered our effective income tax rate beginning in 2018, we surpassed this target, ending 2020 with the return on invested capital of 20%.\nBeyond this, we continued to return capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks.\nIn 2020, we returned $116.2 million to our stockholders through the payments of $40 million in dividends and $76.2 million in share repurchases.\nSince the onset of the 2020 plan, we have returned over 83% of our cash generated by operations to our shareholders, far exceeding our target of 50% I'm extremely proud of all that we've accomplished in these past three years and by executing on the 2020 plan, we achieved solid organic growth, we've rationalized our cost structure to improve companywide profitability and we've improved our working capital management and balance sheet position, in turn creating value for all key Simpson stakeholders.\nNow let's turn to a brief information on our fourth quarter results and operating initiatives.\nOur fourth quarter consolidated net sales grew 12% year-over-year to $293.9 million on significantly higher volume.\nGross margin increased to 42.1% from 41.9% in the prior year quarter, primarily related to strength in Europe, where we experienced lower material and warehouse costs.\nOur solid gross margin combined with effective expense management and reduced costs from travel and other restrictions as a result of the COVID-19 drove a 7.8% year-over-year increase in our income from operations to $39.5 million and earnings of $0.68 per diluted share.\nThe increase in sales volume we experienced in the fourth quarter was primarily related to ongoing momentum in the home center distribution channel, which includes both our home centers and co-op customers.\nWe are continuing to experience a shift in consumer behavior toward home renovations as a result of the pandemic.\nSales from home center distribution channels where we see much of our repair and remodel business improved over the prior year period.\nGrowth was supported by our product rollout of our connectors, mechanical anchors and fastener product solutions into all 1737 Lowe stores, which we completed during the fourth quarter.\nAs a reminder, Lowe's returned to Simpson as a home center customer beginning in the second quarter of 2020.\nOur sales were further supported by solid US housing starts, as we generally experience a multiple month lag in the demand from the time of the start, in the fourth quarter, we benefited from strong third quarter 2020 housing starts which grew over 11% year-over-year.\nIn addition, while we typically see lower seasonal sales in the fourth quarter related to holiday closures and winter conditions, in 2020, the fourth quarter, we experienced a very mild winter.\nThis enabled construction activity to continue late into the year, further bolstering our net sales.\nTurning now to Europe.\nSales continued to recover nicely following government-ordered shutdowns to our operations in the United Kingdom and France due to COVID-19 in late March.\nSales were assisted by strong demand trends and our ability to meet our customer needs through our solid inventory management practices.\nWe believe our sales benefited in Europe during the fourth quarter as many of our competitors experienced supply chain issues.\nDuring this time, we were able to offer customers the important products they required to keep up with demand and to maintain job site on schedule.\nI'd also like to note that while the United Kingdom has reimplemented shutdowns due to the most recent COVID-19 surge, we have been deemed an essential business and all of our major production and distribution facilities have remained open and operational with remote work being promoted where possible, such as in our corporate offices.\nIn regards to, [Indecipherable] implementation, the rollout continued to progress despite travel limitations related to COVID-19.\nIn the fourth quarter, we completed the SAP rollout at our UK branch and Gallatin, Tennessee locations, both of which are now live.\nMost recently, we successfully transitioned all of our Canadian-based sales organization over to SAP, thus completing the full SAP rollout in North America, a very important milestone.\nThis year we will continue working on the SAP transition in our European locations and the rest of the world and we currently anticipate a companywide completion in 2022 and we will continue to monitor and update our timeline should circumstances change.\nNow I'd like to briefly touch on our capital allocation structure.\nWe are very grateful to be able to operate as a supplier to other essential businesses with only minimal disruptions due to the pandemic.\nAs our business continues to generate strong cash flow, we remain focused on appropriately balancing our growth and stockholder return priorities.\nWe are also very pleased to be in a position to pay off our line of credit borrowing in pool, as well as declare our quarterly dividend as we have done consistently since 2004.\nWhile the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to impact our broader economy, exiting 2020 we feel confident in the bright future that we believe lies ahead for Simpson.\nWith another quarter of strong year-over-year growth in housing starts, which were up over 11% in the fourth quarter of 2020, we believe housing will continue to be a key element of the economic recovery in the coming years ahead and we are well positioned to capitalize on this environment.\nAt the same time, we continue to pursue our strategy of diversification, positioning our business to be less vulnerable to US housing market through key investments and adjacent products in markets and we also remain focused on growth, including M&A opportunities that would complement our existing product offering, manufacturing footprint or strengthening our software capabilities.\nOur success in achieving the 2020 plan target has created a very strong foundation for Simpson, successfully positioning our company for long-term sustainable and increasingly profitable growth.\nBut now we are ready for our next chapter.\nToday, I'm pleased to announce that on Tuesday, March 23, we plan to host a Virtual Analyst and Investor Day to provide more insight and details surrounding the elements of our business strategy in 2021 and beyond.\nAdditional information about this event will be released in the coming days.\nI'm pleased to discuss our fourth quarter financial results with you today.\nNow turning to our results.\nAs Karen highlighted, our consolidated net sales were strong, increasing 12% to $293.9 million.\nWithin North America segment, net sales increased 9.8% to $249.1 million primarily due to higher sales volumes in our home center distribution channel, which includes our home center and co-op customers.\nSales volumes were supported by the return of Lowe's along with increased repair and remodel activity.\nOur net sales further benefited from other distribution channels, which experienced increased demand from new housing starts and repair and remodel activity.\nIn Europe, net sales increased 24.9% to $41.8 million primarily due to higher sales volumes in local currencies.\nWood construction products represented 85% of total sales compared to 83% and concrete construction products represented 15% of total sales compared to 17% last year.\nConsolidated gross profit increased by 12.4% to $123.7 million, which resulted in a stronger Q4 gross margin of 42.1% compared to last year.\nGross margin increased by 20 basis points, primarily due to lower material and warehouse costs, which were partially offset by higher labor costs.\nOn a segment basis, our gross margin in North America declined to 43.2% compared to 43.9%, while in Europe, gross margin increased to 25.3% compared to 29.9%.\nFrom a product perspective, our fourth quarter gross margin on wood products was 41.8% compared to 40.8% in the prior year quarter and was 39.6% for concrete products compared to 43.7% in the prior year quarter.\nNow turning to our fourth quarter costs and operating expenses.\nResearch and development and engineering expenses increased 10% to $12.9 million primarily due to personnel costs, stock-based compensation, product testing and cash profit sharing expenses.\nSelling expenses decreased 1.2% to $27.8 million due to lower travel and entertainment and advertising and trade show expenses, partly offset by higher personnel costs, cash profit sharing, sales commissions and stock-based compensation expense.\nOn a segment basis, selling expenses in North America were down 2.1% and in Europe, they were mostly flat.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased 10.9% to $43.6 million primarily due to increases in cash profit sharing, stock-based compensation and software subscriptions and licenses.\nTotal operating expenses were $84.3 million dollars, an increase of $5.1 million or approximately 6.5%.\nAs a percentage of net sales, total operating expenses were 28.7%, an improvement of 150 basis points compared to 30.2%.\nOur solid topline performance combined with our stronger Q4 gross margin and diligent management of costs and operating expenses helped drive a 7.8% increase in consolidated income from operations to $39.5 million compared to $36.6 million.\nIn North America, income from operations decreased 1.8% to $36.1 million.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019 North America income from operations included a $5.6 million gain on the sale of a selling and distribution facility.\nIn Europe, income from operations increased 145.8% to $1.3 million primarily due to increased gross profit.\nOn a consolidated basis, our operating income margin of 13.4% decreased by approximately 50 basis points.\nOur effective tax rate increased to 25.6% from 22.3% due to the release of foreign valuation allowances in 2019.\nAccordingly, net income totaled $29.6 million or $0.68 per fully diluted share compared to $28.1 million or $0.63 per fully diluted share.\nNow let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flow.\nOur balance sheet remained healthy with ample liquidity to operate our day-to-day operations.\nAt December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $274.6 million, an increase of $44.4 million compared to December 31, 2019 after paying down the remaining $75 million on our revolving credit facility during the quarter.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the full $300 million on our primary line of credit was available for borrowing.\nOur inventory position of $283.7 million at December 31 increased by $23.6 million from our balance at September 30 as we continue to see higher levels of construction activity along with the unprecedented demand we've experienced through the pandemic.\nWe continue to be highly selective in regard to inventory purchases through careful management and purchasing practices along with maintaining our high level -- high levels of customer service and on-time delivery standards As a result of our improved profitability and effective working capital management, we generated strong cash flow from operations of $77.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $21.1 million or 37.4%.\nFor the full year of 2020, we generated $207.1 million of cash flow from operations, which increased nearly $1.5 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we used approximately $17 million for capital expenditures.\nFor the full year of 2020, capital expenditures were approximately $37.9 million, in line with our reduced expectations as a result of our focus on cash preservation in mid-2020 due to COVID-19.\nWe were also pleased to have paid $40.4 million in dividends in fiscal 2020 including $10.2 million in the fourth quarter.\nIn addition, we repurchased approximately 1.05 million shares of our common stock in 2020 at an average price of $72.33 per share for a total of $76.2 million.\nThis includes approximately 151,000 shares of our common stock that we repurchased during the fourth quarter at an average price of $89.49 per share for a total of $13.5 million.\nAs our authorization for repurchases of common stock expired at year-end, on December 16, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our common stock, which went into effect on January 1, 2021 and runs through December 31, 2021.\nIn addition, on January 22, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share, which will be payable on April 22, 2021 to stockholders of record as of April 1, 2021.\nBased on business trends and conditions as of today, February 8, we are initiating guidance for the full year ending December 31, 2021 as follows.\nOperating margin is estimated to be in the range of 16.5% to 18.5%.\nThe effective tax rate is estimated to be in the range of 25% to 26% including both federal and state income taxes and capital expenditures are estimated to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million including approximately $10 million to $13 million, which will be used for maintenance capex.\nAs of today, the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on general economic conditions remains uncertain.\nIt's important to note that the potential economic impact related to COVID-19 on our operations, raw material costs, consumers, suppliers and vendors may have a material adverse impact on our 2021 financial outlook should conditions materially change from the current environment.\nWe will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our operations, which were not significantly impacted in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nIn summary, despite the COVID-19 related challenges in the marketplace and ongoing uncertainty, we were very pleased with our fourth quarter financial results and operating performance.\nOur industry-leading position, geographic reach and diverse product offerings combined with our strong balance sheet and liquidity position gives us confidence in our ability to maintain operational excellence and support current and future demand trends.\nAs Karen mentioned, we look forward to updating you on our go-forward business strategy in 2021 and beyond during our Virtual Analyst and Investor Day on March 23.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We will be discussing results that were released yesterday after the close.\nTo listen online, please go to the stewart.com website to access the link for this conference call.\nBecause such statements are based on an expectation of future financial operating results and are not statements of fact, actual results may differ materially from those projected.\nIn a minute, David will take you through the details of this quarter's financial results.\nBut before then, I'd like to discuss Stewart's operational evolution to date and the continued execution of our long-term strategy.\ntwo years ago, we started a journey here at Stewart, a journey to become the premier title services company.\nWe knew it would take some time, but we also knew we had a valued brand, strong balance sheet and associates that were ready and willing to have and to make an impact.\nBetween then and now, we have navigated the dramatic impacts of COVID-19 life as well as historic real estate market that continues to have momentum.\nSo where are we on the journey?\nAnd what have been the main areas of focus and progress?\nWe've made significant improvement on our operational capabilities by adding greater scale in priority markets, augmenting our core business with essential real estate technology and services, and injecting new talent and energy into a 125-year-old company.\nAs I like to say, we are a 125-year-old start-up.\nInitial goals of achieving double-digit margin have been met and exceeded, albeit with the help of a very robust market.\nAs David will discuss, Stewart's operating revenues are up almost $240 million or 40% from last year.\nAnd operating income was up over $30 million or 55% in a quarter in which the Mortgage Bankers Association forecasts have purchase originations down 12% year-over-year and overall mortgage originations down 25%.\nSo we feel we are comfortably outperforming the market and creating some real value.\nAt this stage of our journey, we can safely say much has structurally changed and improved, but we have more work to be done.\nThrough acquisitions, we have grown scale in many critical markets where our size once hindered profitability and prevented the efficient managing of daily operations.\nScale and flexibility are critical in a business that is both seasonal and cyclical.\nWe accelerated our restructuring in the midst of heavy transaction volume.\nWe closed offices where we foresaw challenges going forward.\nAnd we entered two markets we believe will be the center of real estate activity in the future.\nOn the topic of talent, we are becoming a destination for some very special talent.\nOn the -- of the top people at Stewart, what we call our senior leadership team, 50% are new or have been promoted.\nOur aggressive entrepreneurial actions have attracted great talent, not just from the title operations but across the real estate services spectrum.\nAnd in real estate technology, given our investment, our commitment and nimbleness, many talented leaders have joined us.\nThis investment and improvement and talent will support our journey for years to come.\nMost importantly, we have become more valuable to our customers by building ease into the customer experience.\nFor our larger lender partners, we have added technology and services that bring greater efficiency and usefulness, both in the current market and as well as a more digitally transformed marketplace.\nFor our smaller customers, they see the value in our ability to make their daily life easier through tools, technology, service and security.\nThe last component being of vital importance is wirefraud has become a critical issue for agents and the very reason we have partnered with Certified.\nI will leave with you a couple of thoughts.\nFirst, while our operational performance has benefited from the historic real estate market we are in, here at Stewart, we are focused on building a business that will thrive through the full real estate cycle and also be able to take advantage of technology and digitization to further transform the closing process.\nWe intensely focus on driving the digital innovation required to deliver a superior closing process today and into the future.\nAnd I am confident our investments have positioned us for the current and future success.\nSecond, while it is critical to build toward a vision of fully automated and digitized closing process in the future for now, at its core, title insurance remains a technology-enabled but execution-driven business, in which the clearing of title removes risk from customers who are ultimately making the largest purchase of their lifetime.\nThis is a very important reality.\nOur journey continues, and we are a quarter closer to our goal.\nAnd David will now update everyone on the results of the quarter.\nAlthough we are entering a seasonally slower real estate period, real estate markets remain strong, driven by demand and favorable interest rates.\nCommercial is showing good recovery, particularly in industrial, energy and multifamily.\nThere are going to continue to be several watch items that could impact future business performance, including Fed and government policy and action, improving yet historically high mortgage delinquency and forbearance, a lingering virus, rising inflation, and slower supply chains.\nConsistent with our strategy and Fred's comments, we continue to focus on the areas that will have the most meaningful and durable impact on our long-term operating performance: gaining scale in attractive direct markets; improving scale and geographic focus on agency and commercial operations; broadening and scaling lender services offerings; and throughout our business, improving service and digital capabilities to provide ease of use and better user experience.\nFor the third quarter of 2021, Stewart yesterday reported net income of $89 million and diluted earnings per share of $3.26 on total operating revenues of $830 million.\nThe adjustments to our third quarter net income were primarily driven by a gain relating to an acquisition contingent liability adjustment.\nCompared to last year, total title revenues for the quarter increased $205 million or 37% due to solid results from our residential agency and commercial operations.\nThe title segment generated pre-tax income of $119 million, which is $37 million higher than last year's quarter as a result of this revenue growth and continued management focus.\nPretax margin for the segment also improved 90 basis points to 15% compared to last year.\nWith respect to our direct title business, residential revenues increased $55 million or 23%, driven by higher purchase transactions and improving scale.\nResidential fee per file was approximately $2,400, a 24% improvement compared to last year's average fee per file due to a higher purchase mix.\nDomestic commercial revenues improved $28 million or 76% due to increased transaction volume and higher average fee per file, which was $15,400 versus $9,700 in last year's quarter.\nTotal international revenues increased $17 million or 49%, primarily due to improved volumes in our Canadian operations.\nTotal opened and closed orders in the third quarter decreased 13% and 3% respectively due to lower refinancing transactions consistent with the market trend.\nHowever, commercial and purchase closed orders increased 11% and 8% respectively compared to the third quarter of 2020.\nIn line with our direct title business, agency operations generated a strong quarter, with revenues improving 42% to $402 million versus $283 million last year.\nThe agency remittance rate for the third quarter was 17.9% compared to 18.2% last year.\nOn a year-to-date basis, it was 17.8% for both '21 and '20.\nOn title losses, total title loss expense increased $2 million or 7% primarily as a result of higher title revenues, partially offset by favorable claims experience.\nAs a percentage of title revenues, the title loss expense in the third quarter was 4% compared to 5% in the prior year quarter.\nIn regard to operating expenses, which consist of employee and other operating costs, total operating expenses increased primarily in relation to higher revenues.\nEmployee costs as a percentage of operating revenues improved to 24% from 26% last year, while other operating expenses increased to 18% from 17% last year primarily due to increased pass-through appraisal and service costs.\nExcluding these costs, our overall other operating expense ratio would have been similar to last year.\nOn other matters, regarding Informative Research, the transaction closed at the end of September.\nAt that point, the company had $85 million in run rate revenues and a 15%-plus pre-tax margin, with new customers to be onboarded and a good pipeline of future business that should grow both the top and bottom line going forward.\nOur financial position remains very strong to support our customers, employees and the real estate market.\nOur total cash and investments on the balance sheet are approximately $585 million over regulatory requirements, and we had about $74 million on our existing line credit facility.\nStockholders' equity attributable to Stewart increased to $1.2 billion at September 30, 2021, with a book value of approximately $45 a share.\nLastly, net cash provided by operations for the third quarter increased to $107 million compared to $91 million from last year's quarter.\nWe remain grateful for and inspired by our customers and associates, advocates for everyone's improved safety and prosperity, and confident in our support of real estate markets.\nSummary: ",

Excluding this noncash charge, earnings per share was down quarter-over-quarter by $0.16, mainly due to lower volumes across the segments.\nLooking at adjusted EBITDA, this came in at $47.8 million in the third quarter of 2020 versus $66.7 million in the third quarter of 2019.\nAdjusted EBITDA from the coke operations decreased $11.8 million compared to the prior year period.\nDomestic sales volumes were approximately 190,000 tons lower than the prior year due to customer turndowns.\nThe volume shortfall was partially offset by lower operating costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA from the Logistics segment decreased by $5.3 million versus third quarter of 2019.\nThe throughput volumes at CMT and the domestic terminals were lower by approximately 1.4 million tons versus the prior year.\nSlide five bridges the third quarter 2019 adjusted EBITDA to the third quarter 2020 adjusted EBITDA.\nAs we discussed on our second quarter conference call, in response to a challenging and unprecedented environment, we partnered with our coke customers to address their near-term coke needs.\nIn exchange for the extension of several coke contracts, we agreed to reduce our coke production in 2020 by approximately 550,000 tons.\nSubstantially all of this reduction will occur in the third and fourth quarters of 2020.\nThis volume decrease contributed to lower adjusted EBITDA from coke operations in the third quarter of 2020 as compared to the prior year.\nStrong cost control partially offset the impact of these lower volumes.\nThe logistics operations were $5.3 million lower quarter-over-quarter due to lower volumes and lower pricing, which was again offset by lower operating costs.\nCorporate expenses in the quarter includes foundry-related research and development costs of approximately $1 million.\nAnd we're also impacted by period-over-period mark-to-market adjustments in deferred compensation, driven by changes in the company's share price.\nSlide six details the Domestic Coke operating performance.\nWe sold 868,000 tons of coke in the quarter.\nSales volumes for all facilities were impacted by the volume relief provided to our customers.\nQ3 2020 adjusted EBITDA per ton was approximately $56 per ton compared to $57 per ton in Q3 of 2019.\nThe decrease in adjusted EBITDA per ton was due to lower sales volume but was largely offset by favorable cost recovery and strong cost management.\nOur plants have been diligent in lowering costs where possible by managing supplies and services, overtime, contractor usage, postponing capital work and various other efforts.\nMoving to slide seven.\nLogistics adjusted EBITDA was $4.3 million in Q3 of 2020 versus $9.6 million in Q3 of 2019.\nCMT contributed $1.7 million to Q3 2020 adjusted EBITDA as compared to $7.4 million in Q3 2019 on comparable volume.\nThe deterioration of adjusted EBITDA at CMT is due largely to lower pricing.\nThe domestic terminals handled approximately 2.2 million tons in Q3 of 2020 versus 3.4 million tons in Q3 of 2019.\nThe lower volumes at domestic logistics terminals were more than offset by the measures taken to reduce costs, including a meaningful workforce reduction.\nMoving on to the next slide.\nYou could see on the chart that our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $86 million.\nIn the quarter, cash flow from operations generated $74.5 million, and we had capex of $16.5 million.\nWe paid down a portion of the revolver borrowing as working capital charges were a source of cash this quarter.\nWe expect working capital to reverse in the fourth quarter as we build coal inventories going into the winter and as we prepare for an increase in production for 2021.\nAdditionally, we paid a $0.06 per share dividend in the quarter, which was a use of cash of $5 million and today, announced the declaration of the third quarter dividend.\nWe established the dividend at a rate that we believe is sustainable even during challenging market conditions.\nAnd while this is a decision made quarterly by our Board of Directors, we believe we have ample liquidity to maintain this dividend.\nAt the end of the quarter, on an LTM basis, our gross leverage was 3.37 times, and our net leverage was 2.98 times.\nWe intend to continue executing on our long-term capital allocation priorities with the primary focus on reducing gross leverage to three times or lower.\nTo that end, we repurchased $7.5 million face value of SXCP notes in the third quarter and an additional $33.2 million here in Q4.\nWrapping up on slide nine.\nAs we continue to operate during these extraordinary times, our first priority continues to be the safety and well-being of our employees and contractors.\nWe will continue to do everything possible to ensure that they are well-positioned, are well-protected and able to perform their jobs with confidence.\nWe remain focused on our core businesses and how to best-optimize our operations, including our logistics assets.\nAs we announced in the previous quarter, we have made significant progress in reducing our cost structure and adding near-term stability by working collaboratively with our customers to address both current market challenges and longer-term supply requirements.\nWe also continue to maintain our asset base to ensure that we are able to operate efficiently in the long term, even as operating levels may fluctuate in the near term.\nWe are proud of the investments we have made, creating the highest quality assets in the industry, which we are committed to fully utilizing and maintaining.\nFinally, we are confident in the revised financial targets we have put forward and our entire organization is focused on achieving these results.\nWith that, we can open up for Q&A.\nSummary: ",

section of the website.\nDuring the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company's performance.\nYou can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call.\nFinally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties.\nThe power of Synchrony's model continued to show through in our third quarter financial results.\nWe continued to reach and serve more partners and customers.\nNew accounts grew 17% to 6.2 million and average active accounts increased 5% to 67.2 million during the period.\nThis is in large part attributable to the powerful combination of our data driven insights, our seamless customer experiences, and our industry-leading product suite, which resonates deeply with customers.\nSynchrony's omnichannel capabilities enable our partners and customers to connect wherever and whenever they want to be met and the variety of financing options and value propositions we offer empowers them with choice.\nAs we continue to anticipate and deliver on the needs of our partners and customers, we drive more value and greater utilization.\nThis translated to an 11% increase in purchase volume per active account during the third quarter and 16% growth in total purchase volume compared to last year.\nOf course, this strength in purchase volume was largely offset by the persistently elevated payment rate trends resulting from government stimulus and industrywide forbearance actions, leading to a 2% increase in loans, including loans held for sale.\nNet interest margin of 15.45% was 165 basis points higher than last year, primarily reflecting the reduction in excess liquidity.\nOperating expenses were down 10% compared to last year and down 7% year-to-date as our cost efficiency initiatives continue as planned.\nWe remain on track to reduce about $210 million from our expense base by year-end even as we continue to invest in our business.\nThe efficiency ratio was 38.7% for the quarter largely flat with last year.\nCredit continued to perform very well.\nNet charge-offs were 2.18% for the third quarter, down 224 basis points from last year.\nNet earnings were $1.1 billion or $2 per diluted share and included a $0.33 benefit from the reserve release related to the reclassification of the Gap portfolio to held for sale.\nTurning to our balance sheet, deposits were down $3 billion or 5% versus last year, reflecting retail deposit rate actions we took to manage our excess liquidity.\nDeposits represented 82% of our funding mix at quarter-end, a slight increase versus last year due to the retirement of debt.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion in capital through share repurchases of $1.3 billion and $124 million in common stock dividends.\nWe also continue to reinvest in our business.\nAs we highlighted during our recent Investor Day, our ability to remain nimble and adapt to the ever-changing consumer finance landscape has been driven by our continued investment in our product suite and our innovative digital capabilities.\nIn fact, if you think about the last decade alone, the introduction of digital wallets, point of sale financing and a greater variety of installment offerings just to name a few has demonstrated the importance of diversity, accessibility, and utility in both products and experience.\nAnd so Synchrony has continuously evolved, adding new financing options, enhancing our technology platform and expanding our channels and distribution networks in order to reach and serve more partners and customers in sustainable ways that drive greater value for all.\nIn addition to launching new products and partner programs, we are remaining focused on innovative ways to get scale distribution of our product suite.\nLast week, we announced our expanded strategic partnership with Fiserv through which small businesses will now be able to access Synchrony products and services and accept private label credit card payments via the Clover point of sale and business management platform from Fiserv.\nThis will enable accelerated growth for small businesses, empowering merchants to attract more customers and generate more revenue by offering our customers greater flexibility and choice in how they make purchases.\nWe will also explore additional opportunities to cross-sell Synchrony products to existing Clover merchants.\nImportantly, this strategic partnership also deepens Synchrony's ecosystem and reinforces our growth strategy to expand and accelerate innovative product offerings through additional distribution channels.\nIt builds on our momentum to bring our products to merchants faster and leverages Synchrony's leadership in financing, analytics and services.\nWe're excited to utilize the point of sale innovations driven by Clover to continue to transform the way people purchase while helping merchants grow.\nFurthermore, as we and our partners' endeavor to provide more comprehensive customer access to financial products and resources, we are excited to expand our partnership with PayPal.\nAs announced in late September, Synchrony will be launching PayPal savings, a new PayPal branded savings account.\nThis unique opportunity will allow us to expand the distribution of our savings product to a unique set of customers with features and functionality inside the PayPal app delivering an enhanced customer experience while also further diversifying our deposit base at an attractively low cost to acquire.\nIn addition to our ongoing efforts to expand both our product suite and distribution network, we also seek to enhance partner and customer engagement through customized value propositions and omnichannel capabilities.\nWe recently launched two industry-first retail health and wellness credit cards.\nThe myWalgreens Mastercard and myWalgreens private label credit card, which reward customers with savings on future health and wellness purchases.\nMyWalgreens credit card holders can earn 10% Walgreens cash rewards on eligible Walgreens branded products and 5% Walgreens cash rewards on other eligible brands and pharmacy purchases.\nmyWalgreens Mastercard holders can also earn 3% Walgreens cash rewards on eligible grocery and health and wellness purchases everywhere else, including healthcare providers and 1% Walgreens cash rewards on eligible purchases anywhere Mastercard credit cards are accepted.\nIn a world where consumers are increasingly responsible for a greater proportion of their health-related costs, we believe these value propositions will drive considerable value while also providing greater financing flexibility for health-related needs and enhancing loyalty over time.\nFurthermore, Synchrony's digital capabilities allow us to seamlessly engage with customers wherever they are.\nWe have deep digital integration across the Walgreens web, mobile, and native app channels with the ability for customers to apply and instantly buy through all of these channels.\nWe've launched frictionless customer experiences, leveraging technology capabilities like QR codes, quick screen [Phonetic], which is a real-time pre-screen of one [Phonetic], customer-initiated pre-qualification, a direct-to-device in-store application process, card servicing integrated seamlessly into the Walgreens app and API integration with the myWalgreens loyalty program.\nAnd while it's still early, the initial data we're seeing indicates that both the value prop and dynamic customer experience we have achieved with Walgreens are resonating very well with card holders in driving spend both inside and outside of Walgreens in categories such as grocery, health and wellness.\nBy empowering our partners and customers with best-in-class wallet optionality and compelling outcomes, Synchrony is increasingly well positioned as the partner of choice.\nWith more than 65 million active accounts, Synchrony has market-leading reach and deep diverse lending insights that enable us to better anticipate the needs of customers and therefore which financing options will optimize utilization and drive lifetime value.\nSo whether it comes in the form of our dual, co-branded and private label credit cards, our various SetPay installment products or our Synchrony Mastercard, we deeply understand when, why and how customers seek financing solutions for their day-to-day purchases.\nWe're particularly excited about the opportunity we see for our Synchrony Mastercard, which allows us to tap into the $500 billion general purpose credit card market.\nWe are taking a measured approach to growth.\nHowever, by leveraging our scale and underwriting expertise, we've been able to identify better performing customer segments, acquire more customers at lower CPAs, and fine tune our channel strategy over the last two years.\nToday, Synchrony Mastercard offers a variety of value propositions, which we use in combination with our pricing strategy to expand our customer reach and optimize conversion and we have great digital utility through dApply and integration in Apple Wallet as well as our mobile app.\nThis allows customers to access their various bank products, their money market and high-yield savings accounts as well as their credit card balances and transaction data.\nThis value proposition and seamless digital experience resonates very well with our customer, leading to purchase volume growth of 36% versus the same period in 2019.\nWe're also seeing higher levels of engagement around the product and brand as spend per active account is up 40% versus 2019.\nSo we're very excited about our Synchrony Mastercard.\nIt's an important offering within our product suite strategy that we believe will enable us to capture a larger portion of customers top of wallet spend and which should [Phonetic] drive highly scalable growth and above average returns to our business over the long-term.\nSynchrony's third quarter financial results reflected broad-based strength across our business, highlighted by a double-digit purchase volume increase and continued loan growth, a significant improvement in our net interest margin, historically low losses and delinquencies, and continued cost discipline.\nThe combination of these results led to $1.1 billion in net earnings or $2 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 4.9% and a return on tangible common equity of 40.1%.\nThese results are a true testament to the power of Synchrony's unique business model, which builds on our deep domain expertise in consumer lending and leverages dynamic digital capabilities a little bit [Phonetic] through our comprehensive multi-product suite to reach and serve deep and diverse universe of partners and customers.\nLooking at our third quarter performance in greater detail, beginning with purchase volume, which grew 16% compared to last year and 16% compared to 2019 excluding Walmart demonstrates clear broad-based strength in consumer demand.\nThis is also reflected in our purchase volume per account, which increased 11% compared to last year.\nDual card and co-branded cards accounted for 40% of the purchase volume in the third quarter and increased 29% from the prior year.\nOn a loan receivable basis, excluding the impact of the reclassification of the Gap portfolio to held for sale, dual and co-branded cards accounted for 24% of the portfolio and increased 4% from the prior year.\nAverage active accounts increased 5% compared to last year and new accounts increased 17% totaling more than 6 million new accounts in the third quarter and over 17.5 million new accounts.\nIn late August, we reached an agreement for the sale of the Gap portfolio, which led to the reclassification of $3.5 billion of loan receivables to held for sale and therefore reduced our ending loan receivables balance.\nExcluding the impact of the reclassification, loan receivables would have increased by 2% versus the prior year as the period's strong purchase volume growth was largely offset by a persistently elevated payment rate.\nPayment rate for the third quarter was approximately 200 basis points higher when compared to the last year.\nInterest and fees on loans increased 2% compared to last year, reflecting similar growth in average loan receivables.\nNet interest income was 6% higher than last year, primarily reflecting a decline in interest expense due to lower benchmark rates.\nRSAs were $1.3 billion in the third quarter and 6.38% of average receivables.\nThe $367 million year-over-year increase primarily reflected the impact of the lower provision for credit losses and continued strong program performance including growth and improvement in net interest income.\nTo put this in context, remember that RSAs are designed to align interest between ourselves and each of our partners.\nThis means driving growth in attractive risk-adjusted returns enhancing program profitability.\nThis allows each partner to share the programs performance, so when profitability expands, our partners participate in that upside.\nNow when you think about the combined $1.4 billion year-over-year improvement in net interest income, net losses and the reserve change, we shared $367 million of that through the RSA.\nFocusing on our credit performance, provision for losses was $25 million.\nIncluded in this quarter's provision was reserve release of $407 million which incorporated our continued strength in credit performance and we're optimistic macroeconomic environment and the impact of reclassifying our Gap portfolio loan receivables to held for sale.\nThis resulted in a reserve reduction of approximately $247 million.\nOther income decreased $37 million, generally reflecting higher loyalty program costs from higher purchase volume during the quarter.\nOther expense decreased $106 million compared to the prior year.\nAs you recall, last year we recognized an $89 million restructuring charge and we continue to see favorability from lower operational losses.\nMoving to Slide 8 and our platform results.\nWe saw a broad-based purchase volume growth across all five platforms, reflecting strong consumer demand.\nOur Home & Auto, Diversified & Value, Digital, and Health & Wellness platforms each experienced double-digit year-over-year growth in purchase volume.\nThe 10% year-over-year increase in Home & Auto was generally driven by strong retailer performance across almost all verticals while purchase volume in Diversified & Value increased 25% reflecting the continued return to in-person retail experiences.\nIn Digital, the 21% increase was due to broad-based growth across our partners coupled with growth in our new programs with Verizon and Venmo.\nIn Health & Wellness, the 10% growth in purchase volume primarily reflected consumers being more comfortable with the environment and undergoing planned procedures.\nMeanwhile, purchase volume grew a more modest 2% in lifestyle reflecting broad-based growth across the platform, but having a tough comparable to last year's strong growth in power sports.\nLoan receivable growth trends by platform generally reflected modest growth rates versus the prior year as higher purchase volume was largely offset by elevated payment rates.\nThe one exception being in our Diversified & Value platform which was impacted by store closures in 2020.\nAverage active account trends ranged on a platform basis up by as much as 10% in Diversified & Value and 7% in Digital while Home & Auto and Health & Wellness average active accounts were generally flat.\nThe active account growth in Diversified & Value largely reflected the return to in-store retail experiences.\nDigital active accounts were up versus prior year due to greater engagement across our existing customer base as well as the impact of recent program launches.\nInterest and fee trends were generally improved across the platform with the exception of Diversified & Value, which was down due to lower receivables.\nI'll move to Slide 9 to discuss net interest income and margin trends.\nThe accumulated savings by consumers resulting from stimulus, forbearance and lower discretionary spending continue to impact the payment rates during the third quarter.\nPayment rates were approximately 260 basis points higher than our five-year historical average.\nThat said, we've begun to see some signs of moderation in certain cohorts as payment rate was about 200 basis points higher year-over-year compared to almost 300 basis points higher year-over-year comparison in the second quarter.\nWe expect the payment rate to gradually normalize as consumer spending remains robust, excess savings have peaked and widespread forbearance dissipates.\nInterest and fees were up approximately 2% in the third quarter reflecting [Phonetic] average loan receivable growth.\nNet interest income increased 6% from last year reflecting the year-over-year improvement in interest and fees as well as lower interest expense for the period.\nThe net interest margin was 15.45% compared to last year's margin of 13.8%, a 165 basis point improvement year-over-year driven by the mix of interest earning assets and favorable interest bearing liabilities costs.\nMore specifically, the mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets increased by 550 basis points from 78.3% to 83.8% driven by lower liquidity held during the quarter.\nThis accounted for 106 basis point increase in our net interest margin.\nInterest bearing liabilities costs were 1.31%, a year-over-year improvement of 59 basis points primarily due to lower benchmark rates and funding mix.\nThis provided a 51 basis point increase in our net interest margin.\nThe loan receivables yield was 19.59%, a year-over-year improvement of 10 basis points.\nThis resulted in an 8 basis point improvement in our net interest margin.\nNext, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 10.\nFirst, let's discuss our delinquency trends where higher payment trends have continued to drive year-over-year improvements.\nOur 30-plus delinquency rate was 2.42% compared to 2.67% last year.\nOur 90 plus delinquency rate was 1.05% compared to 1.24% last year.\nIt should be noted that removing the impact of the Gap program from the third quarters of this year and last year, the 30-plus delinquency metric would have been down about 40 basis points versus 25 basis points and the 90 plus metric would be down about 25 basis points instead of 19 basis points.\nAnd in terms of our portfolio's loss performance, our net charge-off rate was 2.18% compared to 4.42% last year.\nThis year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by strong delinquency trends we've experienced.\nOur allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 11.28%.\nLet's move to Slide 11 and discuss expenses.\nOverall expenses were down $106 million or 10% from last year to $961 million primarily reflecting the impact of the prior year's restructuring charge of $89 million and lower operational losses.\nThe efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 38.7% compared to 39.7% last year.\nThis metric remains elevated relative to our historical average due to lower revenue resulting from the impact of higher payment rate and lower average receivables.\nWe continue to maintain a disciplined focus on cost containment while we make strategic investments in our business to deepen our competitive advantage and drive long-term value for shareholders.\nMoving to Slide 12, given the reduction in loan receivables in 2020 and early 2021 coupled with the strength of our deposit platform, we continue to carry a higher level of liquidity.\nWhile we believe it's prudent to maintain a higher liquidity level during uncertain and volatile periods, we continue to actively manage our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity and optimize our funding profile.\nAs a result of this strategy, there was a shift in our funding mix during the third quarter.\nOur deposits declined by $3.2 billion from last year and our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by $3 billion.\nThis resulted in deposits being 82% of our funding, compared to 80% last year with securitized and unsecured funding each comprising 9% of our funding sources at quarter-end.\nTotal liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was $18.4 billion which equated to 20% of our total assets, down from 28% last year.\nBefore I provide detail on our capital position, it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies, which has two primary benefits.\nFirst, it delays the effect of the CECL transition adjustment for an incremental two years.\nAnd second, it allows for a portion of the current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment.\nWith this framework, we ended the quarter at 17.1% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 130 basis points above last year's level of 15.8%.\nThe Tier 1 capital ratio was 18% in the CECL transition rules compared to 16.7% last year.\nThe total capital ratio increased 120 basis points to 19.3% and the Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased in basis decreased to 26.6% compared to 27.3% last year.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders, which included $1.3 billion in share repurchases and $124 million in common stock dividends.\nOur business generates strong returns and considerable capital resulting from our commitment to drive growth at appropriate risk-adjusted returns, the scalability of our technology platform and our ongoing cost discipline.\nWe will continue to take the opportunistic approach to returning our excess capital to shareholders as our business performance and market conditions allow, subject to our capital plan and any regulatory restrictions.\nWhile there are a number of external variables that are difficult to predict with precision, we generally expect the third quarter's key operating trends to be stable in the fourth quarter.\nUnderpinning our forecast is a stable and improving macroeconomic environment and the pandemic continues to be largely in control.\nWe expect strong consumer demand through the holiday season to support continued strength in purchase volume.\nThis strength, partially offset by continued elevation in payment rates should lead to a modest growth in receivables.\nOur net interest margin will likely be consistent with 3Q '21.\nOur provision for credit losses will continue to reflect the impact of asset growth, credit performance and macroeconomic factors as well as continued reserve reductions related to the Gap portfolio.\nAs credit losses begin to normalize, we expect the RSA as a percent of average loan receivables to begin to moderate.\nLastly, turning to our operating expense, we expect the acceleration in purchase volume to contribute to a slight sequential increase in absolute dollars for the fourth quarter.\nThat said, we continue to expect the full-year operating expenses to be down compared to 2020.\nAs we close out the year and look forward to the future, we're excited about the opportunities we see to continue to drive strong financial results and shareholder value.\nWe are well positioned to execute on the strategy we laid out during our Investor Day and drive sustainable growth and attractive risk-adjusted returns simply by continuing to leverage our inherent core strengths, the breadth and depth of our business model, the scalability of our innovative digital capabilities and customer lifetime value expansion we drive through our diversified product suite and powerful value propositions.\nI'm really proud of the results that we as a team continued to deliver for Synchrony's partners, customers and stakeholders.\nWe have a truly unique understanding of the wide range of needs that our partners and customers seek to address at any given time and our differentiated approach to addressing those needs enables us to deliver solutions and experiences that deeply resonate whether it's through the optionality embedded within our diverse product suite and customized value propositions or the many ways in which we power the connection between our partners and customers, Synchrony continues to reach, engage and serve more customers and drive greater, more sustainable outcomes for our stakeholders.\nWe will now begin the Q&A session.\nSo that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary and one follow-up question.\nIf you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call.\nOperator, please start the Q&A session.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Please visit our website at transdigm.com to obtain a supplemental slide deck and call replay information.\nThe company would also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA, as defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures.\nAs usual, I'll start off with a quick overview of our strategy, a few comments about the quarter, and then Kevin and Mike will expand and give more color.\nTo reiterate, we're unique in the industry in both the consistency of our strategy in good and bad times, as well as our steady focus on intrinsic shareholder value creation through all phases of the aerospace cycle.\nTo summarize, here are some of the reasons why we believe this.\nAbout 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products, and over [ three-quarters ] of our net sales come from products for which we believe we are the sole source provider.\nMost of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which generally have significantly higher margins and over any extended period of time have typically provided relative stability in the downturns.\nWe follow a consistent long-term strategy.\nSpecifically, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content.\nSecond, we utilize a second -- a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology.\nThird, we have a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system closely aligned with our shareholders.\nFourth, we acquire businesses that fit this strategy and where we see a clear path to PE-like returns.\nAnd lastly, our capital structure and allocation of our capital are key parts of our value-creation methodology.\nOur long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market.\nTo do this, we have to stay focused on both the details of value creation, as well as careful allocation of our capital.\nWe see a bit more light at the end of the tunnel but are still in a pretty tough commercial aerospace market environment.\nOn a positive note, we saw another significant sequential increase in quarterly commercial aftermarket bookings in Q2.\nThis is the second quarter in a row with a significant step-up.\nThe stalling of the air travel recovery that concerned us last quarter, though still spotty, looks somewhat better now but may have pushed a ramp-up a quarter or so out.\nThe two most important operating items we have focused on through this downturn were on the things we can, to some degree, control: one, tightly managing our cost, and I think we have this well in hand; second, assuring substantial liquidity, and this also seems well in hand.\nAbsent some large additional dislocation or shutdown, we should come out of this with substantial firepower.\nWe continue to look at possible M&A opportunities and are always attentive to our allocation.\nBoth the M&A and the capital markets are always difficult to predict and especially so in times like these.\nBut in Q2, we acquired the Cobham Aero Connectivity business for an enterprise value of $965 million.\nOn the divestiture front, in the last 60 days, we signed agreements to sell three additional, less proprietary and mostly defense businesses for about $240 million.\nCollectively, these businesses have revenues of roughly $180 million and EBITDA margins in the low 20%.\nWe expect to receive all the proceeds in Q3.\nWe still have one primarily defense business that we are currently considering for sale.\nAt this time, I do not anticipate that we will make any significant dividend or share buybacks for the next three or four quarters or at least until the commercial market show stronger signs of a rebound and our leverage level settles down a bit, but we'll keep watching and see if our view changes over time.\nWe believe we are about as well-positioned as we can be right now, and we'll watch for market developments and react accordingly.\nAnd now let me hand it over to Kevin to review our performance.\nToday, I will first provide my regular review of results by key market and profitability of the business for the quarter.\nI'll also comment on recent acquisition activity and fiscal 2021 outlook.\nDuring our Q2 fiscal 2021 quarter, there continued to be a significant unfavorable impact on our business as a result of the reduced demand for travel due to the pandemic.\nHowever, the commercial aerospace industry has continued to show signs of recovery in recent months with the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine and increasing air traffic, especially in certain domestic markets.\nIn our business, we saw another quarter of sequential improvement in commercial aftermarket revenues with total commercial aftermarket revenues up 12% over Q1.\nAdditionally, I am very pleased that we continue to sequentially expand our EBITDA as defined margin as a result of careful management of our cost structure and focus on our operating strategy in this challenging commercial environment.\nNow we will review our revenue by market category.\nFor the remainder of the call, I will provide color commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the period -- the prior-year period in 2020.\nThat is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods.\nThis market discussion now includes the recent acquisition of Cobham Aero Connectivity and removes the impact of any divestitures completed by the end of Q2.\nIn the commercial market, which typically makes up close to 65% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket.\nOur total commercial OEM market revenue declined approximately 43% in Q2 when compared with Q2 of the prior-year period.\nWe continue to assume the demand for our commercial OEM products will be significantly reduced throughout the remaining half of 2021 due to reductions in OEM production rates and the airlines deferring or canceling new aircraft orders.\nLonger term, the commercial aerospace market is fluid and continues to evolve.\nWe anticipate a depressed commercial OEM end market for some uncertain period of time when compared to pre-COVID levels.\nHowever, recent commentary from Airbus on potential A320 rate ramps in 2022 and beyond are certainly encouraging.\nOn a positive note, Q2 bookings demonstrated strong sequential improvement of over 20% compared to Q1 bookings and solidly outpaced sales.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, the bookings improvement we are seeing is likely an indicator of OEM destocking slowing.\nNow moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion.\nTotal commercial aftermarket revenues declined by approximately 39% in Q2 when compared to prior-year Q2.\nThis quarterly decline was primarily driven by decreased demand in our passenger and interior submarkets.\nHowever, our commercial transport freight market returned to modest growth and slightly offset this decline.\nTo repeat, sequentially, total commercial aftermarket revenues grew approximately 12% in Q2, another encouraging data point.\nCommercial aftermarket bookings were still down this quarter compared to the same prior-year period.\nHowever, the bookings declined less than the observed flight traffic declines with freight and business jet bookings continuing to improve.\nQ2 bookings sequentially improved almost 30% and solidly outpaced sales.\nThis is likely the result of destocking slowing in airlines, increased flight activity and future planning.\nTo touch on a few key points of consideration, global revenue passenger miles are still low though off the bottom and now recovering.\nIATA's most recent forecast expects that calendar-year 2021 revenue passenger miles will be 57% below 2019, but we are cautiously optimistic.\nThere was an uptick in domestic air traffic in March and April, and the airlines are seeing strength in bookings that will drive summer flight schedules.\nCertain airlines have already announced domestic wide-body routes to serve the anticipated demand this summer.\nIATA does forecast a strong second half of calendar 2021 with a rebound in domestic travel in the U.S. back at 2019 levels of revenue passenger miles and China well above that level.\nThere is also potential for international travel openings more as governments consider revising travel restrictions.\nFor cargo demand, this was weaker prior to the COVID-19 crisis as FTKs have declined from the all-time high in 2017.\nHowever, a loss of passenger belly cargo and the pickup in e-commerce has helped cargo operations to recover quicker than commercial travel.\nBusiness jet utilization data has shown that activity in certain regions has rebounded to pre-pandemic or better levels.\nThis is due to personal and leisure travel as opposed to business travel at this time.\nIt remains to be seen if business jet utilization will continue to expand, but current trends are encouraging, We believe there is a global pent-up demand for travel.\nWe see evidence of this demand through the recovery in domestic travel, specifically in the U.S. and China, and the optimism of airlines for the summer season.\nDomestic travel is currently benefiting from international travel restrictions and could offset some lost international travel in the market.\nIn due time, with vaccine distribution and lifting of travel restrictions, passenger demand across the globe will increase.\nHistorically, personal travel has accounted for the largest percentage of revenue passenger miles.\nAnd forecasts still indicate a more meaningful pickup in personal travel in the back half of this calendar year, followed later by business travel, and we are hopeful this will be the case.\nNow let me speak about our defense market, which, traditionally, is at or below 35% of our total revenue.\nThe defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, grew by approximately 8% in Q2 when compared with the prior-year period.\nOur defense order book remains strong, and we continue to expect our defense business to expand throughout the remainder of the year.\nMoving now to profitability.\nI'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA as defined.\nEBITDA as defined of about $519 million for Q2 was down 23% versus prior Q2.\nEBITDA as defined margin in the quarter was approximately 43.5%.\nWe were able to improve our EBITDA as defined margin approaching 100 basis points sequentially despite the acquisition dilution from the recent Cobham acquisition of about 100 basis points as well.\nNext, I will provide a quick update on our recent acquisition.\nThe Cobham acquisition integration is progressing well under the leadership of one of our experienced EVPs, Joel Reiss.\nWe have now owned Cobham a little over four months, and we are pleased with the acquisition thus far.\nWe have split Cobham into two operating unions -- units: Canyon AeroConnect located in Prescott, Arizona; and Chelton Limited, located in Marlow, U.K. Two experienced TransDigm presidents are leading the integration of these two operating units.\nNow moving to our outlook for 2021.\nWe are still not in a position to issue formal fiscal 2021 sales EBITDA as defined in net income guidance at this time.\nWe will look to reinstitute guidance when we have a clearer picture of the future.\nWe, like most aero suppliers, are hopeful that we will realize a more meaningful return of activity in the second half of the calendar year.\nFor now, we are encouraged by the recovery in our commercial OEM and aftermarket bookings in the first half of our fiscal year, along with the improvement we have seen in our commercial aftermarket revenues.\nAs for the defense market and an update to our defense revenue growth comments on the Q4 and Q1 earnings calls previously, we now expect defense revenue growth in the mid-single-digit percent range for fiscal 2021 versus prior year.\nThe previous expectation communicated for fiscal 2021 defense revenue growth was low to mid-single-digit growth.\nAdditionally, given the continued uncertainty in the commercial market channels and consistent with our past commentary, we are not providing an expected dollar range for fiscal 2021 EBITDA as defined.\nWe assume a steady increase in commercial aftermarket revenue going forward and expect full-year fiscal 2021 EBITDA margin roughly in the area of 44%, which could be higher or lower based on the rate of commercial aftermarket recovery.\nThis includes a dilutive effect to our EBITDA margin from Aero -- from the Cobham Aero Connectivity acquisition.\nMike will provide details on other fiscal 2021 financial assumptions and updates.\nLet me conclude by stating that I am pleased with the company's performance in this challenging time for the commercial aerospace industry and with our commitment to driving values for our stakeholders.\nThe commercial aerospace market is -- its recovery is under way, and current trends are encouraging.\nThere is still uncertainty about the pace of the recovery, but the team remains focused on controlling what we can control.\nWe are closely monitoring the ongoing developments in the commercial aerospace industry and ensure that we remain ready to meet the demand as it returns.\nWe look forward to the remaining half of 2021 and expect that our consistent strategy will continue to provide the value you have come to expect from us.\nI'm going to quickly hit on a few additional financial matters for the quarter and then also the full fiscal year.\nFor the quarter, organic growth was negative 20%, driven by the declines in our commercial end markets and despite some healthy defense growth in the quarter.\nOn taxes, our expectation for the full year is unchanged.\nThat is, we still anticipate our GAAP cash and adjusted rates to be in the 18% to 22% range.\nRegarding tax rates out beyond FY '21, we're monitoring potential changes in the U.S. tax code under the new administration, and we'll provide some guidance on our future rate expectations once any legislation is finalized.\nOn interest expense, we now expect the full-year charge to be $1.06 billion, reduced from prior guidance, primarily for the refinancing activity completed this year.\nMoving over to cash and liquidity.\nWe had another quarter of positive free cash flow.\nFree cash flow, which we traditionally define at TransDigm as our EBITDA as defined less cash interest payments, cash capex and cash taxes, was roughly $146 million.\nFor the full fiscal year, we expect to continue running free cash flow positive as we define this metric.\nIn line with our prior November guidance, we still expect this amount to be in the $800 million area, maybe a little better for our fiscal '21.\nWe ended the second quarter with $4.1 billion of cash, down from $4.9 billion at last quarter's end.\nNote that last quarter's $4.9 billion balance was prior to the Cobham acquisition for an enterprise value of $965 million that closed on January 5.\nPro forma for the closing of this acquisition, our Q2 net debt-to-LTM-EBITDA ratio was 8.2 times.\nWith our last pre-COVID quarter now having rolled out of the LTM EBITDA computation, we believe that the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio as of our second quarter end is at or very close to its peak.\nIn subsequent quarters, it should, at worst, remain relatively stable but more likely start to show gradual improvement as our commercial end markets rebound.\nFrom an overall cash liquidity and balance sheet standpoint, we think we remain in good position and well prepared to withstand the currently depressed commercial environment for quite some time.\nLastly, and shifting gears from financial matters, I'd like to provide a quick update on our ongoing U.S. DoD IG audit.\nWe've been actively engaged with the IG office with some ebbs and flows and continue to work through the audit process, and our best assessment and based upon what we see.\nThis ongoing audit appears to be similar in scope to our prior audits.\nWhile it's difficult to know exactly when a final report could be issued publicly, we expect that this might happen sometime during Q3 or Q4 of our fiscal '21.\nSummary:

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Additionally, during this conference call, you will hear management make references to what the estimated positive or negative impacts were as a result of COVID-19 during the second quarter of 2020.\nYou will also hear management make statements regarding intra-quarter business performance during the month of July.\nManagement is providing this commentary to provide the investment community with additional insights concerning trends, and these disclosures may not occur in subsequent quarters.\nIt's a pleasure to speak with you today.\nI'd also like to take a moment to recognize the Teleflex employees around the world.\nThese past few months have been far from normal, and our employees continue to inspire me as they have stepped up in extraordinary ways to ensure that we are able to provide our products to the hospitals, clinicians and patients who need them most.\nNow on to our Q2 results.\nWhen you take into consideration the global escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are quite pleased with our second quarter performance as it significantly exceeded our internal expectations and reflected improvements in underlying monthly revenue trends for the product categories most impacted by the postponement of non-emergent procedures, most notably, Interventional Urology, Interventional Access and Surgical.\nQ2 revenue was $567 million, which was down 12% as compared to the prior year period on a constant currency basis.\nThe decline in revenue is due to the negative impact from COVID-19, which we estimate caused a net negative impact of approximately $130 million or approximately 20%.\nIf we were to normalize for the negative COVID impact, we estimate that we grew our underlying business by approximately 8% on a constant currency basis, or near the high end of our initially provided 2020 full year constant currency revenue growth rate range.\nFrom an earnings per share perspective, like revenue, our adjusted earnings per share of $1.93 in the quarter also significantly exceeded our internal expectations.\nThis reflects the recovery we saw in monthly procedures as we moved through the quarter, coupled with prudent operating expense management.\nLastly, at the end of the second quarter, we also commenced our workforce reduction plan, which will allow us to capitalize on programs designed to drive further long-term profitability.\nThis latest effort is primarily focused on streamlining certain sales and marketing functions within EMEA as well as certain manufacturing operations within our OEM segment.\nTurning to a more detailed review of our second quarter results.\nAs I mentioned, quarter two revenue declined 12% on a constant currency basis and 13.1% on an as-reported basis.\nThe decline in revenue was primarily due to COVID-19, which we estimate had a negative impact of approximately $144 million across several global product categories.\nThis was somewhat offset by approximately $14 million of additional revenue within our vascular access and other product categories, which experienced higher-than-expected demand as a result of COVID-19.\nFrom a margin perspective, we generated adjusted gross and operating margins of 53.9% and 21.8%, respectively.\nThis translated into a year-over-year decline of 380 basis points on the gross margin line and 340 basis points on the operating margin line, as reduced sales volumes and unfavorable revenue mix impacted by COVID were major headwinds.\nThese headwinds were partially offset by our cost containment efforts as we continue to tighten our belts where we deem appropriate in the current environment, balanced with continued investment to sustain our long-term growth aspirations.\nAdjusted earnings per share was $1.93, down 27.4% year-over-year, but well ahead of our internal expectations as the business started to recover during the quarter.\nAnd while I never like to see declines in year-over-year revenue and profitability, I am very pleased with our overall financial performance as it demonstrates the resiliency of the diversified global product portfolio we have built over the past few years.\nNext, I thought it would be helpful to provide some context regarding how we saw COVID-19 impact our second quarter results.\nDuring the second quarter, we estimate that COVID-19 was a headwind to revenue across Interventional Urology, Surgical, Interventional Access, Anesthesia and OEM.\nSomewhat offsetting these headwinds were positive tailwinds within Vascular Access and other, as hospitals continued to have strong demand for those types of products.\nNetting these two impacts, we estimate that COVID was a $130 million headwind or an approximate 20% detractor from our 2Q revenue growth.\nImportantly, we were encouraged that after a difficult April, the key global business units impacted most negatively by COVID improved sequentially as we moved through May and June.\nSpecifically, Interventional Urology year-over-year revenue was down approximately 79% in April.\nIt was down approximately 30% in May and then down approximately 8% in June.\nTurning to Interventional Access.\nYear-over-year revenue declined approximately 30% in April, approximately 28% in May, and then it was down approximately 2% in June.\nAnd finally, our Surgical business experienced year-over-year revenue declines of approximately 34% in April, 31% in May and then approximately 21% in June.\nAs we anticipated and stated on our last earnings conference calls, as various states and countries began to reopen, Interventional Urology led the recovery.\nBut we also saw improving trends within Interventional Access and Surgical as most hospitals have restarted non-emergent procedures in earnest.\nAnd while our business our businesses have not yet to fully return to normal, we are encouraged by our trends into July, which largely reflect further improvement in the business.\nThat said, while we view the latest trends as encouraging signs of a continued global recovery, we remain cautious as select hospital capacity has come under pressure in certain geographies as COVID-19 cases have reemerged.\nAs a result of the uncertainty associated with the scope and duration of COVID-19, we made the decision not to reinstate our 2020 financial guidance at this time.\nLet's now turn to the quarterly results.\nI will begin with a review of our reportable segment revenue.\nThe Americas delivered revenues of $312.5 million in the second quarter, which represents a 16% decline.\nGrowth within the Americas was driven by Vascular Access and respiratory products, which both saw elevated demands driven by COVID.\nHowever, this was more than offset by declines in other product categories.\nWe estimate that the Americas would have grown approximately 8% excluding an estimated 24% impact of COVID on the region.\nImportantly, as we progressed throughout the second quarter, Interventional Urology saw sequential improvement from April to May and then from May into June with a positive momentum largely carried forward into July.\nWhile we are encouraged by this recovery, we are cautious due to the recent outbreaks and reduced non-emergent procedure capacity in states, including Texas and Florida.\nEMEA reported revenues of $131.6 million in the second quarter, representing an 8% decline.\nLike the Americas, growth drivers included vascular and respiratory businesses, which benefited from elevated demand related to COVID-19.\nHowever, like the Americas, growth in these product categories was outweighed by declines elsewhere.\nAdjusting for COVID, we estimate approximately 1% underlying growth for the region.\nRevenues totaled $67.1 million in the second quarter, which represents a decline of 7.8%.\nHowever, we estimate that we would have had a positive constant currency revenue growth in the low double digits consistent with our long-term outlook for the region if not for the impact of COVID-19.\nAnd lastly, our OEM business reported revenues of $55.8 million in the second quarter, or 70 basis points recurring on a constant currency basis.\nAs we anticipated, during the second quarter, our OEM business saw a lagged impact related to COVID relative to our other businesses.\nInvestors familiar with Teleflex will be aware that our OEM business supplies device companies with complex catheters and surgical sutures.\nAnd the 2Q impact reflects reduced orders from these customers whose business is tied to non-emergent procedures.\nExcluding the estimated COVID-19 impact, the business grew roughly 25%, which includes a 16% benefit from HPC.\nAs it relates to the acquisition of HPC, the integration efforts are well under way, and I am very pleased with how the business is performing under our leadership.\nLet's now move to a discussion on our revenues by global product categories.\nConsistent with my prior comments regarding our reportable segments, commentary on global product category growth will also be on a constant currency basis.\nStarting with Vascular Access.\nDue to the growth within both our central venous catheter and EZ-IO products, Q2 revenues increased 8.8% to $164.9 million.\nWe estimate that COVID-19 positively impacted the growth rates of our vascular products during the second quarter by approximately 5%.\nMoving to Interventional Access.\nSecond quarter revenue was $82.6 million, which is lower than the prior year by 20.3%.\nThe decrease was largely due to the delay in the performance of certain non-emergent procedures because of COVID-19.\nWe estimate that underlying growth was in the mid-single digits, adjusting for an approximate 24% COVID-19 headwind.\nQ2 revenues were $64.9 million, which is lower than the prior year by 23%.\nThe revenue decline was due to lower sales of laryngeal masks and regional anesthesia products.\nWe estimate that COVID had an approximate 22% negative impact in the quarter.\nRevenue declined by 28.4% to $67.3 million, driven by lower sales of our ligation portfolio and instruments.\nWe estimate a significant 30% headwind from COVID during 2Q.\nHowever, as we stated earlier, we have seen sequential improvements on a monthly basis since April lows.\nMoving to Interventional Urology.\nQ2 revenue decreased 40.9% to $40.1 million.\nWe estimate an approximate $58 million COVID-19-related headwind during 2Q.\nUnfortunately, the cancellation of elective procedures impacted this product line more than any other in our portfolio.\nThat said, because the UroLift procedure is primarily performed in an outpatient lower acuity setting, we envisioned that UroLift will be one of the first types of procedures that would be performed once the United States began to reopen, and that's exactly what we have seen with sequential improvements from April to May, May to June and from June into July.\nAnd finally, our other category, which consists of our respiratory and urology care products grew 5.4%, totaling $91.4 million.\nIn large part, we estimate the growth during the quarter was due to increased demand for certain humidification and breathing products resulting from COVID-19.\nIf we were to exclude the estimated benefit from COVID-19, we estimate that the other category would have been down slightly as compared to the prior year period.\nThat completes my comments on quarter two revenue performance.\nTurning to some clinical and commercial updates.\nOur body of clinical evidence for UroLift continues to expand during the second quarter with data from two studies presented at the AUA 2020 Virtual Science Event and data from another study published in the Canadian Journal of Urology.\nThe first study presented at the AUA 2020 Virtual Science Event in May was a meta-analysis of patients' sexual function following treatment with the UroLift System versus medical therapy, while the second study was an analysis comparing patient outcomes from the large Real World Retrospective study to those found in the L.I.F.T.\npivotal trial and the P.U.L.S.A.R. urinary retention trial.\nThe results from the first study compared sexual function outcomes of 849 sexually active men who received daily treatments with an alpha blocker, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, either alone or in combination and 190 men from combined clinical studies of the UroLift System at 12, 24, 36 and 48 months.\nResults from the analysis showed that patients treated with the UroLift System experienced significant improvement in ejaculatory function and erectile function at 12 and 24 months post treatment.\nPatients also reported significant improvement in overall sexual satisfaction through 48 months post treatment.\nIn contrast, none of the medical therapies significantly improved patients' erectile or ejaculatory function at any time point and some therapy significantly reduced function.\nAdditionally, the UroLift System significantly outperformed all three medical therapies across all-time points at preserving patient ejaculatory function.\nOnly patients who received UroLift System reported significant improvement in overall satisfaction in sexual life.\nThe second study compared patient outcomes from the large Real World Retrospective study to those found in the L.I.F.T.\npivotal trial and P.U.L.S.A.R. urinary retention trial, which studied catheter-dependent BPH patients.\nResults from analysis showed patients from all groups experienced similar absolute IPSS scores at all-time points following treatment with the UroLift System.\nAnalysis also revealed equivalent safety profiles among non-urinary retention and urinary retention patient groups from the Real World study when compared to corresponding groups in control studies.\nFinally, the results indicated that the majority of retention patients became catheter independent at the end of the study.\nLastly, a study comparing patient experience of those treated with the UroLift System to those who received tissue ablation by a steam injection was published in the Canadian Journal of Urology.\nThe study compared 53 non-retention patients from two U.S. sites.\nEarly postoperative results showed positive differences for patients treated with the UroLift System compared to resume, including better sexual function outcomes, less interference in daily activities and higher patient satisfaction.\nWe continue to extend our body of clinical evidence which should help to get the fast followers on board with UroLift, which is quickly becoming the standard of care as the leading minimally invasive surgery to address a massive global market opportunity.\nTurning to the next slide on key commercial updates.\nWe received FDA clearance for the UroLift advanced tissue control or ATC system.\nThis is an instrument that optimizes UroLift for the treatment of obstructive median lobe.\nWe plan to hold a market acceptance test for this product in late 2020.\nAnd while we estimate that between only 5% and 10% of the market have an obstructive median lobe, this enhancement demonstrates our commitment to invest in R&D to expand our leadership position in BPH.\nIn addition, as we began to see a recovery in the performance of non-emergent procedures as the second quarter progressed, we made the decision to launch our pilot national DTC campaign in early July, building on the success of our regional DTC efforts.\nThe national campaign will run from July to December, and the strategic role of DTC is important, as about half of the 12 million men being treated for BPH believe prescription medications are their only solution.\nOur regional digital DTC efforts indicated strong patient engagement in June, along with positive sentiment from clinicians, both of which gave us confidence in the July launch.\nWhile it's still early, the initial patient response is very strong, with significant increases in call volumes and web traffic spikes to urolift.com versus the weeks prior to launch.\nPhysician feedback has also been very positive.\nIndeed, UroLift is leading the way in BPH, and this is the first time in recent years that a BPH brand is reaching patients directly in a meaningful way.\nAdditionally, we submitted the UroLift two for 510(k) FDA approval at the end of the second quarter.\nAnd lastly, I would like to congratulate the interventional urology team on surpassing 200,000 patients treated with UroLift.\nWhile this is a significant milestone, with DTC in the U.S., approximately 2,700 urologists trained and major market launches scheduled over the next few years, we have only scratched the surface in treating the approximate 100 million men globally estimated to have BPH.\nTurning to some clinical updates within our Interventional business unit.\nWe recently began enrolling for a prospective single-arm IDE study, targeting 150 patients across approximately 15 sites within the U.S. to evaluate the performance of Teleflex coronary guidewires and specialty catheters in chronic total inclusion percutaneous coronary intervention procedures.\nThe study will evaluate the performance of the entire range of Teleflex complex PCI products in chronic occlusive coronary disease, which is the most demanding PCI environment.\nWe view PCI as a high-growth space within the Interventional Cardiology segment, and we will continue to invest in areas that will improve our weighted average market growth rates over time.\nOverall, we continue to invest in clinical and commercial catalysts that will help to sustain our upper single-digit revenue growth aspirations in a normalized environment.\nGiven the previous discussion of the company's revenue performance, I'll begin at the gross profit line.\nFor the quarter, adjusted gross profit was $305.8 million versus $376.6 million in the prior year quarter, or a decrease of approximately 19%.\nAdjusted gross margin totaled 53.9% during the quarter, which is a decrease of 380 basis points versus the prior year period.\nThe decline in gross margin was primarily attributable to COVID-19-related impacts, including unfavorable product mix, lower sales volumes and higher manufacturing costs.\nThe mix impact was significant for the quarter.\nThe adverse revenue impact from COVID-19 tended to skew toward higher gross margin products, including UroLift, Surgical and Interventional Access.\nIn total, we estimate that COVID-19 negatively impacted our adjusted gross profit by approximately $100 million in the quarter.\nBecause of the reduced revenue and gross profit resulting from COVID-19, we continue to look for opportunities to help mitigate the earnings impact while at the same time, maintaining Teleflex's ability to rapidly rebound once non-emergent procedures recover.\nAs such, operating expense reductions tend to be focused on categories that are non-revenue-generating and are discretionary in nature, including savings from meetings, travel and management variable and performance-based compensation.\nAs a result of the efforts, we estimate that operating expenses were reduced in the second quarter by approximately $35 million.\nWhile we expect the actions taken to continue to deliver opex savings through the second half of the year, by far, the largest quarterly benefit will be realized in the second quarter.\nAdjusted operating profit was $123.9 million as compared to $164.7 million in the prior year or a decrease of approximately 25%.\nSecond quarter operating margin was 21.8% or down 340 basis points year-over-year, driven by the gross margin declines and loss of operating leverage, partly offset by the reduction in operating expense.\nFor the quarter, net interest expense totaled $15.5 million, which is a decrease of approximately 24% versus the prior year quarter.\nThe decrease in interest expense primarily reflects reduced interest rates associated with our variable rate debt, partly offset by higher average debt balances in the second quarter of 2020 versus the prior year period.\nDuring the quarter, we took steps to further improve our liquidity by issuing $500 million of 8-year senior notes at 4.25%.\nThe proceeds obtained from the note issuance were used to repay revolver borrowings.\nMoving now to taxes.\nFor the second quarter of 2020, our adjusted tax rate was 15.8% as compared to 13.4% in the prior year period.\nThe year-over-year increase in our adjusted tax rate is primarily due to less benefit from stock-based compensation as compared to the prior year period.\nAt the bottom line, second quarter adjusted earnings per share decreased 27.4% to $1.93.\nIncluded in this result is an estimated adverse impact from COVID-19 of $1.18 as well as a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $0.04.\nNow I'd like to discuss our recently introduced workforce reduction plan.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we committed to a workforce reduction plan, designed to improve the profitability by streamlining certain sales and marketing functions in our EMEA segment and certain manufacturing operations within our OEM segment.\nWe estimate that we will incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges of between $10 million and $13 million, consisting primarily of termination benefits, which will also result in future cash outlays.\nWe expect that most of these charges will be incurred prior to the end of 2020.\nOnce the plans are fully implemented, we project annual pre-tax savings of between $11 million and $13 million, and we expect the savings will begin in 2020.\nI will also provide a summary of all of our ongoing restructuring and cost savings programs.\nIncluding the latest workforce reduction plan, savings across all programs are expected to be between $59 million and $72 million.\nApproximately 1/2 of the savings are expected to be realized in 2020 and 2021 and in the remaining 1/2 over the period 2022 through 2024.\nAs such, we have good line of sight to non-revenue-dependent margin expansion in the foreseeable future.\nThis also adds to our confidence that our prior LRP financial targets of 6% to 7% revenue growth, 60% to 61% gross margin and 30% to 31% operating margin remain the right goals for Teleflex.\nAnd the question is only when, not if we achieve them.\nTurning quickly to select balance sheet and cash flow highlights.\nFor the first half of 2020, cash flow from operations totaled $134 million as compared to $157.3 million in the prior year period or a year-over-year decrease of $23.3 million.\nThe decrease is attributed to a $10 million pension contribution made in the first half of 2020 and was not made in the first half of the prior year and a $54 million increase in first half 2020 contingent consideration payments versus payments made in the first half of 2019.\nOverall, the balance sheet remains in good shape.\nAt the end of the second quarter, our cash balance was $553 million versus $406 million at the end of the first quarter.\nNet leverage at quarter end was approximately 2.6 times, providing comfortable headroom when compared to our covenant, which requires that we stay below 4.5 times.\nLastly, we have no near-term debt maturities of material size.\nBefore closing, I'd like to make you aware of a matter that will be disclosed in our 10-Q filed today.\nIn June, we began producing documents and information responsive to a civil investigation demand received by one of our subsidiaries, NeoTract from the U.S. Department of Justice through the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia seeking documents and information pertaining to communications with and certain rebate programs offered to a single NeoTract customer in relation to the DOJ's investigation of that customer.\nSubsequently, in July, the DOJ advised us that it had opened an investigation under the Civil False Claims Act with respect to NeoTract's operations broadly in addition to the customer investigation.\nWe maintain policies and procedures to promote compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act and other applicable laws and regulations.\nAnd while the company intends to cooperate with the government's investigation and request for information, we will vigorously defend our programs, practices and conduct, which we believe are lawful and in accordance with industry best practices and standards.\nWe cannot, at this time, reasonably predict the duration, scope or the outcome of this matter.\nIn closing, we delivered solid second quarter results as our diversified portfolio helped to dampen the impact COVID had during April, and procedures have started to improve month-over-month in May, June and into July.\nHowever, it remains difficult to predict the shape and duration needed to measure the path to recovery.\nAnd while the next several quarters will have elements of uncertainty, we remain confident that our long-term underlying fundamentals remain solid, and we still see great opportunity over the long-term to serve our key constituents.\nWe, as an organization, will continue to focus on serving the vast majority of hospitals that remain open for procedures while also monitoring closely, those select regions that are temporarily shut down.\nWe continue to adapt our business and opportunistically shift toward a greater emphasis on digital tools, both internally as well as with our customers.\nWe will manage the business prudently, while staying focused to capitalize on long-term potential of our global product portfolio.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:During this conference call, you will hear management make statements regarding intra-quarter business performance.\nManagement is providing this commentary to provide the investment community with additional insights concerning trends, and these disclosures may not occur in subsequent quarters.\nIt's a pleasure to speak with you today.\nFor the third quarter, Teleflex generated double-digit constant currency revenue and 27% adjusted earnings-per-share growth on a year-over-year basis despite a greater-than-expected headwind from increased COVID-19 infections due to the Delta variant.\nAll of our global product families grew on a constant currency basis year-over-year with the exception of our other category due to the divestiture of the respiratory assets to Medline.\nAlthough we encountered a change in macro trends versus expectations at the time of the second quarter, the solid performance for Teleflex during the third quarter of 2021 reflects the diversified nature of our business and the benefits of the company's broad portfolio of medically necessary products and category leadership.\nOur six primary product families and broad global footprint helped offset pressure on product revenues associated with elective surgery that were subject to pauses during the third quarter.\nAs many investors will be aware, there were restrictions on elective surgical procedures in as many as 28 states during the third quarter.\nHowever, as we have seen since the pandemic began, our broad-based portfolio provides a hedge in periods of increased COVID activity with more than 60% of our business, either benefiting from increased COVID-related treatments or remaining relatively insulated from disruptions due to the pandemic.\nAlthough we do not routinely provide intra-quarter commentary, given the larger-than-expected surge in COVID-19 infections from the delta variant, I will share some details for the third quarter.\nRelative to guidance provided at the time of our Q2 earnings report, we saw a greater-than-anticipated pause in elective surgical procedures across select geographies in the U.S., Europe and Asia.\nHowever, as COVID-19 infections trended down, we saw our average daily sales for products most exposed to elective surgical procedures begin to improve as we progressed through September.\nDuring the third quarter, our Americas, EMEA, Asia and OEM segments demonstrated resilience with all regions showing constant currency revenue growth over 2020 despite the headwinds from the delta variant.\nAs I mentioned earlier, this underscores the benefit of our diversified product portfolio.\nFor the third quarter, gross and operating margins exceeded levels achieved in 2020 and 2019 in comparable periods.\nOur continued progress in margin expansion in 2021 has allowed us to increase directed investments toward growth drivers, which is an important component of our long-term strategy to enhance durable growth.\nWe remain cognizant of uncertainty around COVID-19 infections as the weather turns colder in the Northern Hemisphere, new variants and healthcare worker shortages.\nAccordingly, we believe that it is prudent to assume that COVID-19 will remain a headwind and that a broad-based return to elective surgical procedures to normal volumes is unlikely during the fourth quarter.\nWe anticipate these elements to be transitory in nature, and we expect a more normalized environment to be established in 2022.\nGiven our year-to-date results and outlook for the fourth quarter, we are reducing our constant currency revenue growth to a range of 8% to 9% from 8.5% to 9.75% previously.\nThe revision in the constant currency growth outlook is primarily driven by lower growth expectations for products used in elective surgical procedures.\nHowever, given strength in our operating margin performance and improvements in our balance sheet, we are increasing earnings per share guidance to a range of $13.15 to $13.35 versus our previous range of $12.90 to $13.10, implying growth of 23% to 25% year-over-year.\nTurning to a more detailed review of our third quarter results.\nThird quarter revenue was $700.3 million, an increase of 10.3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis.\nThe year-over-year increase reflects the benefit of our diversified portfolio and was driven by contributions from all business segments, offset by the impact of COVID-19 and the divestiture of the respiratory assets to Medline.\nIn comparison to the comparable period in 2019, third quarter revenue increased 5.8% and demonstrated accelerating quarter-over-quarter growth in our Vascular, OEM and Anesthesia businesses, which offset sequential deceleration in areas of the business more exposed to the surge in COVID-19, including Interventional Urology, Interventional and Surgical.\nThird quarter growth and operating margin performance exceeded our expectations reflecting the strength of our diversified portfolio, partially offset by greater-than-anticipated headwinds from COVID-19.\nOur year-to-date margin performance is an encouraging sign for our longer-term profitability objectives.\nThird quarter adjusted earnings per share of $3.51 increased 26.7% year-over-year and exceeded our internal expectations.\nDespite higher-than-anticipated headwinds from COVID-19 on our adjusted earnings per share results in the third quarter, the year-over-year performance reflects growth in our diversified product portfolio, modest price increases, gross margin expansion and better-than-expected operating expense management.\nWe continue to execute on our strategy to deliver durable growth with investment in organic growth opportunities, product innovation, margin expansion and deployment of capital for deleveraging our balance sheet and M&A.\nI am proud of how the team continues to execute in a challenging environment.\nOur third quarter financial performance demonstrates the resilience of our diversified global product portfolio, our targeted investment in growth drivers, including UroLift and MANTA while also reflecting progress toward our longer-term margin aspirations.\nTurning now to a deeper look at revenue results.\nI will begin with a review of our reportable segment revenues.\nAmericas revenues were $417.3 million in the third quarter, which represents 10.9% growth year-over-year.\nContributors to the year-over-year growth were Surgical, Vascular and Interventional, partially offset by the impact of pauses in elective surgical procedures.\nEMEA revenues of $143.9 million increased 3.6% year-over-year with Interventional and Vascular products leading the growth.\nEMEA benefited from a favorable COVID-19-related comparison due to improved procedure volumes year-over-year as countries across the region continued to open up despite disruptions related to COVID-19.\nRevenues were $75 million, increasing 6.3% year-over-year.\nJapan was strong in the third quarter, growing north of 30%, but was partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 in Southeast Asia.\nLet's now move to a discussion of our third quarter revenues by global product category.\nConsistent with my prior comments regarding our reportable segments, commentary on global product category growth will also be on a constant currency basis and ranked by size of our business units.\nAs a reminder, there were no meaningful differences in year-over-year selling days in the third quarter.\nStarting with Vascular Access.\nThird quarter revenue increased 8.5% to $175.5 million.\nOur category leadership in central venous catheters and midlines, along with our novel coated PICC portfolio, continues to position us for dependable growth.\nOur Vascular Access portfolio remains important in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, driving strength in the third quarter due to increased rates of coronavirus infections.\nOur PICC portfolio continues to perform well with 10% growth year-over-year.\nWe continue to invest behind our differentiated PICC portfolio and are taking market share.\nIntraosseous was also solid in the third quarter with growth up 12% year-over-year.\nThird quarter revenue was $104.3 million, up 10.4% year-over-year.\nWe executed well during the third quarter, although increased COVID-19 infections slowed complex PCI and TAVR procedures.\nWe continue to invest behind our interventional portfolio, including complex catheters and MANTA, our large-bore closure device.\nMANTA momentum remains strong, both in the U.S. and in international markets, with over 80% global growth year-over-year in the third quarter.\nGiven the year-to-date performance for MANTA, we are confident in our ability to achieve 8% share in 2021 of the $200 million to $300 million global market opportunity.\nTurning now to Anesthesia.\nThird quarter revenue was $97.1 million, up 26.6% year-over-year.\nProducts from Z-Medica contributed roughly 85% of the growth as the business continues to track to our $60 million to $70 million revenue expectations for 2021, partly offset by lower sales of tracheostomy products.\nIn our Surgical business, revenue was $92.8 million, representing 10.9% growth year-over-year.\nAmong our largest product categories, we witnessed robust growth in sales of our ligation clips and instruments as the elective surgical procedure environment was stronger than in the prior year period, partially offset by the impact of the Delta variant in select geographies.\nUrology, third quarter revenue was $83.1 million, an increase of 1.5% year-over-year and below our expectations at the time of the quarter two conference call.\nThe quarter was impacted by elective surgery cancellations due to state restrictions and ICU capacity limitations as delta variant infections rose sharply in certain regions of the U.S. as well as continued business disruption associated with the pandemic.\nWe are closely monitoring trends in our UroLift business.\nImportantly, our analysis of commercial and Medicare billing claims over the past six months indicates that UroLift has not lost market share to competing minimally invasive treatments for BPH and remains the leading procedure.\nWe continue to see COVID-19 as having the most significant impact on UroLift utilization with physician office staffing shortages also disrupting the business.\nWe see both of these impacts as transitory in nature and expect a more normalized environment in 2022.\nThe preference for UroLift continues to be driven by strong clinical results, with studies showing rapid symptom relief and recovery, no new sustained sexual dysfunction and durable results.\nIndeed, our analysis shows that very few of our experienced users offer other technologies for the treatment of BPH given their confidence in UroLift.\nThe UroLift system remains distinct from other device-based BPH treatments, and we intend to maintain our leading market position in day surgery treatments for this condition.\nWe continue to target patients that are suffering from BPH and have either failed or are not satisfied with drug therapy, a population that is estimated to be 1.5 million men in the United States.\nAs we look toward the fourth quarter of 2021, we are assuming a relatively stable macro environment as compared to our September trends given lingering COVID-19 headwinds for elective surgical procedures.\nWhen taking into account the softer-than-expected UroLift revenues during the third quarter and our recalibration of the fourth quarter, we are reducing our 2021 Interventional Urology revenue growth guidance to 15% to 17% year-over-year.\nWe would anticipate a more normal environment for elective surgical procedures to emerge during 2022.\nWe remain encouraged by the physician engagement as measured by our active users, new physician training, and the ability to perform UroLift procedures in all relevant care settings.\nOur OEM business, which accounts for roughly 9% of total sales increased 29.4% year-over-year to $64.1 million in the third quarter.\nWe continue to see strength in our OEM business as customer ordering normalizes, and we remain well positioned in our markets with customers valuing our design and manufacturing capabilities.\nAnd finally, our other category, which consists of respiratory products that were not included in the divestiture to Medline, manufacturing service agreement revenues and Urology Care products declined by 4.3% to $83.4 million year-over-year.\nThe decline largely reflects the loss of revenue due to the divestiture of the respiratory products, partially offset by manufacturing service agreement revenues and growth in Urology Care.\nWe continue to expect manufacturing service agreement revenues to phase out at the end of 2023.\nThat completes my comments on the third quarter revenue performance.\nTurning to some commercial updates and starting with UroLift.\nIn the third quarter, we trained 124 urologists.\nInterest in UroLift remains strong, and with over 355 doctors trained in the year-to-date, we remain positioned to meet our training target of 450 to 500 urologists in 2021.\nTurning to our consumer marketing efforts.\nWe continue to view direct-to-consumer as a multiyear catalyst for UroLift in the United States.\nWe have continued to fund our DTC campaign to prime the pump for the recovery in elective procedures, and we'll keep investing in the fourth quarter.\nWe recently won a bronze award for best new branded television campaign from DTC perspective, which is a meaningful accomplishment given 13 finalists.\nSearch interest for UroLip remains high and well above other minimally invasive BPH treatments with the majority of urologist surveys continuing to report patients asking for the UroLift System.\nMoving to UroLift 2.\nWe remain on a full rollout in the United States.\nWe've formally launched the product as well as the UroLift ATC to the broad urology community at the AUA meeting in September.\nWe are well positioned to convert the majority of physician customers to UroLift two by the end of 2022, fueled by advantages in tissue compression, reduced storage space and increased manufacturing capacity.\nUroLift two remains an important margin driver as we remain positioned to generate 400 basis points of UroLift gross margin expansion as the revenue base is fully converted.\nRegarding Japan, we continue to make progress toward an upcoming commercial launch for UroLift.\nRecently, the three major Japanese urology societies agreed on guidelines for UroLift usage, which is a positive development.\nAs for reimbursement approval, we remain highly engaged with the MHLW and has been officially notified that UroLift will be reviewed at an expert panel in November.\nAlthough we cannot control the timing of the regulatory pathway, the panel confirmation is an important milestone toward reimbursement in Japan, marking one of the final steps in the process.\nThere is no change to our baseline assumptions that our commercial ramp will begin in 2022.\nJapan remains an important long-term opportunity for UroLift with a $2 billion TAM and we are excited for our upcoming launch.\nWe continue to expect our sales in the region to ramp in a similar fashion to the U.S. in a market that is 1/3 the size.\nAside from Japan, our international regulatory and commercialization efforts for UroLift remain active.\nOn another positive note, we are excited about our initial commercial activity in Brazil.\nAlthough we have been expecting to enter Brazil in late 2022, we have been able to shorten our time line with a limited market release late in the third quarter of 2021.\nWe have made good progress with select key opinion leader training and initial UroLift cases have already been performed in the hospital and office setting.\nAlthough it is early, and the market will take some time to develop, Brazil remains an important geography in our expansion of UroLift outside of the United States, and we are quite encouraged by the early experience.\nOn the U.S. reimbursement front, and as a reminder, CMS published its proposed physician fee schedule for calendar 2022 on July 13, 2021.\nThe proposed rule would negatively impact reimbursement for roughly 600 procedures performed in the doctor's office across a broad range of surgical specialties with a disproportionate hit to device-heavy procedures such as UroLift.\nTeleflex provided a detailed response to CMS during the public comment period regarding our position on the proposed rule.\nWe believe that the changes to the physician fee schedule would limit healthcare access for Medicare patients and shift procedures to more costly sites of service.\nTeleflex, along with numerous other stakeholders, have urged CMS to postpone the implementation of the proposed physician fee schedule until additional analysis can be performed given the unintended consequences of the current proposed route.\nWe anticipate that the final rule will be published in November, consistent with historic timing.\nWe are pleased with the performance of our recently launched Arrow ErgoPack kit, which contributed over $5 million in revenue during the third quarter.\nAmong other improvements, the new kit configuration for our CVC catheters as a nitinol guidewire which is kink-resistant and an enhancement that clinicians find beneficial.\nGiven our leading market share in CVCs, the launch is a trade-up strategy that drives incremental gross profit dollars and helps sustain our dominant market leadership position in CVCs.\nLastly, on our acquisition of Z-Medica, which was completed in December of 2020.\nThe integration of Z-Medica continues to track slightly ahead of our internal milestones, and we are pleased with the progress we are making.\nRegarding potential label expansion opportunities for the hemostat portfolio, we have completed patient enrollment in a 231-patient IDE study, evaluating the performance of QuikClot Control+ hemostatic devices from mild-to-moderate bleeding in cardiac procedures as compared to standard goals.\nWe intend to file a 510(k) for expanded use of QuikClot Control+ following the completion of the study.\nGiven the previous discussion of the company's revenue performance, I'll begin at the gross profit line.\nFor the third quarter, adjusted gross margin totaled 59.5%, a 230 basis point increase versus the prior year period.\nThe year-over-year increase in gross margin was driven by product and regional mix, benefits from cost improvement initiatives, favorable impacts from pricing, M&A and foreign exchange, partly offset by raw material and distribution inflation.\nThird quarter adjusted operating margin was 28.5% or a 340 basis point year-over-year increase, driven by the gross margin improvement as well as disciplined expense management and partially offset by planned investment in the business.\nFor the quarter, net interest expense totaled $11.8 million, a decrease from $16.4 million in the prior year period.\nThe year-over-year decrease in net interest expense reflects savings from the redemption of the 2026 notes and also includes the impact of debt paydown using the proceeds of the respiratory divestiture and operating cash flows.\nOur adjusted tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was 11.3% compared to 7% in the prior year period.\nThe year-over-year increase in our adjusted tax rate is primarily due to a lower benefit from stock-based compensation compared to the prior year period.\nAt the bottom line, third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 26.7% to $3.51.\nIncluded in this result is an estimated favorable impact from foreign exchange of approximately $0.13 per share versus prior year.\nTurning to select balance sheet and cash flow highlights.\nYear-to-date, cash flow from operations totaled $450.5 million compared to $241.5 million in the prior year period and represented a year-over-year increase of $209 million.\nThe increase was primarily attributable to favorable operating results, lower contingent consideration payments, lower payroll and benefit-related payments and proceeds received under the manufacturing supply agreement with Medline.\nMoving to the balance sheet.\nOur financial position remains sound.\nAt the end of the third quarter 2021, our cash balance was $481.2 million versus $375.9 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020.\nAs noted previously, we made a $259 million payment in July against our revolving credit facility, using funds primarily generated from the initial close of the respiratory business divestiture.\nAt the end of the third quarter, we had $342 million drawn on our revolver and net leverage was approximately 2 times.\nNow moving on to our 2021 guidance update.\nWe are adjusting our 2021 constant currency revenue growth guidance to a range of 8% to 9% year-over-year compared to 8.5% to 9.75% previously.\nRealized outlook reflects the benefits of our diversified portfolio, offset by lower UroLift revenues due to the recovery in elective surgical procedures progressing at a slower rate than what our prior 2021 financial guidance had assumed.\nWe continue to assume a 2% tailwind to reported revenue from foreign exchange rates in 2021, which is unchanged from our previous assumption.\nAs a result, we are reducing our as-reported revenue growth guidance to 10% to 11% year-over-year versus 10.5% to 11.75% previously.\nThe updated guidance would equate to a dollar range of between $2.791 billion and $2.186 billion.\nNow for some commentary on our margin outlook.\nWe are lowering the top end of our 2021 adjusted gross margin guidance by 25 basis points to a range of between 59.25% and 59.5%.\nOn a year-over-year basis, we expect gross margin expansion to be driven primarily by a favorable mix of high-margin products, including Interventional Urology, Interventional Access and Surgical as well as from manufacturing productivity improvement programs and benefits from previously announced Footprint restructuring programs, partially offset by inflation.\nRelative to our prior guidance, the revised outlook is associated with lower UroLift revenues and the impact of higher inflation than previously assumed.\nThere is no change to our expectation at Z-Medica, will add approximately 50 basis points to gross margin for 2021.\nOn the topic of inflation, we continue to experience increased cost pressures in raw materials, freight and to a lesser extent, labor.\nAdditionally, at the end of 2020, we had entered into contracts for sea freight lanes in order to lock-in pricing at that time.\nThe majority of those contracts expired at the end of September, with the remainder expiring at the end of the year.\nAs a result of the expiring shipping contracts and increasing inflation, we now estimate that inflationary costs will be roughly $3 million higher in the fourth quarter than what was incurred in the third quarter.\nThis impact is reflected in our revised guidance for gross margins.\nFor adjusted operating margin, we are increasing our 2021 guidance range to 27.5% to 28%, representing an increase of 75 basis points at the low end and 50 basis points at the high end of the range versus prior guidance.\nThe increase in adjusted operating margin reflects the year-to-date performance, partially offset by the lower gross margin outlook.\nMoving down the P&L.\nWe now expect interest expense to be roughly $57 million versus our previous guidance of $60 million to $62 million.\nThe decrease in net interest expense for 2021 largely reflects a reduction in debt, funded by proceeds from the respiratory divestiture and our strong cash flow generation.\nOn taxes, we now expect our adjusted tax rate for 2021 to be roughly 12% to 13% versus the prior range of 13% to 13.5%.\nConsidering all of these elements, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share outlook for 2021 by $0.25 at the high and low end of the range to $13.15 to $13.35, a 23.2% to 25.1% year-over-year increase.\nIn closing, I will highlight our three key takeaways from the quarter.\nFirst, our diversified product portfolio enables Teleflex to deliver double-digit constant currency growth in the third quarter, even with greater-than-expected disruption from COVID-19.\nSecond, we continue to execute on our strategy to drive durable growth across our diversified portfolio with investment in organic growth opportunities, margin expansion and deployment of capital for M&A.\nThird, we raised our earnings per share guidance for 2021, reflecting 23% to 25% earnings growth year-over-year.\nIn closing, we feel good about our overall performance in the quarter, which was anchored by our diversified portfolio of medically necessary products.\nOur balance sheet is in a solid position with leverage at 2 times, providing ample financial flexibility for our capital allocation priorities.\nWe remain confident in our future and our ability to continue to meet commitments to patients, clinicians, communities and shareholders.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm William Prate, Senior Director of Global Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations.\nOur Chief Operating Officer, Dave Huml, is tending to a family matter today and is not able to join the call.\nChris will brief you on our operations and the progress we're making toward our enterprise strategy, then Andy will cover the financials.\nAfter their remarks, we will open the call to questions.\nThese risks and uncertainties are described in today's news release and the documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nWe encourage you to review those documents, particularly our safe harbor statement for a description of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our results.\nAdditionally, on this conference call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures that include or exclude certain items.\nWe hope that you and your loved ones are managing to stay safe through this pandemic.\nAs you may have seen, in September, we celebrated Tennant's 150th anniversary.\nWhile our current operating environment could not be more different than what our founder George Tennant encountered in 1870, the Company has always maintained a tradition of innovation and resilience, demonstrated by our ability to adapt and stay relevant to our customers.\nWhen the pandemic started, we were quick to respond and established three guiding principles; to keep our employees and customer's safe, to manage our costs and cash flow, and to stay in a position to ramp up quickly when markets recover.\nAt the same time we honored our commitment to provide our customers with the innovative solutions they needed to keep their facilities clean and safe.\nWe continued with that approach in the third quarter and saw encouraging signs of recovery across all of our regions.\nOur global teams have worked hard in overcoming the unprecedented sales and operational challenges resulting from the pandemic, and we work closely with our customers, supply chain partners, and carriers to avoid operational disruptions.\nFurthermore, the execution of our Enterprise Strategy yielded improvements in our operating performance with third quarter EBITDA growth, despite a year-over-year COVID-19 related decline in organic sales.\nWhile the pandemic continues to pose considerable macro level uncertainty, especially as some markets see spikes in COVID 19 cases, we have a high level of confidence in our near-term business outlook.\nAs Andy will speak to in a few moments, we are reinitiating our full year guidance for 2020 which not only reflects our revenue and profitability expectations, but also our commitment to investing in our business to support our long-term enterprise strategy.\nThat strategy includes, winning where we have competitive advantage, reducing complexity and building scalable processes, and innovating for profitable growth.\nWhile the global pandemic impact or the economic impact of the pandemic is nothing anyone could have predicted a year ago, it has not diminished our ability to execute on our enterprise strategy because the key elements are all within our control.\nFor example, while innovating for profitable growth might sound like a lofty ideal; for Tennant it represents how we take customer insights and leverage our tremendous engineering capabilities to solve real world problems.\nA recent illustration of this commitment is our October 1st introduction of our new T380AMR, which complements our current robotic offering by providing a smaller-sized machine that enhances maneuverability and navigation to help customers with smaller footprints.\nThis new product and our continued partnership with Brain Corporation enabled us to finalize agreements in the third quarter to provide two national retailers and a separate regional retailer with our full suite of autonomous floor scrubbers.\nAdditionally, we are starting to achieve wins in additional verticals like logistics, education and aviation.\nFollowing our initial roll-out with Walmart earlier this year, wins like these demonstrate how we're continuing to lead with innovation and deliver value to a more diverse customer base.\nIn support of our enterprise strategy, we recently hired Dan Glusick as our Senior Vice President of Operations, reporting directly to our COO, Dave Huml.\nDan has broad enterprise leadership and deep functional expertise across all aspects of manufacturing operations, supply chain management, and enterprise transformation and he brings more than 25 years of Global Operations leadership experience to Tennant.\nDan is an important hire and will play a critical role in the implementation of our Enterprise Strategy as we advance our supply chain and optimize our operations to support our product standardization and local for local initiatives.\nIn short, this is an important area of focus as we position Tennant for success in a post pandemic world.\nLastly, given the improving demand trends that we've seen since May and our confidence in the improved trajectory of our business, we recognize the need for strategic investments to support the continued execution of our strategy, to backfill key leadership roles, and to recognize and retain our best talent.\nThis is core to the guiding principles we outlined at the start of the pandemic.\nWe began making such investments in Q3 and we'll continue to do so in Q4.\nThey are essential to how we can support our customers, emerge strong as markets recover, and continue to drive shareholder value.\nPlease note that in my comments today, any references to earnings per share, both GAAP and non-GAAP, are on a fully diluted basis.\nAs Chris noted, while Tennant's third quarter results reflected the continuing impact of the pandemic, we did see some encouraging trends across all of our regions.\nOverall, for the third quarter of 2020, Tennant reported net sales of $261.9 million, down 6.7% year-over-year.\nOrganic sales, which exclude the impact of currency effects declined 7.1%.\nThis represents the significant improvement in our sales trajectory when compared to the 27% decline we experienced in the second quarter.\nFor the third quarter, we reported net earnings of $11.7 million or $0.63 per share, down from $14.6 million or $0.79 per share in the year ago period.\nAdjusted EPS, which excludes certain non-operational items and amortization, totaled $0.90 compared with $0.85 in the prior year.\nWe'll now take a closer look at our third quarter sales results by geography, which we divide into three regions; The Americas, which includes all of North America and Latin America; EMEA, which covers Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific, which includes China, Japan, Australia and other Asia markets.\nSales in the Americas declined 9.9% year-over-year and were down 8.8% organically.\nDeclines in direct Industrial business sales and distributor sales were partially offset by the continued success of Tennant's AMR platform and strong growth in Brazil.\nSales in EMEA declined 0.3% or down 4.5% organically in the quarter as a result of market weakness across the region.\nThe declines were mainly in the United Kingdom and the Iberian Peninsula, which offset growth we experienced in France and Italy.\nSales in the APAC region declined 0.8%, down 2.3% organically.\nDeclines in Southeast Asia and Korea were partially offset by growth in direct sales in Australia.\nOverall, the Company's service and parts and consumables business trends continued to be a bright spot.\nWhile equipment sales were down approximately 12% year-over-year for the quarter, aftermarket revenue was up 6% over the same period last year, reflecting our efforts in helping customers meet their rapidly evolving cleaning needs during the pandemic.\nAdjusted gross margins during the third quarters of 2020 and 2019 were 40.2% and 40.8% respectively.\nThe year-over-year decrease reflects a number of strategic investments and deleverage on lower volume which were partially offset by cost out actions driven by strategic initiatives.\nTurning to expenses, during the third quarter, our adjusted S&A expenses were 29.8% of net sales compared with 31.2% in the year ago period, mainly as a result of cost containment efforts and adjustments to management incentives.\nThis included a number of strategic investments that we made during the quarter.\nGiven the macroeconomic uncertainties created by the pandemic, careful S&A management continues to be an important part of our response.\nCombining these results, our EBITDA in the third quarter of 2020 was $32.6 million or 12.4% of sales compared with $31.4 million or 11.2% of sales in the third quarter of 2019.\nThe increase as a percent of sales was attributed to adjustments to management incentives and reductions in discretionary spending that were implemented in the quarter.\nAs for our tax rate, in the third quarter, the Company had an adjusted effective tax rate of 11.3% compared to 16.1% in the year ago period.\nThe lower tax rate primarily resulted from an increase in discrete tax items in the quarter and a favorable mix of earnings.\nTurning now to cash flow, capital allocation and balance sheet items.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, Tennant generated $48.9 million in cash flow from operations, primarily driven by business performance and improvements in working capital.\nAlso in the third quarter, we repaid an additional $17 million of debt.\nAs of September 30th, we had $124.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, and approximately $172 million of undrawn funds on our revolver.\nLastly, turning to guidance.\nAs you may recall, in April, we withdrew the full-year guidance we had provided in February due to the uncertain nature of the pandemic.\nWhile there is still uncertainty in the market, we do have a higher level of confidence in our near-term projections and we are reinitiating full-year guidance for 2020.\nAs included in today's earning announcement, our full year 2020 guidance is as follows; Net sales of $995 million to $1,005 million with organic sales declining 12.5% to 11.5%; GAAP earnings of $2.00 to $2.20 per share; adjusted earnings per share of $2.80 to $3.00 per share, which excludes certain non-operational items and amortization expense; adjusted EBITDA in the range of $116 million to $121 million; capital expenditures of approximately $35 million; and an effective tax rate of approximately 17%.\nIt's worth mentioning that our guidance does include approximately $5 million to $8 million of government benefits, which is primarily driven by the wage subsidies we received and mentioned in our second quarter results.\nAlso, and as Chris noted, this guidance incorporates continued investing in our business to support our enterprise strategy.\nAt the same time, while we believe the underlying business performance is improving and we expect our revenue will continue to increase sequentially quarter-over-quarter, it's important to note that organic sales would reflect a difficult year-over-year comparison as Q4 2019 was Tennant's second highest revenue quarter ever.\nAs a result, we are anticipating that our implied fourth quarter organic decline will be greater than the third quarter; and due to the continued strategic investments that I just mentioned, our anticipated EBITDA dollar and percent of revenue will be lower than previous quarters.\nWith that, we will now open the call to questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Additionally, David Bray, group president, poultry; Noelle O'Mara, group president, prepared foods; Shane Miller, group president, fresh meat; and Chris Langholz, group president, international, will join the live Q&A session.\nEarlier today, we announced our first quarter fiscal 2022 results.\nTyson Foods once again delivered strong financial results.\nAt our Investor Day, I shared our plan to grow our top and bottom lines aggressively over the next three years.\nThis meant earnings per share growth of high single digits relative to a 2019 baseline and volume growth ahead of the market.\nOur results this quarter put us firmly on that path.\nWe achieved double-digit sales and earnings growth, both of which were driven by ongoing demand strength, productivity savings, and improving execution across our segments.\nOur diverse protein portfolio, omnichannel capabilities, leading brands, and value-added products contributed to our results.\nStrong performance in our beef segment, earlier-than-expected recovery in prepared foods, and improvement in chicken and pork all supported strong earning results.\nOur retail core business lines, which include our iconic brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and Ball Park maintain their volume share position even as we work through price increases to address inflationary pressure.\nAnd our foodservice Focus 6 product lines grew share year over year in broad-line distribution.\nThis growth was driven in large part by value-added chicken, which outperformed industry recovery and breakfast sausage where we were seeing improved fill rates.\nImportantly, and despite the continued impact of COVID-19, our volumes improved slightly across the company relative to the same quarter last year.\nChicken was a bright spot, where we saw our volumes improved 3.6%.\nWhile this is a good start, we are not where we want to be on volume.\nSo we're taking actions segment by segment to improve our volume performance.\nThese actions include investing in our team members, in additional capacity, and in brands and product innovation.\nAs discussed at Investor Day, we are also in the process of building 12 new plants.\nEach of these is progressing and each will enable Tyson to address capacity constraints and meet the growing global demand for protein.\nBottom line, we're committed to improving our total company volumes during the year.\nWe're also making sure that our pricing incorporates inflationary cost pressures on our business.\nIn the quarter, our cost of goods sold was up 18% relative to the same period last year.\nWe are seeing higher costs across our supply chain, including higher input costs, such as feed and ingredients.\nWe're also managing the higher cost of labor, transportation due to strong demand and limited availability.\nWith these higher costs, we work closely with our customers to achieve a fair value for our products.\nAs a result, our average sales price for the quarter increased 19.6% relative to the same period last year.\nThis helped us capture some of the unrecovered costs due to the timing lag between inflation and price.\nFinally, our balance sheet and overall liquidity position are strong, providing optionality to pursue strategic growth priorities and invest in growth across our portfolio.\nWe have a disciplined approach to deploying capital to support capacity expansion while achieving improved returns on invested capital.\nOur first-quarter results clearly demonstrate that we are making progress on our growth objectives, that we remain focused on outpacing the overall market, improving operating margins, and driving strong returns for our shareholders.\nWhile we're growing our business, we are mindful of our corporate responsibilities around environment, social, and governance goals.\nFor example, we committed to investing in and supporting our communities in rural America and around the world.\nLast year, Tyson Foods donated more than 16 million pounds of protein, the equivalent of 64 million meals to fight hunger.\nWe're incredibly proud of this work and the people that make it possible.\nTyson is a great company with a great team doing great things, and I'm pleased that this was recognized just last week by Fortune Magazine, who announced that for the sixth year in a row, Tyson Foods was No.\n1 in our sector in their rankings of the world's most admired companies.\nNow let's look at a few financial highlights from the first quarter.\nOur results included double-digit top and bottom-line growth.\nWe delivered solid operating income performance, up 40% for the quarter.\nThis performance was broad-based across segments where continued strong consumer demand and effective pricing to mitigate the impact of inflation drove higher earnings.\nOn volume, we are up slightly.\nAnd while we're working to achieve optimal throughput across our segments, labor challenges are still impacting our volumes and the ability to achieve optimal mix across our network.\nCompared to pre-pandemic levels, our volume performance is outpacing our peer set.\nIn retail, despite substantial market pressures, core business lines held share in the first quarter, led by strong performance in lunch meat, hotdogs, snacking, and bacon.\nWe also realized strong e-commerce results with Tyson Foods outpacing total food and beverage growth in our core lines gaining share in the quarter.\nStill, customer demand continues to outpace our ability to supply products.\nSo we have targeted actions in each segment to improve volumes.\nThis is key to delivering on our commitments.\nTo realize our volume goals, we must be able to fully staff our plants across the company.\nWe continue to take meaningful action toward becoming the most sought-after place to work.\nFor example, we provided our hourly team members with more than $50 million in bonuses during the first quarter.\nWe are piloting subsidized and on-site child care and we are adjusting schedules to flex with workforce needs.\nThese actions are bearing fruit as we see some improvement on the labor front.\nAnd while we have seen some labor challenges during the omicron surge, we are generally seeing lower turnover in absenteeism.\nWe saw chicken volumes grow 3.6% in the quarter, driven by strong fundamental demand and improved live production.\nWhat is important to note is that we grew ahead of the market and gained market share.\nIn prepared foods, volumes were down 2.6% in the first quarter.\nAbout half of the decline was related to pet treats divestiture.\nWe expect to sequentially improve these results over the remainder of fiscal year '22 as we take actions to expand and improve capacity utilization.\nIn beef, volumes were down 6.2%, driven by labor shortages previously mentioned.\nIn addition, port congestion has also dipped in export volumes in the segment.\nWe expect these headwinds on volume to normalize over the course of fiscal 2022.\nIn pork, we have sequentially improved our capacity utilization.\nWe are still working to optimize the mix.\nIn international/other, while we are starting from a relatively small base, our investment in capacity, innovation, and brands are supporting our market share growth objective.\nOverall, we expect to grow our total company volumes by 2% to 3% in FY '22, outpacing protein consumption growth.\nChicken remains a top priority and we continue to execute against our road map to achieve an operating income margin of 5% to 7% on a run-rate basis by mid-fiscal '22.\nI remain confident we will meet this goal.\nIn the first quarter, we've started to see profitability improvement resulting from our actions.\nFor example, we're investing aggressively in automation and technology to help us address some of the most hard-to-fill roles.\nThis is not a series of projects but is a well-planned program with automation designed to use common designs and equipment across our plants to optimize cost, maintenance, and asset utilization.\nThe second imperative is to improve operational performance and critical to improving performance is maximizing our fixed cost leverage, which means having enough furs to run our plants full.\nSince September, we've seen an improvement in our hatch rate ahead of our expectations.\nWe continue to expect full recovery in this year.\nWe were pleased with our volume growth in the quarter and expect further improvements as we grow our harvest capacity utilization from an average of 37 million head per week in FY '21 to 40 million head per week by year end.\nWe've noted previously that strength in spot prices for commodity chicken products put our buy versus grow program at a relative disadvantage.\nWe have reduced our reliance on outside meat accordingly.\nWe will staff our plants, service our customers, grow our volumes and be the best in the business.\nThe plan we have continues to be the right plan and our commitment to winning with our team members, winning with our customers and consumers, and winning with operational excellence is delivering results.\nLast year, we announced the launch of a new productivity program designed to drive a better, faster, more agile organization that is supported by a culture of continuous improvement and faster decision-making.\nThe program aims to deliver $1 billion in recurring productivity savings by the end of fiscal '24 relative to a fiscal 2021 cost baseline and has three critical focus areas, which are operational and functional excellence, digital solutions, and automation.\nWe're making some good progress on this front.\nI spoke just a minute ago about our investments in automation, but we've also attacked other issues.\nIn Prepared Foods, we're making use of supply chain, digitization, and advanced analytics.\nOur digital manufacturing platform allows us to analyze real-time data to take actions to optimize process conditions that drive better yields, lower costs, consistent quality, and increased output.\nIn transportation and logistics, we have established ongoing optimization of the mix and allocation of our private fleet, dedicated fleet, and third-party fleet, mitigating inflationary pressures and supporting better on-time deliveries to our customers.\nIn addition, we continued the expansion of our direct shipment program, reducing miles driven, and product touches in our supply chain.\nAs a result of projects like these, we're on track to deliver $300 million to $400 million of savings in fiscal 2022.\nWe shared at our Investor Day that we are taking actions to accelerate our growth and drive disciplined return on invested capital.\nThe five imperatives on this slide show how we will achieve our commitments and drive value creation.\nThis starts first with our commitment to our team members with a focus on ensuring their health, safety, and well-being as well as ensuring an inclusive and equitable work environment.\nWe are proud of our COVID-19 vaccine policy implemented last year in the U.S. and of the broader investments that we have made to keep our team members, their families, and our communities safe.\nBecause of our policy, our team members are better protected and the cases we do see have been mild or asymptomatic, resulting in an extremely low number of hospitalizations.\nWe are strongly encouraging boosters and are hosting clinics to make it easier for our team members and their families to get boosted.\nSecond, we are working to enhance our portfolio and capacity to better address demand.\nThis includes increasing the contribution of branded and value-added sales.\nAs a result, we expect our volume to outpace this growing market.\nThird, we are aggressively restoring competitiveness in our chicken segment.\nThis starts by returning our operating margin to the 5% to 7% level by the middle of fiscal 2022.\nFourth, we're driving operational and functional excellence and investing in digital and automation initiatives.\nThis is at the heart of our new productivity program.\nWe're working diligently to drive out waste, minimize bureaucracy and enhance decision-making speed across the organization.\nFifth, to address projected demand growth over the next decade, we are using our financial strength to invest in our business.\nOn capital alone, we're expected to invest $2 billion in fiscal year '22 with a disproportionate share focused on new capacity and automation objectives.\nAnd we continue to return cash to shareholders.\nDuring the quarter, we returned over $500 million in dividends and share repurchases.\nTo wrap it up, we are committed to winning with our team members, customers, and consumers as well as winning with operational excellence.\nI'm more excited about the future of Tyson Foods with each passing day.\nLet me turn first to a summary of our total company financial results.\nWe're pleased to report a strong overall start to the year.\nOur sales were up approximately 24% in the first quarter, largely a function of our pricing initiatives to offset inflationary pressures.\nVolumes were also up slightly, although impacted by continued labor challenges.\nLooking at our sales results by channel, retail drove almost $350 million of top-line improvements versus last year.\nImprovements in sales through the foodservice channel drove an increase of $1 billion and our export sales were nearly $333 million stronger than the prior-year period as we leveraged our global scale to grow our business.\nFirst-quarter operating income of $1.4 billion was up 40% relative to the same quarter last year due to increased earnings in beef, pork, and chicken.\nDriven by the strength in operating income, first-quarter earnings per share grew 48% to $2.87.\nHigher operating income led to higher adjusted earnings per share compared to the same period last year.\nAnd first-quarter earnings per share also benefited from lower net interest expense and taxes.\nSlide 10 bridges year-to-date operating income, which was $407 million higher than fiscal 2021.\nVolumes were up slightly during the year, primarily a result of improvement in chicken, pork, and international/other, offset by declines in beef and prepared foods.\nDeclines in beef and prepared foods were largely due to continued labor challenges in those segments.\nOur pricing actions led to approximately $2.1 billion in sales and price/mix benefits during the quarter.\nwhich offset the higher cost of goods sold of $1.6 billion.\nWe saw continued inflation across the business, in some instances, up 20% to 30%.\nNotable examples were labor, grain costs, live cattle and hog costs, and freight costs.\nAnd finally, SG&A was $88 million unfavorable to the same period last year, which was largely a result of cycling a $55 million benefit recorded last year for the recovery of cattle.\nMoving to the beef segment.\nSegment sales were more than $5 billion for the quarter, up 25% versus the same period last year.\nSales growth was driven by continued strong demand for beef products, which has supported higher average sales price.\nPartially offsetting higher sales prices were higher capital costs during the first quarter versus the comparable prior-year period.\nWe had sufficient livestock available in the quarter driven by strong front-end supplies.\nWe have good visibility into cattle availability through fiscal year 2022 and continue to expect it will also be sufficient to support our customer needs.\nWe delivered segment operating income of $956 million, up 81% versus the prior comparable period.\nThis improvement was driven by strong global demand for beef products and a higher cutout, which were partially offset by higher operating costs.\nOur operating margin of 19.1% was notably higher than the same quarter last year but was down on a sequential basis versus the last two quarters as cost increases led to a narrowing of the spread.\nNow let's move on to the pork segment on Slide 12.\nSegment sales were over $1.6 billion for the quarter, up 13% versus the same period last year.\nKey sales drivers for the segment included higher average sales price due to strong demand and increased hog costs, partially offset by a challenging labor environment.\nAverage sales price increased 12.8% and volumes were slightly higher relative to the same period last year.\nSegment operating income was $164 million for the quarter, up 41% versus the comparable period.\nOverall, operating margins for the segment improved to 10.1% for the quarter.\nThe operating income improvement was driven by higher spreads in the business.\nMoving now to prepared foods.\nSales were $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 10% relative to the same period last year.\nTotal volume was down in the quarter with strength in the retail channel and continued recovery in foodservice more than offset by labor and supply chain challenges.\nSales growth outpaced volume growth driven by inflation-justified pricing.\nDuring the quarter, retail core business mines maintained share, driven by consumer demand for our brands and continued strong execution by our team.\nOperating margins for the segment were 8% or $186 million for the first quarter.\nThe decline in segment operating margins versus the same quarter last year was driven by significant increases in raw material and other input costs that we were not able to fully recover through price during the quarter.\nRaw material costs, logistics, ingredients, packaging, and labor have increased our cost of production.\nOur pricing lagged inflation, but we expect to recover cost increases during fiscal 2022.\nIn addition to pricing, we've executed productivity, revenue management, and commercial spend optimization initiatives while ensuring the continued development of brand equity through marketing and trade support.\nMoving into the chicken segment's results.\nSales were $3.9 billion for the quarter, up 37%.\nVolumes improved 3.6% in the quarter due to strong consumer demand and increased life production.\nOur teams have been focused on streamlining our plants to deliver higher volumes and we expect to deliver substantial volume improvements in fiscal 2022 as hatch recovers, and we continue to look for ways to operate our plant more efficiently.\nAverage sales price improved around 20% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year.\nThis increase is due to favorable product mix and price recovery to offset cost inflation.\nOn pricing, we made tremendous progress toward driving our pricing mechanisms toward more variable structures and are now seeing those benefits.\nWe restructured our pricing strategies given our experience in fiscal 2021 to ensure that we have the flexibility to better respond to market and inflationary conditions.\nChicken delivered adjusted operating income of $117 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, representing an operating margin of 3%.\nOperating income in the quarter was negatively impacted by $185 million of higher feed ingredient costs.\nNow turning to Slide 15.\nAs part of our capital allocation approach, we focused on building financial strength, investing in our business, and returning cash to shareholders.\nIn pursuit of our priority to build financial strength and flexibility, we used improved earnings to retire debt in fiscal year 2021 and expect to do the same this year.\nContinued strength in our earnings this quarter have further improved our leverage ratio to 1.1 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA.\nInvesting in our business for both organic and inorganic growth will continue to be an important priority and will help Tyson increase production capacity and market capabilities.\nThis will support strong return generation for our shareholders.\nFinally, as our track record has demonstrated, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders through both dividends and share buybacks.\nWe finished the quarter with a powerful balance sheet and continued capital allocation optionality.\nLet's now discuss the fiscal '22 financial outlook.\nWe are maintaining our total company sales guidance of $49 billion to $51 billion, although we expect to perform at the upper end of the range.\nIn support of our sales growth, we still expect a 2% to 3% volume growth on a year-over-year basis as we work to optimize our existing footprint and run our plants full.\nLooking at AOI margin target ranges for our segments, in chicken, our operational turnaround is working and we still expect to achieve a run rate profitability of 5% to 7% by the middle of the year.\nWe expect full-year margins that also fall between 5% to 7%.\nPrepared foods is expected to deliver margins during fiscal '22 of between 7% and 9%.\nBased on our first-quarter performance, we now expect the full-year margin performance in prepared foods to be at the upper end of the range.\nIn beef, we are maintaining our AOI margin at 9% to 11%, but we expect to perform at the upper end of the range.\nAlso, we expect the front half of the year to be meaningfully stronger than the back half as industry and labor conditions are expected to normalize partway through the year.\nIn Pork, we expect similar performance during fiscal '22 to what we accomplished during fiscal '21, equating to a margin of between 5% and 7%.\nAs is normal seasonality for pork, we expect the first quarter to be the strongest.\nIn international/other, we expect margins of 2% to 3% as capacity expansions and strong global demand support volume growth and improved profitability.\nConsistent with our expectation for a meaningful increase in capex spending to pursue a healthy pipeline of projects with strong return profiles, we anticipate capex spending of approximately $2 billion during fiscal 2022.\nWe now expect lower net interest expense due to lower anticipated average debt balances during the fiscal year.\nOur expectations for productivity savings and tax rate changes remain unchanged.\nOur net leverage is expected to remain well below two times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, providing optionality for inorganic investment and additional return of cash to shareholders over the course of the year.\nIn summary, we've had a strong start to the fiscal year.\nWe have a great team, growing demand for our products, strong portfolio diversity, and the differentiated asset footprint needed to win in the marketplace.\nWe set out ambitious calls at our Investor Day, and we expect to achieve them.\nOperator, please provide the Q&A instruction.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'll start by acknowledging the sad and disturbing recent events in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area and across the nation that began with the horrific death of one of our community members George Floyd.\nOur hearts go out to the family and friends of Mr. Floyd and the communities directly affected.\nRegrettably, these events are representative of larger social and systemic issues.\nAs our communities work together through these tragic circumstances, we must stand for what is right.\nThe Toro Company has a long-standing focus on the importance of respect for all in our workplaces, in how we conduct business, and in the communities we serve.\nIn addition to the events of the past week, we all continue to deal with the effects of COVID-19.\nWe hope all of you and your families are safe during this difficult time.\nIt was humbling to see how so many people and organizations moved forward without hesitation to do what was needed to help others as the COVID-19 pandemic spread around the world.\nIn response to the coronavirus, we prioritized the safety, well-being and support of our employees, customers and communities.\nIn addition to our value of respect for all as previously mentioned, some of our other core people values include carrying relationships, trust and integrity.\nEven through significant personal and family challenges, our team has transformed the way we work to protect the safety of one another, support our customers, and help our communities.\nI am deeply grateful for all of our employees around the world, many who are coming into our facilities each day, to develop, test, build and ship our products.\nThe team's flexibility, resourcefulness and resolve is being demonstrated as we've acted to make our facilities safe and implement work-from-home policies.\nAt the same time, we are maintaining the critical functions of our manufacturing operations.\nAll of this is vital, given The Toro Company's standing as an essential business.\nIn support of our communities, we launched a special COVID-19 giving initiative called Together We Can Do More.\nThrough this initiative, we directly donate and match all employee contributions made to COVID-19 relief efforts.\nIn addition, The Toro Foundation contributed $500,000 to organizations supporting families and communities most directly affected by the pandemic.\nRecognizing the financial strain among our employees and their families, we expanded the availability of the Melrose/Hoffman Employee Critical Need Fund.\nAdditional voluntary contributions were made to that fund by our leadership team and the Board of Directors.\nTo quote our legendary former Chairman and CEO, Ken Melrose who sadly passed away last month, everyone has the potential to contribute to achieving the goals of the company.\nIf you unleash that potential, success will be a natural byproduct.\nThese words mean a lot coming from Ken who successfully led The Toro Company through some of the most challenging times in our history.\nI will turn now to our business and financial review.\nFrom a business perspective, our focus has been on maintaining ample liquidity, growing our position in the market, and balancing short and long-term objectives.\nOur results this quarter were net sales sales of $929 million, down 3.4% from the prior year, primarily due to reduced Professional segment retail demand as a result of COVID-19.\nWe reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.92, down 21.4% from the prior year.\nTo provide specific information by business segments, in the Professional segment, total net sales were $661 million, down 8.6%.\nSales benefited from incremental contributions from the Charles Machine Works and Venture Products acquisitions.\nThis quarter, we passed the one-year anniversary of the Charles Machine Works acquisition.\nWe are fortunate to have this business and its employees as part of our company.\nCharles Machine Works added scale and diversification to our portfolio, open access to new markets and provided additional opportunities for synergy and value creation across the company.\nWe are on track to achieve or exceed our stated synergy targets.\nOffsetting the gains from acquisitions were declines in most of our Professional businesses as a result of soft retail demand due to COVID-19.\nThe declines were most pronounced in commercial golf and grounds which saw fewer shipments of turf equipment and irrigation products.\nThis was driven by budget deferrals at golf course and municipalities, landscape contractor businesses which had fewer shipments as our channel partners aligned field inventory levels which reduced retail demand and rental specialty and underground construction businesses which have experienced reduced sales volumes as a result of global economic slowdown and impact on the construction and oil and gas markets.\nIt's important to note the Professional segment performance was tracking consistent with our expectations of modest growth until mid-March.\nIn April, we experienced additional and significant declines in most of our Professional markets.\nWe typically do not discuss the current quarter in our earnings calls.\nHowever, we appreciate that this quarter is very different.\nSo, we'll share some color on what happened in May.\nFor the Professional segment, it was largely a story of new equipment purchase deferrals and focus on service and repair.\nWe're seeing continued challenges across golf and grounds, landscape contractor, and rental specialty and underground construction businesses.\nThese challenges stem more from lower budgets and deferred purchases than from temporary facility closures.\nFor golf, most play has resumed and demand for rounds has been robust.\nHowever, lower food and beverage and event revenue has negatively affected club budgets, putting pressure on new equipment purchases.\nFor our municipal grounds customers, budgets have been lowered or diverted to non-ground support which has resulted in reduced equipment demand.\nThe repair and defer story is the same with landscape contractors.\nHowever, with the lessening of stay-at-home restrictions, there were some improvements in these categories starting in late May.\nIn rental, specialty and underground construction, 5G infrastructure and broadband spending increased modestly in May with high demand for system capacity as a result of stay-at-home orders.\nUnderground infrastructure, rehab and repair projects remained steady.\nHowever, this is being offset by continued construction and oil and gas project softness, reduced capital spending from national rental accounts resulting in new equipment purchase deferrals and lower dealer retail.\nIn the Residential segment, sales were up 12.9% in the second quarter.\nThis was mainly driven by incremental shipments to our expanded mass retail channel and strong retail demand.\nSome of the demand drivers were favorable spring weather, new products and consumers focusing on home and garden improvements during stay-at-home orders.\nOur product sales through captive and partnered e-commerce sites were up significantly in the second quarter.\nFor May, Residential segment momentum continued, driven by the same trends.\nRegarding operations, all of our facilities are currently open with some operating at reduced capacity.\nDuring the second quarter, some sites closed temporarily due to government orders or to manage inventory levels.\nWe will continue to align production to customer demand, comply with government orders and ensure the safety of our teams.\nWe had no supplier-related shutdowns in the quarter.\nRegarding cash and financial flexibility, we continue to have a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity.\nWe took measures in the quarter to ensure that we have sufficient cash given the economic climate.\nFor the remainder of fiscal 2020, we are taking, across the board, pay cuts inclusive of leadership and eliminating merit increases and discretionary retirement plan contributions.\nWe also reduced expenses and paused new hires except for critical positions.\nAt the same time, we have preserved jobs and retained key talent.\nWe continue to benefit from productivity initiatives and enterprise synergy opportunities as a result of recent acquisitions.\nAs with past periods of economic challenge, we know what works and how to play to our strengths.\nOur culture and business management approach are well adapted to respond to uncontrolled external variables.\nWhile certain factors do lie out of our control, our diverse portfolio and flexibility, help us adjust to shifting situations, while continuing to provide long-term growth and sustained free cash flow.\nWe will continue to invest in the future for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.\nThe Toro Company is comprised of a balanced portfolio of products that enhance our customers' productivity across the seasons.\nThe company has a strong balance sheet that enables us to allocate capital effectively among a variety of alternatives, including new product development, acquisitions, dividends, debt pay down and share repurchases.\nQ2 was no exception.\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic affected our results, we were able to adjust our operations and move the business forward.\nWe reported net sales of $929 million in the quarter, a 3.4% decrease from the second quarter of fiscal 2019.\nDiluted earnings per share was $0.91 for the quarter compared to $1.07 last year.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.92, down 21.4% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019.\nFor the first six months of fiscal 2020, net sales increased 8.4%.\nDiluted earnings per share was $1.55 compared to $1.62 in the first six months of fiscal 2019.\nYear-to-date adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.56 compared to $1.69 a year ago.\nBefore I review segment results, I'll cover liquidity.\nBack in March, we entered into a three-year term loan agreement for $190 million.\nThis was to refinance our revolving credit facility borrowings, incurred in connection with Venture Products acquisition which closed on March 2.\nWith the funding of this new term loan, the company now has liquidity of approximately $800 million including cash and cash equivalents of $200 million and availability under our revolving credit facility of approximately $600 million.\nWe have no significant debt maturities until April 2022.\nWe continue to work closely with our banking partners and monitor credit markets.\nReceivable collections continue to track similar to last year.\nAll of this gives us confidence in our ability to weather the current and potentially extended period of macroeconomic uncertainty.\nI'd like to provide more color and some of the actions we've taken so far to maintain the strength of the company given the unprecedented speed and depth of the pandemic.\nFrom a demand perspective, we've executed business continuity plans and work to ensure product availability in areas where demand remains strong such as in our Residential segment.\nAdditionally, we scaled back production in areas where demand was weaker.\nAs Rick discussed, we have taken actions to align costs with near-term demand and we'll continue to look for ways to make our cost structure more flexible and competitive.\nMeanwhile, we focus on maintaining productivity and synergy intiatives which were driven by recent acquisitions and then extended across the enterprise.\nNow, to the segment results.\nFor the second quarter, Professional segment net sales decreased 8.6% to $661 million.\nThe top line benefited from the Charles Machine Works and Venture Products acquisitions which together added incremental net sales of $142 million.\nProfessional segment sales declined compared to the second quarter of 2019, due to lower shipments driven by COVID-related demand pull back.\nUntil mid-March and the impact of COVID-19, sales were tracking to modest growth in line with our expectations.\nWe saw a modest sales decline in the second half of March and a more significant reduction in April as compared to prior-year performance.\nFor the year-to-date period of fiscal 2020, net sales increased 6.6% compared to the same period of fiscal 2019.\nProfessional segment operating earnings for the second quarter decreased 29.2% to $106 million, reflecting a 460 basis point decline in segment operating earnings as a percent of sales, primarily due to manufacturing variance as a result of COVID-19 related facility closures and social distancing initiatives, incremental marketing, engineering and administrative costs as a result of the Charles Machine Works and Venture Products acquisitions, higher warranty expense and unfavorable product mix.\nThis was partially offset by favorable net price realizations, productivity and synergy gains, lower commodity and tariff costs and decreased incentive compensation expense.\nYear-to-date Professional segment operating earnings declined 12.3% compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.\nProfessional segment operating earnings decreased 360 basis points to 16.6%.\nResidential segment net sales for the second quarter were up 12.9% $262 million, mainly driven by incremental shipments of zero turn riding and walk power mowers to the expanded mass retail channel as well as strong retail demand.\nYear-to-date fiscal 2020 net sales increased 13.4% compared to the same period of fiscal 2019.\nResidential segment operating earnings were up 68.5% to $37 million.\nThis reflects a 470 basis point year-over-year increase in segment operating earnings to 14.2%.\nThis improvement was largely driven by productivity and synergy gains, lower commodity and tariff costs, lower freight costs and SG&A leverage.\nThis was partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing variance and higher warranty expense.\nYear-to-date Residential segment operating earnings increased 67.2% to $58.7 million.\nOn a percent of sales basis, segment earnings increased 440 basis points to 13.7%.\nMoving to our operating results.\nWe reported gross margin for the second quarter of 33%, a decrease of 40 basis points over the prior year period.\nExcluding acquisition-related charges and one-time costs associated with the inventory writedown of the Toro branded underground business, adjusted gross margin decreased 100 basis points to 33.4%.\nThe decrease in adjusted gross margin was primarily driven by manufacturing variance due to production downtime and inefficiencies as a result of COVID-19 related closures and product mix with higher Residential segment net sales compared to Q2 of 2019.\nThis was partially offset by productivity and synergy gains, favorable net price realizations within our Professional segment and lower commodity and tariff costs.\nFor the first six months of fiscal 2020, gross margin was 35.1% compared with 34.3% in the prior year period.\nAdjusted gross margin was 35.3% compared with 34.9% in the first six months of fiscal 2019.\nSG&A expense as a percent of sales increased 40 basis points to 19.5% for the quarter due to incremental marketing and engineering costs as a result of the Professional segment acquisitions as well as higher warranty expense.\nThese cost increases were partially offset by decreased incentive compensation costs and lower transaction and integration costs.\nSG&A expense as a percent of sales for the first six months of fiscal 2020 was 22.3%, up 130 basis points from the prior year period.\nOperating earnings as a percent of net sales decreased 80 basis points to 13.5% for the second quarter.\nAdjusted operating earnings as a percent of net sales decreased 240 basis points to 14%.\nFor the first six months of fiscal 2020, operating earnings as a percent of net sales were 12.8% compared to 13.3% a year ago.\nAdjusted operating earnings as a percent of net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2020 were 13.1% compared with 14.7% a year ago.\nInterest expense increased $2 million and $5.4 million for the second quarter and year-to-date, respectively, compared to a year ago.\nThese increases were due to higher debt outstanding related to the Professional segment acquisitions.\nFor the full year, we anticipate interest expense of about [Phonetic] $34 million.\nThe effective tax rate was 18.9% for the second quarter and the adjusted effective tax rate was 20%.\nFor the first six months of fiscal 2020, the effective tax rate was 18.8% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 20.4%.\nFor the full year, we anticipate an adjusted effective tax rate of about [Phonetic] 20.5%.\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow.\nAccounts receivable totaled $400 million.\nThis was down 6.6% from a year ago as a result of lower professional segment sales at the end of the second quarter, driven by reduced demand due to COVID-19.\nThis was partially offset by incremental residential segment sales to the expanded mass retail channel and additional receivable as a result of the Venture Products acquisition.\nInventory was up 16.8% to $714 million from a year ago, primarily due to higher finished goods in our Professional segment due to COVID-19 related sales reduction, increased raw materials and work in process as a result of production downtime due to facility closures and production inefficiencies and incremental inventories from Venture Products.\nAccounts payable decreased 16.4% to $327 million from a year ago.\nThis was mainly due to decreased material purchases as we align production levels with reduced sales volume.\nIncremental payables from Venture Products partially offset the decline in purchases.\nWe expect depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2020 of about $100 million which includes approximately $3 million of fair value step-up related to the acquired inventory from Venture Products.\nWe are now estimating lower capital expenditures of $80 million versus our prior expectation of $100 million.\nFree cash flow for the quarter was below prior year amounts, primarily due to decreased net earnings, lower accounts payable, and higher inventory.\nOur disciplined capital allocation strategy includes investing in organic and M&A growth opportunities, maintaining an effective capital structure and returning cash to shareholders.\nOur keen focus on near-term liquidity has reaffirmed our capital allocation priorities for the year.\nConsistent with our objectives following the Venture Products acquisition, we will continue to prioritize debt repayments in order to manage our leverage target, curtail share repurchases for the year and consider strategically compelling acquisitions.\nIn May, we declared our regular quarterly dividend.\nBased on our current outlook and strong financial position, we expect to maintain our dividend.\nAs a result of the many and evolving COVID-19 related factors we discussed today and more that could emerge, should the current economic climate extend for a prolonged period, we do not have the ability to predict its impact on our businesses and financial results.\nThat said, we do want to share with you some of our thinking about the remainder of the year.\nAt this point, based on current information regarding the global economic outlook, the company expects the most pronounced year-over-year sales and earnings per share percentage declines in the third quarter of fiscal 2020.\nWe also expect negative year-over-year fourth quarter sales and earnings per share growth.\nThis assumes continued customer behavior changes that include lower capital outlays and cash preservation, mostly in the Professional segment.\nOn the positive side, our products have a natural replacement life.\nSo we anticipate net sales will rebound in future periods.\nCOVID-19 related factors that could impact these expectations include: first, the company's ability to continue operations and or adjust our production schedules due to governmental actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the COVID19 pandemic; second, supplier risk and the company's ability to obtain commodities, components, parts and accessories in a timely manner and at anticipated costs; and finally, prolonged periods of economic stress that may affect customer liquidity and could impede customer buying patterns.\nWhile we do not know how long this COVID-19 uncertainty will continue, we anticipate an easing of these pressures as we head into fiscal 2021.\nIn summary, with our flexible business model and strong culture as our foundation, we have taken the necessary steps to be in a position to grow as we enter fiscal 2021.\nWe have preserved jobs, lowered costs, strengthened our financial position, served our partners well and continued to invest in technology and innovation and we are prepared to take further actions to serve our customers in multiple potential economic scenarios.\nAs we've seen so for so far in 2020, we have been agile in our response to the pandemic and remain committed to our core values of innovation and caring relationships built on trust and integrity.\nWhile our near-term visibility is limited, we've taken measures to ensure a solid financial position as we move forward.\nWe are confident in our ability to continue serving our global customers throughout and far beyond the pandemic.\nAs we look ahead, we are optimistic about our many exciting opportunities, our investments in alternative power, smart connected products, and robotic and autonomous technologies will drive an entirely new cycle of innovative products across our markets.\nWe continue to expand our full future portfolio of battery-powered products as customers see convenience and an opportunity to reduce emissions.\nWe expect the customers who deferred new equipment purchases will return to historic buying patterns as the economy improves.\nIn past recessionary times when we saw new equipment purchase deferrals, we experienced strong growth in the recovery.\nIn construction, the buildout of 5G and rural broadband should benefit sales of our underground equipment like the new JT24 horizontal directional drill.\nIn golf and grounds, we will continue to innovate to increase productivity and solve customer challenges.\nFor example, our IntelliDash course management platform professionals helps turf professionals integrate data and use information to simplify operations and use water and other resources more efficiently.\nWe continue to support contractors with an expanded line of high productivity equipment solutions.\nFor the snow and ice season, this includes the BOSS Snow Raider and Ventrac SSV and for the growing season, the Exmark Staris and Toro GrandStand Multi-Force.\nThese are just a few examples of how we're creating long-term growth through new product development and strategic acquisitions.\nWe also expect continued homeowner interest in home and garden improvement.\nWe have an exciting array of new products, including an expanded portfolio of 60-volt solutions, refreshed brand content and marketing and a new channel partner that is broadening our reach.\nIn closing, our strategic priorities are enduring.\nNow and long after we emerge from this challenging time, we remain focused on accelerating profitable growth, driving productivity and operational excellence and empowering people.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today.\nOn the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our chief financial officer.\nTextron's revenues in the quarter were $3.7 billion, down $368 million from last year.\nDuring this year's fourth quarter, we recorded $23 million in pre-tax special charges, largely related to restructuring activities on industrial and Textron Aviation or $0.07 per share after tax.\nWe also recognized a one-time favorable tax benefit related to the sale of TRU Canada of $0.04 per share.\nExcluding special charges and the one-time favorable benefit, adjusted net income was $1.06 per share compared to $1.11 in last year's fourth quarter.\nManufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $467 million, down $183 million from last year's fourth quarter.\nFor the full year, revenues were $11.7 billion, down from $13.6 billion a year ago.\nAdjusted net income was $2.07 per share compared to $3.74 last year.\nManufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $596 million, as compared to $642 million last year.\nOur business has closed out the year with a strong operating performance in the fourth quarter, as we saw margin improvement in Systems, Industrial, and Bell that drove an increase in Textron's manufacturing margin to 8.8% on lower revenues.\nAt Bell, margins of 12.6% were up 30 basis points, as compared to the prior year despite lower military revenues and commercial volume.\nWe delivered 57 commercial helicopters, down from 76 in last year's fourth quarter.\nOn the military side, the Japanese officially began V-22 flight operations in November.\nThis continues the growth of the worldwide fleet of operating aircraft, which has amassed over 560,000 flight hours.\nLooking to Future Vertical Lift, Bell marked the third anniversary of the V-280's first flight in December, with the aircraft having now flown more than 200 hours.\nArmy leadership and Congress have been very supportive of Future Vertical Lift and we expect this will continue under the new administration.\nIn December, the U.S. Army provided the draft RFP for the FLRAA program for review and comment.\nThe Army continues to anticipate a down-select and FLRAA program award in mid-2022.\nAt Systems, revenues were down primarily on lower volume at the TRU Simulation + Training business.\nIn November, Systems announced sale of its commercial air transport simulator business to CAE.\nThis transaction closed in January.\nIn the quarter, ATAC won the recompete of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps flight, fighter jet training services program.\nThis contract expands the scope of the services we currently provide into the program and it's worth up to $440 million over the next five years.\nAlso in the quarter, unmanned systems was awarded a $66 million contract for the U.S. Army for 36 Shadow aircraft.\nThe Shadow platform now has over 1.2 million flight hours globally.\nRevenues were down primarily due to reduced demand in the ground support equipment business within Specialized Vehicles.\nKautex, the automotive production outlook, has steadily improved since the low point in May and demand from our customers continues to ramp in the fourth quarter as revenues approach their prior-year levels.\nMoving to Textron Aviation.\nRevenues were down in the quarter, primarily on lower jet deliveries and aftermarket volume.\nWe delivered 61 jets, down from 71 last year and 61 commercial turboprops, up from 59 in last year's fourth quarter.\nOn the new product front, Aviation began deliveries of the new King Air 360 with eight units in the quarter and announced the new King Air 260.\nCessna SkyCourier program continues to progress with three aircraft flying in the certification program.\nThe flight test -- test program has completed over 400 flight hours and the aircraft is on track for entry into service in the second half of 2021.\nIn summary, 2020 was a difficult year with many challenges for our operations and I'm proud of the way our teams responded.\nThrough our focus on working capital management and cost control, the business has generated a strong manufacturing cash flow performance for the year.\nAt our defense businesses, we were able to maintain our operations, meeting our customer commitments and delivering strong results.\nOn the commercial side, we overcame temporary manufacturing shutdowns and disruptions in our end markets to deliver strong fourth-quarter results and look forward to carrying that momentum into 2021.\nWith this backdrop, we're projecting revenues of about $12.5 billion for Textron's 2021 financial guidance.\nAt Aviation, we are projecting growth from increased aircraft deliveries on both jets and turboprops, including the entry into service of our new Cessna SkyCourier and higher aftermarket revenues driven by increased fleet utilization.\nAt Systems, we're expecting higher revenues and margin expansion, primarily driven by growth in ATAC and Marine and Land Systems.\nAt Bell, we expect solid margin performance despite lower military and commercial revenues while continuing to invest in Future Vertical Lift.\nAt Industrial, we're expecting revenue growth and margin improvement at Kautex as auto demand continues to recover from pre -- to pre-COVID levels.\nAt Textron Specialized Vehicles, we're also expecting revenue growth and margin improvement as we continue to grow our powersports business with Bass Pro Shops.\nWe are projecting adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.70 to $2.90 per share.\nManufacturing cash flow before pension contributions is expected to be in the range of $600 million to $700 million.\nSegment profit in the quarter was $324 million, down $16 million from the fourth quarter of 2019 on a $368 million decrease in revenues.\nLet's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation.\nRevenues at Textron Aviation of $1.6 billion were down 10%, primarily due to lower Citation jet volume and lower aftermarket volume.\nSegment profit was $108 million in the fourth quarter, down from $134 million a year ago, primarily due to the impact from lower volume and mix.\nBacklog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.6 billion.\nMoving to Bell, revenues were $871 million, down from $961 million last year, primarily on lower military revenues and commercial volume.\nSegment profit of $110 million was down $8 million, largely on the lower volume, partially offset by a favorable impact from performance, primarily reflecting higher favorable program adjustments.\nBacklog in the segment ended the quarter at $5.3 billion.\nAt Textron Systems, revenues were $357 million, down from $399 million a year ago, primarily due to lower volume at TRU Simulation and training.\nSegment profit of $49 million was up $16 million, primarily due to favorable performance.\nBacklog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.6 billion.\nIndustrial revenues were $866 million, a decrease of $61 million from last year, primarily due to reduced demand in the ground support equipment business within Specialized Vehicles.\nSegment profit was $55 million, up 25% from the fourth quarter of 2019, largely due to a favorable impact from pricing and inflation and favorable performance, partially offset by the impact of lower volume and mix.\nFinance segment revenues were $13 million and profit was $2 million.\nMoving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $50 million and interest expense was $36 million.\nWe recorded pre -- pre-tax special charges of $23 million in the quarter related to restructuring activities.\nFollowing the strong cash performance in the quarter, we ended the year with approximately $2.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet.\nThe $2.3 billion represents a higher-than-normal level of cash on hand, reflecting a prefunding of $500 million of 2021 debt maturities.\nDuring the quarter, we repaid $350 million of floating rate notes that matured in November and $362 million of outstanding borrowings on corporate-owned life insurance policies that were drawn in the first quarter for additional liquidity.\nIn the quarter, we also reactivated our share repurchase program and repurchased approximately 120 -- 129 million of shares.\nAt Textron Aviation, we're expecting higher revenues of about $4.5 billion, reflecting higher aircraft deliveries for both jets and turboprops, as well as, higher aftermarket revenues.\nSegment margin is expected to be approximately 5.5%, reflecting the higher volume and increased production.\nLooking to Bell, we expect slightly lower revenues of about $3.1 billion, reflecting lower military revenues from a lower H-1 production and aftermarket volume and lower commercial deliveries.\nWe're forecasting a margin of about 12.5%, largely reflecting the lower military and commercial revenues and increased R&D investments related to FLRAA and FARA.\nAt Systems, we're estimating higher 2021 rev -- revenues of about $1.4 billion.\nSegment margin is expected to be about 12.5%.\nAt Industrial, we're expecting segment revenues of about $3.4 billion, reflecting higher revenues at Kautex and Textron Specialized Vehicles.\nSegment margin is expected to be about 6%.\nAt finance, we're forecasting segment profit of about $10 million.\nTurning to Slide 10.\nWe're estimating 2021 pension income of about $30 million versus a pension cost of $33 million last year.\nOur 2021 pension, reflects the strong return on our pension assets for 2020 of 17.4% and a change to the amortization period for accumulated actuarial losses for one of our domestic plans, resulting in those losses being amortized over a longer period.\nOffsetting these favorable changes are a 75-basis point decrease in our discount rate to 2.7% and a decrease in our estimated long-term asset return of 50 basis points to 7.25%.\nTurning to Slide 11.\nR&D is expected to be about $600 million, up from $545 million in 2020.\nWe're estimating capex will be about $400 million, up from $317 million last year.\nMoving below the segment line and looking at Slide 12, we're projecting about $120 million of corporate expense, $135 million of interest expense, and a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 18%.\nOur full-year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance is $2.70 to $2.90 per share, which excludes $20 million to $30 million of pre-tax special charges for the completion of our previously announced restructuring plan and a pre-tax gain of about $10 million from the sale of TRU Canada.\nOur outlook assumes an average share count of about 227 million shares as we continue to deploy the majority of our free cash toward share repurchases in 2021.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'd like to start by recognizing our colleagues, the people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare, for delivering strong results throughout 2021 and creating the momentum that is carrying us through as we enter into this year.\nFor example, performance in two key elements of our growth strategy, accelerating the transition of patients to Optum-led value-based care and strong United Healthcare growth in serving Medicare Advantage consumers, are both tracking well with the expectations we shared with you at our recent investor conference.\nThese, and the broader performance across the enterprise, confirm our confidence in our ability to advance our stated growth strategies and to support our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth rate.\nWhen you look back at the prevailing themes for 2021, you see a story of accelerating growth, strong collaboration between Optum and UnitedHealthcare and with our many external partners helped us grow in serving both commercial and government markets, unlock new innovation, introduce integrated products and services to the marketplace and significantly increased the number of people benefiting from value-based models of care.\nLast year, we leveraged our technology capabilities to help physician and hospital systems better serve their patients and communities.\nAnd we sharpened our focus on the consumer, working to elevate and improve the end-to-end experience.\nTaken together, these efforts helped us add more than $30 billion in revenue for the year, about $10 billion above our initial outlook.\nAnd you should expect similar growth in the year ahead.\nWe see an even greater demand for integration to bring together the fragmented pieces of the health system, to harness the tremendous innovation occurring in the marketplace, to help better align the incentives for providers, payers, and consumers, and to organize the system around value.\nA healthcare system that is more connected, more informed, more human, and more responsive to every person's unique needs.\nAt our investor conference, we shared five key areas for growth and for differentiated experiences across our portfolio.\nThese growth opportunities will guide our strategy this year and for many years to come.\nFirst is care delivery, more specifically, value-based care.\nFor UnitedHealth Group, this is more than a primary care strategy.\nIt's a comprehensive clinical strategy encompassing our growing behavioral, home, ambulatory, and virtual care capabilities.\nOur second growth area is health benefits, advancing the quality, innovation, and consumer appeal of our benefit offerings and bringing our value-based strategy to life.\nWe enter '22 having generated strong consumer growth in Medicare Advantage and saw further progress in Medicaid and growing momentum in our commercial business.\nOur major partnerships across the country help health systems improve their performance and returns, all to better support their missions.\nWe're energized by the potential to bring these comprehensive tailored solutions to a greater number of system partners in 2022 and beyond.\nFourth, health financial services, vastly improved in the health payment sector, streamlining and simplifying payments for providers, payers and consumers while reducing friction and increasing speed and convenience.\nAnd finally, pharmacy services, where people interact most often with the healthcare system.\nWe can better use the significant breadth, volume, and value of our foundational pharmacy services and data capabilities and integrate our medical pharmacy and behavioral capabilities, all of this to provide whole person care, support the discovery of new drugs and treatments and support value-based models of care.\nIn sum, we enter 2022 with heightened confidence in our ability to execute upon the objectives we set forth in late November.\nI thought I would take a few minutes providing you with some additional details on our first growth priority: value-based care, how we have prepared for it, the investments we have made and how we see it working in the near future.\nThis has been something we have been working on and building over the course of a decade.\nFor example, there was significant operational groundwork and investment that went into supporting the half-million new patients for whom OptumHealth will become accountable in 2022.\nSuccessful execution requires a lot of detailed planning, investing, and building.\nIt has become a distinctive competency of our enterprise, which we can now increasingly apply at scale.\nSo what does it take to prepare for moving to a fully accountable arrangement?\nInvestments can be significant.\nAs an example, in '21, we incurred over $100 million in preparation expense.\nWithin this, there are three major workstreams involved: clinical training and staff preparation, technology and data enhancement and third is network coordination.\nThe first workstream focuses on physician education.\nIt begins well more than a year prior.\nIt's important to provide the resources and knowledge for physicians to begin approaching their patients differently.\nThey engage in their patients' whole health, well ahead of taking on greater accountability.\nWe find it to be an essential and sometimes complex shift in what our long-held fee-for-service practices.\nBeyond education, we ramp up our capacity in the form of physicians, nurses, and other clinicians to meet the requirements of our business.\nThe second area focuses on the technology systems and information needed to support patient care and effective clinical management.\nThis includes things like patient portals and utilization management systems as well as reporting systems for teams to effectively manage.\nFinally is the planning and network coordination work to support clinical oversight beyond primary care and ensure true continuity of care.\nThis planning and coordination includes initiatives such as identifying the patients most in need and ensuring a seamless transition to high-touch clinical care services that improve health and quickly pairing patients with a personal care navigator to assist in supporting complex health needs, appointment scheduling, and timely medication support on day one.\nThese foundational preparations and investments have been critical in creating strong results across the variety of geographies and practices we have transitioned.\nWe expect this expertise will serve us well as we transition even larger groups of patients in the years to come.\nBefore handing it over to John, I'd like to update you on how COVID has impacted our operations.\nLike other businesses, we have experienced moderately higher levels of attrition and more unplanned absences.\nWe had prepared for this situation through increased recruiting capacity as well as meaningfully upgraded digital capabilities to improve customer experience and reduce call volumes.\nAs a result, in the first two weeks of '22, traditionally our most demanding period, we were able to service the needs of our patients and customers.\nAt the same time, we responded swiftly to the federal mandate for cash-free COVID test for consumers, a highly complex undertaking.\nWith four days' notice, UnitedHealthcare created a customer digital experience for ease of reimbursement and established a partnership with Walmart and now Rite Aid that eliminates cash outlays by consumers at point of purchase.\nWe expect more partnerships in the days ahead.\nAs we look forward, we believe we have the right capacity in place to execute our business priorities and meet our customers' expectations.\nI'll start by expanding a bit upon Dirk's comments on the COVID impacts we're seeing.\nIn the most recent weeks, inpatient hospitalization levels for our members are similar to the January 2021 levels, even with national COVID case rates about four times higher.\nFor those people needing inpatient care, severity is seemingly lower as we are seeing shorter lengths of stay compared to that earlier period.\nAt the same time, we are observing familiar correlations of care activity patterns to other periods of elevated infection rates experienced over the past two years.\nFor example, in these early weeks of January, we are seeing slowing in primary care, elective visit, and procedural volumes.\nActivity over the past several weeks shows primary care visits having declined about 10% and an even higher rate of decline in specialist visits.\nAs always, our prime focus is on helping people get the care they need when they need it.\nMoving now to our specific business performance.\nOptumHealth's revenue per consumer grew by over 30% in '21, driven by the increasing number of our patients served under value-based arrangements.\nConsistent with the expectations we shared in late November, we had a strong start to the year and continue to expect to add 500,000 new patients in accountable value-based relationships, benefiting from the groundwork laid over the past many years.\nOptumInsight's earnings grew 25% in '21, with operating margins approaching 28% for the year.\nWe ended the year with a revenue backlog of $22.4 billion, an increase of $2.2 billion over the prior year.\nOur expanding relationships serving health systems has been a key factor driving this growth, and we expect these partnerships to continue to grow in '22 and beyond.\nOptumRx earnings grew 6% for the year, driven by the continued expansion of our pharmacy services businesses, supply chain initiatives and strong cost management activities and benefiting from strong customer retention.\nIn addition, we continue to see the impact of OptumRx's movement to a higher-value pharmacy care and specialty services orientation.\nFull-year revenues of $223 billion grew 11%.\nAs noted, our 2022 Medicare Advantage member growth outlook is very positive and consistent with the objectives we established at our November investor conference.\nWithin the up to 800,000 new members we will serve in '22, about three-quarters will be in individual and group Medicare Advantage and the remainder in dual special needs plans.\nAnd given the steady strides we've made in quality performance, we have the opportunity to enroll people in our newly rated five-star plans throughout the entirety of this year.\nOur Medicaid membership outlook for '22 continues to incorporate an expectation that states resume eligibility redeterminations, resulting in modest net attrition.\nIn January, we began serving the citizens of Minnesota and continue to support the Missouri expansion this year as well as renewed relationships with Ohio, Tennessee, and Nevada.\nOver the course of the year, we will look to continue to expand upon the nearly 8 million individuals we serve across 31 states.\nWe concluded '21 with commercial membership about 200,000 people ahead of the original outlook provided.\nCreating this momentum is the strong response we are seeing to the new innovative products you have heard us discuss, products such as NavigateNOW, which use the Optum virtual network as a first option.\nOur capital capacities remain strong.\nFull year '21 cash flow from operations was $22.3 billion or 1.3 times net income, about $2 billion above the initial outlook we shared a year ago.\nWe continue to expect our 2022 cash flow to approach $24 billion, about 1.2 times net income.\nAnd we ended '21 with a debt-to-total capital ratio of 38%.\nThese ample capital capacities allow us to continue to accelerate our investments, while remaining committed to an advancing shareholder dividend and supporting our expected repurchase of between $5 billion and $6 billion of stock in '22.\nOur 2022 adjusted earnings per share outlook of $21.10 to $21.60 is consistent with the view we offered seven weeks ago.\nFrom this distance, and in contrast to the past two years, we expect the seasonal pattern to be more consistent with our historical experience, with just under 50% of full-year earnings in the first half and the first two quarters comparably even.\nBefore we transition to the Q&A portion of the call, I hope you've already taken away the strong sense of confidence John, Dirk, and I share in the growth potential of this company, rooted in the growing number of people we're serving in value-based models, the depth of relationships we're building with local health systems, our pharmacy capabilities and the innovation and consumer focus that's driving growth across our government programs, individual and commercial businesses.\nAs demand for innovation and integrated solutions, products, and services only continues to grow, we've never been in a better position to help bring together the fragmented pieces of healthcare and create more value for the people we try to serve.\nOne per caller, please.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We are also excited to discuss Vector Group separating its businesses through the spin off of Douglas Elliman.\nWith me here today are Bryant Kirkland, CFO of Vector; Richard Lampen, Chief Operating Officer of Vector; Scott Durkin, President and CEO of Douglas Elliman Realty LLC; David Ballard, CTO of vector; and Nick Anson, President and COO of Liggett Vector Brands.\nWe also have Ron Bernstein, Senior Advisor to Liggett Vector Brands joining for the Q&A portion of the call.\nWe will then discuss the exciting news of our intention to spin-off Vector Group's real estate brokerage business, including Douglas Elliman and its cutting edge PropTech investments into an independent publicly traded company.\nWe also filed a Form 10 with the SEC.\nLet me start with financial results.\nAt September 30, 2021 Vector Group's consolidated balance sheet remain strong.\nWe maintained significant liquidity with cash and cash equivalents of $524 million, including cash of $159 million at Douglas Elliman and $133 million at Liggett.\nWe also held investment securities and investment partnership interests with a fair market value of $214 million at September 30, 2021.\nNow turning to Vector Group's consolidated results from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2021.\nVector Group's revenues were $652.6 million compared to $547.8 million in the 2020 period, the 104.8 million increase in revenues was a result of an increase of $125.7 million in the real estate segment, partially offset by a decline of $20.9 million in the tobacco segment.\nMoving on to -- excuse me, net income attributed to Vector Group was $48.9 or $0.32 per diluted common share compared to $38.1 million or $0.25 per diluted common share in the third quarter of 2020.\nThe company recorded adjusted EBITDA of $116.5 million compared to $103.3 million in the prior year.\nAdjusted net income was $52.6 million by $0.34 per diluted share compared to $38.3 million or $0.25 per diluted share in the 2020 period.\nMoving on to the results for the nine months ended September 30, 2021.\nVector Group's revenues were $1.93 billion compared to $1.45 billion in the 2020 period.\nThe $478 million increase in revenues was a result of an increase of $500.4 million in the real estate segment offset by a decline of $22.5 million in the tobacco segment.\nNet income attributed vector Group was $174.2 million or $1.13 per diluted common share compared to $60.7 million or $0.39 per diluted common share in the 2020 period.\nThe company recorded adjusted EBITDA of $355.1 million compared to $240 million in the prior year.\nAdjusted net income was $194.3 million or $1.26 per diluted share compared to $106.9 million or $0.70 per diluted share in the 2020 period.\nMoving on to the results for the last 12 months ended September 30, 2021.\nVector Group reported revenues of $2.48 billion, net income of $206.4 million and adjusted EBITDA of $44.8 million [Phonetic].\nTurning to our tobacco business financial results.\nLiggett continued its strong 2021 performance during the third quarter, delivering an increase in both retail market share and operating income.\nEagle 20's continues to deliver significantly higher margins, while Pyramid delivers both substantial profit and market presence and we continue to be pleased with the performance of our price-fighting brand, Montego, as we expand its distribution into targeted geographies across the country.\nBased on Management Science Associates retail data, the discount category increased approximately 80 basis points in the third quarter from a year ago, now comprising 26.5% of the total market as compared to 25.7% for the same period last year.\nAs the deep discount segment continues to offer attractive value proposition for the consumers, we expect down-trading trends will continue for the foreseeable future.\nAs such, we remain confident that our value focused brand portfolio and broad distribution position us well to meet these evolving market demands and drive profitable growth.\nI will now turn to the combined tobacco financials for Liggett Group and Vector Tobacco.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, revenues were $297.9 million and $895.9 million respectively, compared to $318.9 million and $918.4 million for the corresponding 2020 period.\nTobacco adjusted operating income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $91.8 million and $273.9 million compared to $91.6 million and $240.2 million for the corresponding periods a year ago.\nThrough the first three quarters of 2021, tobacco adjusted operating income exceeded our full year 2019 figures, which was a record at that point in time.\nLiggett's third quarter earnings increase was primarily the result of higher gross profit margins associated with higher pricing and promotional spending efficiencies, offset by lower wholesale volumes and higher Master Settlement Agreement expense.\nAs discussed in last quarter's conference call, we anticipated pressure on our third quarter wholesale volumes following a significant inventory increase at the end of the second quarter and we estimate approximately half of our year-over-year third quarter wholesale shipment declines related to a reduction in wholesale inventories.\nIn addition, significant reductions made to our net MSA expense in the third quarter of last year because of unusually strong third quarter 2020 industry volumes put additional pressure on our year-over-year earnings comparison.\nAccording to Management Science Associates, overall industry wholesale shipments for the three months ended September 30, 2021 were down 11.8% compared to last year, while Liggett's wholesale shipments declined by 11.6% for the comparable period.\nAs we regularly note, however, we believe retail shipments are a much better indicator of underlying industry trends due to varying wholesaler buying patterns.\nLiggett's retail shipments for the three months ended September 30, 2021 declined 6.1% from the year ago period, while industry retail shipments decreased 7% during the same timeframe.\nAs a result, Liggett's third quarter retail share increased to 4.22% from 4.18% in the corresponding period last year.\nSequentially, Liggett's retail share increased by 13 basis points in the third quarter over the second quarter.\nIn summary, we remain pleased with the operational and financial performance of our tobacco business.\nFinally, while we always subject to industry regulatory and general market risks, we remain confident that we have effective programs and infrastructure in place to keep our business operating efficiently and delivering both market share and profit growth from our value-based brand portfolio.\nBefore Howard addresses the spin-off transaction, turning to Douglas Elliman's financial performance for the three, nine and last 12 months ended September 30, 2021.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2021, Douglas Elliman reported $354.2 million in revenues compared to $208 million in revenues in the 2020 period.\nDouglas Elliman reported net income of $25.1 million and adjusted EBITDA of $27.8 million in the third quarter compared to $11.8 million and $14.1 million in the year ago period.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2021, Douglas Elliman reported $1.02 billion in revenues compared to $506.5 million in revenues in the 2020 period.\nDouglas Elliman reported net income of $82.2 million and adjusted EBITDA of $89.5 million for the nine months 2021 period compared to a net loss of $62.2 million and adjusted EBITDA of $5.3 million in the 2020 period.\nThe net loss in the 2020 period included pre-tax charges for non-cash impairments of $58.3 million and pre-tax restructuring charges up $3.3 million.\nFor the last 12 months ended September 30, 2021, Douglas Elliman reported $1.29 billion in revenues, $96.2 million of net income and $106.2 million in adjusted EBITDA.\nIn addition, Douglas Elliman reported closed sales of $47.7 billion in the last 12 months ended September 30, 2021.\nDouglas Elliman's year-to-date results were driven by strong continued activity in all markets.\nBoth closed sales volume and revenues doubled from the comparable 2020 period.\nWe are particularly pleased with the continued strength of South Florida market as well as a rebound of the New York City market during the first nine months of 2021.\nIn addition, Douglas Elliman's gross margin or company dollar increased to $94.5 million in the third quarter 2021, up from $58.9 million in the third quarter of 2020.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2021, Douglas Elliman's gross margin or company dollar increased to $274.1 million or $154.8 million for the same period in 2020.\nAnd as Douglas Elliman's revenues and gross margins significantly increased in 2021, we have discontinued certain expense reductions, which were implemented in the second quarter of 2020.\nThese include reductions to activity-based items such as advertising and discretionary compensation.\nThis team has substantial real estate expertise and a proven track record of driving growth.\nWe are very excited about this team because we have combined a strong management team from Vector with decades of public company management experience and a strong industry team from Douglas Elliman, which brings decades of real estate experience.\nMoving to Page 4, let's discuss our plan to separate Vector Group's real estate brokerage business and it's PropTech investments into an independent publicly traded company.\nWe are doing this because we believe Douglas Elliman as a separate company will leverage its comprehensive suite of real estate solutions, industry leading brand name PropTech Investment Arms, New Valley Ventures LLC, and talented team of finding technology, marketing and communication employees to unleash its growth potential.\nWe are doing this now, especially given current trends in the large and growing U.S. residential real estate industry at a time when the size of our business has reached a critical mass, positioning us well to succeed in the market as a stand-alone company.\nAnd of course, it will also be able to access the capital markets and widen its potential investor base, as well as use it pure play stock for M&A purposes and provide incentive opportunities for its key talent.\nWe expect this transaction to create significant value for all of Douglas Elliman's key stakeholders: developer, clients, brokerage customers, employees, agents and stockholders.\nSpecifically, we believe our presence in the most important primary luxury market in United States, our opportunities for continued growth, our diverse revenue streams, as well as our distinctive approach to technology will furnish a higher earnings multiple.\nMoving to Page 5, this is planned as a tax-free spin-off of Douglas Elliman to Vector Group stockholders.\nUpon completion, the new company called Douglas Elliman Inc will be a separate publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol, DOUG.\nDouglas Elliman Inc will consist of the brokerage, New Valley Ventures LLC, DE property management, DE development and marketing, DE title, DE mortgage and portfolio as well.\nThe rationale for the spin-off is that Vector Group's two businesses tobacco and real estate operate in distinct markets and possess unique growth prospects and investment profiles.\nAs planned, Vector Group stockholders will receive one share of Spinco common stock for every two shares of Vector Group common stock held.\nWe also expect subject to Board approval that Spinco will initially pay $0.05 per share quarterly dividend to holders of Douglas Elliman common stock and if Vector were to continue its $0.20 per share quarterly dividend.\nDoug's Board will consist of Dick Lampen and myself, as well as five seasoned public and private company executives who bring technology, legal and financial expertise: Ron Kramer, Wilson White, Lynn Mestel, Michael Liebowitz and Mark Zeitchick.\nNow, let us turn to Page 6 for an overview of Elliman's business.\nFounded in 1911, Douglas Elliman is one of the preeminent cutting edge residential brokerage companies in the United States.\nDouglas Elliman is a leading real estate brand associated with luxury service and forward thinking that operates in premium markets, primarily those that are densely populated international finance and technology hubs, as well as many of the second and third home markets, which DEDM.\nThese markets offering housing inventory at premium price points.\nWith a brand name synonymous with luxury and its comprehensive suite of technology enabled real estate services and investments, focus element is well positioned to capitalize on the highly attractive dynamics in the U.S. residential real estate market.\nAs a stand-alone publicly traded company, Douglas Elliman will pursue profitable growth opportunities to create stockholder value through the expansion of its geographic footprint, adoption of cutting edge PropTech and investments in PropTech companies through New Valley Ventures continue to excel in its retention and recruitment of best-in-class talent, acquisitions Aqui-hires and operational efficiencies.\nDouglas Elliman will also be able to directly and more efficiently access the capital markets and widen it's potential investor base.\nDouglas Elliman has an attractive financial profile with a balance sheet strength of $200 million of net cash at significant operating leverage, currently Douglas Elliman has approximately 6,600 agents and for the 12 months ended September 30, 2021, it had gross transaction volume of $47.7 billion, revenue of $1.29 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $106.2 million.\nTurning to page 7, Douglas Elliman is one of the largest residential brokerage companies in the New York metropolitan area, which includes New York City, Long Island, Westchester and the Hamptons and is sixth largest in the United States by sales value according to HousingWire.\nNote, this is sixth among brokerage such as Realogy, Berkshire Hathaway and Compass, for example, all of which opposed to tens of thousands of agents compared to Elliman 6,600.\nSince 2013 Douglas Elliman has expanded throughout Florida, California, Aspen and Snowmass, Colorado, Houston, Dallas and Austin, Texas and Massachusetts including Boston, Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.\nThe company can leverage Douglas Elliman's brand equity and earn credibility to expand its presence in new existing and adjoining markets and recruit best in class agents who recognize and trust the Douglas Elliman name, all contributing to increased market share.\nAn important point of differentiation for Elliman from Realogy and Compass is that the primary focus of our business is on the leading densely populated international finance and technology hubs, where housing inventory is at a premium price levels.\nThis is unlike these two competitors, one of whom is a multi-brand national franchise whose growth plans are less focused and include many markets through the country with these same demographics.\nThis results in Elliman having an average price per transaction substantially higher than our leading competitors.\nThis is important because the economics of the luxury market are attractive with commission rate strong, but also because we see the luxury market has more recession proof with drivers to our markets such as the continued migration to lower and lower tax states, the prevalence of remote working and a growth in millennials entering the housing market, who are generationally inclined to buying.\nWe believe this creates a large runway for us to continue to grow our business, not only in our existing, but in completely complementary markets as well.\nTurning to Page 9 to review the investment highlights for Spinco.\nThe U.S. residential real estate market has highly attractive growth dynamics.\nElements comprehensive suite of real estate solutions provide some multiple revenue streams and opportunities to monetize our agent relationships.\nDouglas Elliman is an industry-leading brand with a presence in most major U.S. luxury markets.\nWe have cutting-edge technology which support agent recruitment, retention and productivity.\nWe have a strong platform for continued and sustainable growth.\nThe stand-alone Douglas Elliman will have a balance sheet strength and significant operating leverage.\nAnd finally, we have a seasoned management team with substantial real estate experience and a track record of driving growth.\nTurning to Page 10, which highlights the attractive characteristics of the U.S. residential market.\nSince the beginning of 2020, U.S. homeowner equity has grown 17.6% to $23.6 trillion.\nNew and existing home sales in the U.S. are forecast to grow to approximately 7.4 million units in 2022, up from 6.9 million units in 2021 and 6.5 million units in 2020.\nThis is occurring against the backdrop of low mortgage rates driving home sales and even with some increase next year likely still on a relative basis at very attractive levels.\nThis is accompanied by increased mobility, driven by a number of factors including the continued migration to low tax jurisdiction, as well as COVID related factors such as greater remote work flexibility leading to increased demand for greater space and second homes.\nDouglas Elliman increasingly refers to buyers wanting multiple primary residents with their second and third residents having all the amenities and space they desire for a full-time residents.\nTurning to Page 11, another contributing factor to long-term demand in the residential market arises from millennials, the largest population cohort, entering the housing market in large numbers as they hit family formation and peak homebuying age, making their first home purchases at an older age than prior generations, they now are an important and growing part of the demand and we anticipate them to prefer technology focused firm like Douglas Elliman.\nThis strong demand combined with low inventory has resulted in significant price appreciation in many sectors of the market, including in many of our luxury markets.\nAnd finally agents continue to play a critical role in the purchase and sale of residential real estate, notwithstanding various agentless models like iBuying.\nThey represent a very small piece of the market ended approximately 90% of all residential transactions an agent is involved.\nAs real estate transactions are complex and agents help to facilitate the successful completion of the transaction.\nTurning to Page 12, Douglas Elliman's comprehensive suite of real estate solutions provide for multiple revenue streams in addition to our residential brokerage business.\nOur existing portfolio of ancillary real estate services allows us to enhance client experience and drive revenue and earnings growth, with an opportunity to accelerate growth via investments and acquisitions.\nThese other revenue streams include the Douglas Elliman development sales and marketing platform, which enhances Elliman's position in the luxury real estate segment, headed by Susan de Franca, an industry leader, the new development is sought after by well-known real estate developers as it offers expertise from project inception to close, including sales, leasing and marketing for new developments in key U.S. markets.\nThe firm ranks among New York City's and South Florida's most prominent marketing and sales firms with 75 in-house development professionals overseeing a $40 billion portfolio of buildings by such famed architects as Jean Nouvel and iconic brands, including the Waldorf Astoria, the St Regis and the Ritz-Carlton.\nThrough a strategic global alliance with Knight Frank residential, the world's largest privately owned property consultancy, Douglas Elliman new development benefits from immediate opportunities to market properties to international audiences.\nWith new development sales and marketing, unlike our principal competitors, Douglas Elliman employees a hybrid broker model, where our traditional residential real estate agents work in tandem with our Douglas Elliman new development professionals and leverage their extensive industry relationships for the benefit of our developer clients.\nOur agents are able to market and sell high profile developments that enhance their brands and provide additional commission revenue potential.\nWe believe this model provides a competitive advantage to our new development business, while also increasing the attractiveness of the Douglas Elliman platform to current and prospective agents.\nOur premium residential property management business, Douglas Elliman property management, provides a full range of fee-based management services for approximately 360 properties representing about 56,500 units in New York City.\nNassau County, Long Island City and Westchester County.\nThe buildings we manage provides an important source of referrals for our agents through our building specialist program, which allows designated edged agents to leverage the relationship trust developed by our property management team with building owners and tenants.\nDE title services provides a wide, the full range of title insurance services to real estate buyers and financial institutions in New York and Florida.\nPortfolio escrow, a leader in the California escrow market delivers all pertinent documents for recording to the appropriate county clerks office, the release of funds to the seller and any other agreed upon entity.\nWe look over the coming year to expand our title and mortgages businesses into additional of our markets.\nTurning to Page 13.\nToday, we believe Douglas Elliman is the preeminent luxury brand in the U.S. with an established reputation for luxury and trust built over the last century.\nThis is an important point of differentiation for us from our peers.\nWe have successfully leveraged Elliman's brand equity to expand from our historical focus on the New York metropolitan area into new and adjoining luxury markets throughout Florida, California, Massachusetts, Colorado and now Texas, places where our clients often have primary, second or third residences and where agents and clients recognize and trust the Douglas Elliman name.\nOur brand recognition and agent credibility lead to a large referral network among Elliman agents who were provided ample opportunities throughout the year to connect in person at bespoke events including Art Basel, the Winter Equestrian Festival and the Hampton Classic.\nThese carefully curated events allow agents to develop personal and professional relationship and a mutual trust with each other's clients, looking to invest in multiple markets.\nTo build on this established brand presence, Douglas Elliman produces a tremendous amount of owned content on social media for its digital magazine Element Insider and it's quasi print magazine Elliman.\nThe firm also generates earned media via important news organizations including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Financial Times and CNBC to name a few, building a very high level of credibility in the real estate space, as well as targeted exposure of brand initiatives, exclusive listings, new development projects and closed deals.\nSuch important press coverage resonates with our clients as it showcases element agents and executives' thought leadership and contributes to a strong share of voice across all major markets in which we operate.\nAs you can see from the chart on the slide, Elliman is number one in earned media in each of its principal markets including New York City, Florida and Los Angeles.\nAnd as a final point, we sponsor the Miller Samuel report, the gold standard of market research in the residential brokerage world.\nJonathan Miller is the most quoted and respected researcher and analyst in our business and our association with these reports builds a high credibility factor for our agents.\nTurning to Slide 14, Elliman has a large and growing presence in most of the leading luxury markets in the United States.\nOur 6,600 agents across the country are augmented by our exclusive relationship with Knight Frank with its international network with approximately 500 offices and 19,000 agents.\nThis is an invaluable relationship that is truly singular in the U.S. residential brokerage community and provides our agents with unprecedented global exposure to important buyers from around the world.\nThis is of particular importance today as our borders open to foreigners on November 9th.\nAnd as you can see from the charts, our significant and growing market share in our principal markets and we are regularly one of the largest firms in New York.\nOur focus on the major U.S. luxury markets is reflected in Douglas Elliman having substantially higher average transaction value than any of our major competitors, approximately 1.6 million year-to-date, materially higher than Compass and Realogy.\nStarting on Page 15, you'll start to see that our general approach to real estate technology is leveraging best of breed technology, leveraging proven technology around legacy investments, as well as leveraging new early stage disruptive PropTech companies from New Valley Ventures.\nThis strategy gives our stakeholders access to fast and changing industry-leading technology, while enabling Douglas Elliman to benefit from traditional valuation growth of breakthrough PropTech companies.\nHiring technology talent to develop new products inside large companies such as Douglas Elliman is costly, takes longer to bring new technology to the market and rarely generates most cutting-edge solutions and then limits the value of the emerging product to the company's own usage.\nInstead, we believe technology innovation is best fostered in smaller, purpose-built PropTech companies.\nWe operate a very open architecture technology infrastructure that allows for plug and play environment where new features and functionalities can quickly be added for the benefit of our agents and their clients.\nThis ensures our technology remain state of the art.\nVendor optionality is maintained and our costs are minimized.\nBy investing in early stage PropTech companies, Douglas Elliman can gain differentiation access into the innovative PropTech services, while benefiting from expected growth and valuation of these firms without the need to build or fully acquire them.\nWe anticipate that these investments will continue to provide us with unique access to cutting edge industry-leading technology, providing us with valuable technology system to improve the efficiency of Douglas Elliman's business, while also capturing some of the most valuable created combination of experience between a real estate industry and the PropTech companies which we partner with.\nOur Douglas Elliman agent portal shown on this page powered by invent.\nus is built on a native cloud SaaS infrastructure foundation that is designed to rapidly adjust and incorporate new initiatives and solutions.\nThe user-friendly portal incorporates automated and simplified workflows for our agents, interactions, expansive data rich dashboards and reports backed by artificial intelligence and integrated data assets.\nThe technology is completely plug & play and enabled, which supports our ability to quickly adjust our solution in concert with the digital transfer information happening in the PropTech industry today.\nTurning to Page 16, leveraging this solution -- leveraging this strategy, we also can quickly incorporate innovative technology to meet our business requirements at a rapid pace.\nExample in 2018 to 2020 on average, we were able to roll out about 2 to 4 major solutions needed to support our business in addition to just small changes that were required for our existing solutions.\nOver the course of 2021, we've rolled out nine solutions that are target -- nine solutions and we target two more by the end of the year.\nSolutions like mobile ready CRM, DIY marketing solutions, transaction management powered by rechat and others, AI integration powered by purlin, e-sign, online notary, DIY robust video abilities and expanding revenue opportunities by leveraging partners like Humming Homes for home services.\nTurning to Page 17.\nOur open architecture technology strategy allows access to fast changing industry-leading technology, while enabling Douglas Elliman reality to benefit from the potential adjacent revenue streams and valuation growth at the breakthrough tech firms.\nElliman is bringing innovation technology driven PropTech solutions to Douglas Elliman Reality and the greater real estate community through its New Valley Ventures subsidiary.\nThe investment approach and insurers at Douglas Elliman companies and its agents are on the cutting edge of the of the industry with new solutions and services that can easily be integrated into our technology foundation, while keeping us asset-light.\nThis includes access to exciting fast growing sectors in the PropTech space such as EV and green tech, which significantly align with our assets.\nThe PropTech companies we invest and benefit access to Douglas Elliman's operating business and distribution to grow their own business, while simultaneously driving Elliman's growth and competitive differentiation.\nAnother additional revenue stream example would be our white label homeowners engagement platform that supports long-term client relationships by providing clients' lifetime access to services that include home management, moving HVAC support, home insurance, change of addresses, and many more.\nOur access to leading industry technology also enhances agent productivity, earning potential and satisfaction thus supporting effects to recruit and retain high performing agents through the appeal of more creative offerings and to the increase of our market share.\nI now return return back to Scott to go through Page 18 and 20.\nMoving on to Page 18.\nDouglas Elliman has a strong platform for continued growth.\nThis involves growth in existing markets and in markets adjacent to where we are today, as well as entree into new markets.\nIn addition to organic growth through recruiting in our major markets, we have a number of very significant opportunities to grow our market share in adjacent markets, where the Elliman name is well known and trusted.\nSome clear examples in New York, where we have a significant presence in New York City, Long Island and the Hampton, we are working hard to grow our business in Westchester County; Greenwich, Connecticut and in New Jersey.\nLikewise, we are focused on scaling our business in Boston and nearby summer luxury market.\nIn Florida, we are building on our strength in South Florida from Miami to Palm Beach to increase our presence on the West Coast of the state and recently, for example, has had a significant growth in our Naples present.\nAnd we have made a strategic decision to aggressively grow our current business in Texas.\nThis past summer, we restructured our relationship with our partners and are fully integrating the business with the rest of our operations.\nWe are actively recruiting top agents and talent in Houston, Dallas and Austin, and we believe Texas could be a major market for us in the future.\nTexas is a low tax state and growing in importance as a tech hub, seeing significant in migration from California and other markets where we operate in.\nThere are a number of potential markets where our strength in the luxury segment could make these markets interesting.\nThese include as examples markets such as Nashville, Scottsdale, Denver, Las Vegas and San Francisco.\nThese are also examples of markets where there is also potential for new development sales and marketing business, which can be a good way for us to enter a new market.\nIn the aggregate, the 18 markets shown represent approximately $180 billion in transaction value, which would represent a 50% increase in our addressable market.\nIn terms of growth of our new development sales and marketing platform, this is very important as a part of our business.\nTotal revenues for this business was $66.7 million year-to-date and our pipeline is very strong.\nWe see a number of attractive opportunities to expand this business into new markets and are actively working to expand our presence in Texas.\nAnd as discussed before, we have a real opportunity to expand our ancillary services, such as mortgage title and escrow to enhance client experience and stickiness, as well as to drive profitable revenue growth.\nTurning to Page 19, a final key to our continued growth lies in the retention and the recruitment of agents.\nWe have a very high retention rate for our industry equal to approximately 90% of our revenue and our agents are long tenured with 87% of our revenue coming from agents who have been with us for more than three years.\nWhile we have all the technological assets and leadership acumen of any major corporation, our agents and employees often describe our completely close-knit culture as family like and probably have agents who have called Elliman home for 10, 20 and even 30 years.\nForbes has ranked us is one of the best places to work several years running.\nWe are steeped in culture, rich in entrepreneurialism and work closely with agents to help develop very unorthodox, yet winning business plans that have led to some extremely successful initiatives that bring Elliman worldwide acclaim and recognition.\nSuch examples include the shows Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles, Million Dollar Listing New York and most recently Kendra Sells Hollywood.\nDouglas Elliman has many of the most successful and most visible agents in the U.S.\nWe pride ourselves on our track record for many years of recruiting high profile best in class agents who are attracted to the strength of our platform and our brand.\nAs David mentioned before, we will continue to invest in compelling PropTech opportunity that will help propel our growth and competitive differentiation, as well as enable us to benefit from growing adjacent revenue streams and the potential growth in valuation of breakthrough tech firms.\nIt is very important for Douglas Elliman to have a strong financial profile that is commensurate with its luxury customers.\nThis strong financial profile will enhance Douglas Elliman's growth prospects as it expands and seeks merger and acquisition opportunities and related to valuation, we believe this position of strength should entitle DOUG to a higher earnings multiple.\nPlease turn to Page 22.\nPage 22 provides a summary of the attractiveness of Douglas Elliman, strong operating performance with impressive revenue growth, disciplined expense management led by seasoned industry executives, healthy margins and limited capital expenditures that support strong future growth initiatives and a quarterly cash dividend from a balance sheet with $200 million of net cash.\nPlease turn to Page 23.\nThis slide shows our strong key performance indicators, a healthy number of principal agents, significant growth in transactions and transaction value and most importantly, an average sales price of $1.55 million per home over the last 12 months, well above the national average.\nThe reduction in principal agents from 2018 to 2021 is the result of cost reduction initiatives that began in 2019.\nThe fruits of our work from increasing revenues as well as expense reduction initiatives are demonstrated on page 24.\nIn addition to a healthy EBITDA margin of 8.2%, there is a solid conversion to free cash flow with low capital expenditures.\nPlease turn to pages 25 and 26, where the company's income statement and balance sheet are presented.\nNow turning to page 27, a summary of the investment and some highlights are presented including Douglas Elliman operates in a highly attractive US real estate market.\nDouglas Elliman is an industry-leading brand name that is associated with luxury.\nDouglas Elliman has a seasoned management team with substantial Real Estate, technology and operating experience.\nDouglas Elliman's technology creates a strong platform for continued growth.\nDouglas Elliman's comprehensive solution for multiple revenue streams capitalizes on its monetization of its valued agent relationships and Douglas Elliman has a healthy balance sheet with significant operating leverage for expansion.\nIn summary, we believe Douglas Elliman's strong leadership team, technology and financial profile is commensurate with the profiles of its luxury customers.\nBeing a separately traded public company will enhance DOUG's strength, which along with DOUG's runway for expansion will increase its growth prospects as it expands and seeks M&A opportunities.\nWe are pleased with our long-standing history at Vector of paying a quarterly cash dividend.\nIt remains an important component of our capital allocation strategy and following the spin off, it is our expectation that our current policy of quarterly dividends of $0.20 per share will continue well into the future.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I am joined on the call today by Michael Happe, president and chief executive officer, and Bryan Hughes, senior vice president and chief financial officer.\nThese factors are identified in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to read.\nWe, as always, deeply appreciate your interest in Winnebago Industries and taking the time to discuss our fiscal fourth quarter and annual 2021 results.\nOur fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 was a strong finish to a remarkable year, characterized by record revenue and record profitability, propelled by three key factors.\nFirst, a sustained elevated excitement for the outdoor lifestyle remained a powerful tailwind driving demand for Winnebago Industries premium products.\nWinnebago Industries grew fourth-quarter revenues 40.4% year over year, and 56.8% on an organic basis ex-Newmar, compared to our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter.\nSecond, Winnebago Industries trend of expanding market share accelerated in the fourth quarter, gaining a full 2.1 percentage points of share during the three-month period ending August.\nImportantly, this is driven by both new and experienced consumers who recognize the differentiated quality and innovation in Winnebago Industries brand portfolio.\nAnd the exceptional service we are known to provide in partnership with our dealers.\nAnd third, our team's relentless demonstration of operational excellence, which enabled us to deliver for consumers and our dealer partners efficiently and profitably during a very challenging period as supply constraints and inflation have endured.\nAs a result, we expanded margins in both our motor home and towable segments during the fourth quarter.\nBefore I continue, I want to recognize the superb Winnebago Industries employee team.\nOur employees now 6,800 plus drawn with the addition of Barletta, have worked tirelessly to provide the high-quality products and exceptional service our customers and dealer partners have come to expect.\nWhile managing through record high backlogs to meet the tremendous demand for our products, their dedication throughout this year has been the key factor in our success.\nThe pandemic has undoubtedly catalyzed and accelerated powerful demand for outdoor experiences.\nAnd we believe this secular shift already underway pre-COVID-19 will have a lasting impact as more and more new families experience the great outdoors.\nOver 10 million households camp for the first time in 2020, and we are tracking toward another estimated 4.3 million households to have their first camping experience in 2021.\nIn addition to first timers, a new wave of engaged enthusiasts, especially millennials, younger generations are investing more of their time and income in the outdoor lifestyle.\nTo put a finer point on this, even as we saw the easing of pandemic restrictions over the summer, creating a possible return to a broader set of vacation and travel leisure options.\nOur performance in the summer selling season was strong, setting revenue records in both our fiscal third quarter, and now, our fiscal fourth quarter.\nOur record backlog of orders continues to grow, and we are seeing rapid sell-through of inventory we provide to dealers.\nWe are also confident that the diverse cohorts making memories in the outdoors will be the foundation of our growth in the decades ahead.\nSo, we're bullish on the broader recreation economy and investing to expand our reach beyond RVs, in line with our strategy to become a premier outdoor lifestyle company.\nEarly in the first quarter of our fiscal 2022 year, we completed our acquisition of Barletta Boat Company.\nBuilding on our past marine investment in the Chris-Craft brand, Barletta's premium pontoon boats meaningfully expand and extend our marine platform into one of the fastest-growing boating segments in pontoons.\nLooking ahead, we're excited to discuss the exciting opportunity in our new marine reporting segment in quarters to come.\nDue to the strength of our overall offering, we have been very successful in harnessing the industrywide demand for the outdoor lifestyle and delivering net total growth.\nWinnebago Industries is increasingly winning with customers, and we're proud that an outsized share of new outdoor adventures has chosen to become part of the Winnebago Industries' community.\nAs of August 2021, our RV fiscal year-to-date market share is now 12.5%, up 140 basis points from the same period last year.\nEven better, we've been able to achieve these gains while maintaining record low levels of discounting.\nOur performance and ability to capture share in the full value of our products in a competitive market underscores the unique appeal of our differentiated brand portfolio, which includes a broad range of options for new customers as they enter the market, as well as more premium products as customers upgrade and move up the value chain.\nContinuing to invest in our products and brands unified by our golden threads of quality, innovation and service ensures we are positioned to meet consumer demands on technology and capabilities to drive share gains now and into the future.\nFinally, our world-class team did a masterful job translating demand growth and market share gains into financial performance in the fourth quarter with an enterprisewide commitment to operational efficiency, despite the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures.\nThese operational efforts can be clearly seen as we kept off the fiscal year with record consolidated annual gross margins of 17.9%.\nOne key element of our operational excellence is the success of our enterprisewide operations and sourcing teams, who quickly adapted to component shortages and supply disruptions that have become commonplace across the supply chain.\nOur team has remained flexible using creative and strategic material sourcing strategies and solutions to keep our assembly lines moving.\nWe will continue to monitor supply chain issues and provide updates along with our results as long as they persist.\nOur work to improve communication across our supply chain has allowed us to better anticipate and plan for disruptions in partner component availability.\nAnd we are continuing to strengthen and deepen our relationships with our dedicated dealer network as we focus on replenishing their inventories as quickly as possible.\nWe are incredibly proud of our team and the performance in the fourth quarter and for our entire fiscal 2021 year.\nOur results demonstrate that we are executing well on our proven value creation strategy.\nThe new heights we were able to achieve in revenues and profitability demonstrate the unique strength and appeal of our growing platform, as well as our world-class team.\nI'll touch on fourth quarter and annual highlights, recent capital allocation announcements and several items impacting reporting going forward.\nThis information can be found on our investor relations website at investor.\nAs Mike mentioned earlier, our first fiscal fourth quarter was a strong finish to an already outstanding fiscal 2021.\nFourth-quarter revenues were a record $1 billion, an increase of 40% compared to the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter.\nFourth quarter consolidated gross profit margin of 18.1% was up 150 basis points compared to the same period last year due to leverage, pricing, including lower discounts and allowances and profitability initiatives.\nFourth-quarter record revenues and strong margins resulted in record levels of earnings per share.\nFourth-quarter earnings per diluted share was a record $2.45, an increase of 96% versus the same period last year.\nFourth-quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was a record $2.57, up 77% versus the same period last year.\nNow turning to the full-year fiscal 2021 results.\nConsolidated fiscal 2021 record revenues of $3.6 billion increased approximately 54% from $2.4 billion in fiscal 2020, positively impacted by strong consumer demand for Winnebago Industries product, coupled with continued RV market share gains.\nRevenues were also positively impacted by pricing taken throughout the year, which was implemented to offset inflationary cost input, as well as lower levels of discounts and allowances.\nAnnual gross profit margin improved 460 basis points to a record 17.9%, primarily due to robust fixed cost leverage, profitability initiatives, increased pricing, including lower discounts and allowances and favorable segment mix.\nIn line with the fourth quarter, strong annual revenues and healthy margins drove record levels of profitability.\nFull-year earnings per diluted share were a record $8.28, an increase of 350% compared to fiscal 2020.\nAnnual adjusted earnings per diluted share also hit a record high of $8.55, an increase of 231% compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.58 in the same period last year.\nNow, turning to the individual segments.\nTowable segment revenues for the fourth quarter were $560 million, up approximately 35% from $414 million in fiscal 2020, primarily driven by strong-end consumer demand and pricing, which was implemented to offset inflationary cost input pressures.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $83.4 million, up approximately 36% year over year, primarily driven by the higher revenues.\nFourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.9% increased 10 basis points, compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by operating leverage, which was offset by a shift in mix favoring travel trailers versus fifth wheel.\nFor the full-year fiscal 2021, revenues for the towable segment were a record $2 billion, up 64% from fiscal 2020, driven by high demand for our towable products and pricing, which was implemented to offset inflationary cost input pressures.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $289 million, up 95% from fiscal 2020.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.4% increased 230 basis points for the full year over fiscal 2020.\nNow, let's turn to our motor home segment.\nIn the fourth quarter, revenues for the motor home segment were $448.9 million, up approximately 49% from the prior year, driven by strong end consumer demand, particularly in class B and class A and pricing, which was implemented to offset inflation.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA was $50.4 million, up approximately 159% from the prior year.\nAnd adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.2%, an increase of 480 basis points over the prior year and 150 basis points sequentially, driven by fixed cost leverage and profitability initiatives.\nFor the full-year fiscal 2021, revenues from motor home segment were $1.5 billion, up approximately 46% compared to fiscal 2020 due to increased unit sales and pricing.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $169.2 million, up 414% from fiscal 2020.\nSegment adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 11%, up 790 basis points over fiscal 2020.\nTurning to the balance sheet.\nAs of the end of the 2021 fiscal year.\nThe company had outstanding debt of $528.6 million comprised of $600 million of gross debt, net of convertible note discount of $60.4 million and net of debt issuance costs of $11.1 million.\nWorking capital was $651.6 million.\nOur current net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 0.4 times, below our targeted range of 0.9 to 1.5 times providing financial flexibility and balance sheet strength to enable continued investment in our strategic imperatives and health returns for our shareholders.\nWe continue to maintain a very healthy liquidity position.\nOur cash balance increased to $434.6 million at the end of fiscal 2021, and we have not drawn on our $192.5 million ABL.\nThis liquidity of approximately $627 million provided the necessary funding for the Barletta acquisition, which closed in early fiscal 2022.\nWe also bought back approximately $45 million worth of shares throughout the year with approximately $35 million occurring in the fourth quarter.\nCombining share repurchases with dividends paid, Winnebago Industries returned a total of $62 million to shareholders in fiscal 2021, while also growing the business significantly.\nThe effective income tax rate for the full year was 23.3% compared to 20.5% for fiscal 2020 due to relatively consistent year-over-year tax credits on higher pre-tax income in fiscal 2021.\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2022, we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%, not considering unforeseen discrete items or any change in the tax law.\nOur balance sheet and financial health have never been so strong.\nWith that in mind and looking ahead, I want to comment on our capital allocation priorities.\nFirst, we will continue to invest in our business and advance our strategic priorities focused on growth and to meet the robust demand we continue to expect.\nWe are planning investments to add capacity, including new facilities, executing production flow, redesign and optimizing our operational capabilities.\nThese improvements will support continued production output, as well as product innovation, and they signal our confidence in the future of Winnebago Industries and the vitality of our end markets.\nWe continually look for areas of improvement across our Winnebago, Grand Design, Newmar, Chris-Craft, and now, Barletta, manufacturing and assembly footprint and will add meaningful square footage in the coming year.\nOur acquisition of Barletta completed in early fiscal 2022 was primarily funded out of cash but also included newly issued shares.\nThis effective deal structure keeps our liquidity position strong and our leverage ratio low, so we can continue to pursue M&A opportunities as they arise.\nIssuing shares also serves to align all parties on driving a successful integration and our collective future success.\nOn August 18, 2021, the company's board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share, payable on September 29, 2021, to common stockholders of record at the close of business on September 15, 2021.\nThis quarter's dividend declaration represents a 50% or $0.06 per share increase from the previous quarter and further demonstrates our confidence in future business performance while also delivering financial returns to our shareholders.\nAs mentioned previously, we returned approximately $45 million to shareholders through share repurchases during the year.\nwith approximately $35 million occurring in the fourth quarter.\nTo enable further repurchase activity in the future, our board approved a new share buyback program on October 13 that authorizes us to repurchase up to $200 million of our shares in the future.\nThis should be interpreted as a signal that we have confidence in our future, and we will continue to utilize our share repurchase program as another mechanism to return cash to our shareholders.\nBefore I conclude my remarks, I want to raise three items that will change our reporting beginning with the first quarter of our fiscal year 2022.\nThe first is that, as previously announced, our acquisition of Barletta Boat Company materially increases the scale of our marine platform.\nBeginning next quarter, Q1 of fiscal 2022, Winnebago Industries' public reporting will include a new reporting segment, the Marine segment, comprised of Barletta and Chris-Craft.\nComparisons will be made to fiscal 2021, which will only include Chris-Craft results, and we will report the same key data points for the Marine segment as we do with our RV segments, specifically revenues, units, adjusted EBITDA, backlog and field inventories.\nSecond, going forward, we will be adjusting for 100% of intangible amortization within our adjusted earnings per diluted share metric.\nWe are taking this step to ensure that our adjusted earnings per share best reflects the core operations of our business.\nThird, the tax rate for adjusting items that impact reported earnings per share to arrive at adjusted earnings per share will be 24.2%.\nWe have historically utilized the federal statutory 21% rate.\nThis change will be effective going forward, and we will not restate prior years.\nTo conclude, our Q4 and annual fiscal 2021 results reflect very strong position in the industries we compete in and also reflects the great contributions to the Winnebago Industries portfolio of businesses and the people that comprise these businesses.\nWe are extremely proud of these results, and we have strong expectations for our future.\nThat concludes my review of our quarterly and full-year financials with that.\nAs we reflect on 2021, as Bryan said, we're proud of the financial, strategic and cultural strides we have made together with our talented team.\nIn addition to delivering strong financial results and market share growth, Winnebago Industries also continued our deep commitment to our corporate responsibility to our communities and shareholders.\nAs part of our commitment to our Winnebago Industries family and all of our stakeholders, we have made several important strides toward enhancing our ESG efforts across the organization.\nJill is responsible in partnership with the rest of company leadership for advancing DEI programs and initiatives and leading the execution of our overall DEI strategy and road map.\nAs an example of lifting others up, we launched a year-round Go Together fund to aid employees facing natural and personal disasters.\nFollowing our work mobilizing resources recently to support earthquake relief and recovery in Haiti as an example, which is closely connected with many of our valued Chris-Craft teammates.\nAt Winnebago Industries, we are committed to the pursuit of outdoor adventures and in doing so, seek to be vigorous protectors of the environment.\nIt is essential to our mission that our employees and customers are able to experience the beautiful natural spaces our planet has to offer.\nIn the spirit of reducing our footprint for the next generation of outdoor enthusiasts, we recently strengthened our commitment to sustainability by joining the business ambition for 1.5 degrees Celsius, a United Nations-backed global coalition of business leaders.\nAs part of this program, we are committing to help limit the impact of climate change by setting a goal to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\nWe also announced additional goals on water, waste and product sustainability.\nWe look forward to working with the science-based target initiative and external validators to develop an active plan for achieving this net zero goal, which represents an important focus of our corporate responsibility strategy.\nAs we move into the coming year, you can expect us to continue to prioritize corporate responsibility in our investments and partnerships.\nTurning to the future.\nThe unprecedented interest in our products and bullish industry outlook has provided us with a very bright outlook for fiscal 2022.\nIn addition to leveraging the strength of our RV and Chris-Craft brands, we are excited to add Barletta, the fastest-growing brand and the fastest-growing segment of the marine category in pontoons.\nBarletta's quality brand and high-quality dealer partners adds to our existing portfolio of premium brands, bringing more families access to the long-term value of Winnebago Industries' quality products provide.\nCollectively, our brands exemplify quality, service and innovation to our dealers and end consumers.\nThe golden threads that will drive market share gains for us in the RV and marine industries during fiscal '22 and the years ahead.\nConsumer interest in the outdoors remains strong.\nCampground reservations are just one metric that remained robust due to more households camping and camping more frequently.\nWebsite traffic is as strong as ever on our websites, and dealers continue to see steady interest in the outdoor lifestyles of RV and boating.\nAs I mentioned earlier, over 14 million households will have experienced camping for the first time during the 2021 and 2021 period.\nAnd those experiences have resulted in many of those families buying their first RV.\nAs these new households experience the outdoors and further identify what they want from their experiences, our dealers are already seeing the upgrade cycle take place.\nYes, some new customers from 2020 are trading out of the lifestyle, which is not at all historically unusual.\nBut our broad dealer conversations across all RV brands indicate dealers are also seen at a higher accelerated pace of users trade up, a trend that favors our premium brands as we tend to outperform the broader market when consumers upgrade.\nLong term, we believe the number of new customers who came into the outdoor lifestyle in 2021 and 2020 will bode well for the industry.\nAnd we're particularly excited about the number of kids who experienced RV and boating as those experiences have been proven to translate into a love of the outdoors throughout their future lifetimes.\nFrom a supply perspective, we continue to see material and component cost increases from suppliers, and we continue to manage out of stock or late deliveries on a weekly basis.\nThere is limited visibility right now to when those trends will dissipate meaningfully.\nDespite those challenges, though, we continue to deliver record-level revenues and margin accretion as our teams continue to work very hard in deploying effective sourcing and production strategies.\nGiven the levels of cost input inflation that we have witnessed over the past year, we are thoughtfully working to mitigate these cost increases with our internal cost savings initiatives.\nHowever, it has also been necessary for us to pass price increases that serve to offset the inflationary pressures we are seeing while also ensuring our products are viewed as having exceptional value in the marketplace.\nThe level of price increases year-over-year across our portfolio of our respective brands varies from mid-single digits to 20% plus.\nThere is no one price increase number for our business.\nEach of our outdoor brands are blending a price to market and price to cost approach that protects profitable market share growth.\nAccordingly, consumers are seeing the price of boats and RVs go up as pricing to the consumer is a combination of OEM pricing and improved dealer margins due to high levels of demand.\nRetail pricing is not a result of OEM pricing strategy alone.\nDespite higher prices, we are still sustaining a higher double-digit percentage retail pace currently than two years ago.\nBefore we open the call to questions, I want to touch quickly on expectations for the RV industry for the upcoming year.\nWe are aligned with RVIA's recent -- recently released RVIA forecast for calendar year 2022, which calls for 600,000 wholesale shipments or a growth of 4% versus the calendar year 2021 forecast of 577,000 units.\nOn a fiscal year 2022 basis for Winnebago Industries, the RVIA forecast translates to 605,000 wholesale industry shipments or 6% growth compared to the fiscal 2021 number of 569,000 units.\nRV retail sales for the industry in our fiscal year 2021 were approximately 585,000 units, a record number and will likely be adjusted upwards as SSI adjustments take place in the coming months.\nLooking ahead, we expect that fiscal 2022 RV industry retail sales will be strong.\nWhile they will still likely fall short of the record fiscal 2021 retail results, we fully expect that we will see industry retail sales for our fiscal 2022 period, notch the second highest level of industry retail sales on record in that period.\nGiven that outlook, it is highly unlikely that industry field RV inventories will be adequately replenished by the end of our fiscal year 2022, suggesting that the restocking phase will continue into our fiscal 2023.\nAs we approach inventory normalization sometime in the future, we've mentioned in the past that we could see that some dealers, not all, but some work on lower levels of inventory and higher turns.\nIn line with history as markets normalize, dealers will rationalize the quantity of OEM brands on their lots, and we believe we are competitively advantaged in that scenario with our brands.\nWe would also expect that dealers will return to more normal or historic levels of profitability, implying pricing to end customers may ease as that occurs and as general inflation dissipates in the future.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:On the call today, we have Brian Casey, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Forbes, our Chief Financial Officer.\nWe hope you're keeping safe in what's a difficult circumstances for all of us.\nAs always, I'll discuss our quarterly earnings and we'll cover the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on our company.\nLooking back, the past quarter was one for the record books.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe, sending liquidity and returns sharply lower with much of the pain felt in March.\nThe S&P 500 suffered the worst first quarter performance since 1928 while global equity and fixed income markets were equally battered.\nInvestors remain focused on when the number of new cases of the virus may peak for clues about the future, though the path to economic recovery is anything but clear.\nIn our U.S. Value Equity products, the unprecedented sell-off in equities was large in absolute terms, but higher quality companies up and down the market cap spectrum were the best relative performers.\nEvery single one of our U.S. Value strategies outperformed its passive benchmark, as the benefits of active management were clearly evident.\nOur flagship LargeCap Value strategy showed resilience during the sell-off, capturing only about 85% of the downside and posting nearly 400 basis points of outperformance relative to the Russell 1000 Value Index.\nLargeCap Value is ahead of the benchmark over multiple time periods, and its ranking among institutional LargeCap Value peers remains strong.\nThrough the first quarter, our LargeCap Value strategy was in the top-decile for the trailing three-year period and in the top-quartile for the trailing one-, five- and seven-year periods.\nOur LargeCap Select strategy also finished the quarter ahead of the Russell 1000 Value benchmark and it now possesses a ranking in the top-decile among institutional peers in the eVestment large-cap value manager universe for the trailing three-year time period.\nOur SMidCap strategy also beat the Russell 2500 Value Index by over 400 basis points and now has returns above the benchmark in most trailing year periods.\nRankings among institutional peers were also strong.\nThe strategy now ranks in the top half ranking for the trailing five and seven years and the top-quartile for the trailing one- and three-year time periods.\nOur portfolio managers have worked hard to improve the track record and we are seeing growing interest in the strategy from the institutional channel.\nSmallCap was the hardest hit sector of our U.S. Value strategies, but our portfolio managers continue to focus on finding companies with strong fundamental qualities and finished the quarter ahead of the Russell 2000 Value benchmark by approximately 260 basis points.\nOur institutional strategy also maintained attractive peer rankings with a top one-third placement for the quarter and trailing one-year time period.\nSmallCap's longer-term tracker record places it in the top-decile over the trailing seven-, 10- and since inception time periods.\nAs we work through the economic situation created by the COVID-19, market volatility will create an attractive investment opportunity for high-conviction, actively managed portfolios centered around quality and value.\nWhile the value style, which emphasizes companies priced at low valuation levels has historically performed best coming out of a recession, today, many companies have higher debt levels than in past cycles and may find themselves with limited options.\nFinancial distress is particularly acute in the energy sector and we're already seeing several companies filing for bankruptcy protection.\nAs the market pays more attention at balance sheets, the cream will rise to the top and the debt-laden companies of the past cycle will falter.\nOur investment process has always incorporated a fundamental understanding of a candidate's balance sheet and that has historically served our clients well in times of stress.\nMany index funds hold more than one-third of their portfolio in companies with zero profits and high debt levels.\nIncreasing losses and debt will kill a lot of these companies and we believe this to be an opportune time for investors to sell index funds and lean in on active managers, who can thoughtfully navigate through the minefield of winners and losers.\nTurning now to our Multi-Asset group, our product line-up in Multi-Asset holds an array of strategies aligned across the risk and return spectrum that are tailored for a client specific risk profile and investment objective.\nIncome opportunity, our largest strategy in the group, showed attractive characteristics relative to the equity markets.\nHowever, investors rush to assets perceived as safe, pushing treasury returns up and holding back our relative performance.\nAsset classes such as preferreds, convertible bonds and mortgage-backed securities experienced large declines during the quarter.\nThe drop in convertible securities has provided opportunities not seen since the global financial crisis.\nAnd it's created an opportune time for investors to look at strategies such as our Global Convertible and Alternative Income strategies that have historically delivered solid risk-adjusted results.\nOur Global Convertible and Alternative Income strategies performed as expected and acted as diversifiers in an asset allocation mix during a very difficult and volatile time.\nCorrelations across capital markets went to one and volatility shot up to levels last seen during the global financial crisis.\nAmong institutional peers, our Alternative Income strategy ranked in the Top 20% for the trailing one-year and top-decile in the trailing five-, seven- and 10-year time periods.\nIn Emerging Markets, the valuation case remains positive, particularly relative to developed markets following the asset class' under-performance of recent years.\nIn our strategies, performance fell behind primarily due to our underweights in China and Hong Kong.\nGlobally, Emerging Markets had unprecedented volatility and the reaction to COVID-19 was swift and indiscriminate.\nInvestors reached for any kind of liquidity and these markets were particularly impacted by this flight to liquidity and safety.\nThis reaction also caused currencies in several emerging market countries in which we invest, including Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and Chile to see larger sell-offs.\nWe do not believe this volatility is over yet.\nThe duration and depth of the shockwaves are still to be determined and will vary across geographies.\nOutside China, some of the largest emerging markets are in the middle of lockdowns and government economic reactions are evolving.\nAs in our other strategies, dislocations in these markets have created opportunities to invest in companies with strong management teams, strong cash flow and solid balance sheets.\nOur emphasis on quality companies has enabled us to manage through past crises and gives us conviction that our holdings will be well positioned for the long run.\nShifting to Wealth Management, our teams in Dallas and Houston have been actively contacting clients to assist them through the market's uncertainty.\nMany of our larger high net worth clients are choosing to add to their accounts during this time to take advantage of the sell-off and position themselves for an eventual recovery.\nWe have broadened service offerings at Westwood Private Bank for our high net worth clients, improving our ability to retain clients in the Westwood branded ecosystem.\nThe combination of banking services, integrated with Westwood's existing financial planning, trust and investment services is resonating well with our clients.\nAs we move forward, Westwood Trust will begin rolling out our new digital portal to allow us to better engage with clients.\nThe Select Equity strategy, managed out of Westwood Trust Houston office, saw its risk management metrics work as expected this quarter, posting outperformance against its benchmark.\nSelect Equity and its tax-efficient counterpart is designed to provide a high-quality, low-turnover portfolio with risk controls for downside protection.\nAt the market's lows this quarter, both held up well due to the emphasis on risk control and investments in companies with high-quality balance sheets.\nBoth versions of our strategy recently completed their three-year track record and are ahead of their global benchmark.\nAdditionally, we tax loss harvest throughout the year instead of waiting until year-end, which helps lower our clients' tax bills and has provided over 200 basis points of additional annualized alpha over the last three years.\nIn our institutional and intermediary sales group, we had inflows of nearly $400 million and $950 million in outflows for total net outflows of $560 million.\nMost of the outflows were in our sub-advisor relationships in LargeCap Value, Global Converts, Alternative Income and Emerging Markets.\nSmallCap was again our most successful strategy with net inflows in the quarter as existing clients added funds to their accounts and new clients were earned into our mutual fund.\nWith the strong relative performance in our U.S. strategies, we feel that we're well positioned to capture sales in the current environment.\nThe investments we've made in distribution infrastructure and alignment of investment teams, vehicles, pricing, product definitions, risk guidelines and messaging have allowed us to create a cohesive message that positions our sales teams for success.\nOur intermediary and institutional investment teams continue to work on adding consultant approvals; and overall, our pipeline remains healthy and spread across several different strategies.\nNew opportunities were added in SmallCap and Income Opportunity during the quarter and a large portion of our pipeline is in the mid- to late-stage and we are hopeful of decisions throughout the year.\nWe have made it well within the red zone on approvals for our SmallCap fund at several of the largest wirehouses.\nAlthough COVID-19 has created market disruptions and slowed the sales cycle with prospects, our distribution teams continue to execute on our plan to build a broader, more sustainable distribution business and our client services teams continue to provide strong service to our clients.\nWhile we're not able to conduct face-to-face meetings, our teams are functioning quite normally.\nWe did an online campaign to 25,000 advisors a few weeks ago and we were thrilled to see over 10,000 views.\nConference calls, portfolio updates, RFPs and questionnaires continue as usual.\nWe are cognizant of the fact that clients and consultants need timely and relevant communication.\nThey need communication on how the pandemic is affecting portfolios and our portfolio investment decisions and they're interested to know how our business continuity plan is functioning and changing.\nOur success working remotely is also a key point of inquiry as clients work to understand how we've protected the integrity of our business in this environment.\nPrior to COVID-19, the asset management industry was already experiencing disruption on several fronts, including fee compression, margin erosion and rising data, technology and other costs.\nAs I've noted in the past, Westwood made major investments in technology to reduce costs, gain operational efficiencies, prepare our business for disruptions and increase our agility.\nGiven recent events, these have proven to be a wise investment as we have not only increased efficiency, but we're able to move to a fully operational, remote working environment with little to no disruption.\nWe will continue to evaluate our business and take meaningful steps to reduce our cost structure.\nTo-date, we've identified over 750,000 of cost reductions that are being implemented or in process over the balance of the year.\nWe've been researching the outsourcing of trading for the past six months and recently made the decision to move forward with this project.\nWe will move to an outsourced trading model later this summer and expect to save over $1 million per year beginning in 2021.\nWe will continue to utilize technology to define our future state to be more efficient wherever possible.\nWe will close or eliminate commercially unviable funds and put only our best products and people on the field.\nAlthough, financial performance over the last year has been disappointing, we continue to execute on numerous initiatives to strengthen our foundation for the future.\nOur partnership with InvestCloud continues to reap operational benefits.\nThe U.S. Value and Multi-Asset strategies are delivering alpha and we have commitments from private wealth clients for a new credit opportunities fund that we launched a few weeks ago.\nWe expect industrywide disruption to continue and the steps we've taken to reinvent ourselves have placed us in a position to survive and grow.\nFinally, I want to emphasize that the health and safety of our employees and their families is our first priority.\nAll our employees are well, working remotely and completing their work in an efficient manner.\nWe understand that we have a business to run and we're working hard to balance the company's needs with the employees' personal needs.\nAnd I'm really proud of everyone at Westwood and how well everyone is working together, yet apart, during this difficult time.\nOur customers still have goals and priorities and we will continue to service them to the best of our ability.\nToday, we reported total revenues of $16.7 million for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $18.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $23.9 million in the prior year's first quarter.\nThe decrease from the fourth quarter and the prior year's first quarter was primarily due to lower average assets under management.\nFirst quarter net income was $1.1 million or $0.13 per share compared to $2.5 million or $0.30 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nThe decrease primarily related to lower total revenues and unrealized losses on private investments, partially offset by lower operating expenses and income taxes.\nEconomic earnings, a non-GAAP metric, were $4.2 million or $0.50 per share in the current quarter versus $5.4 million or $0.64 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nFirst quarter net income of $1.1 million or $0.13 per share compared to $0.4 million or $0.05 per share in the prior year's first quarter.\nThe increase primarily related to lower operating expenses, particularly employee compensation and benefits, foreign currency transaction gains and income taxes, partially offset by lower revenues and unrealized losses on private investments.\nEconomic earnings for the quarter were $4.2 million or $0.50 per share compared to $4.1 million or $0.49 per share in the first quarter of 2019.\nFirmwide assets under management totaled $11.6 billion at quarter end and consisted of institutional assets of $6.3 billion or 55% of the total, wealth management assets of $3.8 billion or 33% of the total and mutual fund assets of $1.5 billion or 12% of the total.\nOver the quarter, we experienced market depreciation of $3 billion and net outflows of $0.6 billion.\nOur financial position continues to be very solid with cash and short-term investments at quarter end totaling $82.4 million and a debt free balance sheet.\nIn the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 272,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $4.9 million.\nIn April, we repurchased an additional 407,000 shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $8.1 million.\nThis completed the amount authorized under our share repurchase program.\nThat brings our prepared comments to a close.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Along with me co-hosting, we have our Executive Chairman, Bill Berkeley; as well as Rich Baio, Group CFO.\nWe're going to follow a similar agenda to what we've done in the past, so we're in a moment or two going to hand it over to Rich to walk us through the quarter and focus our attention on a few highlights.\nAnd once he is through, I'm going to offer a few soundbites, and then we will be opening it up for Q&A.\nRich, so if you would please.\nThe positive momentum continues to build in our business as evident by our growth in premium and expansion in underwriting profits as rate improvements and additional premium associated with increase in exposure through the income statement.\nWe reported a consecutive quarterly record underwriting profit in the second quarter of 2021 along with strong net investment income, resulting in an annualized return on beginning of year equity of 15%.\nThe company reported net income of $237 million, or $1.27 per share.\nThe components include operating income of $219 million, or $1.17 per share and after-tax net investment gains of $18 million or $0.10 per share.\nDrilling down into our quarterly underwriting performance, you will note that gross premiums written grew by $529 million, or 24.8%, almost $2.7 billion.\nNet premiums written grew $472 million, or 27.2% to more than $2.2 billion, recognizing an increase in both segments.\nOur overall cession rate decreased in the quarter due to changes in certain underlying outward reinsurance arrangements, lower reinstatement premium and business mix.\nMoving into segment production of net premiums written, the insurance segment grew 29.2% to almost $2 billion, with an increase in all lines of business.\nProfessional liability led this growth with 64.8%, followed by commercial auto with 31%, other liability of 28.7%, short tail lines of 21.2% and workers' compensation of 15.6%.\nThe reinsurance and Monoline Excess segment grew about 11% to $218 million, with an increase in Monoline Excess of 20.9% and casualty reinsurance of 17.5%, partially offset by a decrease in property reinsurance of 13.8%.\nUnderwriting income benefited from the compounding rate improvement above loss cost trends along with growth in exposure and lower claims frequency in certain lines of business.\nWe did experience an above average level of non-weather related property losses in the quarter that partially offset these benefits.\nIn addition, our current accident year, catastrophe losses decreased significantly quarter-over-quarter from $146 million, or 8.7 loss ratio points in the prior year to $44 million or 2.2 loss ratio points in the current quarter.\nAs a result, quarterly underwriting income increased almost 800% to a record $202 million.\nThe reported loss ratio was 61% in the current quarter, compared with 67.7% in 2020.\nPrior-year loss reserves developed favorably by about $0.5 million in the current quarter.\nAccordingly, our current accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes was 58.8% compared with 59.2% for the prior year's quarter.\nThe continued growth in net premiums earned has benefited the expense ratio, which was 28.7% in the current quarter compared with 31% a year ago.\nNet premiums earned outpaced underwriting expenses by a margin of more than 8.5%.\nWe also continue to benefit from reduced cost associated with travel and entertainment, but do anticipate some of this will be given back as the economy more fully reopens.\nWrapping up the full picture.\nOn the underwriting side, our current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 87.5% for the quarter compared with 90.2% for the prior year quarter.\nOn the investment front, net investment income increased 96.9% to $168 million, driven by strong results in investment funds.\nThe fixed maturity portfolio reflected a decline quarter-over-quarter due to the lower interest rate environment.\nAlthough the quarterly gap is closing.\nWe also continue to maintain an above average level of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2021, which has been decreasing over the past few quarters where we see opportunities to invest at attractive risk-adjusted returns.\nOur duration remains flat at 2.4 years, while maintaining a high credit quality of AA minus.\nPre-tax net investment gains in the quarter of $24 million is primarily comprised of realized gains on investments of $39 million, a reduction in unrealized gains on equity securities of $18 million, and a decrease in the allowance for expected credit losses of $3 million.\nThe realized gain was largely driven by the sale of two real estate properties, which also resulted in the reduction in our debt that was supporting one of the real estate properties of approximately $102 million.\nCorporate expenses increased approximately $13 million due to debt extinguishment costs of $8 million relating to the redemption of hybrid securities on June 1st, and higher incentive compensation costs as well.\nIn addition, we announced the formation of a new operating unit in the second quarter, which you may recall that such expenses are reflected in corporate until the operation begins writing business and is then moved into the underwriting expense.\nStockholders' equity increased by $164 million to approximately $6.6 billion in the quarter after regular and special dividends of $112 million.\nBook value per share increased 2.5% in the quarter and book value per share before dividends increased 4.3%.\nAnd finally, cash flow from operations continue to be strong with approximately $700 million on a year-to-date basis.\nAnd with that, I'll pass it back to Rob.\nSo let me just offer a couple of quick observations and then we'll get to your Q&A and take the dialog anywhere participants would like to.\nI think by virtually any measure, it was a great quarter for the company.\nAnd from my perspective, it's been in the making for some period of time.\nIn addition to that, I think there is a growing amount of evidence that would support the idea that there is more to come and it's just again quite encouraging.\nAnd as far as drilling down into the market a little bit more, when we look at the major product lines with the exception of workers' compensation, all of them continue to get rate increases that outpace our view of loss trend, and that is even as we have been factoring in a bit more for financial inflation.\nRegarding workers' compensation, there are again growing but early signs that the level of erosion there is slowing.\nThat having been said, we also are paying close attention to wage inflation and what that may mean for the comp economic model.\nRich walked you through the top line, obviously, the 27% growth plus is pretty healthy.\nA couple of observations there, though, one, please keep in mind, if you go back and you look at 2020, we were not an organization, where in Q2 of '20, our top line fell off a cliff.\nWe will give or take flat.\nSo this was not just a bounce back to a normal run rate.\nThis was a meaningful growth.\nIn addition to that Richard commented around the Excess and reinsurance segment, you would have noted possibly in the release and also again in Rich's comments, that it was the reinsurance segment where particularly our domestic treaty business where we backed away from a couple of deals where we just felt as though the rates were good, they weren't good enough for us to participate.\nIf you unpack the 27% growth overall, give or take about a third of it is coming from rate, the balance of it is coming from exposure as you would have gathered from the rate increase coming in ex-comp at just shy of 10%.\nI think it's important that people not read too deeply into as I suspect some might as to the rate increase.\nAnd what does this mean relative to what the rate increase was last quarter or the same time in the prior year?\nThe simple fact is that when we think about our economic model, it is multi-dimensional.\nWe look at the margins that are available in the business and as we become pleased with available margins, we start to think about possibly how we reprioritize exposure growth versus pushing further on rate.\nAnd again, as we have seen the margins in a meaningful part of our portfolio become particularly attractive.\nWe are still pushing for rate.\nWe are still getting rate by and large ex-comp that outpaces trend, but again growing exposure becomes even more of an opportunity that we are capitalizing on.\nCouple of other comments just as it relates to the top line, I think it's a helpful data point, particularly our specialty businesses are getting flooded with submissions.\nIt's a clump and in particular, it's our E&S businesses.\nTwo things, and opening economy which clearly we are benefiting from across the board.\nAnd of course, a standard market that continues to revisit its appetite.\nAs far as the opening economy just bouncing back to workers' compensation.\nAs we have expressed in the past, we are concerned with that product line and where rates have gone.\nBut you would have seen that product line growing in our release [Phonetic], and that is really driven by payroll growth.\nAnd again, I think it just speaks to the health and well-being of the US economy, as it continues to recover.\nMaybe pivoting over to the combined ratio, Rich got through a lot of this.\nJust a couple of observations from my perspective.\nOn the expense front, coming in at a 28.7% from our perspective is a pretty good place with opportunity to improve from here.\nAs Rich suggested, as our travel and entertainment picks back up.\nCertainly some if not all of the approximately 50 basis point benefit that we've been getting as far as expenses due to COVID, that is likely to erode and disappear.\nThat having been said, if you look at the power of the earned premium coming through and how it is likely to build from here, and you can see that given the written leads the earned, there is likely more benefit to be had over time.\nLoss ratio pretty good at a 61%.\nThe ex-cat accident year, as Rich mentioned, was a 58.8% [Phonetic].\nHe talked about non-cat property loss activity of that added relative to where it was running last year, about a little over two points.\nSo this was, quite frankly, we had a rash of fires.\nSome would suggest it's bad luck, we tend to believe that oftentimes you make your own luck.\nSo we're digging into that to make sure that this is not a new normal, and it was more of a one-time unfortunate series of events.\nAnother data point on the loss ratio front, the paid loss ratio came in at a very attractive 44.3 [Phonetic].\nA couple of comments on the investment portfolio.\nAgain, Rich, commented on the duration of the 2.4 years, the book yield is running coincidentally at about 2.4 as well.\nWe continue to be very focused on inflation.\nFrom our perspective, inflation is very much here.\nThere are some people that talked about it being this transient, that may be true.\nI'm not quite sure when people talk about transient will -- well, how long is transient, regardless the cost of things are up today.\nBut even if you saw inflation return to 2.5% or 3% level, we continue to believe that a 10-year at 130 [Phonetic] or less doesn't make a whole lot of sense for the long run.\nOne other comment just related to the balance sheet and the capital structure and we can get into this during the Q&A, if people are interested.\nWe've done a fair amount of work and restructuring certain things per one of Rich's comments around the prepayment or the calling of certain securities and the cost associated with that.\nBut as you think about, again, the earnings power of the business later this year, but even more so for '22 and '23, there is a very meaningful benefit that will be coming through, again, savings around capital costs.\nSo long story short, very good quarter.\nAnd I think what's more encouraging than even just the results is, if you look at how the table is set for what is likely not just to be the next couple of quarters, but quite frankly the next couple of years.\nThis is an organization that is going to benefit greatly from the broader macro conditions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We refer to certain of these risks in our SEC filings.\nParticipating in today's call with me will be Paul McDermott, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Riffee, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Taryn Fielder, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; Drew Hammond, Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer; and Grant Montgomery, Vice President and Head of Research.\nI hope you and your families are keeping safe and well.\nLast evening, we released our fourth quarter earnings results, which rounded out a year, dedicated to stabilizing our operating fundamentals and maintaining and preserving future growth drivers against the backdrop of one of the most challenging operating environments in recent history.\nWith the vaccine roll-out that commenced toward the end of last year, we are seeing signs of increased activity across both our multifamily and commercial portfolios.\nFor multifamily, net applications were up 30% year-over-year in January for our urban properties, and year-to-date trends already reflect improvement in occupancy as we head into the spring leasing season.\nWe are focused on growing occupancy to begin reducing concessions and increasing rents.\nCurrently, multifamily occupancy is over 95%, excluding our two rent-controlled properties where we are not emphasizing occupancy gains as they offer limited rent growth potential in the current environment.\nMultifamily credit performance continues to remain very strong at both our urban and suburban properties and has consistently outperformed the national average by a wide margin over the past year.\nWhile multifamily lease rates declined 3.6% and 5.7% on a gross and effective blended basis during the fourth quarter, we believe that December represented the height of rental rate pressure as lease rate changes improved in January on a month-over-month basis and concession declined.\nFurthermore, new and renewal lease executions with commencement dates in February and March indicate continued improvement and effective lease rate growth.\nOur renewal rates were strong during the fourth quarter and that strength has continued into 2021.\nBoth urban and suburban renewal lease rate growth increased by 90 basis points during the fourth quarter to 1.7% and 3.1% respectively, and those renewal rate increases remained stable through January.\nThe continued pricing power that we are experiencing at our suburban assets, combined with the ability to influence lease terms with concessions, has allowed us to roll more leases into future spring and summer lease maturities at our newest multifamily assets.\nAs a result of the strategic management of our lease expiration schedule, only 20% of our leases expired during the fourth quarter and only 17% expire in the first quarter.\nWe think December marked the low point for pricing given the improving year-to-date trends that we are seeing.\nWe believe the vaccine-led recovery will lead to an inflection in 2021 heading into 2022.\nHowever, it is too early to know the precise timing and extent of this benefit in 2021.\nApproximately two-thirds of our multifamily leases expire in the stronger spring and summer months, and we anticipate that these leases will benefit from an increased number of vaccinations.\nIn the meantime, we plan to continue to focus on building occupancy and maximizing our retention rates, which continue to outperform our region.\nMoving onto commercial, our credit performance continues to hold up very well as Steve will discuss in greater detail.\nAnd we expect that the vast majority of our commercial credit losses are behind us.\nOur forecast indicates that commercial occupancy could increase by nearly 4% by year-end although there is still too much uncertainty to accurately forecast occupancy gains over the course of the year.\nHowever, our outlook is improving, and we are seeing signs that tenant decision-making is accelerating.\nLeasing activity picked up significantly in January and active long-term renewal discussions with significant tenants are progressing well.\nFor example, in January, we've received the signed LOI from Sunrise Senior Living to renew their space at Silverline, which currently represents approximately 1.5% of office revenue.\nWe also have signed LOIs with B. Riley and then an accredited third-party at Arlington Tower.\nB. Riley has a termination option in December 2022 and will exercise this option on only one of its three floors, which allow the third-party to enter into a sublease for this entire floor through 2022 and then, enter into a direct lease with us through 2029.\nB. Riley will extend the balance of their premises through 2026.\nAdditionally, in January, we signed a 45,000 square foot five-year lease renewal with Giant Food that at Takoma Park, which represents our second largest retail tenant and over 6% of other rental income.\nWe also signed a 15,000 square foot 10-year lease renewal with our grocery-anchored at Montrose Shopping Center.\nThese two lease renewals represent approximately 10% of our retail rental income.\nHeading into the recovery, our office portfolio offers substantial growth potential given that much of the available space is high-quality, move-in ready and located in our best assets.\nWe have a weighted average lease term of approximately five years, limited near-term lease expirations, and our price points and floor layouts are well positioned for our market.\nThe average tenant size in our market and the space requirement that seizes the most volume is about 4,000 to 6,000 square feet, which is both our medium tenant size and the tenant size with the highest demand in the current environment.\nWe have zero exposure to co-working operators, no co-working tenants and no single-tenant risk.\nWe continue to see good traction with Space Plus, which is our proprietary flexible office program that is managed in-house with spaces strategically located in our portfolio.\nSpace Plus represents approximately 3% of our office portfolio and is very well positioned once decision-making picks up.\nSpace Plus is move-in ready space that is private, not co-working space that allows tenants to control the health and safety of their environment and it offers more flexibility than traditional leases.\nAdditionally, Space Plus offers premium pricing compared to traditional leases and on average, has much longer terms than co-working providers achieve allowing us to participate in the increasing demand for flexible office space, while preserving our weighted average lease term, and thus our opportunities for future portfolio transformation.\nWhile uncertainty about the timing and pace of reopening remains, the resilience of our region provides relative stability compared to other major metropolitan areas.\nSince the onset of the pandemic, the Washington Metro has benefited from fewer job losses than other major metropolitan areas and has already gained back roughly 180,000 jobs or 56% of the jobs lost from February to May.\nAdditionally, those job losses have been largely contained to non-office-using sectors as office-using sector employment in the Washington Metro market declined only 2% year-over-year in 2020 according to BLS data.\nAs we continued down the path toward a vaccine-driven recovery, our region has several unique catalysts to accelerate the rebound in demand.\nThe growing, high-tech labor pool, federal investments in cloud, cyber and artificial intelligence as well as affordable office rents continue to drive information sector leasing activity in Northern Virginia.\nAmazon continues to expand their regional office footprint and remains on pace with HQ2 hiring.\nOver the course of 2020, the tech sector contributed 36% of total leasing volume and more than 800,000 square feet of occupancy growth in Northern Virginia according to CBRE.\nTech-driven leasing demand drove positive absorption for the sector in the fourth quarter and that momentum has continued into January with the announcement of Microsoft's new 180,000 square foot sales headquarters in Rosslyn, next door to Arlington Tower and strategically located at the nexus of four bridges, five major road networks and three metro lines and offers easy access to the Pentagon and Downtown DC.\nGovernment contract awards should remain at record highs in 2021 and the cloud market alone is forecasted to grow 9% to 10% annually over the next three years according to JLL.\nLot of Virginia's diversification over the past decade, blending government contracting with direct federal leasing, technology sector growth, investments in higher education, and medicine have set it up for a quicker-than-average office market recovery in 2021 and beyond according to Newmark.\nWith the arrival of our newly aligned administration, the Washington Metro market is positioned to benefit from a surge in activity.\nHistorically, alignment between the executive and legislative branches has resulted in a higher number of legislative bills passed with increased lobbying and legal presence in DC to influence, write and then implement legislation resulting in higher absorption in the DC office market.\nA historical correlation to office absorption in years with aligned [Phonetic] branches of the government is very strong.\nAdditionally, the election should have a positive effect on our local partner market and may even accelerate a shift back into the city for renters.\nData analyzed by CBRE over the past six Presidential elections indicates that on average DC Metro rent growth was more than double the US average during the six months subsequent to each election.\nFurthermore, market-level data indicates that urban submarkets, which have underperformed suburban areas during this downturn, will likely benefit the most from the boost of activity associated with the Presidential election.\nAgain these are catalysts historically unique to the Washington Metro area as opposed to other gateway metropolitan markets.\nIt has been an eventful and unexpected year and alongside the challenges that we have successfully navigated, we continue to make progress on derisking and improving our portfolio.\nThis pandemic has reaffirmed our commitment to and the direction of our capital allocation strategy as part of the WashREIT transformation.\nFollowing our fourth quarter office asset sales and including stabilized income from Trove, multifamily comprises 53% of our NOI, while office and retail comprise 41% and 6% respectively.\nI'll start off today by reviewing the balance sheet before discussing our fourth quarter and full-year financial performance and future outlook.\nIn the midst of the uncertainty that dominated the capital markets during 2020, we took steps to strengthen our balance sheet and increase our operational flexibility, which has put us in a stronger position as we head toward the recovery phase of the pandemic.\nFirst, we made sure that we had ample liquidity at the onset of the pandemic by entering into a $150 million one-year term loan with extension rights.\nSecond, we closed and funded in December a $350 million 10-year Green Bond at 3.44%, and we used the proceeds to pay off the new $150 million term loan and our other $150 million term loan that was scheduled to expire in March of 2021.\nThese actions address all of our debt maturities through the fourth quarter of 2022 and turned out our maturity ladder.\nThird, we fully unencumbered the balance sheet, allowing us optimal flexibility as we continue to allocate capital to further multifamily growth.\nFinally, we increased our balance sheet flexibility heading into 2021 with our strategic office asset sales and issued some equity through the ATM program to be ready to continue our capital allocation when visibility into the recovery is more clear.\nIn that regard, at year-end, we only had $42 million outstanding on our fully available $700 million line of credit, underscoring that we increased our liquidity further during the pandemic.\nAll of our covenant ratios remained strong, and we maintained our Baa2 and BBB flat investment-grade ratings with Moody's and S&P.\nNow, I'll turn to our cash collection performance.\nOur multifamily collections continue to be excellent trucking well above national averages.\nWe collected 99% of cash and contractual rents during the fourth quarter, and our rent collections through January are in line with our quarterly trend.\nWe've offered deferred payment programs to residents who've been financially impacted by the pandemic and only a very small amount, about $15,000 of deferred multifamily rent remains outstanding.\nOur office and retail collections for the fourth quarter improved sequentially, continuing the trend of steady quarterly improvement since the beginning of the pandemic.\nWe collected 99% of cash rents from office rents -- from office tenants during the fourth quarter and over 99% of contractual rents, which excludes rent that has been deferred.\nWe deferred rent associated with office tenants and that amount was $1 million as of January 31.\nAnd we expect to collect approximately 75% of that rent that was deferred by year-end with the balance thereafter.\nWe collected 94% of retail cash rents in the fourth quarter and excluding deferred rent, our collection rate was approximately 97%.\nNet deferred rent associated with retail tenants was $1 million as of January 31, 2021 and we expect to collect 40% of that rent at year-end.\nOverall, we've only deferred a small portion of rent and the expected cumulative cash NOI impact is less than $0.01 per share through year-end 2021.\nNow turning to our financial performance.\nNet loss for 2020 was $15.7 million or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to net income of $383.6 million or $4.75 per diluted share in the prior year.\nThe largest decrease is primarily due to the net gains on asset sales that were executed during 2019 compared to small losses recorded on sales in 2020.\nCore FFO of $1.45 per diluted share for full-year 2020 was in line with the midpoint of our guidance range.\nOn a year-over-year basis, core FFO per share declined by $0.26 due to the strategic transactions completed during 2019 as well as the impact of the pandemic on leasing activity, parking income and credit losses.\nOverall, same NOI declined 5.4% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 4.9% on a cash basis for the full-year 2020.\nMultifamily same-store NOI declined 0.9% and 1% on a GAAP and cash basis for the year and 7.2% and 7.3% on a GAAP and cash basis for the fourth quarter.\nThe full-year and fourth quarter declines were primarily driven by the year-over-year new lease rate declines at our urban assets, which comprise 100% of our same-store portfolio during 2020.\nThe impact of lease rate declines has an outsized impact on our same-store results during the fourth quarter as the impact of urban flight [Phonetic] on overall demand levels had a greater impact on lease rates during the winter months that were weaker.\nOur suburban properties where lease rate performance has been the best will be included in the same-store results in 2021.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we focused on maintaining occupancy and ended at 94.3%, excluding Trove.\nOffice same-store NOI declined 7.1% and 6.4% on a GAAP and cash basis for the year and 12.7% on a GAAP and cash basis for the fourth quarter.\nThe full Year and fourth quarter declines were primarily driven by lower parking income, no move-outs and increased credit losses reflected in the write-off of two isolated and specific receivables and a more significant lease intangibles related to COVID-19.\nSame-store GAAP NOI decreased for our remaining retail centers, which we report as other, by $2.1 million and $1.8 million on a GAAP and cash basis for the year and $0.7 million on a GAAP and cash basis for the fourth quarter.\nThe full year and fourth quarter declines were primarily driven by credit losses related to COVID-19, which increased in the fourth quarter primarily due to the write-off of intangibles related to two leases.\nOverall, commercial credit losses reduced our core FFO by approximately $0.02 per share this quarter, which is higher than the third quarter impact and in line with the second quarter.\nHowever, the sequential increase this quarter was primarily driven by the write-off of intangibles related to the aforementioned leases, which are not indicative of change in the credit performance of our overall portfolio, which remains very strong and stable.\nOver 60% of the credit losses related to these leases were non-cash straight-line rent write-offs as our cash losses were relatively flat on a sequential basis.\nWe believe that we've addressed the credit risks that are apparent at this point in time.\nAnd we anticipate steady improvement in credit performance over the coming year.\nTurning to leasing activity for the fourth quarter and full year, we signed approximately 9,000 square feet of new office leases and 22,000 square feet of office renewals in the fourth quarter.\nOffice rental rates declined 5% on a GAAP and 9% on a cash basis for new office leases, but increased 22% on a GAAP basis and 8% on a cash basis for office renewals.\nMore importantly, in December, the exchange of proposals and the negotiation of lease renewals picked up substantially and that momentum has carried into January.\nEarlier, Paul gave color on two of our largest renewals and extensions at Silverline Center and Arlington Tower, for example.\nRetail signed approximately 8,000 square feet of new leases and 3,000 square feet of renewals during the quarter and achieved rental rate increases of 13% on a GAAP basis for new retail leases and 3% on a GAAP basis for retail renewals.\nAnd as Paul referenced, we signed approximately 60,000 square feet of retail leases, representing 10% of our retail portfolio revenues since year-end.\nNow turning to our outlook.\nWith the development and roll-out of vaccine programs and our growth prospects heading into 2021 have improved, but the timing of when we will reach, an inflection point is still unknown.\nTherefore, the extent that vaccine roll-outs will offset the pandemic in 2021 prior to the inflection is uncertain.\nWe do, however, believe we will see rapid improvement once we get to that point and then, it will carry over into 2022 given that the embedded growth drivers that we had prior to the pandemic are still intact.\nWhile we believe the most disruptive part of the pandemic is behind us, the timing and pace of the economy reopening still remains uncertain.\nAnd we're not ready to forecast with a sufficient degree of accuracy, the timing and extent of the recovery over the course of the full year.\nJust close to quarter-end, we have enough visibility to provide FFO guidance for the first quarter.\nHowever, we do not have enough visibility to provide FFO guidance for the full year.\nWe are, however, providing full-year guidance ranges for the financial performance metrics that we believe we are able to forecast with a reasonable degree of accuracy.\nWhile we're not calling the timing of and therefore, the full impact of the pandemic prior to the anticipated inflection point, we will discuss the areas of our portfolio that we would expect to be the most responsive and to offer the most upside growth potential once the economy resumes.\nStarting with multifamily, total operating portfolio occupancy ended the year at 94.3%, which is in line with our expectations and represents a relatively stable trend since the end of the second quarter.\nOn a positive note, as Paul mentioned, we've gained occupancy since year-end and leading indicators point toward steady improvement in occupancy as we head into the strong leasing season.\nWe've increased occupancy to slightly over 95%, excluding our two rent-controlled assets, and we are seeing effective lease rates trending in the right direction.\nAdditionally, net application volumes have increased significantly on a year-over-year basis for urban properties.\nOverall, we have previously expected significant multifamily growth in 2020 and that growth is likely now going to be deferred until the economic recovery led by the greater vaccination takes hold.\nWhile we do expect the seasonal lift in the second quarter, we expect the broader inflections incur at some point in 2021 heading into 2022.\nIt's important to have a greater impact on 2022.\nWe have a five-year pipeline of value-add renovations ready to resume once conditions improve.\nAnd we still expect future NOI growth in the Trove, which I'll cover next.\nIn terms of our renovation pipeline, we're constantly evaluating the health of each of our submarkets for rent growth and renovation potential, and we are encouraged by the metrics that we're seeing, especially in our newly acquired suburban portfolio.\nCertain submarkets in the metro area are seeing the rent gaps between Class A and Class B rents widening, which is an early indicator of renovation potential, while other submarkets continue to see rent gaps tightening.\nWe are monitoring these trends, and we will resume renovations when the sub-market fundamentals allow for rent increases to deliver the appropriate ROI and we know that capital allocation is accretive.\nTrove delivered its final phase in the fourth quarter, and leasing momentum continues to increase.\nWhile lease-up has just begun when social distancing measures drew on-site touring to a halt in April, we continue to make substantial progress on lease-up and have maintained the monthly lease-up rate that is above long-term regional average against an extremely challenging backdrop.\nWe reached breakeven in December and remain on track to reach stabilization in early 2022.\nWe expect Trove to add $100,000 of income in the first quarter, ramping up each quarter to approximately $1 billion by the fourth quarter of 2021 with significantly greater growth in 2022 over 2021 levels.\nNow moving onto commercial.\nAs expected, occupancy remained relatively flat through the year-end.\nAnd while we only have a small amount, approximately 20,000 square feet of signed new leases that have not yet rent commenced and approximately 20,000 square feet of signed LOIs for new leases that are expected to rent commence during 2021, we have minimal lease expirations during 2021.\nOur 2021 office lease expirations represent less than 3% of our overall revenue.\nAnd we believe that our renewals likely over go [Phonetic] or we are under negotiation for renewal for over 60% of that space.\nWe do not have enough visibility on the timing of the inflection point for new office leasing, but it will be driven by combination of widespread vaccination roll-out, schools reopening and the general community returning to more normalized activities.\nWhen that occurs, it will impact the timing of new lease commencements.\nWe have a forecast that can result an occupancy growth of up to 4%, but that forecast is at risk if new leasing is delayed.\nFor example, that forecast includes a little over $3 million of new leasing revenue in the fourth quarter.\nThat would be at risk if the infection does not happen sooner.\nSo we're not ready to provide a guidance range yet without more visibility.\nFollowing the two retail renewals, which were executed in January and which represent 10% of our retail NOI, we have less than 3% of retail revenue expiring in 2021.\nWhile we are seeing recent signs, I've been experiencing increased activity across our office portfolio.\nOne of the most challenging calls for us to make is when sentiment will return and decision-making will pick up to even higher levels again and when those additional lease commencements will begin.\nWith that said, we believe that we are positioned well once activity improves.\nAnd we expect our office portfolio to be highly responsive to the economy reopening.\nThe majority of our vacancy is in high-quality space, some of which is in move-in ready status.\nNearly 60% of our current vacancy in Northern Virginia where job growth and absorption rates were the strongest and where we are seeing the most touring and leasing activity.\nParking revenue improved slightly over the course of 2020, driven by an increase in transient parking, but remains below normalized levels.\nCompared to other major metropolitan areas, our parking coverage is higher, which allows more of our tenants to choose to drive instead of taking public transportation.\nOur parking garages' capacity can serve over 50% of our building population prior to the pandemic on average, and we still currently have at least 50% parking capacity available, which provides an option for companies that want to encourage employees to return to the office before sentiment improves toward public transportation.\nWe are guiding to a core FFO per share range of $0.29 to $0.32 per share for the first quarter.\nWe expect multifamily NOI to range from $20.25 million to $20.75 million, office NOI to range from $17.75 million to $18.5 million and other NOI of approximately $3 million.\nG&A is projected to range from $6 million to $6.25 million; interest expense is expected to range from $10 million to $10.25 million; and development expenditures are expected to range from $5 million to $7.5 million.\nWe expect NOI to bottom in the first quarter, driven primarily by our year-end asset sales.\nFollowing the first quarter and absent any major setbacks through the current gradual pace of reopening, we expect sequential growth throughout the year to be driven by the lease-up of the Trove, the benefit of the more favorable multifamily leasing seasons coming off in the winter months, the phased resumption of unit renovations and commercial rent commencements.\nTherefore, we expect our full-year results for 2021 to be higher than the first quarter annualized results.\nSince our last earnings call, we sold two office assets and issued approximately 2 million shares through our ATM program at an average price of $23.86 per share to improve our balance sheet and position us to further strengthen our capital allocation once visibility aligns with opportunity to increase multifamily.\nCurrently, we are not planning on reinvesting those proceeds in the near term.\nThus we estimate at this time that these two initiatives, net of their interest impact, will further strengthen our balance sheet and lower full-year 2021 core FFO by approximately $0.09 per share.\nFor the full year, we expect G&A to range from $22.25 million to $23.25 million and interest expense to range from approximately $41.5 million to $42.5 million.\nThese ranges do not assume any acquisitions are completed during the year.\nAdditionally, assuming that leasing activity and utilization continues to increase and we achieve occupancy growth by year-end, we expect commercial operating expenses to increase by approximately $1 million by the fourth quarter from the first quarter expected range of $11.75 million to $12.25 million.\nWe believe that during '21, the vaccine distribution should create a positive recovery inflection point.\nAnd from that point forward, we should see improvement with more to follow in 2022.\nDuring what was a challenging and unexpected year, we supported and protected our residents and tenants, stabilized our operating fundamentals, strengthened our balance sheet and preserved long-term growth opportunities.\nWhile the timing of when we will reach an inflection remains uncertain, we believe that it will happen at some time in the second half of 2021 and that we are positioned for rapid improvement once we reach that point.\nOur region has several unique catalysts to accelerate the rebound in demand, including a strong economy and favorable demographics.\nHistorically, we have seen Washington office absorption increase significantly when the White House and both branches of Congress are aligned with one party correlating with increased legislation, lobbying and law implementation.\nThat is a promising opportunities that we will be monitoring.\nWe also expect the apartment market in the region to receive a relative boost compared to other markets over the six months based on historical patterns following Presidential elections, which should coincide with our strongest seasonal leasing months.\nLong-term, our research indicates that we should expect sustained growth in Northern Virginia, driven by government contracting, technology sector growth and investments in higher education.\nWhile we certainly have not emerged from the pandemic at this point, we are seeing signs of our multifamily occupancy strengthening, concessions starting to decline and improvement in effective lease rates, all of which are positive trends heading into our stronger, seasonal leasing months.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in earnings materials on our website.\nExcluding a special item with a net after-tax benefit of $32 million, we earned $450 million or $0.60 per diluted share.\nIn the third quarter, we delivered strong results across each of our businesses despite weather-related disruptions, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and continued supply chain challenges.\nOur teams did an exceptional job navigating these headwinds, and I'm incredibly proud of their collective efforts and focus on safely operating our businesses and continuing to serve our customers.\nTruly, great execution across the entire supply chain in a difficult environment, which has resulted in record earnings and cash flow in 2021.\nYear-to-date, we've generated more than $3.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA and $2.4 billion of adjusted funds available for distribution.\nTurning now to our third quarter business results.\nI'll begin the discussion with Timberlands, on pages six through nine of our earnings slides.\nTimberlands earnings increased by $20 million in the quarter, which included a $32 million gain on the previously announced sale of our North Cascades Timberlands.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by $15 million compared to the second quarter.\nIn the West, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $13 million compared to the second quarter.\nWestern domestic log markets started the quarter in a favorable position despite weakening lumber prices and ample log supply.\nDemand remains elevated as mills continue to bolster log inventories during the peak of wildfire season, but weakened somewhat in September as a number of producers experienced COVID-related disruptions and finished lumber inventories increased above normal levels.\nDespite these headwinds, our third quarter domestic sales realizations were comparable to the second quarter, driven by strong domestic log prices in July and August.\nSalvage operations resulting from the 2020 Oregon wildfires continued in the third quarter.\nThe teams have done an outstanding job in managing these salvage efforts over the last year.\nTo date, we've completed approximately 80% of our planned salvage harvest and expect to conclude most of this work by year-end.\nAs expected, during the warmer and drier months in the summer, we transitioned to higher elevation and higher cost operations.\nAdditionally, although we experienced very minimal wildfire damage to our timberlands, active fires and dry conditions across the region resulted in restrictions on our harvest activity in the quarter, particularly in Oregon.\nAs a result, our fee harvest and domestic sales volumes were modestly lower in the third quarter, and per unit log and haul costs were higher.\nTurning to our export markets.\nIn Japan, demand for our logs remained strong in the third quarter.\nLumber imports from Europe into Japan continue to be restricted by the ongoing shortage of global shipping containers.\nThis dynamic is driving increased market share for our customers and robust demand for our logs.\nAs a result, our Japanese log sales realizations increased moderately compared to the second quarter, and sales volumes were comparable.\nIn China, demand for our logs remained favorable in the quarter despite seasonally lower consumption, COVID impacts to construction activity and other supply chain disruptions.\nImports of lumber and logs into China continue to be constrained by global shipping container availability as well as the ban on Australian logs.\nAs a result, sales realizations for our China export logs increased moderately compared to the second quarter, but were more than offset by higher ocean freight rates.\nSales volumes to China were comparable to the second quarter.\nMoving to the South.\nSouthern timberlands adjusted EBITDA was comparable to the second quarter.\nSouthern sawlog and fiber markets continued to strengthen as log supply was constrained and mill inventories remain lean, resulting from ongoing wet conditions and significant weather events.\nAs a result, our sales realizations were slightly higher than the second quarter.\nFee harvest and sales volumes increased slightly in the third quarter, but fell below our planned activity level as a result of persistent wet weather and operational disruptions from Hurricane Ida.\nPer unit log and haul costs increased slightly in the quarter as did forestry and road costs.\nOn the export side, we continue to see growing demand for our Southern logs.\nOur export log pricing increased substantially in the third quarter, but volumes were lower than second quarter as we continue to face challenges associated with container availability and increased freight rates.\nIn the North, adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly compared to the second quarter.\nSales volumes were significantly higher coming out of spring breakup conditions, though sales realizations were lower due to mix.\nTurning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on pages 10 and 11.\nReal estate and ENR contributed $45 million to third quarter earnings and $60 million to adjusted EBITDA.\nThird quarter adjusted EBITDA was $31 million lower than the second quarter due to timing of transactions, but comparable to the year ago quarter.\nSimilar to last year, our 2021 real estate sales activity has been heavily weighted toward the first half of the year.\nThird quarter earnings more than doubled compared to the third quarter of 2020 due to the mix of properties sold.\nWe continue to capitalize on strong demand for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value.\nMoving to Wood Products, pages 12 through 14.\nWood Products earnings and adjusted EBITDA decreased by approximately 60% compared to the prior quarter as lumber and OSB pricing declined substantially from record levels earlier in the year before stabilizing later in the quarter.\nAdditionally, weather events in the U.S. South, including Hurricane Ida, resulted in temporary downtime and lost production in our lumber business.\nAnd together with COVID-related staffing disruptions, further exacerbated transportation challenges in the region.\nDespite these headwinds, our teams performed well and delivered strong results.\nOur EWP business established a new quarterly EBITDA record in the third quarter and the overall Wood Products segment has achieved year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of more than $2.8 billion.\nLumber markets began the third quarter with elevated home center and treater inventory levels due to softening do-it-yourself repair and remodel activity.\nAs a result, pricing continued its downward trajectory in July and for much of August.\nThe market began to strengthen later in the quarter as home centers and treaters work through excess inventories and consumer spending shifted back to do-it-yourself repair and remodel activity after Labor Day.\nWhen combined with solid demand from new home construction and professional repair and remodel activity, each of which remain healthy throughout the third quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA for our lumber business decreased $686 million compared to the second quarter.\nOur sales realizations decreased by 52% in the third quarter while the framing lumber composite pricing decreased by 61%.\nOur sales volumes increased moderately in the third quarter and log costs increased slightly, primarily for Canadian logs.\nThe OSB market weakened significantly at the outset of the third quarter with the softening of do-it-yourself repair and remodel activity.\nThis dynamic drove lower sales activity and higher inventories at the home centers.\nAs a result, we experienced a rapid decline in pricing from the peak record prices that we reached in July.\nPricing then stabilized above the historical average in August, as demand from strong new home construction activity continued and the market faced supply constraints resulting from ongoing resin availability and transportation challenges.\nThis dynamic, along with late quarter improvement in do-it-yourself repair and remodel demand, drove prices gradually higher through September.\nAdjusted EBITDA for our OSB business decreased by $128 million compared to the second quarter.\nOur sales realizations decreased by 24% in the third quarter while the OSB composite pricing decreased by 43%.\nThis relative outperformance was largely a result of our higher percentage of premium OSB products.\nOur sales and production volumes improved modestly in the third quarter due to less downtime for planned maintenance.\nUnit manufacturing costs increased slightly, primarily for resin costs.\nEngineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased $23 million compared to the second quarter, a 43% improvement.\nSales realizations improved significantly across most products, and we continue to benefit from previously announced price increases for solid section and I-joist products.\nThis was partially offset by higher raw material costs for OSB webstock, resin and veneer.\nSales and production volumes were moderately lower for most products as a result of planned annual maintenance during the quarter.\nIn Distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $53 million compared to the second quarter.\nDespite lower sales volumes for most products and significantly lower margins resulting from the commodity price correction, our teams did a great job navigating these challenges and delivered $22 million of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter.\nI'll begin with our key financial items, which are summarized on page 16.\nWe generated $659 million of cash from operations in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to nearly $2.7 billion, our highest year-to-date operating cash flows on record.\nAdjusted funds available for distribution or adjusted FAD, for year-to-date, third quarter 2021 totaled over $2.4 billion, as highlighted on page 17.\nYear-to-date, we have returned $382 million to our shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend, and we will supplement the base dividend each year with an additional return of cash to achieve the targeted 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD.\nFor this year, we intend to achieve this entirely through a variable supplemental cash dividend.\nThough in future years, we may also utilize opportunistic share repurchase for a portion of this cash return.\nThe supplemental dividend will normally be paid in the first quarter of each year based on prior year cash flow.\nHowever, as a result of the record year-to-date performance, we accelerated a portion of the supplemental dividend by returning $375 million to our shareholders through our previously announced $0.50 per share interim supplemental dividend earlier this month.\nWe look forward to returning the remaining portion of the supplemental dividend with a significant payment in first quarter 2022.\nDuring the third quarter, we also returned $26 million to shareholders through share repurchases.\nFurther, as previously announced, we authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program.\nAnd as always, we'll look to repurchase shares opportunistically under circumstances when we believe it will create shareholder value.\nTurning to the balance sheet.\nWe ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion of cash and just under $5.3 billion of debt.\nSubsequent to quarter end, we repaid our $150 million or 9% note at maturity, which brings our debt balance to $5.1 billion.\nAfter this repayment, we have no additional maturities until 2023.\nLooking forward, key outlook items for the fourth quarter are presented on page 18.\nIn our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the third quarter.\nTurning to our Western Timberland operations, although domestic log inventories ended the third quarter higher than normal, takeaway of finished lumber and log demand have improved following a brief pullback in September.\nWe anticipate this dynamic continuing for most of the fourth quarter.\nAs a result, we expect our domestic sales realizations to improve from the lower levels experienced in September.\nFor the fourth quarter, we anticipate our average domestic sales realizations to be moderately lower than the elevated third quarter levels.\nAs Devin discussed, we have made great progress within our salvage operations in Oregon and expect our salvage volumes to decrease in the fourth quarter.\nAs a result, we expect fourth quarter fee harvest volumes to be moderately higher with lower per unit log and haul costs.\nMoving to the export markets.\nIn Japan, log demand remains favorable.\nWe anticipate our fourth quarter sales realizations to be comparable to the elevated third quarter levels, partially offset by moderately lower sales volumes due to the timing of vessels.\nIn China, despite elevated log inventories at the ports, demand for our logs is expected to remain favorable as construction activity increases seasonally and imports of lumber and logs continue to be constrained from other countries.\nWe expect our fourth quarter sales volumes to be higher than the third quarter, partially offset by slightly lower sales realizations.\nElevated freight costs and labor to load ships continue to be headwinds.\nIn the South, weather conditions improved at the outset of the fourth quarter.\nAs a result, we anticipate slightly higher fee harvest volumes compared to the third quarter.\nLog demand continues to be favorable as mills work to bolster lean inventories, resulting from persistent wet conditions and reduced log supply.\nAs a result, we anticipate slightly higher sales realizations during the fourth quarter.\nWe expect this will be offset by slightly higher per unit log and haul costs as well as a moderately higher forestry and road costs as a portion of our planned activities in the third quarter were deferred due to weather disruptions.\nAs a result of persistent wet conditions in 2021 and significant weather events in the third quarter, we now expect full year Southern fee harvest volumes to be comparable to 2020.\nIn the North, sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower due to mix and fee harvest volumes are also expected to be slightly lower compared to the third quarter.\nTurning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment.\nFourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be significantly lower than third quarter due to timing of transactions.\nWe continue to predict full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $290 million, and we now expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be approximately 25% to 30% for the full year.\nFor our Wood Products segment, new residential construction activity remains strong and demand from the repair and remodel segment continues to strengthen following the improvement in do-it-yourself activity in September.\nThis dynamic should continue for most of the quarter before weakening seasonally into winter.\nExcluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be higher than the third quarter.\nFor lumber, production volumes are expected to be comparable to the third quarter.\nHowever, our sales volumes are expected to be modestly lower, resulting from the inventory drawdown we experienced in the third quarter.\nWe anticipate this will be offset by slightly lower log costs and improved unit manufacturing costs.\nAs shown on page 19, our current and quarter-to-date realizations for lumber are slightly higher than the third quarter average.\nFor oriented strand board, we anticipate moderately higher sales volumes and improved unit manufacturing costs, primarily due to less downtime for planned maintenance during the fourth quarter.\nWe expect this will be partially offset by moderately higher fiber costs.\nAs shown on page 19, our current and quarter-to-date realizations for oriented strand board are significantly lower than the third quarter average, but still elevated compared to historical standards.\nFor engineered wood products, we expect sales realizations for solid section and I-joist products will be comparable, while realizations for plywood will be lower.\nWe anticipate this will be more than offset by significantly lower raw material costs, primarily for OSB webstock.\nFor our distribution business, we're expecting higher adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter, primarily due to improved commodity margins, partially offset by seasonally lower sales volumes.\nI'll wrap up with a couple of additional items or comments on our total company financial items.\nWe now anticipate our full year outlook for capital expenditures to be slightly below our previous guidance of $460 million as a result of supply chain and contract labor constraints with $15 million to $25 million potentially at risk.\nThe $90 million tax refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution was approved during the second quarter.\nHowever, we are still awaiting the refund.\nWe expect to receive it by the end of fourth quarter 2021.\nExcluding this refund, we now anticipate our full year cash taxes will be slightly lower than tax expense.\nNotwithstanding a slight decrease from the prior quarter, U.S. housing activity remained strong in the third quarter, with total housing starts and permits averaging around 1.6 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis.\nAlthough housing starts in 2021 continue at a strong pace, the cycle time between starts and completions has extended as homebuilders continue to experience supply chain and labor availability challenges.\nDespite these headwinds, our customers tell us they continue to expect strong demand for new home construction for the balance of 2021.\nThe latest new home sales number released earlier this week further reinforces our positive view on the current state of the housing market.\nWith favorable long-term demand fundamentals, including a decade of underbuilding, favorable demographics, we continue to have a bullish outlook on U.S. housing activity well into the future.\nTurning to repair and remodel.\nWe've continued to see strength in large professional projects over the course of 2021 and expect that to continue for the balance of the year and into 2022.\nAnd while we did see some softening in the smaller do-it-yourself segment during the summer, demand has improved significantly coming out of Labor Day, and we've continued to see strong demand from the repair and remodel segment through October.\nOverall, we continue to have a favorable long-term outlook for repair and remodel activity, supported by numerous demand drivers, including an aging housing stock, rising home equity and low interest rates.\nFinally, we hope you have the opportunity to participate in our virtual Investor Day on September 22, where we outlined a series of multiyear strategic growth targets, including growing our Timberlands portfolio, growing our new Natural Climate Solutions business and organically growing our lumber business.\nWe also announced several capital allocation actions and enhanced our ESG leadership by releasing our carbon record and announcing new greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.\nOur strategy, as we outlined at Investor Day, is simple.\nWe intend to grow the value of our portfolio, improve our cash flows, build on our competitive advantage in the marketplace and solidify Weyerhaeuser as a premier ESG investment opportunity.\nThese actions will ensure that we drive superior returns for our investors, including returning meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders through a growing base dividend, a variable supplemental dividend and opportunistic share repurchases, all while continuing to invest in our businesses and maintain an appropriate capital structure.\nWe're excited about the future of Weyerhaeuser, and we're well positioned to capitalize on strong macro trends driving continued growth and demand for our products and new opportunities for our businesses.\nWe're greatly appreciative of Beth's contributions to our IR function and look forward to our next opportunity at the company.\nWith Beth's transition, Andy Taylor has assumed the lead role of our Investor Relations program.\nAndy joined Weyerhaeuser in October of last year after an 18-year career in the energy industry, where he served in numerous leadership roles, including Investor Relations.\nHe's been a great addition to the Weyerhaeuser team, and we're really excited to have him taking on this new role.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We are looking forward to discussing our record third quarter performance and the enhancements to our capital allocation priorities announced yesterday, as well as providing an update on our strategy execution.\nJoining me on todays call is U.S. Steel President and CEO, Dave Burritt; Senior Vice President and CFO, Christie Breves; and Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy and Sustainability Officer, Rich Fruehauf.\nI would now like to turn the conference call over to U.S. Steel President and CEO, Dave Burritt, who will begin on slide four.\nAs Kevin just mentioned, we delivered record performance in the third quarter, record net earnings, record EBITDA, record EBITDA margin and record quality and reliability.\nOur record-setting performance in the third quarter and throughout 2021 has truly transformed our business and demonstrates the progress we are making in pursuit of best.\nBy year-end, we will have transformed the balance sheet by repaying over $3 billion of debt, achieving our deleveraging target ahead of schedule.\nWe expect to have total liquidity of approximately $5 billion, creating the foundation to confidently execute our strategy and invest in our competitive advantages and we will have put the business in position to deliver another strong year in 2022.\nOur transformed balance sheet, the ability to prefund critical strategic investments, and continued optimism for our business gives us confidence to return capital to stockholders while executing the next phase of our Best for All strategy.\nWe believe the market is significantly undervaluing the progress weve made and the value our strategy is creating and now is the time to be more balanced in our capital allocation priorities.\nOur strategy is truly best for all, of course, including our stockholders.\nWere delivering strong performance year-to-date.\nContinued bullish outlook for 2022 and beyond and expectations for a super cycle continuing put us in a position to move faster on the next phase of our strategy execution while beginning to reward stockholders with direct returns.\nOur biggest challenges remain lowering our capital and carbon intensity.\nInvestments in mini mill steelmaking, like the construction of a second mini mill, while investing in our competitive advantages can deliver on these objectives and reposition the company for the future.\nThe solution is to continue moving toward a more balanced capital allocation strategy by successfully executing our Best for All strategy with mini mill number two and an electrical steel line and coating line at Big River Steel.\nWe are moving quickly on our path forward by expanding our competitive advantages through strategic investments that help us achieve our strategic objectives aligned with long-term value creation, improved through cycle earnings and cash flow and reduced capital and carbon intensity.\nWhether youre looking only at next year or our ability to build long-term value, we believe that investors are undervaluing our progress and potential.\nBut not our customers.\nThey are noticing the transformation thats taking place at U.S. Steel and the importance of a regional supply chain.\nOur industry-leading finishing line capabilities are increasing our value proposition and customers are excited about the opportunities we are creating together.\nWhether it is advanced high-strength steels, differentiated electrical steels or green and sustainable steels, discussions with customers continue to shift from transactional to strategic.\nWe continue to create longer-term value with customers by prioritizing innovation, differentiation and strategic goals, and we look forward to building deeper relationships that unlock the value of U.S. Steel for our customers and provide them the certainty of a regional supply chain.\nslide six further emphasizes our progress and performance.\nWe are encouraged by our record-setting performance, performance that is outpacing even those records being achieved by direct competitors.\nBut there is more we can do.\nAs we said, our goal is to be the best steel competitor.\nAnd while there is certainly much more opportunity ahead, weve clearly come a long way quickly.\nAs we always say at U.S. Steel, safety first, and Im so pleased with the U.S. Steel team for continuing to prioritize safety and for embodying our steel principles each day.\nMoving to our margin performance.\nOur enterprise EBITDA margin reflects the disciplined, value-focused approach weve taken to our footprint.\nWith revenues of nearly $6 billion in the quarter, the quality of our earnings demonstrates a business model that is increasingly built upon capability and cost differentiation.\nFrom our iron ore advantage to our integrated assets and from the newest mini mill in the country to the most efficient mill in Eastern Europe, our diversified footprint is extracting significant value from todays stronger for longer market.\nWhile the competition isnt standing still, the actions weve taken over the past several years to invest in our assets, streamline our footprint and add capabilities have created significant value, leading to out-performance versus peers this quarter.\nOur mini mill performance also continues to be the industry leader, further widening its performance versus other mini mill producers.\nOur position as a mini mill leader creates the perfect platform for high-return investments in capabilities that expand our margins, reduces our carbon and capital intensity and furthers our customer value proposition for sustainable green steel solutions.\nThose investments continue to be supported by strong liquidity, and we are moving forward with investments that create enduring value while rewarding stockholders for the progress weve made so far.\nslide seven expands on what makes U.S. Steel unique and why Best for All will continue to grow the competitive advantages of U.S. Steel.\nWe are investing to get better, not bigger, and expanding our three competitive advantages that differentiate us versus the competitors.\nFirst, low-cost iron ore; second, lower greenhouse gas emission mini mill steelmaking; and third, best-in-class finishing capabilities.\nThose competitive advantages are built on a foundation of research and innovation and deep customer relationships.\nWe are pleased to report the first step in our metallic strategy, which pivots our iron ore advantage in Minnesota toward our growing fleet of EAFs.\nWe are finalizing an agreement with a strategic partner to produce up to 500,000 tons annually of pig iron at Gary Works.\nUnder the contemplated deal, our potential partner would fund, install and operate pig iron production assets, which we would supply with excess liquid iron production.\nThis potential partnership would further enhance the cost structure of Big River Steel by in-sourcing high-value metallics while driving blast furnace efficiencies at Gary Works.\nThe permitting process has begun, and we expect pig iron production at Gary to begin in early 2023.\nThis is an efficient and quick way to expand our iron ore advantage to our mini mills, and we continue to evaluate other opportunities to extract additional value from iron ore.\nslide nine provides some additional context on our mini mill number two investment.\nLast month, we commenced the site selection process to build a new state-of-the-art mini mill.\nThis new mini mill will provide differentiated steelmaking supported by a comprehensive suite of finishing assets, including advanced high-strength steel galvanizing, hot-rolled galvanizing, painting and slitting.\nWe are expanding our mini mill steelmaking capability as we continue to transition toward sustainable, lower greenhouse gas emission steelmaking.\nThis investment is a platform to provide our customers with more of the Greens deal they expect from like-minded partners like U.S. Steel.\nWere in the process of filing permits in multiple states and are on track to begin construction as early as the first half of 2022.\nMini mill number two will be built by the same experienced construction team who built Phase 2A of Big River Steel, ahead of schedule, under budget and fully ramped in record time.\nWe expect the value-added capabilities of mini mill number two to drive an approximately $650 million of incremental EBITDA contribution from this investment once fully ramped.\nAlso yesterday, we announced plans to build a new coating line at Big River Steel.\nslide 10 has the details.\nThis line will have 325,000 tons of annual capability and will sustainably produce both Galvalum and galvanized product.\nWe expect the investment to contribute another $60 million of annual run rate EBITDA to Big Rivers already industry-leading results.\nWe expect the line to produce a mix of 75% Galvalum and 25% hot-dip galvanizing.\nGalvalum capabilities create opportunities to target the higher value construction market, including exposed building panels.\nHot dip galvanizing capabilities create additional opportunities to serve the appliance, automotive and construction markets.\nThe investments we are making at Big River are natural extensions of the Big River campus and further utilize the state-of-the-art capabilities of the facility as we provide customers with sustainable steels to help meet their own decarbonization objectives.\nAs we continue to demonstrate our industry-leading position at Big River, were excited to expand the mini mill footprint, invest in downstream capabilities and further enhance the commercial mix of our business model.\nThe progress we have made in 2021 is undeniable.\nOver the past several quarters, weve transformed our balance sheet.\nWhen we closed on the Big River Steel acquisition at the start of the year, we carried $7 billion of debt and expect to end the year with $3.9 billion.\nWeve extended the maturity profile and expect next years run rate cash interest expense to be approximately $225 million.\nOur pension plan is overfunded, an enviable position that others in our industry are not close to achieving.\nWe are in a clear position of strength.\nSo while well continue to look at the ability to delever further as debt becomes callable, we are very confident that this level of debt puts us in a sustainable and manageable position to support investments in our business.\nNext, we continue to believe the highest source of long-term value creation is from investing in expanding competitive advantages that reshape our earnings profile and reduce our capital and carbon intensity.\nOur cash and liquidity position more than supports these high-return projects and allows us to execute with confidence.\nAnd today, given the undeniable progress weve seen over the past several quarters, we are announcing enhancements to our capital allocation priorities that begin to directly reward stockholders with the improvements weve made to the business.\nWe believe the market is not rewarding us for the strong performance we expect in 2022 and is not yet recognizing the long-term value creation potential of our Best for All strategy.\nOur strong financial performance and the significant returns we believe we can generate by buying our own stock is the reason we are accelerating direct returns to stockholders.\nReinstating the $0.05 per share quarterly dividend and moving quickly on a $300 million stock buyback demonstrates our commitment to ensuring our strategy is indeed best for all.\nOur goal is to ensure direct returns become an enduring part of our capital allocation strategy, and we believe there are catalysts that could drive additional buybacks in the future.\nAside from additional free cash flow generation, we believe there are near-term opportunities to divest noncore assets, primarily real estate, which could further accelerate or increase further authorizations.\nIn addition, the option for Stelco to acquire 25% of Minntac remains in place through January of 2027 and presents an opportunity to return up to $500 million of incremental capital to stockholders.\nChristie will now provide details into our quarterly performance before I provide some thoughts on 2022.\nIll begin on slide 12.\nAs Dave mentioned earlier, the third quarter was a quarter of records.\nWe delivered adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin of over $2 billion and 34%, respectively.\nThis represents a nearly $750 million or a 58% increase over the second quarter.\nAdjusted earnings per share in the quarter was $5.36 per diluted share.\nWe also generated approximately $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, including a $400 million investment in working capital.\nWe expect another quarter of strong free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter.\nNext, let me expand on some key points related to the balance sheet.\nYear-to-date, we have repaid approximately $2.7 billion of debt and expect to end the year with $3.9 billion of debt on the balance sheet, an amount we are confident is sustainable and supports the investments we are making in our business.\nWe ended the quarter with net debt to last 12 months EBITDA of 0.6 times and expect to end the year at 0.2 times.\nWith the balance sheet strengthened, 80% of our remaining debt due in 2029 and beyond and a fully funded pension plan, we are well positioned for a future of value creation.\nLet me now transition into the individual segments, including expectations for the fourth quarter.\nOur Flat-Rolled segment delivered record EBITDA and EBITDA margin of over $1.1 billion and 32%, respectively.\nThis represents an approximately 60% improvement versus the second quarter.\nHigher selling prices flowing through our contract structure in the third quarter will likely continue to be a tailwind in the fourth quarter.\nWe expect lower volumes from our planned blast furnace outage at Gary Works and higher energy costs to be an offset.\nWe currently expect fourth quarter Flat-rolled EBITDA to be near our record third quarter performance.\nOur mini mill segment also delivered record EBITDA and EBITDA margin.\nThird quarter EBITDA was $464 million or an industry-leading 42% EBITDA margin.\nHigher prices continue to be reflected in the segment results, partially offset by higher scrap and other metallics cost.\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect higher prices to continue to flow through the segments, primarily monthly contracts.\nWe currently expect the fourth quarter to be another record for our mini mill segment, potentially exceeding $500 million of EBITDA in the fourth quarter.\nUSSK also posted record EBITDA and EBITDA margin in the third quarter.\nEBITDA was $418 million in the quarter or 33% EBITDA margin.\nA 60-day outage planned on number one blast furnace will begin in November through the remainder of the year.\nThis will remove approximately 250,000 tons of lost steel equivalent capacity from the market in the fourth quarter.\nOperational headwinds as a result of the planned outage, modestly lower shipments and changes to the pricing dynamic in Europe are expected to result in reduced fourth quarter EBITDA versus the third quarter.\nI also want to take a moment to recognize and congratulate the USSK team for completing Slovakias first revolving credit facility containing sustainability-related performance targets.\nThe new EUR300 million unsecured sustainability-linked credit agreement reinforces our commitment to creating profitable solutions for sustainable steelmaking and replaced the previous EUR460 million credit facility.\nOur Tubular segment reported similar quarter-over-quarter results.\nImproved commercial performance was largely offset by higher scrap and energy costs and continued high levels of imports.\nImports continue to capture roughly half of the U.S. tubular market.\nAnd earlier this month, we and the USW filed new OCTG trade cases.\nWe expect fourth quarter performance to be similar versus the third quarter as higher selling prices are offset by elevated scrap costs for the Fairfield EAF and continued high import levels.\nWe expect enterprise earnings in the fourth quarter to continue to reflect the strong market conditions we are seeing as we exit the year and we currently believe that our fourth quarter results will be near our record third quarter performance.\nWere entering 2022 in a great position to both create value for our stockholders and deliver value to our customers.\nWe are executing a robust contract process with customers, in most instances, having begun discussions 90 days sooner than we have historically.\nOur strategy is paying dividends.\nAssuming the forward curve, which we believe to be a pessimistic view of spot prices, we fully expect average selling prices to be higher in 2022 than 2021 for our Flat-rolled segment.\nWeve also listened to our customers and in some instances, have signed agreements beyond 12 months.\nThis creates longer uplift and supply continuity while fostering collaborative product development opportunities to solve their most difficult challenges.\nFinally, we continue discussions on commercial terms for more than just price.\nLeveraging continued strong interest in advanced high-strength steels, our planned NGL electrical steel line and other future sustainable steel offerings from U.S. Steel.\nCustomers value domestic supply chain and we value their partnership.\nWe are delighted to hear from multiple auto customers who are foreshadowing that the trough of the chip shortage could be behind us.\nThey are beginning to add to the fourth quarter and first quarter build schedules and indicating to us increasing usage rates starting as early as next week.\nKevin, lets move to Q&A.\nWe ask that you each please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up so everyone has the opportunity to ask a question.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer.\nOur remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP.\nWe also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.\nI hope you and your loved ones remain safe and healthy as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect all of our professional and personal lives.\nIn the second quarter, we delivered better-than-expected results given uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn terms of numbers, our revenue grew 4% operationally, with the U.S. segment up 6% and International up 3%.\nOur companion animal products continue to drive our business performance, with 13% operational growth, while livestock products declined 5%.\nOur adjusted net income increased 4% operationally in the second quarter.\nWe have built a very strong companion animal portfolio over the last several years based on our internal innovation.\nAnd these products helped offset some of the deeper market challenges in the livestock market today.\nOur recently launched parasiticides, Simparica Trio, ProHeart 12 and Revolution Plus as well as our key dermatology portfolio of Apoquel and Cytopoint, provide a solid foundation that has continued to perform well this year.\nWe continue to be very pleased with the performance of our new triple-combination parasiticide for dogs, Simparica Trio as well as the strength of the overall Simparica franchise.\nGlenn will share more details in his remarks.\nOur continued focus on meaningful innovation and the diversity of our portfolio across species, products and geographies remain core advantages for Zoetis during times of economic uncertainty.\nAnd we've also seen the essential nature of animal health playing an important role in the resiliency of our business and our industry at this time.\nIn terms of COVID-19, our veterinary and producer customers are under increased pressure to deliver critical animal care and maintain a reliable global food supply, and we are fortunate to be able to support them in this mission.\nWe continue to put the safety of our colleagues and customers first during this pandemic, and we've been very pleased with our team's ability to maintain productivity, even with safety and social distancing adjustments at our facilities as well as the ongoing use of remote work arrangements for the majority of our colleagues.\nOur field force has returned to meeting with customers in many geographies based on local guidance and practices.\nWe monitor and adapt these plans on a daily basis based on local feedback and adjustments in markets that may be experiencing increased COVID-19 cases.\nOur teams are excited to be back out with our customers, but we're also preserving the lessons we have learned from effective online interactions, webinars and e-commerce to evolve our sales and support.\nIn terms of supply chain, Zoetis has maintained a reliable inventory of critical medicines, vaccines and diagnostics to our customers and distributors in more than 100 markets around the world.\nAnd our research development programs remain on track in terms of filings, clinical trials and interactions with regulatory agencies.\nWe remain confident in the progress of regulatory reviews of our monoclonal antibody candidates for pain in cats and dogs.\nOur submissions are proceeding as expected.\nThis year continues to be uncharted territory due to COVID-19 and the related trends affecting our customers.\nHowever, the underlying demand for healthy pets and a reliable source of protein remains fundamental to the global economy.\nIn the second quarter, we benefited from the veterinary clinics in the U.S. recovering much more quickly from the COVID-19 impact than we anticipated.\nVeterinary practices in the U.S. adapted quickly to curbside visits and mobile clinics to deliver critical care and maintain relationships with their customers.\nWe also saw an acceleration of companion animal product sales through e-commerce channels as a result of the lockdowns in many states.\nVeterinarians and pet owners are adapting more quickly to these online options as a way to fill prescriptions for parasiticides and other medicines.\nWe also know people are spending more time at home with their pets.\nThey may be observing conditions such as itchiness or pain, which have previously gone unnoticed.\nAnd so we are actually seeing an increase in spend per visit in U.S. clinics.\nMeanwhile, outside the U.S., companion animal veterinary clinic performance has been in line with expectations despite wide market-by-market variations based on local dynamics.\nFor Zoetis, we expect our overall revenue growth for the remainder of the year to be driven largely by companion animal products, especially our parasiticides and key dermatology portfolio.\nWe plan to continue investing in direct-to-consumer advertising and digital marketing to support these products.\nLivestock is a very different picture and remains very challenged by the pandemic, especially in the U.S. Producers are adjusting to new market demands and distribution needs from foodservice and restaurant channels to more grocery and retail channels, while also managing ongoing labor, safety and trade issues.\nAs expected, U.S. livestock in the second quarter saw a significant downturn as we expect that to remain a challenge for the rest of the year.\nThe pace of return to more foodservice and restaurant demand, along with increased export opportunities, will be the most significant factors in the recovery of livestock producers in the U.S. Internationally, livestock grew and performed in line with expectations across a diverse set of markets.\nWe saw very positive results in places like China, where they're further along in their COVID-19 recovery, but we will be sensitive to see how Latin America and markets like Brazil perform in the remainder of the year due to COVID.\nAs we look ahead, we remain focused on advancing our five key priorities to ensure our long-term success, driving innovative growth, enhancing customer experience, leading in digital and data analytics, cultivating a high-performing organization and championing a healthier, more sustainable future.\nWe've continued to make important investments in products and innovations across the continuum of care from prediction and prevention to detection and treatment of disease, Supporting successful launches as well as new life cycle innovations and expansions of major products into new markets continue to be the cornerstones of our durable and steady performance.\nIn the second quarter, we expanded major vaccine franchises with the approval of our Vanguard B Oral for dogs in Brazil and our Fostera Gold PCV MH and Fostera Gold PCVMetastim for vaccines for pigs in Australia.\nWe also continue to strengthen our diagnostic and digital capabilities, building on recent acquisitions in point-of-care and reference labs, along with additional investments.\nWe plan to launch a new diagnostic platform for pet care in the third quarter called VetScan Imagyst.\nWe are very excited about the potential for this disruptive innovation, which will be the first system to bring clinical pathology right to the point of care.\nThis new multipurpose platform uses a combination of image recognition technology, algorithms and cloud-based artificial intelligence to deliver rapid testing results to the clinic.\nIts first indication will be for testing fecal samples for parasites, making it quick and easy to test and treat pets in the same visit.\nWe'll have more to say in the coming weeks as we prepare for a global launch.\nWe also view diagnostics as playing an important role in the continuum of care for fish.\nIn the second quarter, we acquired Fish Vet Group to add more diagnostic tools to our aquaculture portfolio, including environmental testing, which is critical to fish farming.\nFinally, at Zoetis, our key priority around high-performing teams is tied to creating a culture where all colleagues feel valued and included and is reflected in our commitment to promoting inclusion, diversity and equity across our organization.\nOur leadership and Board are dedicated to being a force for positive change across the globe to drive greater equity and inclusion.\nAnd we have dedicated financial and people resources to do so.\nNow let me hand off to Glenn, who will speak more about our second quarter results and updated guidance for the full year.\nI hope everyone is safe, healthy and adapting to what is certainly an unprecedented time for all of us.\nToday, I will provide additional commentary on our Q2 financial results, provide an update on our liquidity position and review our improved full year 2020 guidance.\nBeginning with the second quarter results.\nWe generated revenue of $1.5 billion, which was flat on a reported basis and 4% growth operationally.\nAdjusted net income of $427 million decreased 2% on a reported basis and increased 4% operationally.\nForeign exchange in the quarter had an unfavorable impact of 4% on revenue.\nThis was driven primarily by the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Brazilian real, Australian dollar, Mexican peso and euro.\nOperational revenue growth of 4% was driven by 2% price and 2% volume.\nVolume growth of 2% includes 3% from new products, 3% from key dermatology products, 1% from acquisitions and a decline of 5% in other in-line products.\nCompanion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 13% operationally, while livestock declined 5% operationally.\nCompanion animal performance was driven by our parasiticide portfolio, which includes sales of Simparica Trio in the U.S., Canada and certain European markets and our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint.\nRevenue from the acquisition of Platinum Performance and its nutritional products, acquired in the second half of 2019, drove the growth in equine.\nLivestock declines in the quarter were driven by challenges to our U.S. livestock portfolio.\nSupply chain disruptions caused by reduced animal processing capacity and shifts in consumer demand from restaurant and foodservice to grocery stores affected our customers' purchasing decisions.\nThis decline was partially offset by strong performance internationally with growth in swine, fish and poultry.\nNew products contributed 3% to overall growth in the quarter, driven by Simparica Trio, ProHeart 12, Revolution Plus and our Alpha Flux parasiticide for salmon in Chile.\nWe remain excited by the launch of Simparica Trio and are reaffirming the range of $100 million to $125 million for full year incremental revenue.\nTrio have been more robust and cannibalization of Simparica has been less than we anticipated.\nGlobal sales of our key dermatology portfolio were $224 million in the quarter, growing 24% operationally and contributing 3% to overall revenue growth.\nRecent acquisitions contributed 1% growth this quarter, which includes Platinum Performance and our reference lab expansion strategy.\nNow let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter.\nU.S. revenue grew 6%, with companion animal products growing 19% and livestock products declining by 18%.\nCompanion animal growth in the quarter was driven by sales of the Simparica franchise, our key dermatology products and the impact of recent acquisitions.\nU.S. key dermatology sales were $160 million for the quarter, growing 26%.\nThe continued strength of this portfolio was driven by expanded usage of both Cytopoint and Apoquel benefiting from our direct-to-consumer campaign, uptake in e-commerce channels and pet owners spending more time with their pets as a result of COVID-19.\nSimparica Trio performed well in the U.S. with sales of $36 million despite challenging market conditions in Q2.\nWe are observing several positive trends, including rapid uptake in clinics that have adopted Trio, smaller-than-expected cannibalization of Simparica, sales coming from new patients to the category and taking share from current oral flea and tick competitors.\nDiagnostic sales increased 18% in the quarter, largely driven by our reference lab acquisitions.\nIn addition, previous instrument placements created a solid foundation for consumables growth in the second quarter.\nU.S. livestock declined 18% in the quarter, driven by lower sales across all species.\nIn the second quarter, we faced challenges with significant declines in feedlot placements, reduced demand from the foodservice industry and the effects that had throughout the food supply chain and our customers, in addition to increased competition.\nTo summarize, U.S. performance was strong in a difficult market environment.\nAnd the diversity of our portfolio, again, proved beneficial as growth in companion animal offset the challenges faced in the U.S. by our livestock portfolio.\nOur International segment had operational revenue growth of 3% in the second quarter, with more balanced performance across our companion animal and livestock portfolios.\nCompanion animal operational revenue growth was 2% and livestock operational growth was 4%.\nIncreased sales in companion animal products was a result of growth in our key dermatology portfolio and our Simparica franchise, including the launch of Simparica Trio in Canada.\nWhile European markets were impacted significantly by COVID-19, the decline was offset by significant growth in other markets, including Japan and China.\nDiagnostics had a difficult quarter as wide-scale clinic closures resulting from COVID-19 limited the ability to place instruments and negatively impacted consumable usage.\nInternational livestock growth in the quarter was driven by swine, fish and poultry.\nSwine grew double digits in the quarter, primarily driven by China, which grew 25%, as key accounts continue to expand their herds and production shifts from smaller farms to larger-scale operations.\nOur fish portfolio delivered another strong quarter.\nWe saw favorable conditions in Chile and Norway that resulted in vaccinations being accelerated into Q2.\nIn addition, we continue to see an uptake of the Alpha Flux parasiticide in Chile.\nOverall, our international segment was again a positive contributor to revenue growth, with performance in swine, companion animal, fish and poultry more than offsetting decline in cattle resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L.\nAdjusted gross margin of 71.1% increased slightly on a reported basis compared to the prior year due to price, favorable manufacturing costs and product mix, which were partially offset by foreign exchange, recent acquisitions and higher inventory charges.\nAdjusted operating expenses were flat operationally.\nThe incremental advertising and promotion expenses related to Simparica Trio, recent acquisitions and R&D increases were largely offset by reductions to T&E and compensation-related costs as a result of COVID-19.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.3%.\nThe increase versus prior year is driven by the jurisdictional mix of earnings and the impact of discrete tax benefits recorded in Q2 2019.\nAdjusted net income for the quarter grew 4% operationally, primarily driven by revenue growth, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 6% operationally.\nNext, I'd like to cover our liquidity position and our capital allocation priorities.\nWe ended the second quarter with approximately $3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, including the proceeds from our $1.25 billion long-term debt issuance in May, of which $500 million is earmarked for repayment of our November 2020 maturity.\nWe have access to a $1 billion revolving credit facility and a coinciding commercial paper program, both of which remain undrawn.\nGiven our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we remain committed to our capital allocation priorities for internal investment, M&A and returning excess cash to shareholders.\nConsistent with what I mentioned last quarter, we still anticipate elevated capital expenditures this year to support investments in manufacturing, information technology to support our recent acquisitions and capabilities in digital and data analytics.\nWith regard to returning excess cash to shareholders, we remain committed to our 2020 dividend, which represents a 22% increase over 2019.\nIn Q1, we repurchased $250 million in Zoetis shares before suspending the program in the second quarter in order to conserve cash.\nWe have approximately $1.4 billion remaining under our multiyear share repurchase program.\nNow moving on to our updated guidance assumptions for 2020.\nOur past performance has always given us confidence that the essential nature of our business, our diverse portfolio and the innovation we consistently bring to our customers would position us well during difficult market conditions.\nAfter assessing recent trends and our performance in the second quarter, we are further refining and raising our full year 2020 guidance.\nWe expect recent positive companion animal trends in the U.S. will continue, although vet clinic revenue may moderate somewhat as pent-up demand works its way through the system.\nThe more recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases in parts of the U.S., and expanding rates of infection in international markets continues to create uncertainty around the duration, scope and economic impact of the pandemic.\nPlease note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of mid-July.\nAnd given our global footprint, movement in foreign exchange has had an impact on revenue and adjusted net income since we issued our prior guidance in May.\nOur current guidance includes favorable foreign exchange revenue of approximately $50 million and approximately $10 million at adjusted net income versus May guidance.\nFor revenue, we are raising and narrowing our guidance range with projected revenue now between $6.3 billion and $6.475 billion and operational revenue growth of between 3% and 6% for the full year versus a negative 2% to positive 3% we had in our May guidance.\nAdjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of between $1.685 billion and $1.765 billion, representing operational growth, a positive 1% to positive 5% compared to our prior guidance of negative 9% to negative 2%.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $3.52 to $3.68 and reported diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.14 to $3.32.\nIn closing, while the COVID-19 pandemic has certainly presented a set of challenges we have not seen in the past, we are extremely proud of our colleagues and the commitments they have shown toward our customers, our company and animal healthcare.\nDuring this time, we have demonstrated the diversity and durability of our portfolio, the resiliency of our industry.\nAnd we have confidence in our ability to continue to execute on our strategy during these uncertain times.\nSummary: ",
