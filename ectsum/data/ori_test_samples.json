    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:And we have prepared slides to supplement our comments today.\nI'm Pankaj Gupta, Dow investor relations vice president.\nBecause these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties.\nDow's Forms 10-Q and 10-K include detailed discussions of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences.\nUnless otherwise specified, all financials, where applicable, excludes significant items.\nWe will also refer to non-GAAP measures.\nOn Slide 2, you will see our agenda for the call.\nJim will begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year highlights, and operating segment performance.\nHoward will then share our outlook and modeling guidance.\nAnd then Jim will discuss how we will continue to execute on our priorities to deliver value growth.\nBeginning with Slide 3.\nIn the fourth quarter, Dow once again delivered top and bottom-line growth year over year, with sales growth and margin expansion in every operating segment.\nOur results reflect the strength and resilience of our advantaged portfolio and the incredible efforts of the Dow team, as we continue to ensure well-being and safety of our team and our communities.\nWe delivered year-over-year sales growth of 34% with gains in every operating segment, business, and region.\nWhile volume declined 4% year over year due to supply constraints from several factors, including our own maintenance, lingering effects of weather-related outages, and global logistics challenges, we continued to see robust underlying demand across our end markets, particularly for higher-margin downstream and sustainability-led applications.\nPrices were up 39% year over year, reflecting gains in all operating segments, businesses, and regions.\nOur discipline and agility enabled us to navigate the supply constraints and logistics challenges I just mentioned, dual control actions in China, and rising energy costs.\nWe delivered operating EBIT growth of $1.2 billion year over year with margin expansion in every operating segment.\nEquity earnings were also up year over year with margin expansion at our joint ventures in Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and Kuwait.\nThese results translated into significant cash generation for the quarter, with cash flow from operations of $2.6 billion, up $901 million year over year, and cash flow conversion of 88%.\nAnd we returned $912 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $512 million through our industry-leading dividend and $400 million in share repurchases.\nOur performance in the fourth quarter capped a record year for Dow, which you will see highlighted on Slide 4.\nIn 2021, Team Dow capitalized on the economic recovery, achieving record sales and earnings performance despite pandemic-driven uncertainty and industrywide weather-related challenges.\nOur focus on cash flow and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to deliver on our financial priorities.\nWe achieved $7.1 billion of cash flow from operations, bringing our total cash flow from operations since spin to $18 billion.\nWe enhanced our balance sheet by reducing gross debt by another $2.4 billion in the year, bringing down gross debt by more than $5 billion since spin.\nWe have also no substantive debt maturities until 2026.\nWe proactively funded our U.S. pension plans and successfully executed Sadara's debt reprofiling, lowering Dow's guarantees by more than $2 billion.\nDow has returned a total $7.3 billion to shareholders since spin through our dividend and share repurchases, including $3.1 billion in 2021.\nAnd we kept capex well within D&A as we continue to invest in our higher-return and faster-payback growth investments.\nIn 2021, we achieved a return on invested capital of greater than 22% on strong earnings growth.\nAs we turn the corner on the pandemic, we do so with a strong balance sheet and a deliberate and disciplined strategy to decarbonize and grow.\nWe achieved this record financial performance in 2021 while advancing our ESG leadership.\nImportantly, we announced our disciplined strategy to decarbonize our assets while improving underlying EBITDA by more than $3 billion as we capitalize on our participation in attractive, high-growth end markets and sustainability-driven solutions.\nOur ESG efforts continue to be recognized externally as we were recently recognized by JUST Capital for the third year.\nDow earns the top spot in the chemicals sector overall, as well as the No.\n1 position in the workers and stakeholders in governance categories in the industry.\nI'm extremely proud of Team Dow's dedication to deliver for our customers and drive value for all of our stakeholders.\nWe will build on these achievements in 2022 as we advance our ambition.\nMoving to our operating segment performance for the fourth quarter on Slide 5.\nIn the packaging and specialty plastics segment, operating EBIT was $1.4 billion, up $662 million year over year, primarily due to margin improvement and partly offset by lower-supply volumes.\nSequentially, operating EBIT was down $512 million, and operating EBIT margins declined by 520 basis points on lower olefin and co-product pricing, combined with higher raw material costs and energy costs.\nThe packaging and specialty plastics business reported higher net sales year over year, driven by price gains in all regions, as well as in key applications, such as flexible food, industrial, and consumer packaging.\nVolume declined year over year, primarily in Asia-Pacific, due to supply constraints.\nMoving to the industrial intermediates and infrastructure segment, operating EBIT was 595 million, up 299 million year over year, primarily due to continued price strength.\nSequentially, operating EBIT was down $118 million, and operating EBIT margins declined 280 basis points, primarily driven by higher energy costs in Europe and our planned maintenance turnaround activity.\nThe polyurethanes and construction chemicals business increased net sales compared to the year-ago period on broad-based price gains in all regions.\nVolume declines were primarily due to a planned transition, away from a low-margin co-producer contract and our planned maintenance turnaround activity.\nThe industrial solutions business delivered a net sales improvement compared to the year-ago period with local price gains in all regions.\nVolume was flat year over year as higher volume from a renewable energy contract was offset by fewer licensing and catalysts sales.\nAnd finally, the performance materials and coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $295 million compared to 50 million in the year-ago period, as margins increased 900 basis points due to strong price momentum for silicones and coatings offerings.\nSequentially, operating EBID improved $11 million as price gains were partly offset by our planned maintenance turnaround activity.\nThe consumer solutions business achieved higher net sales year over year, with local price gains in all regions and across end market applications.\nVolume declined as strong demand, particularly for industrial, electronics, and personal care applications, was offset by lower supply availability due to our own decision to pull forward maintenance activity to coincide with dual-control actions in China.\nThe coatings and performance monomers business achieved increased net sales year over year, as higher raw material costs and strong industry demand led to price gains in all regions.\nand Canada, was more than offset by lower merchant sales of acrylic monomers, partly due to Dow's own higher captive use.\nTurning to Slide 6, our diversified portfolio continues to enable us to capitalize on attractive end market trends with higher-margin downstream products.\nOur four primary market verticals are each growing at rates of 1.3 to 1.5 times GDP and benefiting from sustainability macro trends.\nWe are meeting this demand with higher-margin solutions, such as functional polymers, alkoxylates, surfactants, polyurethane systems, sustainable coatings, and performance silicones.\nIn the packaging vertical, demand for lower carbon emissions, recyclable, and circular materials are driving demand for Dow's industry-leading plastics portfolio and in-house application design capabilities.\nDow's broad suite of products and hybrid innovations targeting infrastructure will continue to benefit from government investments and incentives, with particular demand resiliency in the Americas, Europe, as well as in the Middle East, Africa, and India.\nWe see global demand across the diverse consumer market vertical remaining at elevated levels, particularly for applications like electronics, 5G, appliances, pharma, and home care, where several of Dow's growth investments are targeted.\nAnd in mobility, Dow's portfolio of specialty silicones, polyurethanes, and elastomers is uniquely positioned to benefit from growing electric and autonomous vehicle trends.\nImportantly, these attractive market verticals are supported by favorable balances across our key value chains, with continued strength across consumer and industrial end markets, which we'll see on Slide 7.\nWe expect the economic recovery to continue as forecasts call for above historical average global GDP growth in 2022.\nWhile the omicron variant has resulted in some near-term disruption, we do not expect it to materially change the current recovery path, particularly as global immunization levels and treatment options continue to increase.\nSeveral factors support continued strength across our end markets.\nConsumer balance sheets remain healthy, with significant pent-up demand driven by more than $5 trillion in additional savings accumulated through the pandemic.\nManufacturing growth is expected to remain robust, supported by increasing investments in infrastructure and accelerated adoption for 5G, EV, and sustainability trends.\nAnd with retail inventories remaining low and backlogs elevated, easing supply chain issues should unleash additional volume growth in 2022, as manufacturing activity increases to meet strong consumer demand.\nThis will certainly be a focus for Dow as we work closely with our customers to fill order backlogs and replenish inventories to meet the robust demand and increased service levels.\nTurning to Slide 8.\nIn the first quarter, we expect these demand trends to drive growth, particularly following the Chinese Lunar New Year.\nDemand remains resilient in packaging and specialty plastics.\nAlthough domestic polyethylene supply improved through the fourth quarter, comonomer supply remains constrained.\nAnd trade sources are predicting another year of higher-than-average turnaround activity.\nThese factors, coupled with improvements in shipping logistics that will help meet demand in the export market, are leading to more constructive supply and-demand balances domestically.\nEquity earnings are expected to be lower sequentially due to rising feedstock costs impacting Asian olefin margins.\nAnd we anticipate higher raw material and energy costs, particularly in Europe and Asia.\nAltogether, we anticipate an approximately $200 million impact versus the prior quarter for this segment.\nUtilizing our best-in-class feedstock flexibility and our differentiated portfolio, Dow will continue to be agile to mitigate potential volatility and meet demand.\nIn industrial intermediates and infrastructure, strong demand for our high-value materials in appliances, construction, pharma, home care, and energy applications, combined with tight supply and increased global infrastructure investment, are supporting a constructive demand outlook.\nWe anticipate approximately a $100 million benefit in this segment from completed turnarounds in the fourth quarter, including Sadara's isocyanate facility and several in our core polyurethane business.\nAnd we expect the elevated energy costs in Europe will be a $75 million impact versus the prior quarter for this segment.\nIn performance materials and coatings, increasing industrial activity and consumer demand for electronics and construction continues to outpace supply for our differentiated silicone products.\nThe industry also anticipates resilient demand for architectural coatings as rebuilding from low inventory levels in preparation for the Northern Hemisphere spring and summer months.\nThe completion of our turnaround in the fourth quarter at our siloxane facility in China will allow us to take advantage of tight global market conditions as silicon metal supplies improve and energy curtailments in China continue to ease.\nWe will also be executing a turnaround at our methacrylates facility in Deer Park.\nAll in, we expect a $25 million net tailwind versus the prior quarter from turnarounds for this segment.\nTurning to the full year.\nWe're continuing to provide our best estimates of several income statement and cash flow drivers.\nNotably, we expect lower equity earnings sequentially due to margin compression versus the tighter conditions in 2021, particularly in Asia as oil remains constructive, putting upward pressure on the naphtha-based feedstock costs in the region.\nTotal turnaround spending for the year will be up approximately $100 million versus 2021 as we have another heavy turnaround year with three crackers slated for maintenance activity and increased inflationary pressure on materials and labor.\nNet interest expense is expected to be approximately $600 million, benefiting from our proactive deleveraging actions since spin.\nFor cash flow, we anticipate higher joint venture dividends from increased earnings in 2021 and a $1 billion tailwind toward pension-related items following our actions last year.\nContinued investment in our digital initiatives will drive efficiency and enable us to achieve our $300 million EBITDA run rate on the program by 2025.\nWe will also complete the spending portion of our restructuring program which is now delivering a full $300 million EBITDA run rate as we enter 2022.\nAnd finally, as we highlighted at our investor day, we anticipate increasing our capital expenditures to $2.2 billion, well within our DNA target, as we continue to advance our higher return, faster payback projects, and execute on our decarbonize and grow strategy.\nOverall, the macroeconomic backdrop remains favorable in 2022.\nAnd Dow is well positioned due to our global footprint, feedstock flexibility, productivity programs, and sustainable solutions for our customers.\nWe will continue to leverage these advantages as we navigate higher oil prices and continue to deal with inflation and logistics challenges.\nAnd as the year progresses, we intend to drive operating rates and service levels higher and do expect widening oil to gas spreads.\nTurning to Slide 10.\nAt our investor day in October, we laid out our disciplined strategy to decarbonize and grow the company, supported by a series of inflight earnings growth programs that will drive over $3 billion in underlying EBITDA growth.\nIn 2022, our capital and operating investments are on track to deliver $200 million to $300 million in run-rate EBITDA and will serve higher-margin, differentiated applications where demand is accelerating, as customers work to reduce their own carbon footprint.\nIn packaging and specialty plastics, our Fort Saskatchewan expansion completed last year will deliver a full year of earnings growth to support increasing polyethylene demand.\nAnd our FCDh pilot plant in Louisiana will start up this year to produce propylene for coatings, electronics, and durables end markets.\nNotably, the technology enables lower capex, opex, and CO2 emissions compared to conventional PDH technologies.\nThese projects serve faster-growing, more sustainable market segments, such as renewables, to drive lower carbon emissions for our customers.\nFor example, our endurance compounds for cable systems support next-generation, longer-life, and lower-carbon emissions infrastructure, including on and offshore wind farms, by reducing the cable manufacturing carbon emissions footprint by 80%.\nAnd our ENGAGE elastomers deliver 35% improved performance and efficiency for solar photovoltaic applications.\nIn industrial intermediates and infrastructure, our alkoxylates and PU systems expansion projects are closely linked with brand owner demand for higher value, differentiated downstream applications across home and consumer care, agricultural, and infrastructure end markets.\nFor example, our surfactants offer an improved environmental profile for leading brand owner laundry and home care products.\nAnd our polyurethane system, PASCAL technology, enables up to 10% greater energy efficiency and appliances without raising manufacturing costs.\nIn performance materials and coatings, we're expanding capacity in formulated solutions for coatings and silicones through incremental debottlenecking projects.\nOur products enable higher-performing, more sustainable solutions, targeting mobility, consumer, and infrastructure end markets.\nFor example, FASTRACK coatings enable autonomous mobility infrastructure and have approximately 45% lower greenhouse gas emissions.\nAnd our DOWSIL technology enables higher-density, lower-cost battery packs for the fast-growing electric vehicle market.\nFinally, as Howard mentioned, our restructuring program and digital investment will continue to support our low-cost operating model and top-quartile cost structure.\nTurning to Slide 11.\nThe increasing demand for sustainable products represents a significant growth opportunity for Dow with attractive pricing that will support longer-term, higher-quality earnings.\nOur customers are looking for opportunities to enhance their sustainability.\nAnd we are meeting those needs with lower-carbon emissions solutions beginning with our own operations.\nOur Alberta project will decarbonize approximately 20% of Dow's global ethylene capacity while growing our global polyethylene supply by about 15%.\nWe are also working with our suppliers to reduce our Scope 3 carbon emissions.\nTo date, we have more than 150 supplier agreements in place and have adopted third-party frameworks like CDP, together for sustainability and EcoVadis to drive tangible improvements in environmental performance along the value chain.\nWe continue to advance a circular economy for plastics and see a consistent trend across our brand owner customer base toward redesigning packages to be recyclable and incorporating 30% post-consumer recycled content in their packaging by 2030.\nSix of our largest sites have now received International Sustainability and Carbon Certification PLUS recognition for tracking the use of sustainable feedstocks.\nWe're advancing our partnership with Mura Technology to scale advanced recycling solutions and secure circular product supply.\nMura broke ground on the new plant with an expected start-up around the end of the year.\nEarlier this month, we announced an investment in Mr. Green Africa, the first recycling company in Africa to be a Certified B Corporation, which includes socially responsible waste collection and plans to codevelop new flexible plastic packaging that will enable more sustainable packaging solutions.\nA first-of-its-kind investment for Dow in Africa, this business model will be scaled to other developing regions around the world.\nWe continue to grow our recyclable offerings, recently doubling sales with Chinese laundry brand, Liby, and increasing our addressable market opportunities.\nAnd like the partnerships, Dow recently announced to source pyrolysis oil from Gunvor and New Hope Energy.\nThese investments in circularity are examples of our progress and solid foundation as we grow and scale circular solutions.\nTo close, on Slide 12, 2021 was an outstanding year for Team Dow.\nWe delivered record financial performance and continued our disciplined execution of our strategic priorities.\nBuilding on this foundation, we're focused on advancing our plan to decarbonize our assets and grow earnings.\nOur competitive advantage enables us to meet the increasing needs of our customers and consumers who are demanding more circular and sustainable products while we work to achieve zero carbon emissions in our own operations.\nAnd as we look ahead, our priorities remain consistent.\nOur focus on profitable growth, while maintaining a low-cost position and best-owner mindset, will enable us to deliver on our earnings growth levers.\nWe'll continue to maintain our balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation, driving higher returns for the company and our shareholders while retaining the financial flexibility that has served us well.\nAnd we'll continue to advance our leadership in ESG with a clear path to achieve our zero carbon circularity and sustainability targets.\nThe world and our customers are demanding a more sustainable future.\nAs we execute our ambition, I am confident that we will create significant, long-term value for all of our stakeholders.\nOperator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today.\nOn the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's chairman and CEO, and Frank Connor, our chief financial officer.\nRevenues in the quarter were $3.3 billion, down from $3.7 billion in last year's fourth quarter.\nDuring this year's fourth quarter, we reported income from continuing operations of $0.93 per share.\nIn the quarter, we recorded $5 million in pre-tax special charges related to our 2020 restructuring plan or $0.01 per share after tax.\nExcluding these special charges, adjusted income from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.94 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $1.06 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nSegment profit in the quarter was $310 million, down $14 million from the fourth quarter of 2020.\nManufacturing cash flow before pension contributions totaled $298 million in the quarter.\nFor the full year, revenues were $12.4 billion, up $731 million from last year.\nAdjusted income from continuing operations was $3.30 per share compared to $2.07 per share in 2020.\nManufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $1.1 billion, up from $596 million in 2020.\nOur business has closed out the year with another solid quarter.\nAt aviation, we continue to see favorable market conditions, including improved aircraft utilization, low preowned inventory levels and strong customer demand.\nOrder activity remained very strong with backlog growth of $655 million in the quarter and $2.5 billion for the full year, resulting in a $4.1 billion backlog at year-end.\nAs a result, we delivered aircraft on a more linear trend through the year, which improved manufacturing efficiency and cash flow generation.\nReflecting this improved operating environment and strong execution of our teams, aviation achieved a segment margin of 10.1% in the fourth quarter.\nFor the year, we delivered 167 jets, up from 132 last year and 125 commercial turboprops, up from 113 in 2020.\nAlso in the year, we saw sequentially higher aftermarket revenue on a quarterly basis driven by increased aircraft utilization.\nMoving to defense, aviation was awarded a $143 million contract for eight AT-6 aircraft, ground support equipment, spare parts and training from the Royal Thai Air Force.\nThis contract establishes Thailand as the international launch customer for the U.S. Air Force's latest light attack aircraft.\nOn the new product front, the Beechcraft Denali completed its first plate in November, launching the start of the flight test program.\nTotal revenues were down slightly in the quarter, largely on lower military revenues as expected, reflecting the continued wind down of the H-1 production program, partially offset by higher commercial revenues.\nIn December, Bell completed the first assault improvement modifications of an Air Force CV-22 Osprey.\nThis effort is part of an ongoing process to upgrade the Air Force Osprey fleet.\nOn the commercial side of Bell, we delivered 156 helicopters in 2021, up from 140 in 2020.\nWe also saw solid commercial order activity for the year, reflecting broad-based demand.\nMoving to Textron Systems.\nWe saw another strong quarter of execution that contributed to a full year margin of 14.8%, up 320 basis points from 2020.\nDuring the quarter, we delivered the fourth Ship-to-Shore Connector to the U.S. Navy after its successful completion of acceptance trials.\nOn the Shadow program, systems was awarded an $82 million logistics support contract for 2022.\nOn our common unmanned surface vessel platform, we completed file testing related to the unmanned influenced sweep system program, setting up potential for a production contract award in the first quarter of 2022.\nRevenues were lower in the quarter as we continue to experience supply chain challenges, including order disruptions in Kautex related to global auto OEM production schedules.\nAt Textron specialized vehicles, we continue to see a strong pricing environment and steady retail demand.\nDespite the ongoing supply chain challenges, both businesses saw sequential revenue improvements in the quarter.\nIn summary, there were many items to highlight in 2021 across our segments.\nIn aviation, strong order activity and customer demand throughout the year drove $2.5 billion of backlog growth.\nOn the new product front, we continued our product refresh strategy with the introduction of the Citation M2 XLS and CJ4 Gen2 aircraft.\nSky Courier completed the flight test program with 2,100 hours of flight test activity, and we expect FAA certification in the first half of 2022.\nAt Bell, we continued our work on the FVL programs.\nWe submitted the proposal for the FLRAA program in September, and the U.S. Army is expected to award the FLRAA program contract in 2022.\nOn FARA, we've made significant progress on the 360 Invictus prototype build with 75% of the effort complete at year-end.\nWe opened the Bell Manufacturing Technology Center, an innovative proving ground to test and refine technologies and processes across Bell's core production capabilities.\nTextron Systems, ATAC continued to grow its fleet of certified F1 aircraft in support of increased demand on U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corp tactical air programs.\nWe continued our innovation and development activities with the rollout of the Ripsaw M5 prototype vehicle for the U.S. Army and the Cottonmouth ARV for the Marine Corps.\nAt Textron specialized vehicles, we entered into a strategic collaboration with GM, which will assist our ground support equipment business and electrification of baggage tractors, cargo tractors and belt loaders for use in airports globally.\nWe also introduced the Liberty, the industry's first PTV to offer four forward-facing seats in a compact golf cart-sized platform powered by lithium-ion battery.\nAt Kautex in 2021, we were awarded eight contracts on new vehicle programs for our hybrid electric fuel systems.\nLooking to 2022 at aviation, we are projecting growth driven by increased deliveries across all product lines and higher aftermarket volume.\nAt Bell 2022 represents the beginning of a transitional period as we expect lower revenues related to military production programs while awaiting a downselect and award on the FLRAA program.\nAt systems, we're expecting flat revenue with growth on ship-to-store and tactical air programs, offset by lower fee-for-service volume.\nIn industrial, we're expecting revenue growth and margin improvement.\nWithin Kautex, we expect increasing volumes from improving OEM auto production.\nWhile specialized vehicles, we anticipate improving supply chain conditions and increasing volumes across our products.\nEarlier in 2021, we launched our eAviation initiative to leverage the resources and expertise across our aviation businesses to develop new opportunities in aircraft-utilizing electric propulsion systems.\nIn 2022, we plan to expand these efforts and increase our investment in developing technologies to accelerate the shift to sustainable flight, including eVTOL and fixed-wing aircraft.\nWith this backdrop, we're projecting revenues of about $13.3 billion for Textron's 2022 financial guidance.\nWe're projecting earnings per share in the range of $3.80 to $4 per share.\nManufacturing cash flow before pension contributions is expected to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million.\nLet's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron aviation revenues at Textron aviation of $1.4 billion were down $201 million from a year ago, largely due to lower aircraft volume, partially offset by higher aftermarket volume.\nSegment profit was $137 million in the fourth quarter, up $29 million from last year's fourth quarter, largely due to favorable pricing net of inflation of $21 million and improved manufacturing performance.\nBacklog in the segment ended the quarter at $4.1 billion.\nRevenues were $858 million, down $13 million from last year, reflecting lower military revenues, partially offset by higher commercial revenues.\nSegment profit was $88 million -- of $88 million was down $22 million, primarily due to lower military volume and mix.\nBacklog in the segment ended the quarter at $3.9 billion.\nAt Textron Systems, revenues were $313 million, down $44 million from last year's fourth quarter due to lower volume, which included the impact from the U.S. Army's withdrawal from Afghanistan on the segment's fee-for-service contracts.\nSegment profit of $45 million was down $4 million from a year ago, largely due to the lower volume.\nBacklog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.1 billion.\nIndustrial revenues were $781 million, down $85 million from last year, reflecting lower volume and mix of $133 million, largely in the fuel systems and functional components product line, reflecting order disruptions related to the global auto OEM supply chain shortages, partially offset by a favorable impact of $50 million for pricing largely in the specialized vehicles product line.\nSegment profit of $38 million was down $17 million from the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to lower volume and mix, partially offset by favorable impact from performance.\nFinance segment revenues were $11 million, and profit was $2 million.\nMoving below segment profit, corporate expenses, and interest expense were each $29 million.\nOur manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $298 million in the quarter and $1.1 billion for the full year.\nIn the quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares, returning $335 million in cash to shareholders.\nFor the full year, we repurchased approximately 13.5 million shares, returning $921 million of cash to shareholders.\nTurning now to our 2022 outlook.\nAt Textron aviation, we're expecting revenues of about $5.5 billion, reflecting higher deliveries across all our product lines and increased aftermarket volume.\nSegment margin is expected to be in the range of approximately 10% to 11%, reflecting higher volume, favorable pricing and increased operating leverage.\nLooking to Bell, we expect revenues of about $3 billion, reflecting lower military volume, primarily related to lower H-1 production.\nWe're forecasting a margin in the range of about 10% to 11%, largely due to the lower military volumes and continuing high levels of R&D investment.\nAt systems, we're estimating revenues of about $1.3 billion with a margin in the range of about 13.5% to 14.5%.\nAt industrial, we're expecting segment revenues of about $3.5 billion on higher volumes at Kautex and specialized vehicles.\nWe're estimating industrial margins to be in the range of about 5.5% to 6.5%.\nAt finance, we're forecasting segment profit of about $15 million.\nMoving to slide nine.\nOn a consolidated basis, we're expecting earnings per share to be in the range of $3.80 to $4 per share.\nWe're also expecting manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions to be about $700 million to $800 million, which includes an approximately $300 million impact from a change in the R&D tax law beginning in 2022.\nLooking to slide 10.\nWe're projecting about $150 million of corporate expense, which includes $30 million of investment in eAviation.\nWe're also projecting about $120 million of interest expense and a full year effective tax rate of approximately 18%.\nLooking to the other items and turning to slide 11.\nWe're estimating 2022 pension income to be about $120 million, up from $30 million last year.\nTurning to slide 12.\nR&D is expected to be about $585 million, down from $619 million last year.\nWe're estimating capex will be about $425 million, up from $375 million in 2021.\nOur outlook assumes an average share count of about 219 million shares in 2022.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:In today's remarks by management, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial metrics.\nIn fact, in the second quarter, patient volumes across our total span of services has now exceeded pre-pandemic levels.\nOn a same-unit basis, total volume was up 1.3% versus the second quarter of 2019 with hospital-based services up by 10 basis points and office-based services up by 5.2%.\nI'll add that other key metrics that were particularly volatile through last winter continued to show stable improving trends coming into the summer.\nPayer mix remained favorable on a year-over-year basis for the second consecutive quarter and the rate of admission into our NICU did so as well.\nAs a result, our revenue for the quarter of $473 million was above our internal expectations, as was our adjusted EBITDA of $66 million.\nThere are, of course, the risks that we face, most importantly, the recent rise in COVID-19 cases driven by the Delta variant.\nBut that said, our updated view for the full year includes our experience to date.\nLooking forward beyond 2021 and count for the same risks, there are a number of factors that give me increased confidence that we'll see additional growth in adjusted EBITDA in 2022 that will get us pass the $270 million run rate we achieved pre-COVID.\nI'll expand on these in three areas.\nFirst, we're building momentum in our core.\nWhile demand has recovered faster than we had anticipated earlier in the year, we are also helping to drive additional growth across our practices.\nI talked earlier this year about the investments we've made in improving patient access, better scheduling and a drive for increased pace and efficiency.\nQ2 is the first quarter where we can estimate the impact of these initiatives, and we think we've just begun by adding roughly $2 million to the top line in the quarter.\nI'm very confident that this is just the beginning of a long-term payoff.\nAnd please remember that we call this initiative patient access because it's really just that.\nWe want to make sure that patients that need our care receive our care as soon as possible.\nOur reengineered and focused sales efforts are accelerating our pipeline of organic growth.\nWe have such a superb focused and organized team that make this a reality.\nHalfway through this year, our new business bookings and by that, I mean new contract sales have already approached our total bookings for 2020.\nOur win rate has increased.\nOur time to close has decreased, and our pipeline remains robust and diversified across multiple specialties.\nOur M&A pipeline also continues to build with several acquisitions of important specialty groups completed for the year-to-date.\nAs an example, last week, Child Neurology Consultants of Austin joined the MEDNAX family.\nThis group of 12 physicians and three nurse practitioners are among the premium groups of neurologists in the country.\nThe lack of local neurology coverage is a major reason in time to transfer the way from the birth hospital.\nThis is the most recent example of investing to further support our hospital-based practices with subspecialty consultation to allow infants to stay near their homes.\nBut we believe this is also a plan for growth, both geographically and via telehealth.\nSecond, we're still in the early stages of building our presence in children's primary and urgent care.\nFollowing our acquisition of NightLight, we're now in the planning stages for new clinic openings outside of NightLight's hometown of Houston.\nWe're also working on additional investments and initiatives for primary urgent care that we believe will meaningfully accelerate this expansion.\nWe also believe that our breadth and depth in women's and children's health will enable us to actually change nationally many aspects in pediatric care.\nI look forward to doing the calls to cataloging our progress.\nThird, we're making significant progress on improving the efficiency of our practice support infrastructure.\nMark Richards will detail some of this progress, but I'll highlight our previously announced agreement with R1 to transfer our RCM operations to them, which not only gives us immediate G&A savings, but also enables improved bottom line results that I'm certain would not have been possible had we continued on our own.\nTo put these things together, I think you should view our expectations for 2021 as far from the finished products.\nBeyond this year, we believe the full benefit of our efficiency improvements will be paired with our ongoing and compounding growth initiatives that today are only just beginning to bear incremental fruit.\nThese factors together support our confidence that in 2022 we can achieve adjusted EBITDA above the $270 million that I just referenced.\nOf course, none of this is possible without the strength in our core and a singular unwavering focus on our top priority, taking great care of the patients.\nIt's so timely to me to reiterate this to you today.\nBut the fact is that in talking to our clinicians and clinical leadership, it's becoming clear that as the country continues to evolve through this pandemic period, the need for many, many of the highly specialized services our doctors provide is only increasing, which makes it that much more important that these doctors are able to operate as part of a highly integrated collaborative network in order to ensure that patients have access to the services they need exactly at the time they need them.\nThat's why I'll ask Mack, who is a longtime neonatologist and pediatrician, to talk about the why behind the resurgence in volumes we've seen across many specialties as well as the why behind the importance of having access to the full continuum of care for expecting parents, newborns and children.\nI'll start with what we're seeing across the country today.\nAnd then for the benefit of all of our stakeholders, give some thoughts about what we truly are as a national medical group, and how MEDNAX is uniquely positioned to address this current and future environment.\nI would describe the market trends we see today as twofold.\nFirst, as isolation measures became less restrictive, our pediatric specialists are seeing a surge in respiratory illnesses during the summer, illnesses that we typically see during the winter months.\nWe've also seen a significant number of behavioral health issues that have resulted in both pediatric intensive care and pediatric hospital service admissions.\nIn addition to that, the American Academy of Pediatrics now recommends that any child with COVID has a cardiac evaluation prior to returning to sports.\nOur pediatric cardiologists, hospitalists, critical care physicians, surgeons, urgent care physicians and other pediatric specialists are all seeing the near- and long-term consequence of COVID-19.\nRegardless of the immediate rate of infection in our communities, we believe the consequence of isolation and delayed healthcare will continue to require access to the entire spectrum of our pediatric specialty services.\nThese services are scarce national resources and access to them is filed for the health of the children and our communities.\nSecond, alongside the significant increases in total births and NICU admissions we reported this quarter, our maternal fetal medicine volumes have now far surpassed pre-pandemic levels.\nHere, too, for at least the near term, it's clear that trends in pregnancies and deliveries have turned upward.\nAnd across the country, access to highly trained obstetrical specialists is vital for the health of expecting parents facing a high-risk pregnancy.\nAnd in fact, a number of states have highlighted the risk of higher child-work complications that can result from insufficient access to proper care.\nAnd all the payers we work with, both commercial and governmental, stress the importance of access to high-quality maternal care.\nTo put some statistics behind these two phenomena, I'll point out that compared to the second quarter of 2019 on a same-unit basis, volumes in our pediatric intensive care units were up 11.5% and pediatric hospitalist volumes were up 4%.\nOn the office space side, pediatric surgery volumes were up 8% and maternal-fetal medicine was up 9%.\nPediatric cardiology volume is still down slightly by 2%, but we anticipate that, that could increase as we move into the fall.\nAll of these statistics went to the breadth of specialty services provided across our organization and across the country, and the demand for these services has been increasing in this rapidly evolving environment.\nBut beyond these numbers, I'll speak to you now as a physician who's been fortunate to have been a leader of MEDNAX for many years.\nThere's a broad spectrum of care that is absolutely essential for prenatal, newborn and pediatric populations.\nAnd that is exactly what our pediatrics at Stafford's medical groups provides every day of every year.\nWe are far more than a collection of practices and clinicians to ensure our clinicians trust for lives of thousands of women and children every year.\nBut more than that, we are a highly integrated group of affiliated maternal pediatric practices that work together to deliver care across the whole spectrum of pregnancy, childhood and in some cases, even adulthood.\nThis includes maternal-fetal medicine doctors, or the hospitalists and neonatologists, all working closely to provide diagnostic care to mothers who are at risk of the complicated pregnancy and to provide routine and emergency triage evaluation and care to pregnant patients presenting to the hospitals as well as to provide a complete inpatient spectrum of maternal in the neonatal care.\nIt includes pediatric hospitalist to cover smaller community pediatric services to large tertiary referral services, emergency medicine physicians who see patients in dedicated pediatric emergency departments, and pediatric critical care physicians who care for severely ill children and adolescence with a large range of medical and surgical problems, including patients requiring cardiac surgery.\nWith the addition of NightLight Urgent Care, it now includes pediatric urgent care clinicians who see pediatric patients at a time and place convenient for parents in an environment that's the right place for their child.\nAs Mark spoke to earlier, we see an enormous opportunity at MEDNAX to change the way pediatric primary and urgent care is practiced in our country, and this is totally complementary to our core business.\nIt includes developmental medicine specialists who evaluate and treat disorders of development and you see many of our former NICU patients.\nIt includes pediatric cardiologists who evaluate and treat the entire spectrum of childhood cardiac disease as well as adult congenital heart disease patients, and additionally support both neonatology and hospitalized pediatric patient population, including intensive caring cardiac intensive care patients.\nWe continue to add multiple other pediatrics specialties, include neurology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology and infectious disease to better serve our patients and their families.\nAnd this includes rapidly growing pediatric surgical services across general surgery, urology, ophthalmology, orthopedics, E&T and plastic surgery.\nEach of these represents a scarce and highly specialized surgical specialty that's very important to our pediatric communities in their own right, but are also supportive to our inpatient services.\nI hope all of this can help you appreciate how interconnected our organization is.\nIt is this network of care from pregnancy to delivery to childhood and sometimes even beyond that makes what we do special and, in fact, essential.\nAnd of course, we do this in a very close partnership with our hospitals.\nWhen they choose us, the vast majority of the time they stay with us because of our shared commitment to our patients, because of our work to maintain strategic alignment with them, and because they rightly expect and demand the robust resources we at MEDNAX provide to our affiliated clinicians everyday.\nRather than going through each line of our P&L, I'm going to focus today on our G&A restructuring and stabilization efforts during the quarter and our expectations as we move through the second half of this year.\nAnd then, I'll touch on our financial position as it stands today.\nWe had a lot of activity during the quarter that I'll globally describe as the culmination of efforts to refine our support services and create efficiency going forward, all while keeping a priority on service to our practices.\nFirst, as previously disclosed, in May, we finalized an agreement with R1 to transition our RCM functions to them.\nThis agreement followed a thorough decision-making process, from which we concluded that R1's scale, technology investments and dedicated focus on revenue cycle can give our affiliated clinicians capabilities we would never match.\nUnder the terms of our agreement, we realized near-term G&A savings.\nAnd we also expect to benefit over time from future improvements in RCM performance, yield and revenue enhancements.\nIn terms of the impact of this transition on our P&L for the second quarter, it was a net savings to our G&A.\nBut as with any major transformational project, we did record certain onetime expenses within our transformational and restructuring line item, primarily related to expected terminations of other existing third-party RCM contracts.\nIn addition to this agreement, we passed two other important milestones related to information technology and infrastructure modernization.\nWe completed a significant data center consolidation, and we went live on our Oracle ERP solution that represents a far more advanced financial platform.\nThe planning and implementation of both of these have been in the works for some time.\nBut we did incur a surge of IT-related spend in the second quarter to bring all of this over the finish line, which all sized, is roughly $3 million to $4 million over the year-over-year increase in our total G&A when compared to last year.\nThird, we have substantially completed the support services related to the PSA arrangement attached to last year's sale of our anesthesia organization and plan to wind down any remaining services through Q3.\nAs I noted in the past couple of quarters, there will still be some period of time when we're still incurring some of those expenses, but not being reimbursed for them.\nFinally, we sold a secondary corporate office building in Florida during the quarter.\nWe received $25 million in cash proceeds and recorded a $7 million gain on the sale.\nAnd on a go-forward basis, we'll realize approximately $2 million to $3 million in annual G&A savings from the building sale.\nWith all of these actions moving toward in our rearview mirror, we expect our dollar G&A spend for the second half of this year to be below $137 million we incurred during the first half.\nI'll finish with a comment on our financial position.\nWe generated a strong $70 million in operating cash flow for the second quarter.\nWe ended up the quarter with $338 million in cash, up from $270 million at the end of the first quarter, and net debt of $662 million, implying leverage of less than three times.\nIn addition, you'll see on our balance sheet that we also have a $29 million income tax receivable primarily related to the tax elections made with respect to the sale of our Anesthesiology Medical group last year, and we anticipate receiving that cash sometime in late '21 or early '22.\nBased on our expectations of second half adjusted EBITDA and cash flow, this tax receivable and normal uses of cash for capex and M&A, we would expect to end this year with leverage below 2.5 times.\nWe are ready to respond to any questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:The company undertakes no obligation to update this information.\nwhitestonereit.com in the Investor Relations section.\nWith that, let me pass the call to Jim Mastandrea.\nWe continue to hope and pray that all of you, your families and your businesses remain healthy, and are doing well as we navigate these most unusual times.\nI am pleased to share with you our strong operating and financial results that have sustained the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur business has recovered quickly, and in doing so produced shopping center sector-leading results.\nDave Holeman, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed look at the drivers of our operating and financial performance.\nWe attribute these results to owning properties located in areas with high household income neighborhoods and the fastest-growing MSAs in business-friendly states.\nOperating a consumer business-driven model based on consumer demographics and psychographics to design a tenant makes that drives customer visits and experiences.\nOur strategic customer focus differentiates Whitestone from other real estate owners that leads to traditional hard and soft good retailers.\nTo enhancing our intrinsic value through redeveloping and developing, which adds value to -- value as we physically expand our real estate footprint and grow rents and to balancing a capital management structure to drive revenues, net operating income and funds from operation.\nWith this background, I would like to provide some color as to where we are today, where we plan to go in the coming months and quarters to drive long-term shareholder values, key building blocks to Whitestone's success and our progress toward the long-term goals we announced in February of 2018.\nFirst, where we are today.\nSince the onset of COVID-19, which injected considerable economic uncertainty, relative to the real estate industry in particular, we've had shopping center sector leading rental collections throughout the pandemic and most recently announcing 90% cash collections for the third quarter of 2020.\nThese results are in line with our expectations and are trending upward from the first-half of the year.\nRental collections, solid leasing spreads and execution of our business model is deeply rooted in Whitestone's team culture.\nSince the end of the first quarter, we focused on improving our dividend payout ratio, increasing our cash on hand, paying down our debt and strengthening our balance sheet.\nThese actions have prepared us for the next level of growth and provided greater financial flexibility.\nOur judicious and disciplined allocation of capital has produced positive third quarter operating results, including occupancy of 88.9% at the end in the quarter, revenue that approached $30 million for the quarter, up 8% from the second quarter.\nProperty net operating income of $21.3 million, up 6% from the second quarter.\nLeasing spreads that were strong and resulted in a positive 11% increase for the quarter.\nCash collections, which I mentioned earlier that achieved 90% for the quarter were up from 81% in the second quarter and funds from operation core that were solid at $0.23 per share, up $0.01 or 5% from the second quarter.\nDave in his remarks will follow mine, will go into greater detail on these results and comparisons to the prior year.\nOverall, I am very pleased with the way our management team is navigating the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus, stabilizing our business quickly and enabling us to refocus on extracting the embedded intrinsic value in our properties, while targeting acquisitions that are accretive and further scaling our platform.\nSecond, where we plan on doing in the coming months.\nWe intend to maintain our disciplined capital allocation philosophy going forward, as we have over the past.\nOur track record of our growth from 2010 to 2019 speaks to our plan.\nOur long-term plan is to grow our strategically chosen markets of Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio and Phoenix through redevelopment and development opportunities within our portfolio and externally grow by making targeted acquisitions in our existing markets and beyond.\nThird, the key building blocks for Whitestone's success is building a portfolio of choice properties in great markets that we lease and manage with a team of well-trained professionals who continue to do what has worked for us in the past.\nWe view Whitestone as a highly differentiated and somewhat a special really -- specializing in e-commerce-resistant entrepreneurial tenants and crafting the right mix of those tenants who ultimately meet the neighborhood consumers' needs.\nOur diversified mix of tenants provide essential services for lease that cannot usually be acquired online, if at all.\nAs a result, our open-air centers provide community experiences that cater to adjacent neighborhood as an extension of their lifestyle.\nWhile we recognize that we are in the retail real estate business, our differentiated approach and contrarian business model has allowed us to profitably grow an asset base over the years despite significant overall industry challenges.\nOur growth since our IPO in 2010 has been steady and disciplined and we intend to continue this disciplined approach.\nFinally, we continue to make progress toward our long-term goals of improving debt leverage and scaling our G&A cost that we set in 2018.\nDuring the third quarter, we paid off $9.5 million of real estate debt from cash, lowering our net real estate debt by $11 million from a year ago and improving our ratio of debt to gross book value real estate assets to 55% from 58% a year ago.\nWe also are making progress on scaling our G&A.\nThese costs since the beginning of the year have been reduced through reduction of headcount from 105 to 85 or 21% through further automation, improvements in processes and all of our team working smarter and harder.\nOur total G&A costs for 2020 are approximately $900,000 or 6% lower in the same time last year.\nWe have a highly dedicated team that works every day to create local connections in communities that drive and we feel strongly that we are positioned to withstand the current headwinds and thrive into the future.\nGiven the severe economic pressures caused by the coronavirus during the quarter, our portfolio has performed quite well.\nDespite having a significant amount of our tenant businesses impacted, we only had a handful of tenants close for good such that the portfolio occupancy rate held up well ending the quarter at 88.9%, down just 0.3% or 13,000 leased square feet from the second quarter.\nAlso our annualized base rent per square foot at the end of the quarter was $19.43 and $19.38 by cash and straight-line basis.\nThis represents a 0.5% increase on a cash basis and a 1.3% decrease on a straight-line basis from a year ago.\nThe decrease on a straight-line basis is largely related to the conversion of 84 tenants to cash basis accounting and the associated write-off of accrued straight-line rents.\nOur square foot leasing activity was up 43% from the second quarter of 2020 and 46% from the third quarter of 2019.\nAnd we are pleased with positive blended leasing spreads on new and renewal leases of 3.3% and 11% on a cash and GAAP basis for the quarter.\nAs Jim mentioned, for the quarter, we collected 90% of our rents, this include base rent and triple net charges billed monthly.\nWe have also entered into rent deferral agreement on 3% of our third quarter rents.\nAs part of the deferral agreements, we have negotiated beneficial items, such as, entry into our online payment portal, further reporting of tenant sales, suspension of co-tenancy requirements, loosening of exclusive or restrictions that allow further development and stronger guarantees.\nWhile we are encouraged by how things are progressing, the pandemic has continued to impact our business in term -- in the terms of our financial results.\nFunds from operations core for the third quarter was $10.1 million or $0.23 per share compared to $10.9 million or $0.26 per share for the same quarter of the prior year and our same-store net operating income for the quarter decreased by 4.5%.\nThese decreases are primarily due to the impact of the pandemic, which resulted in a charge of $1.3 million to bad debt expense and $100,000 in write-off of straight-line receivables in the third quarter.\nThis charge was incremental to the bad debt expense and straight-line revenue recorded in the prior year by $900,000 or $0.02 per share.\nLet me add some color on our collectability analysis related to the pandemic and the related receivable balances.\nAt the end of the quarter, we had $23.6 million in accrued rents and accounts receivable.\nThis consists of $21.1 million of billed receivables, $1.9 million of deferred receivables, $16.1 million of accrued rents and other receivables and a bad debt reserve of $15.5 million.\nSince the beginning of the year, our billed receivable balance has increased $4.4 million and our deferred receivables have increased $1.9 million for a total build and deferred receivable balance increase of $6.3 million.\nAgainst this increase of $6.3 million, we have recorded an uncollectible reserve in 2020 of $4.5 million or 71%.\nOur accrued rents and other receivables had decreased by $1.1 million, largely the result of the write-off of accrued straight-line rent receivables on tenants converted to cash basis accounting and our bad debt reserve has increased by $4.3 million.\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, if the company determines that the collection of a tenant's future lease payments is not probable, the company must change the revenue recognition for that tenant to cash basis from accrual basis.\nIn light of the financial pressures that COVID-19 has been placing on many of our tenants, we reevaluated all of those tenants in the second and third quarters, as a result have switched 84 tenants in our portfolio to cash basis accounting.\nThese 84 tenants represent 3.6% of our annualized base rent and 3.4% of our leasable square footage.\nAs a result of this conversion to cash basis accounting we have written off $1.1 million of accrued straight-line rents for the year, but the company intend to collect all unpaid rents from its tenants to the extent possible.\nOur tenants on cash basis accounting paid 63% of contractual rents in the third quarter, up from 41% in the second quarter.\nWe have provided some additional details of our collections, it can be found on Page 27 of the supplemental.\nTurning to our balance sheet.\nSince March, we have implemented various measures to conserve cash, including further reductions in headcount.\nTo-date, we have approximately $39 million in cash, representing a 6% increase since March 31st.\nAdditionally, we paid off $9.5 million of real estate debt in the third quarter and have no debt maturities in 2021.\nWe have reduced our total net real estate debt by $11 million since the third quarter of 2019.\nCurrently, we have $111 million of undrawn capacity and $13 million of borrowing availability under our credit facility.\nWe are in full compliance with our debt covenants and expect to remain so in the future.\nLooking ahead, one particular trend we are seeing as COVID-19 persists is that Whitestone's best-in-class geography is benefiting from net migration of businesses coming out of the regulation-heavy gateway market.\nOur markets continue to attract both large and small businesses, as evidenced by Charles Schwab's recent announcement of its move of its headquarters to Dallas from San Francisco.\nWhitestone's properties are seeing this migration also.\nRecently, we added a successful restaurant who needed to escape the high-tax high-regulation environment of California to our Mercado property in Arizona.\nExamples like these prove the resilience of our markets and give us further assurance that our business model is thriving.\nWe have seen pent-up demand in our markets, as consumers are leaving their homes and returning quickly and in force.\nParking lots are filling and stores and restaurants are becoming more active.\nWhitestone is well positioned to capture this pent-up demand and intends to do so.\nOur team has worked together through this ongoing crisis and our shareholders will reap significant future benefits through greater collaboration, a more robust exchange of ideas, better and more effective communication and improved systems and processes that provide new actionable data and allow us to more efficiently scale our infrastructure.\nWhitestone is continuing to perform and deliver on our strategic plan.\nWe operate in many of the most highly desirable growth markets in high-population growth states and expect these markets to lead the country in economic recovery from the pandemic.\nWe look forward to providing further updates as we progress.\nAnd with that, we will now take questions.\nOperator, please open the lines.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I hope you are all doing well and staying safe.\nWhile the majority of our production employees continue to work from home, we have many dedicated employees at our manufacturing sites and with customers all adhering to the many layered health and safety protocols.\nAs a matter of fact, we delivered a record quarter in terms of earnings per share and tied the record for quarterly sales.\nWe improved manufacturing output and experienced more consistent order demand after the trough in activity last quarter stemming from the rapid onset of widespread pandemic lockdowns.\nNot surprisingly, and as we anticipated, most flow instrumentation end markets remain challenged.\nBob will walk you through the details of the quarter and after that, I'll come back and talk further about the market outlook and what we're hearing from customers in the current environment.\nAs you can see on slide 4, total sales for the third quarter were $113.6 million compared to $108.6 million in the same period last year, an increase of 5%.\nAs we noted last quarter, activity levels began to improve as lockdown started to be lifted in mid-May and into June and this activity stabilization continued out throughout the third quarter.\nIn municipal water, overall sales increased 11%, a roughly equal combination of improved order rates and recovery of the backlog built in Q2, which as we noted last quarter was the result of lockdown induced manufacturing disruptions which limited our output.\nPositive revenue mix trends continued with further adoption of smart metering solutions including ORION Cellular radios and BEACON software-as-a-service revenue along with ultrasonic meter penetration.\nAs noted and as anticipated, flow instrumentation sales declined 18% year-over-year, reflective of the broadly challenged markets and application served globally.\nOperating profit as a percent of sales was 17.2%, a 210 basis point increase from the prior year's 15.1% with improved gross profit margins and SEA leverage contributing to the strong results.\nGross margin for the quarter was 39.6%, up 120 basis points year-over-year.\nMargins benefited from higher sales volumes and positive sales mix.\nNotably, the overall trends of ultrasonic meter adoption and AMI implementations, including higher BEACON software-as-a-service and ORION Cellular radio sales.\nWhile copper prices, which serve as a proxy for Brass have been increasing.\nOur average price cost in the third quarter was effectively neutral compared to the prior year due in part to the normal purchasing to production lag.\nFinally, a reminder that prior year's results included a non-recurring discrete warranty provision associated with the products sold only outside North America.\nSEA expenses for the third quarter were $25.5 million down $300,000 year-over-year with higher personnel costs, mostly offset by lower travel, trade show and other ongoing pandemic impacted expenses.\nThe expense run rate was $2.3 million higher than the second quarter's $23.2 million reflecting the lifting of the temporary cost actions taken in the second quarter in response to the rapid onset of the pandemic.\nThe income tax provision in the third quarter of 2020 was 23.9%, slightly higher than the prior year's 22.1% rate.\nIn summary, earnings per share was $0.51 in the third quarter of 2020, an increase of 16% from the prior year earnings per share of $0.44.\nWorking capital as a percent of sales was 23% relatively in line with the prior two quarters.\nWe again delivered strong free cash flow which at $19.1 million dollars was consistent with the prior year comparable quarter despite the deferral of our federal income tax quarterly instalment payment under the CARES Act from the second quarter into the third quarter.\nOur year-to-date free cash flow of $67.8 million was 22% higher than the prior year $55.6 million and is currently tracking at 187% conversion to net earnings.\nWe ended the quarter with approximately $94 million of cash on the balance sheet as we paid down the small euro line of credit with excess cash.\nWe continue to have full access to our untapped $125 million credit facility.\nOur stable balance sheet and ample liquidity remain a clear source of strength for Badger Meter.\nUnfortunately, much of the globe, including the majority of US states are experiencing a resurgence in COVID cases.\nWhile this continues to create uncertainty, we are optimistic that extensive lockdowns will not again become a necessity, regardless, we remain fully prepared to manage safely in support of our customers in the critical and essential water sector.\nMunicipal water customer base is large and diverse.\nThe potential for some to experience difficult budgetary challenges exist due to a variety of contributing factors.\nHowever, as we've continued to learn from our active dialog across the spectrum of customers, their activities are essential and in many cases regulated.\nSome are implementing temporary cost reduction measures such as hiring freezes and travel restrictions.\nHowever, spending on critical and necessary activities, which includes metering solutions required for billing and controlling non-revenue water continues in many respects.\nOur large and diverse customer base means that there will not be a sole or single response as each municipal operation is unique with different needs and priorities.\nMunicipal water bid tenders and awards are mostly proceeding as planned, although a few have incurred extended timelines or deferrals.\nThere have been no widespread or significant cancellations and most daily order activity has returned to near normal.\nOur supply chain and the logistics partners continue to operate with new safety protocols and processes in place to address the needs of customers with no critical shortages currently.\nIn spite of other challenges and uncertainty, I'm extremely pleased with the level of execution of our team as evidenced by our operational and financial results.\nThrough the first nine months of 2020.\nMost of this fiscal year, we've been managing in a pandemic environment with countless changes to how all of us do business and severe economic shock to the global economy.\nDespite that backdrop, we have delivered municipal water sales growth, strong EBITDA margin expansion, robust working capital management and cash flow and an increase in earnings per share.\nIt is a true testament to the criticality of the water industry and the exceptional Badger Meter team.\nNow turning to the outlook.\nLet me start at a granular level where I do want to highlight a few items in terms of near-term outlook.\nFirst, the benefit of the backlog conversion into sales we saw in Q3.\nOn a year-to-date basis, it is neutral, created in Q2, recovered in Q3.\nBut as you analyze the municipal water growth rate in the quarter, order activity alone accounted for a solid mid-single-digit growth rate in sales.\nThe second as Bob noted, copper prices on average have trended up and with our normal leg, this will be a factor in Q4.\nI remind you that, while still important, the impact of Brass on our cost structure has been moderating over time as we sell more software and radios versus primarily in meters.\nLastly, you may recall, we had a seasonally strong fourth quarter of municipal water sales a year ago, which creates a tougher comp for the balance of 2020.\nTurning to the more important longer-term dynamics, it is clear that COVID-19 will have a profound impact on the global water sector and we will -- and we believe there will be a catalyst or increased adoption of smart water solutions.\nOur customers have a need for holistic integrated solutions that operationalize real time data.\nThese digitally enabled solutions such as our smart meter AMI offering reduce overall cost and offer safer remote solutions.\nThese factors are in addition to the secular drivers that have already been evolving such as the need to reduce non-revenue water, drive conservation, address the aging workforce of utilities and connect with end consumers.\nWith our robust cash flow and ample liquidity, we are actively investing in, and developing products and solutions to address these challenges.\nThis includes both organic and acquisition driven growth geared toward augmenting our offerings and attractive adjacencies serving water-related markets and applications.\nFor example added sensors and instruments for complementary data elements, such as pressure and temperature, which are used to determine system health.\nIt also includes expanding functionality of our ion water software app [Phonetic] that helps drive consumer engagement.\nWe will continue to stay close to the rapidly changing implications of the pandemic on both near term operations and longer-term trends and are prepared to successfully manage all aspects within our control.\nSummary: ",

comparability.\nI'm not sure how often in the term supply chain challenges or inflation are going to be referenced during the quarterly earnings cycle over the next month, but I can only imagine it's going to be an all-time record.\nWhile we clearly faced our fair share of those challenges, I want to focus my introductory comments and recognizing the tremendous execution of our Badger Meter teams globally, for their proactive and constructive dialog with customers to manage priorities, expectations and build trust, for their agility and effectively redesigning certain product components to provide greater flexibility on supply sources, for their unrelenting diligence and supplier and logistics management, and for their collaboration across functions to maximize our deliveries to customers.\nThese strategic and tactical actions by our world-class team allowed us to deliver record sales and earnings this quarter, while we added to our already record backlog.\nTurning to Slide 4.\nOur total sales for the third quarter were $128.7 million, an increase of 13.3% over the $113.6 million in the same period last year.\nTotal utility water product line sales increased 12.2%.\nExcluding approximately $10 million of sales from the s::can and ATI acquisitions, core utility water revenues increased 1.7% year-over-year.\nA great result considering both the difficult prior year comparison and current year supply chain challenges.\nIn addition to the difficult comparison, our manufacturing output in the current quarter continued to be limited by supplier shortages of certain electronics and other components along with logistics challenges.\nWe did experience growth in mechanical meter, cellular radio and BEACON software as a service levels, and we continue to realize the benefit from strategic value-based pricing actions.\nStrong orders continued in the third quarter of 2021, and we exited the quarter with another record high backlog.\nOur water quality solution sales were also impacted by supply chain challenges on a more modest basis, yet still delivered results in line with our expectations.\nThe flow instrumentation product line did not escape the impact of production limitations from component shortages, but delivered a strong 18.5% year-over-year increase in sales.\nImproved demand trends across the majority of global end markets and applications as well as an easier comparison led to the increase year-over-year.\nWe are very pleased with the margin performance in the quarter, in light of widespread inflation, difficult comparisons and the dynamic supply chain impact on manufacturing operations.\nStarting with gross margins, we increased gross profit dollars by $6.2 million and as a percent of sales, gross margins improved 20 basis points to 39.8% from 39.6%.\nMargins benefited from favorable acquisition mix as well as the higher volumes and positive product sales mix, namely higher SaaS revenues, along with favorable value-based pricing realization.\nThese factors combined more than offset increasing cost headwinds across purchase components, including higher brass, resin and other materials, as well as freight and logistics.\nAs our margins demonstrate, we have executed well thus far and proactively implementing pricing mechanisms to offset existing cost increases, however, as been well publicized, the breadth and pace of inflationary pressures is increasing.\nWe will continue to actively monitor pricing in light of these circumstances, recognizing there'll be leading and lagging impacts in this dynamic environment.\nSEA expenses in the third quarter were $31.7 million consistent with the first two quarters on a dollar basis, with sequentially improved leverage as a percent of sales to 24.7%.\nSEA expenses increased $6.2 million year-over-year with the inclusion of the water quality acquisitions as well as more normalized pandemic impacted expenses such as travel.\nAs a result of the above, overall operating profit margin was 15.1% compared to a record 17.2% in the prior year quarter.\nThe income tax provision in the third quarter of 2021 was 18.3%, below the prior year's 23.9% and our normalized rate in the mid 20% range due to a discrete favorable income tax benefit related to equity compensation transactions.\nIn summary, earnings per share was $0.54 in the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 6% from the prior year's earnings per share of $0.51.\nWorking capital as a percent of sales was 25.6%, an increase of 140 basis points compared to the prior quarter-end.\nThe modest elevation in accounts receivable and inventory are temporary byproduct of the current supply chain environment.\nFor example, we are strategically maintaining higher levels of certain inventory components and work in process, capitalizing on spot availability and capacity.\nIn addition, certain customers are understandably deferring payment on partial shipments.\nWe believe these are transitory repercussions of the current environment.\nFree cash flow of $13.9 million was lower than the prior year, the result of this higher working capital.\nOn a year-to-date basis, free cash flow conversion of net earnings is 125%.\nTurning to Slide 5.\nWe've updated the quarterly sales comparison chart which highlights the key factors driving uneven year-over-year top line trends.\nThe growth rate we experienced this quarter excluding the acquisitions was the result of strong customer demand, which was muted by headwinds from the varied supply chain challenges and difficult prior year core utility water comparisons.\nAs we enter fourth quarter and look to 2022, our backlog is supportive of continued sales growth with the level of quarterly sales quite frankly dependent on the level of supply chain disruption.\nWhile this could be the variability in the cadence of sales, it is important to recognize two things.\nWith regard to our execution.\nOne, our performance thus far is delivering total sales growth despite the significantly supply challenged environment.\nAnd two, that our orders and awards are not being canceled or postponed, but simply shifting to the future.\nWe feel very good about our competitive position and the underlying drivers supporting our markets.\nIn summary, here on Slide 6, we believe that our strong order momentum and backlog confirms the underlying market demand for our solutions, which combine data, communications and analytics into tailorable solutions to enable customers to be more efficient, effective and sustainable throughout the water ecosystem.\nThe water quality acquisitions continue to perform well and the integration work that has been underway, including customer discussions, confirm the growing need and acceptance of online low maintenance and reagent free solutions for real-time water quality monitoring.\nThese distributed solutions will be a game changer for utilities, wastewater and industrial customers alike.\nWe remain optimistic about our future prospects as we continue to execute on our growth strategy, but in tandem we are acutely aware of the challenges presented by the current disruption to the supply chain and global shortage of electronics and other components, accelerating broad-based inflation as well as the potential for further impacts from the pandemic.\nWhile these challenges are not unique to Badger Meter or even our industry, the ongoing headwinds have the ability to impact top line growth rates and exert increasing margin pressures.\nThe breadth of these challenges is greater than what we've experienced previously, but the playback -- playbook for addressing them is not new.\nFinally, I want to mention our work with AT&T on the connected climate initiative they launched in August.\nWe are one of the several partners that AT&T highlighted for our efforts to reduce the impact of climate change via the the water and energy savings associated with our smart water offerings.\nUsing infrastructure free cellular technology in our ORION LTE-M radio, enables our AMi solutions to deliver more resilient, efficient and sustainable water solutions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Joining our call today are Chief Executive Officer, Glenn Williams; and our Chief Financial Officer, Alison Rad.\nWe also reference certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe will provide insight into the company's operations.\nSecond quarter results were very strong, reflecting continued progress in both our term life and our Investment and Savings segments.\nLeveraging the fundamental strengths of our business model, we are positioned to meet the middle market's increased demand for financial security, which has been revealed by the COVID pandemic.\nStarting on slide three.\nAdjusted operating revenues of $654 million increased 25% compared to the second quarter of 2020, while diluted adjusted operating income per share of $3.25 rose 33%.\nROAE also increased to 27.8% compared to 25.6% during the same quarter last year.\nTurning to slide Four.\nWe attracted nearly 90,000 new recruits during the quarter.\nYear-over-year comparisons are difficult to evaluate because of the varying impact of the pandemic in each period and the tailored recruiting incentives we deployed each quarter.\nLooking beyond this noise, we believe that we are using the right mix of messaging and incentives to continue to drive recruiting and to increase the appeal of our business proposition.\nMore than 10,000 individuals obtained a new life insurance license during the quarter, and we are encouraged by those results.\nWe have seen some improvement in the licensing process over the last few months.\nTesting windows are now generally available and many states have called up on processing backlogs, although there remain some pockets where processing is still taking longer than usual.\nLicensing candidates today also have more flexibility to access pre-licensing classes in both in-person and remote options widely available.\nWe continue to see a higher success rate for candidates choosing to attend in-person classes, but there is some hesitancy about assembling in classrooms.\nAs COVID social distancing measures eased, we noted a greater degree of distraction among our licensing candidates.\nAfter a prolonged period of lockdown, some people are prioritizing social activities and travel over the pursuit of their life license.\nSince the beginning of the year, our message to the field has been focused on getting new recruits engaged and licensed.\nWe provide resources and coaching to assist new recruits on the most effective path to licensing.\nWe also offer incentive credits and consistent messaging on the importance of new licenses and growth of the sales force.\nWe believe our prioritization and support will help overcome the recent obstacles to the licensing process over the next few months.\nWe ended the quarter with about 132,000 life license representatives, including a total of 2,400 individuals with either COVID temporary licenses or a license with an extended renewal date.\nAs time wears on, we believe the majority of these licenses will largely age out.\nExcluding all 2,400 of these licenses from our total sales force provides a more appropriate and conservative understanding of the underlying size of our sales force and the foundation for future growth.\nThe pandemic presented us with numerous unique challenges over the last year, yet we were able to navigate these obstacles by adapting quickly to a remote framework -- remote work environment and by embracing web conferencing tools that will have a lasting benefit to our sales force.\nWe remain committed to growing our sales force and expect to end the year at around 131,000 life licensed representatives after all the COVID-temp licenses and extended renewals have expired compared to a normalized count of 130,700 at the end of 2020.\nTurning to slide five.\nConsumer sentiment for the value of life insurance remains strong, which is most evident in our persistency levels.\nSales are also robust.\nHowever, we are finding that some individuals, both clients and reps, are also focused on resuming normal everyday activities, which competes with their urgency to obtain insurance coverage.\nNonetheless, we issued nearly 90,000 new life insurance policies during the quarter, a figure that is slightly below last year's second quarter record levels yet outstanding by historical standards.\nProductivity remains above our historical range at 0.23 policies per life license representative per month and total face amount grew to $887 billion in force at quarter end.\nLooking ahead, as we see trends normalizing, we project full year-over-year life sales to decline approximately 5% versus last year's elevated levels.\nTurning to slide six for a review of our Investment and Savings Products segment results.\nSales exceeded $3 billion for the first time in history with solid demand from both the U.S. and Canada clients and across all product lines, including mutual funds, annuities and managed accounts.\nStrong equity markets continue to contribute to investors' confidence and help drive sales.\nNet inflows at $1.2 billion during the quarter were twice the level in the prior year period and slightly above the $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2021.\nThis level of sustained net inflows is a function of strong sales and investors' decisions to stay invested.\nWe believe our redemption levels remain well below the industry rates.\nWe ended the quarter with client asset values of $92 billion, a 34% increase year-over-year, combining strong equity markets and nearly $3.5 billion of net new inflows over the last 12 months.\nBarring an unforeseen period of market uncertainty, which would have a negative impact on investor sentiment, we expect third quarter investment sales to grow in the 30% to 40% range versus last year's third quarter.\nWe're making steady progress in our U.S. mortgage distribution business and continue with our deliberate efforts to expand distribution.\nWe are now actively engaged to do business in fiftheen states with about 1,000 license representatives.\nWe estimate the mortgage business will earn around $4 million in pre-tax earnings during the second half of 2021 for a full year total of $7 million.\nBecause of the positive impact, we believe the mortgage business brings to recruiting, life and ISP sales and client satisfaction.\nWe've begun a mortgage referral program in Canada.\nWhile providing similar positive overall business dynamics, this referral program does not require licensing of our representatives in Canada and provides much smaller economics for the company.\nWe're seeing good response from our reps and clients to this offering, which rounds out the full-service client experience.\nOur acquisition of e-TeleQuote closed on July one and we're excited about adding senior health offerings to Primerica's financial solutions for middle-income families.\nIn addition to e-TeleQuote's existing distribution model, we're in the process of rolling out a pilot referral program, leveraging Primerica's strong relationships between our sales force and our clients.\nI look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters.\nStarting with our Term Life segment on slide seven.\nThis quarter marks the first period where COVID impacted both the current and prior year periods.\nSegment results were very strong and operating revenues of $384 million increased 17% and pre-tax operating income of $117 million rose 23% year-over-year.\nAs Glenn discussed, term life sales were down slightly from last year's highly elevated levels.\nConsumer sentiment for protection products continues to be favorable as reflected in record levels of policy retention.\nPersistency improved across all durations over the prior year period, which was already at historically elevated levels.\nGiven more context, lapse rate in last year's second quarter was 50% lower than 2019 levels, while the current quarter lapses were an estimated 25% lower than 2019.\nThe compounding impact of sustained higher sales and policy retention over the last five quarters drove 16% growth in adjusted direct premiums year-over-year.\nadding $11 million to pre-tax income over baseline 2019 levels.\nThe similar contribution in 2020 was $3 million.\nThe higher persistency lowered DAC amortization by $14 million, which was partly offset by $6 million in higher benefit reserves for a net contribution of $8 million to pre-tax income for the quarter.\nThe net contribution in the prior year period was $4 million.\nCurrent period claims remained elevated in comparison to our historical experience.\nWe incurred about $6 million in COVID claims and an additional $3 million of claims that were not identified as COVID for a total of nine million excess claims for the quarter.\nThis compares to $10 million of excess claims in the prior year quarter, which were fully attributable to COVID debt.\nThe $6 million of COVID claims was in line with our expectations but increased our experience from $10 million per 100,000 population deaths to $13 million per 100,000 population deaths.\nThe increase was caused by higher COVID-related deaths in Canada, which has historically had lower reinsurance coverage and therefore, a higher average retained face now.\nIt's not unusual for us to experience normal claims volatility in the $3 million range in the quarter.\nAnd at this point, we believe this to be the case.\nThat being said, there was a lot of discussion in the news about the impact of delayed medical care and the behavioral health crisis, which could have impacted recent claims activity.\nWe continue to monitor our experience for any emerging trends.\nThe level of vaccinations and their efficacy against strains of the virus are key to determining the ongoing level of COVID-related deaths.\nLooking at the third quarter, we estimate $6 million in COVID claims for the quarter based on an estimated 57,000 population deaths, including 500 deaths in Canada.\nWe expect lapses to begin normalizing later in 2020 -- excuse me, 2021.\nHowever, we have yet to see movement in that direction, and it remains difficult to predict the extent to which we will see a permanent improvement in persistency from pre-COVID levels.\nAny such improvement in persistency would be favorable to margin, resulting in a benefit ratio being higher and the DAC ratio being lower than pre-COVID levels.\nIf the improvement is in the 10% range, margins would likely increase 80 to 100 basis points from where they were prior to the pandemic.\nInsurance expense ratio remained below its pre-COVID historical average during the quarter at 6.6% compared to 6.8% in the prior year period as higher adjusted direct premiums led to greater fixed cost absorption.\nTurning to the ISP segment on slide eight.\nOperating revenues of $238 million increased 45% and pre-tax income of $71 million was 52%.\nThese year-over-year comparisons reflect continued strong sales, which Glenn discussed earlier and significant asset appreciation over the last year.\nThe 67% increase in sales base revenues was somewhat lower than the growth in revenue generating sales due to an increase in large dollar trades, which have a lower commission rate.\nMany of the large dollar trades are coming from retirement plan rollovers with job turnover on the line and a greater number of baby boomers deciding to retire.\nAsset-based revenues increased 39%, largely in line with the higher average client asset value.\nOur sales and asset-based commission expenses increased in line with the associated revenue.\nOther operating expenses grew by 11%, largely driven by fees based on client asset value.\nCanadian segregated fund DAC amortization for the quarter was at a normal run rate, but was $1.7 million higher than the prior year due to a significant market correction that occurred during the second quarter of 2020.\nMoving next to our Corporate and Other Distributed Products segment on slide nine.\nThe adjusted operating loss increased by $5.2 million compared to the prior year excluding $2.1 million in transaction-related expenses incurred during the quarter as a result of the acquisition of e-TeleQuote.\nThe year-over-year change results reflects around $3 million higher employee and technology-related costs as well as $1.6 million of higher reserves on a block of discontinued business due to the low interest rate environment and improved persistency.\nAllocated net investment income in the segment declined by $2 million largely driven by a higher allocation to the Term Life segment to support growth in that business, along with lower overall yield on the invested asset portfolio.\nOur growing mortgage business added a net $1.6 million to pre-tax income during the quarter year-over-year.\nConsolidated insurance and other operating expenses on slide 10 were in line with expectations that are $113 million during the second quarter, rising 13% or $13 million over the prior year.\nThe increase was largely driven by growth in our businesses.\nWe anticipate third quarter insurance and other operating expenses in our three existing segments to be approximately $119 million or 12% higher than the prior year period.\nBeginning next quarter, our disclosures will be expanded to including four segments: senior health, which will capture revenues and expenses associated with the distribution of Medicare-related insurance policies by e-TeleQuote, including earnings generated from sales force by Primerica labs.\nOur intent is to continue to remove transaction-related costs, which are specific to the purchase of e-TeleQuote and that we view as onetime in nature from our operating results.\nThese costs include fees necessary to close the transaction.\nOther onetime costs that assist us in integrating e-TeleQuote into our organization and the adjustments to certain items recognized for purchase accounting.\nOther integration-related costs that are ongoing in nature will be shown as operating expenses in the Senior Health segment.\nTurning to slide 11.\nThe unrealized gain on our invested asset portfolio at the end of June was $123 million, up from $98 million at the end of March as rates declined and credit spreads tightened.\nThe portfolio remains of high quality and well diversified across sectors and issuers.\nThe NAIC recently adopted new bond factor to be used in the calculation of RBC that go into effect for 2021 year-end reporting.\nModeling our June 30 RBC ratio using these factors, we estimate our ratio will be reduced by approximately ten to fifteen basis points.\nWe believe this change is small enough to not require significant changes to our invested asset portfolio.\nWith the new bond factors, Primerica Life estimated risk-based capital ratio is about 410% at the end of the second quarter, and we plan to remain above 400% for the rest of the year as we continue to fund business growth and take ordinary dividends to the holding company.\nOn slide 12, holding company liquidity at June 30 was $656 million reflecting the buildup in anticipation of the e-TeleQuote acquisition and includes the $125 million draw against our revolving credit facility.\nImmediately following the closing on July 1, holding company liquidity was approximately $169 million.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Joining me on the call today are Don Kimble, our chief financial officer; and Mark Midkiff, our chief risk officer.\nI'm now turning to Slide 3.\nOur first quarter was a strong start to the year as we executed our strategy and delivered positive operating leverage relative to the year-ago period.\nWe continued to grow the number of clients across our franchise.\nIn the first quarter, we experienced the strongest growth in consumer households in five years.\nAdditionally, we continue to add commercial clients and deepen existing relationships.\nWe leverage the strength of our business model by raising over $13 billion for our commercial clients of which we retained approximately 19% on our balance sheet.\nAnd let me just say that's exactly the way our model is designed to work, taking advantage of attractive markets for the benefit of our clients while maintaining our credit discipline with that which we place on our balance sheet.\nWe also launched our National Digital Bank, Laurel Road for doctors at the end of March.\nI will comment more on that shortly.\nIn addition, we announced the acquisition of AQN Strategies, a client-focused analytics firm with deep expertise in the financial services industry.\nThe acquisition aligns to Key's relationship strategy and underscores our commitment to a data-driven approach to grow our business.\nWe also identified 70 branches for consolidation representing approximately 7% of our network.\nWe continue to lean into digital.\nMost of these closures will take place in the second quarter.\nMoving to our financial results for the quarter.\nWe reported net income of $591 million or $0.61 per share for the first quarter.\nOn a per share basis, this is an increase of 9% from the fourth-quarter results and up significantly from the year-ago period.\nWe generated record first-quarter revenue, which reflected broad-based growth across our company, driven by our fee-based businesses.\nOur investment banking business achieved record first-quarter revenues with growth across the platform.\nThis is an area where we have invested in our teammates and made targeted acquisitions to enhance our capabilities, including such areas as healthcare and technology.\nWe have grown this business in eight of the last nine years, including having a record year in 2020, and we expect to grow this business again in 2021.\nWe reached a new milestone in our consumer mortgage business with record loan originations of $3 billion for the quarter.\nIn addition to adding high-quality loans to our balance sheet, consumer mortgage fees were up 135% from the year-ago period.\nOur outlook for this business remains positive as we continue to grow and take market share.\nWe reported a record $8.3 billion of originations in 2020, and we expect to eclipse that level this year.\nOther contributors to fee income this quarter were trust and investment services and cards and payments income.\nCredit quality remains strong.\nNon-performing loans, net charge-offs and criticized loans were all down from the prior quarter.\nWe continue to support our clients while maintaining our moderate risk profile, which has and will continue to position the company to perform well through the business cycle.\nFinally, we have maintained our strong capital position while continuing to return capital to our shareholders.\nOur common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.8%, which is above our targeted range of nine to nine and a half percent.\nOur strong capital position enables us to execute against our capital priorities, organic growth, dividends and share repurchases.\nThis quarter, we repurchased $135 million of common shares.\nOur board of directors also approved our first-quarter common stock dividend of 18 and half cents a share.\nNow turning to Slide 4.\nWe acquired Laurel Road, a born digital company in April of 2019.\nThe acquisition has exceeded all of our expectations.\nIt has accelerated our digital transformation and has been a great complement to our existing healthcare platform.\nSince our acquisition, Laurel Road has generated over $4.6 billion in high-quality loan originations adding high-value digital relationships with healthcare professionals.\nWe also have the opportunity to continue to scale this business.\nAt the end of March, we took the next step on this journey with the launch of our Digital Bank, Laurel Road for Doctors, serving the healthcare segment and expanding our consumer franchise nationally.\nImportantly, our approach to our Digital Bank is differentiated.\nHistorically, many offerings have been product-centric or focused on deposit gathering.\nOurs is a fully -- is fully aligned with our relationship strategy.\nThe launch broadened our offering for Laurel Road clients to include deposits, additional lending products and other value-added services created to meet the unique financial needs of healthcare professionals.\nThe launch was an important milestone in our digital journey, which brings together critical elements of our strategy, targeted scale, digital, healthcare and primacy.\nRight now, we are focused on physicians and dentists, but soon, we will expand to other medical professionals.\nImportantly, this launch is not the end goal but rather just the beginning.\nI will close my remarks by restating that I am pleased with our results for the quarter and our strong start for 2021.\nI am proud of what we have achieved as a team and remain optimistic about the future as we emerge from the pandemic and the economy continues to recover.\nKey is well positioned to grow and deliver on our commitments for all of our stakeholders.\nI'm now on Slide 6.\nAs Chris said, it was a strong start to the year with net income from continuing operations of $0.61 per common share, up 9% from the prior quarter and over four times from the year-ago period.\nThe quarter reflected a net benefit from our provision for credit losses.\nThe reserve release was largely driven by expected improvement in the economic environment.\nImportantly, we generated a record first-quarter revenue, driven by the strength in our fee-based businesses.\nTurning to Slide 7.\nTotal average loans were $101 billion, up 5% from the first quarter of last year, driven by growth in both commercial and consumer loans.\nCommercial loans reflected Key's participation in PPP, partially offset by decreased utilization.\nPPP loans had an impact of $7 billion in the first quarter of 2021 average balances.\nConsumer loans benefited from the continued growth from Laurel Road and as Chris mentioned, record performance from our consumer mortgage business with $3 billion of consumer mortgage loans this quarter.\nThe investments we have made in these areas continue to drive results and importantly, add high-quality loans and relationships.\nLinked quarter average loan balances were down 1%, reflecting lower commercial utilization rates and a reduction in average PPP balances.\nWe had just under $1 billion of PPP forgiveness in the current quarter.\nConsumer loans were up 1% from the prior quarter, again related to continued production from consumer mortgage and Laurel Road.\nContinuing on to Slide 8.\nAverage deposits totaled $138 billion for the first quarter of 2021, up $28 billion or 25% compared to the year-ago period and up 1.5% from the prior quarter.\nThe linked quarter and year-ago comparisons reflect growth in both commercial and consumer balances, which benefited from government stimulus.\nThe growth was offset by continued and expected decline in time deposits.\nThe interest-bearing deposit costs came down another 3 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020, following an 8-basis-point decline last quarter.\nWe continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for over 60% of our total deposit mix.\nTurning to Slide 9.\nTaxable equivalent net interest income was $1.012 billion for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $989 million a year ago and $1.043 billion for the prior quarter.\nOur net interest margin was 2.61% for the first quarter of 2021 compared to 3.01% for the same period last year and 2.7% from the prior quarter.\nBoth net interest income and net interest margin were meaningfully impacted by significant growth in our balance sheet compared to the year-ago period.\nThe larger balance sheet benefited net interest income but reduced the net interest margin due to the significant increase in liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows.\nCompared to the prior quarter, net interest income decreased $31 million and the margin declined 9 basis points.\nThe decrease in net interest income was caused by the day count of approximately $14 million, lower loan fees of $8 million and lower loan balances resulting in an additional $8 million reduction to NII.\nNet interest margin also reflected a 4-basis-point reduction due to the increases in our liquidity position.\nMoving on to Slide 10.\nWe have continued to see growth in our fee-based businesses.\nNon-interest income was $738 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $477 million for the year-ago period and $802 million in the fourth quarter.\nCompared to the year-ago period, non-interest income increased 55%.\nWe had a record first quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees, which reached $162 million driven by broad-based strength across the platform.\nThis quarter, both debt and equity markets were especially strong.\nRecord mortgage originations drove mortgage -- consumer mortgage fees this quarter, which were up $27 million or 135% from the first quarter of '20.\nCards and payments income also increased $39 million related to higher prepaid card activity from state government support programs as well as the growth in the core platform.\nOther income in the year-ago period included $92 million of market-related valuation adjustments.\nCompared to the fourth quarter, non-interest income decreased by $64 million.\nLargest driver of the quarterly decrease was seasonality in our investment banking line coming off an all-time high record quarter.\nThis was partially offset by the strength in trust and investment services income and cards and payments income.\nI'm now on Slide 11.\nTotal non-interest expense for the quarter was $1.071 billion compared to $931 million last year and $1.1 billion in the prior quarter.\nThe increase from the prior year is primarily in personnel expense related to higher production-related incentive compensation, which increased $58 million and the increase in our stock price resulting in a $36 million increase compared to last year.\nEmployee benefit costs also increased $15 million.\nYear over year, payments-related costs reported in other expense were $32 million higher, driven by higher prepaid activity.\nComputer processing expense this quarter was elevated related to software investments across the platform, accounting changes and timing differences.\nCompared to the prior quarter, non-interest expense decreased $57 million.\nThe decline was largely due to lower production-related incentives and severance costs.\nMoving now to Slide 12.\nOverall, credit quality continues to outperform expectations.\nFor the first quarter, net charge-offs were $114 million or 46 basis points of average loans.\nOur provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $93 million.\nThis was determined based on our continued strong credit metrics as well as our outlook for the overall economy and loan production.\nNon-performing loans were $728 million this quarter or 72 basis points of period-end loans, a decline of almost $60 million from the prior quarter.\nAdditionally, criticized loans declined and the 30- to 90-day delinquencies also improved again quarter over quarter with a 5-basis-point decrease, while the 90-day plus category remain relatively flat.\nNow on to Slide 13.\nKey's capital position remains an area of strength.\nWe ended the first quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.8%, which places us above our targeted range of nine to nine and a half perccent.\nThis provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders.\nImportantly, we continue to return capital to our shareholders in accordance with our capital priorities.\nOur board of directors approved a first-quarter dividend of $0.185 per common share.\nWe also repurchased $135 million of common shares under the share repurchase authorization we announced in January of up to $900 million.\nThis leaves us with a capacity of up to $765 million for the next two quarters.\nOn Slide 14, we provide our full-year 2021 outlook, which we've adjusted to reflect our strong start to the year, positive momentum in our business and more favorable revenue outlook.\nConsistent with our prior guidance, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the year.\nAverage loans are expected to be relatively stable, reflecting continued momentum in our consumer areas, the impact of PPP and stronger commercial growth in the second half of the year.\nThe first quarter should be the low point of the year with expected growth from here.\nWe expect deposits to be up mid-single digits and that we will continue to benefit from our low-cost deposit base.\nNet interest income should be up low single digits.\nOur net interest income will benefit from higher loan fees related to PPP forgiveness and continued deployment of some of the excess liquidity, offset by the ongoing impact of low rates.\nnon-interest income should be up mid-single digits, reflecting the growth in most of our core fee-based businesses.\nNon-interest expense should be relatively stable, reflecting higher production-based incentives related to our improved revenue outlook.\nOur continuous improvement efforts and branch consolidation plans remain on track and will help support our ongoing investments in talent and to stay at the forefront of our digital offerings.\nMoving on to credit quality.\nWe have reduced our net charge-off guidance, which is now expected to be in the 35 to 45-basis-point range for the year.\nThis reflects the quality of our portfolio and our current outlook.\nAnd our guidance for our GAAP tax rate remains unchanged at around 19% for the year.\nFinally, shown at the bottom of the slide are our long-term targets, which remain unchanged.\nWe expect to continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile and improving our productivity and efficiency, which will drive returns.\nOverall, it was a good start to the year, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm Aaron Hunt, Director of Investor Relations.\nWe are pleased to see signs of recovery in global air traffic.\nThe U.S. air travel recovery has been strong and has come back faster than some expected.\nTSA traveler throughput has exceeded two million passengers on multiple days during the past two months and some days in July where passenger screenings exceeded the 2019 levels.\nA recent International Air Transport Association report indicates domestic passenger market show improvement, but with demand still down 22% versus June 2019 levels.\nThe situation remains dynamic.\nWe are monitoring the most recent reports of a spike of COVID-19 cases and what impact this may have on air traffic recovery.\nHowever, the upward momentum of domestic air traffic over the past few months is an encouraging trend for our industry.\nWe are pleased to see the rebound of demand for the MAX and the news of large orders from United, Southwest, Alaska Air and Ryanair.\nRyanair took delivery of its first 737 MAX 8200 and had positive feedback.\nWith 85% of Spirit's backlog associated with narrow-body aircraft, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from this domestic air traffic demand and narrow-body recovery.\nIn the first half of this year, we delivered 64 737 shipsets compared to 37 in the first half of last year, a 73% increase.\nWe are also on track to deliver about 160 shipsets this year, a 125% increase over the 71 we delivered in 2020.\nAs we have discussed before, we are trailing Boeing in terms of 737 production rate to burn off the inventory of storage shipsets in Wichita and Tulsa.\nThis quarter, for example, we delivered 35 units but shipped 42 to Boeing.\nWe currently have about 125 units in storage, all of which Boeing owns.\nWe expect store units will decrease to about 100 shipsets by the end of the year.\nOur plan is that we will reach 20 stored units by the end of next year, which will remain as a permanent buffer to cushion the production system.\nTurning to the 787 program.\nAs a result of our ongoing engagement with Boeing, we identified an additional fit and finish issue in the forward section of the fuselage.\nThis issue is related to a part that Spirit receives from one of our Tier two suppliers, and we are working with Boeing and the supplier on a resolution.\nWe continue to coordinate with Boeing to ensure that we are performing all necessary rework.\nPrimarily driven by this issue, we have recognized a $46 million forward loss on the 787 program.\nDespite this forward loss, we are maintaining our free cash flow target of negative $200 million to $300 million, as indicated on our last earnings call.\nThis amount is net of the $300 million cash tax benefit, which we expect to receive in the second half of this year.\nNext, I would like to highlight the fact that we published our first sustainability report in June, outlining Spirit's environmental, social and governance strategy.\nThe report also includes a few of our notable 2020 achievements.\nFor example, by the end of this year, we intend to be 100% wind powered at our Wichita facility.\nNow our Chief Operating Officer, Sam Marnick, will take you through updates on our acquisition integrations.\nThe integration workstreams for our recent acquisitions are progressing well.\nWe recently acquired the assets of Applied Aerodynamics, and we've already completed approximately 60% of the 323 identified integration tasks.\nThe integration of our other acquisition from Bombardier is also going well.\nWe have completed about 90% of the tasks required to integrate the Belfast, Morocco and Dallas site.\nThe remaining tasks are largely associated with the information technology transition services agreement, and we expect to complete it before the end of the year.\nThe estimated synergies we're expecting from the deal are tracking to plan.\nWe have seen good progress on A220 wing costs, supply chain improvements and infrastructure optimization.\nAirbus continues to have confidence in this aircraft, and we expect production rates to continue to improve over time.\nTurning to the Belfast pension plan.\nWe have ended our formal consultation with employees and the unions.\nSubject to the completion of the process, we will close the plan to future benefit accrual and provide a defined contribution benefit plan before the end of the year.\nThe Bombardier asset acquisition significantly increased our business jet work statement.\nWe also secured the award of the engine nacelle on the new Falcon 10 times.\nThis new growth has established Spirit as a leading business jet aerostructure supplier, a market segment that is recovering rapidly following the pandemic.\nThese business aircraft inventories are down around 40% year-over-year, highlighting a strong demand.\nAdditionally, U.S. business jet flight activity is about 6% higher than prepandemic levels, another good indicator of a rebound in this market segment.\nWe believe our capabilities and business ship programs position us well to generate $500 million of revenue at accretive margins by 2023.\nAnother market segment, we are watching closely is urban air mobility, also referred to as electric vertical and take off aircraft or eVTOL.\nWe believe our expertise in composite aerostructure design and manufacturing bring unique capabilities in this future mode of transport.\nWe've been exploring opportunities with a number of companies in this exciting new area and have signed agreements that are already generating revenue.\nThese two acquisitions have helped us grow our aftermarket and business jet businesses.\nWe are also accelerating our revenue diversification efforts in defense, which we expect will grow by roughly 20% in 2021.\nI hope everybody is doing well.\nWe continue to see 2021 as a bridge year for our Spirit and the commercial aviation industry.\nDomestic air travel in the United States as well as many other regions of the world are starting to recover, which is encouraging, especially for narrow-body aircraft production rates.\nWe are cautiously monitoring the COVID variant and its impact on this recovery, particularly with international travel.\nWe expect international air travel will continue to recover at a slower pace, and therefore, wide-body programs will remain a headwind for the next few years.\nAs we work through the second half of the year, we are starting to see the benefits of increasing narrow-body production rates.\nNow let's move to our second quarter 2021 results.\nRevenue for the quarter was $1 billion, up 55% from the same quarter of last year and approximately 11% above the first quarter of 2021.\nThe revenue increase was primarily due to production on the 737 and A320 programs as well as increased revenue from the recently acquired A220 wing and Bombardier business jet programs.\nThese increases were partially offset by the lower wide-body production rates resulting from the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on international air traffic.\nOverall deliveries increased to 243 shipsets compared to 159 shipsets in the same quarter of 2020.\nThe second quarter 737 deliveries have increased to 35 compared to 19 shipsets delivered in the second quarter of last year.\nWe still expect to deliver around 160 shipsets during the year.\nAdditionally, second quarter A320 deliveries increased to 96 compared to 69 shipsets delivered in the same period of last year.\nLet's now turn to earnings per share on slide four.\nWe reported earnings per share of negative $1.30 compared to negative $2.46 per share in the same period of 2020.\nAdjusted earnings per share was negative $0.31 compared to earnings per share of $2.28 in the second quarter of 2020.\nAdjusted earnings per share excludes acquisition costs, restructuring costs, noncash voluntary retirement plan charges and deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nLooking at the operating margin, we saw improvement in the second quarter to negative 10% and compared to negative 57% in the second quarter of 2020.\nThe cost-reduction actions we have taken over the last year, along with increasing production rates, have contributed to the improved results with lower cost and expenses, including excess capacity, restructuring and abnormal COVID-19 costs.\nWe also recognized lower forward loss charges compared to the same period last year.\nIn the second quarter, we recognized forward loss charges of $52 million, primarily driven by engineering analysis and rework on the 787 program compared to forward loss charges of $194 million in the same period of 2020.\nAdditionally, the increase in other income is primarily related to Belfast pension plan and the absence of voluntary retirement expenses recognized in the second quarter of 2020.\nI do want to mention that there was a revaluation of deferred tax assets during the second quarter of 2021 due to a future increase of the United Kingdom's corporate tax rate.\nThis resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately $55 million.\nThis benefit is included in both GAAP and adjusted EPS.\nThe revaluation of deferred tax assets, along with the adjustments related to tax law changes and other state tax impacts, resulted in incremental adjustments to the valuation allowance.\nAs a reminder, the valuation allowance is a noncash item.\nEarlier this week, Spirit received the latest 787 program demand from Boeing.\nBased on our preliminary assessment, we expect to incur an incremental forward loss of approximately $40 million to $60 million in the third quarter of 2021 due to the impact of reduced production volumes and the corresponding amount of fixed overhead absorption applied to lower deliveries.\nDue to the timing, this is considered a subsequent event and is not reflected in our second quarter financial statements.\nNow turning to free cash flow on slide five.\nFree cash flow for the quarter was negative $53 million compared to negative -- $249 million negative in the same period of 2020.\nThis year-over-year improvement is primarily due to cost-reduction actions, increased production volume and favorable working capital management.\nThe second quarter cash from operations also reflect an improvement of $142 million as compared to the first quarter of '21.\nExcluding the cash interest payments of approximately $80 million made during the second quarter, cash from operations was positive $51 million.\nWe expect the second half of this year to improve as single-aisle production rates continue to increase.\nDespite the additional challenge of the 787 program, we continue to expect free cash flow for the year to be between negative $200 million and $300 million.\nLet's now turn to our cash and debt balances on slide six.\nWe ended the second quarter with $1.3 billion of cash and $3.6 billion of debt.\nIn February, we paid $300 million floating rate notes early, and we remain on track to repay $1 billion in debt during the next three years.\nThe timing will be in line with air traffic and narrow-body production rate recoveries.\nThe cadence of the global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic could result in fluctuations in our cash flows from period-to-period.\nNow let's turn to our segment performance on slide seven.\nIn the second quarter, fuselage segment revenues were $492 million, up 51% compared to the same period of 2020, primarily due to higher production volumes on the 737 and Bombardier business jet program, partially offset by lower production volumes on the 787 program.\nOperating margin for the quarter was negative 7% compared to negative 77% in the same period of the prior year, primarily due to increased 737 production volumes and the resulting decrease in excess capacity costs as well as less net forward losses in the absence of a loss on disposal charges.\nThe fuselage segment recorded $4 million of favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments and $36 million of net forward losses during the quarter, primarily due to the 787 program.\nPropulsion revenue in the quarter improved to $242 million, up 43% compared to the same period of 2020, primarily due to higher revenue on the 737 program and aftermarket sales, partially offset by decreased volume on the 777 program.\nDespite the challenging environment, operating margin for the quarter was positive 12%.\nThis is compared to negative 10% in the same quarter of 2020.\nIncreased 737 production and the resulting decrease in excess capacity costs as well as less forward loss charges were the main drivers to the improvement in the segment profitability.\nThe segment recorded $6 million of favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments and $9 million of forward losses.\nHigh production volumes on the 737, A220 and A320 programs were the main contributors to the increase in wing revenue to $259 million.\nOperating margin for the quarter was negative 6% compared to negative 35% in the second quarter of 2020.\nThe increases in segment profitability and operating margin were primarily a result of increased A320 production volume as well as less forward losses compared to the same period of 2020.\nThe segment recorded $8 million of net forward losses.\nIn closing, we are encouraged by the recovery in domestic air traffic demand.\nWe anticipate improved performance through the second half of the year as narrow-body production rates continue to increase.\nIncreasing narrow-body rates should also create positive momentum going into 2022.\nAdditionally, we are pleased to see the progress made so far on our aftermarket business jet and defense diversification efforts.\nIntegrating our acquisitions and expanding our diversification continue to drive long-term growth potential.\nCash flows remain a top priority for our team, and we are actively working on the execution of our cost and working capital initiatives.\nWe are also monitoring the remaining regulatory approvals needed for the 737 MAX return to service.\nAnd in addition, we are encouraged by the domestic aerospace recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe continue to see improvement in domestic air traffic, which has translated to improved production rates for our narrow-body aircraft versus 2020.\nFor the year, we expect to deliver 160 737 shipsets, up from just 71 in 2020.\nThis quarter, we also continued work with Boeing to address fit and finish issues on the 787 program, and we'll continue to coordinate with them to complete all necessary rework.\nThe recovery in narrow-body production is supporting better overall performance.\nWe're also encouraged by the continued growth in our aftermarket, business jet and defense programs.\nWe are maintaining our 2021 free cash flow guidance of negative $200 million to $300 million.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Today, we will review the second quarter 2021 financial results and provide an update on key business trends for Bio-Rad.\nWith me on the phone today are Norman Schwartz, our Chief Executive Officer; Ilan Daskal, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Andy Last, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Annette Tumolo, President of the Life Science Group; and Dara Wright, President of the Clinical Diagnostics Group.\nOur actual results may differ materially from these plans and expectations, and the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown.\nFinally, our remarks today will include references to non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share, which are financial measures that are not defined under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\nSo I'd like to take a few minutes to review our current state of operations around the world.\nOverall, Bio-Rad has adapted well to the working constraints that COVID has imposed upon us, and we find ourselves able to respond and react well to everyday operational changes and demands.\nWe continue to make solid progress on our core strategies, support of our customers and the safety of our employees.\nWith improvement in our end markets after the significant downturn a year ago, we're responding well to increased demand.\nBut as with other manufacturers in life sciences, we are having to work hard to procure raw materials in some challenged areas, such as plastics and electronic components, as well as dealing with increased pressure on raw material costs.\nWe also continue to experience higher than typical logistics costs as indicated in our Q1 call.\nWith the emergence of the COVID-19 delta variant, we are maintaining our work from home policies for the near term as we work on return to the workplace plans targeted for later this quarter, and we continue to monitor the global pandemic situation carefully given the fluidity the delta variance has created.\nEmployee safety remains a principal focus, and we are pleased with our safety record and the growing vaccination status of our organization.\nAs we enter Q3, we expect the emergence of the delta variant will continue to create some challenges, and we are maintaining vigilance and flexibility as a result.\nOverall, we expect to see continued improvement in our end markets through the second half of the year as our customers continue to adapt.\nHowever, the new delta variant clearly introduces an element of uncertainty as we move forward.\nNow I would like to review the results of the second quarter.\nNet sales for the second quarter of 2021 were $715.9 million, which is a 33.4% increase on a reported basis versus $536.9 million in Q2 of 2020.\nOn a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 27.5%.\nOn a geographic basis, we experienced currency-neutral growth across all three regions.\nSales of our core products in the second quarter of last year were negatively impacted by the pandemic.\nAnd generally, we are seeing a continued gradual capacity improvement at both academic and diagnostic labs, which we estimate between 90% and 95% of pre-COVID levels.\nWe estimate that the COVID-19-related sales were about $68 million in the quarter.\nSales of the Life Science group in the second quarter of 2021 were $334.2 million compared to $252.1 million in Q2 of 2020, which is a 32.6% increase on a reported basis and a 27.1% increase on a currency-neutral basis.\nThe year-over-year sales growth in the second quarter was driven mainly by increases in western blotting, Droplet Digital PCR and qPCR products.\nWe have seen strong growth in the biopharma market for our Droplet Digital PCR platform.\nWe are also seeing a healthy uptake for ddPCR in wastewater solutions.\nGovernment funding toward public health labs is driving increased demand for our ddPCR products that offer automated solutions with high accuracy and sensitivity.\nProcess Media, which can fluctuate on a quarterly basis, saw a year-over-year double-digit growth versus the same quarter last year.\nExcluding Process Media sales, the underlying Life Science business grew 29.1% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q2 of 2020.\nOn a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew across all regions.\nBefore moving on, I would like to highlight the broad legal settlement with 10 times Genomics announced earlier this week.\nThis settlement resolves the multiyear global litigation with 10 times over outstanding issues in the field of single cell and includes a global cross-license agreement.\nIn addition to past and future royalties, Bio-Rad received broad freedom to operate in the single-cell market and maintained exclusivity to our microwell single-cell IP.\nWe estimate that the future royalty payments from this legal settlement could total $110 million to $140 million over the life of the agreement, which runs through the year 2030.\nThis includes payments of $32 million in the third quarter for back royalties owed to Bio-Rad for the period from November 2018 through December 2020 as well as for settlement fees and interests.\nSales of the Clinical Diagnostics group in the second quarter were $380.2 million compared to $283.2 million in Q2 of 2020, which is a 34.3% increase on a reported basis and a 28% increase on a currency-neutral basis.\nDuring the second quarter, the diagnostics group posted double-digit growth across all of its product lines.\nThe year-over-year growth was driven by a recovery of routine testing.\nElective surgery recovery is still progressing although at a slower pace.\nOn a geographic basis, the diagnostics group currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew across all regions.\nOur diagnostics group announced last month a partnership with Seegene, which is a global leader in multiplex molecular diagnostics.\nBio-Rad will exclusively market the Seegene tests in the U.S., pending regulatory approvals.\nSeegene's diagnostic products have high sensitivity and specificity and are optimized to work with Bio-Rad's CFX Real-Time PCR Systems.\nThe reported gross margin for the second quarter of 2021 was 56.1% on a GAAP basis and compares to 54.6% in Q2 of 2020.\nRecall that the gross margin in Q2 of 2020 included an $8 million customs duty charge.\nAnd excluding that charge, the Q2 gross margin further improved this quarter as a result of our productivity and efficiency initiatives.\nHowever, as mentioned, we currently see increased pressure on raw material costs and higher logistics costs.\nAmortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.6 million and compares to $5 million in Q2 of 2020.\nSG and A expenses for Q2 of 2021 were $213.4 million or 29.8% of sales compared to $189.3 million or 35.3% in Q2 of 2020.\nIncreases in SG-and-A expenses was mainly the result of employee-related performance compensation expense.\nTotal amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG and A for the quarter was $2.4 million versus $2.3 million in Q2 of 2020.\nResearch and development expense in Q2 was $63.4 million or 8.9% of sales compared to $52 million or 9.7% of sales in Q2 of 2020.\nQ2 operating income was $124.8 million or 17.4% of sales compared to $51.7 million or 9.6% of sales in Q2 of 2020.\nLooking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $1.031 billion of income to the reported results and is substantially related to the holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG.\nAlso during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in net other income of $1.3 million primarily due to foreign exchange and compared to $10.7 million of income last year.\nQ2 of 2020 includes an $8.9 million dividend from Sartorius, which was declared in June and was paid in July.\nIn 2021, the Sartorius dividend was declared in the first quarter.\nThe effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 21% compared to 22.4% for the same period in 2020.\nThe tax rate for both periods were driven by the large unrealized gain in equity securities.\nIn addition, the second quarter of 2021 effective tax rate was lower also due to a lapse of statute of limitations of certain tax reserves.\nReported net income for the second quarter was $914.1 million, and diluted earnings per share were $30.32.\nThis is a decrease from last year and is related to changes in valuation of the Sartorius holdings.\nMoving on to the non-GAAP results.\nLooking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income.\nLooking at the non-GAAP results for the second quarter.\nIn cost of goods sold, we have excluded $4.6 million of amortization of purchased intangibles and $1.2 million of restructuring-related expenses.\nThese exclusions moved the gross margin for the second quarter of 2021 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 56.9% versus 55.5% in Q2 of 2020.\nNon-GAAP SG-and-A in the second quarter of 2021 was 29.2% versus 33.9% in Q2 of 2020.\nIn SG-and-A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization of purchased intangibles of $2.4 million, legal-related expenses of $8.8 million and restructuring and acquisition-related benefits of $7 million.\nNon-GAAP R-and-D expense in the second quarter of 2021 was 9.1% versus 9.8% in Q2 of 2020.\nIn R-and-D, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded $2.1 million of restructuring benefits.\nThe cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 17.4% on a GAAP basis to 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis.\nThis non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 of 2020 of 11.8%.\nWe have also excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius equity holdings of $1.031 billion and the $1.8 million loss associated with venture investments.\nThe non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 21.5% compared to 23.8% for the same period in 2020.\nThe lower rate in 2021 was driven by the geographic mix of earnings.\nAnd finally, non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2021 was $106.6 million or $3.54 diluted earnings per share compared to $48.3 million or $1.61 per share in Q2 of 2020.\nMoving on to the balance sheet.\nTotal cash and short-term investments at the end of Q2 were $1.167 billion compared to $1.025 billion at the end of Q1 of 2021.\nDuring the second quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our stock.\nFor the second quarter of 2021, net cash generated from operating activities was $154.6 million, which compares to $92.1 million in Q2 of 2020.\nThis increase mainly reflects higher operating profits.\nThe adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2021 was 22.3% of sales.\nThe adjusted EBITDA in Q2 of 2020 was 18.6% and excluding the Sartorius dividend was 16.9%.\nNet capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2021 were $23.4 million, and depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was $33.7 million.\nMoving on to the guidance.\nAndy previously alluded to continued uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, which could create some challenges and we look -- sorry, as we look to the better half of this year.\nThat being said, with customers continuing to adapt in this environment, we assume a gradual return to pre-pandemic activity and the more normalized business mix during the second half of 2021.\nWe are now guiding non-GAAP currency-neutral revenue growth to be between 10% and 10.5% for 2021 versus our prior guidance of 5.5% to 6%.\nThis updated outlook assumes the full year COVID-related sales to be between $200 million and $210 million, of which approximately $40 million to $50 million are projected for the second half of 2021.\nExcluding COVID-related sales, the non-GAAP year-over-year currency-neutral sales growth in the second half is expected to be between 13% and 14%.\nThis represents between 4.5% and 5.5% growth in the second half of 2021 over the first half of 2021.\nFull year non-GAAP gross margin is now projected to be between 57% and 57.5%.\nFull year non-GAAP operating margin is forecasted to be about 19%, which assumes higher operating expenses in the second half of 2021 versus the first half as we are anticipating continued gradual return to more normal activity levels.\nThis guidance excludes any benefit related to the settlement with 10 times Genomics.\nOur updated annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2021 is projected to be between 23% and 24%.\nFull year adjusted EBITDA margin is forecasted to be between 23% and 23.5%.\nSummary: ",

therefore, you should not place undue reliance upon them.\nAlso, our discussion today may include references to certain non-GAAP measures.\nI'm joined today by Harp Rana, our chief financial officer.\nOur team executed extremely well and delivered strong results in the fourth quarter.\nWe generated $14.3 million net income or $1.28 of diluted earnings per share as a result of continued quality growth in our loan portfolio, a strong credit profile, disciplined expense management and low funding costs.\nWe leveraged our new growth initiatives to take advantage of an increase in consumer demand in the quarter.\nWe originated $359 million of loans in the fourth quarter, which was comparable to the prior year and up nearly $51 million or 16% from the third quarter.\nThis drove sequential growth in our total portfolio of $77 million or 7%.\nOur core small and large loan portfolio grew by $80 million or 8% quarter over quarter.\nAnd on a year-over-year basis, our core loan portfolio grew by $19 million or 2%, and an impressive result considering the circumstances presented in 2020.\nCredit quality also remained stable in the fourth quarter, and we continue to maintain a very strong balance sheet.\nOur net credit loss rate during the quarter was 6.9%, a 210-basis-point improvement from last year, and we ended the quarter with a 30-plus day delinquency rate of 5.3%, down from 7% last year.\nOur $150 million allowance for credit losses as of December 31 continues to compare quite favorably to our 30-plus day contractual delinquency of $60.5 million and includes a $30.4 million reserve for additional credit losses associated with COVID-19.\nThis reserve assumes an unemployment rate of 9% at the end of 2021.\nWe continue to believe that we have ample coverage to absorb future credit losses.\nIn addition, with $452 million of unused capacity on our credit facilities and $203 million of available liquidity as of February 5, we have access to more than enough capital to invest in our business and fund our ambitious growth plans.\nEarlier today, we also amended our ABL facility to provide an additional $20 million of flexibility to return capital to our shareholders in the future, whether through dividends or share repurchases.\nIn addition, earlier this week, we priced our latest securitization transaction, which is expected to close on February 18.\nApproximately $250 million securitization garnered wide interest from investors, and priced at a record low average-weighted coupon of 2.08%, nearly 80 basis points better than our previous securitization.\nThe proceeds from the securitization will be used to retire our RMIT 2018-2 securitization, thereby significantly reducing our cost of capital and further strengthening our balance sheet.\nBefore looking ahead to 2021 and beyond, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the accomplishments of the past year.\nFrom the beginning of the pandemic, we maintained our focus on serving our customers, supporting our team members, delivering assistance to our communities and generating value for our shareholders.\nFor our customers, we provided effective avenues for continued access through our valuable loan products.\nWe introduced curbside service for payments, loan closings and all other types of servicing activity, and we quickly created and rolled out electronic remote loan closing capabilities, enabling our customers to extend and expand their relationship with us from the comfort of their homes.\nIn December, we closed 20% of our branch originations through the remote loan closing process.\nWe also offered borrower assistant programs as a necessary bridge for those most impacted by the pandemic.\nAnd in combination with government stimulus, we experienced historically low delinquencies throughout most of the year.\nImportantly, we ensured our customer safety while continuing to provide the best-in-class service experience.\nFor our team members, we expanded our paid time off policy to provide them with flexibility to address personal obligations and to assist in situations where they were unable to work remotely.\nWe implemented enhanced safety measures in all of our branches, covered the cost of virtual health visits for our team members, and offered paid leave for those exposed to the virus.\nAt the end of the year, we announced significantly enhanced benefit programs.\nFor our communities, we introduced retail reach, an employee-led initiative dedicated to creating positive social change and goodwill through community service, charitable giving and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\nIn the spring, we partnered with the American Heart Association and led all upstate South Carolina companies in fundraising for the Heart Walk.\nMore recently, we partnered with local food banks throughout our footprint to raise tens of thousands of dollars and collect literally tons of food for distribution within local communities.\nFor our shareholders, we grew our loan portfolio, maintained a stable credit profile, appropriately managed our operating expenses and decreased our funding costs, resulting in excellent bottom-line results.\nWe fortified our balance sheet, and we maintained access to significant borrowing capacity and liquidity.\nWe made considerable progress on our digital investments and initiatives, including by migrating our technology infrastructure to the cloud at the end of the year.\nThe resilience of our omnichannel operating model was clearly validated in 2020.\nAs we turn the page on what was for everyone, a very challenging year, I could not be prouder of our team and how they stepped up to navigate the crisis successfully.\nWe entered 2021 in a position of considerable strength and ready to embark on our next chapter.\nLooking ahead, we're excited about the opportunities that we see for sustainable growth.\nWe remain focused on expanding our market share, maintaining the credit quality of our loan portfolio and extending our competitive advantages.\nOver the next 18 months, we will acquire new customers through innovation and geographic expansion.\nWe will continue to prioritize our investment in digital capabilities to further enable our growth and make sure that we're always available at our customers' convenience.\nDuring the first half of 2021, we expect to roll out an improved digital prequalification experience for our customers, including expanded integration with existing and new digital affiliates and lead generators.\nWe're also moving ahead with our pilot of a new guaranteed loan offer program.\nThis will be an alternative to our convenience check loan product and may be fulfilled online with ACH funding into a customer's bank account.\nIn the second half of 2021 and into early 2022, we expect to test a digital origination product and channel for new and existing customers.\nAt the same time, we will complete the development of our mobile app and enhancements to our customer portal, allowing our customers easy access to payment functionality and additional features.\nIn parallel with our digital investments, we will expand our operations into four to five new states over the next 18 months.\nDoing so, we'll make our valuable product set, including a newly enhanced auto secured product available to millions of new customers.\nTo that end, we plan to open between 15 and 20 net new branches in 2021.\nWe believe this branch expansion strategy, supported by our digital initiatives will enable our branches to maintain a wider geographic reach and higher-average receivables per branch.\nThis will ultimately further expand our revenue and operating efficiencies and lead to stronger bottom-line growth.\nOur accelerated state expansion will begin with Illinois in the second quarter.\nWhile Illinois has recently passed legislation to cap the all-in APR at 36%, we feel that it remains a terrific opportunity to enter a new market with our digitally enabled business model and take advantage of the competitive disruptions from the recent legislation.\nAs of year-end 2020, 80% of our loan portfolio had an APR at or below 36%.\nWhile we have significant plans to invest in our growth in 2021 and beyond, we will not sacrifice the credit quality of our portfolio, which remains of paramount importance.\nAs of year-end, 61% of our total portfolio had been underwritten using the enhanced credit standards that we deployed during the pandemic.\nIt's our credit performance and underwriting capabilities that provide us with confidence in the pursuit of our long-term growth strategies.\nWe will continue to invest in our underwriting capabilities over time, including advanced machine learning tools to ensure the sustainability of our growth.\nAs we've said previously, any additional stimulus such as the recent $600 stimulus checks, will push COVID-related losses into the second half of 2021.\nAny subsequent stimulus will continue to positively impact credit, but will reduce loan demand early this year.\nAs we experienced in 2020, we expect a strong second-half balance in loan demand as vaccinations become more widespread and the economy begins to reopen more fully.\nIn sum, we had a fantastic end to a year that challenged everyone.\nWe executed across all facets of our business, and we have set ourselves up for an improved 2021 on both the top and bottom lines.\nOur team continues to go above and beyond to ensure that our customers receive the best possible experience.\nWe are excited about and confident in the sustainability of our omnichannel operating model, the resiliency of our customers and our team's ability to execute on our growth plans.\nLet me take you through our fourth-quarter results in more detail.\nWe generated net income of $14.3 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.28, resulting from quality growth in our portfolio, a strong credit profile, disciplined expense management and low funding costs.\nPage 4 shows our strong portfolio growth in the second half of 2020, driven by increased loan demand and our new growth initiatives.\nWe grew $114 million from June to December of 2020, with $77 million of this growth in fourth quarter.\nWe also increased our core finance receivables by $120 million from June to December of 2020 with $80 million of this growth in fourth quarter.\nPage 5 displays our portfolio growth and mix trends through year-end 2020.\nWe closed the quarter with net finance receivables of $1.1 billion, up $77 million or 7% sequentially and $3 million year over year.\nOur new growth initiatives drove $36 million of the $77 million of sequential growth.\nOur core loan portfolio grew $80 million or 8% sequentially and $19 million year over year.\nWe continued our mix shift toward large loans, which represent 63% of our portfolio as of fourth-quarter 2020.\nMoving to Page 6, as Rob mentioned earlier, originations continued to rebound in the fourth quarter.\nBranch originations grew from $233 million in the third quarter of 2020 to $272 million in the fourth quarter, a 17% improvement.\nMeanwhile, direct mail and digital originations increased from $75 million in the third quarter to $87 million in the fourth quarter, a 16% improvement.\nTotal originations in December increased 7% year over year.\nFor the first quarter, we expect to see our normal seasonal patterns, lower originations and higher runoff, as customers receive tax refunds and utilize their most recent stimulus payments.\nAs in prior years, we expect our net finance receivables to liquidate quarter over quarter with the timing of any new government stimulus reducing the loan demand temporarily.\nOn Page 7, we show our digitally sourced originations, which were 29% of our new borrower volume in fourth quarter, the highest we've seen.\nThis demonstrates our commitment to meeting the needs of our customers and serving them through our omnichannel strategy.\nDuring the fourth quarter, large loans were 60% of our digitally sourced originations.\nTurning to Page 8.\nTotal revenue declined 1% due to the continued product mix shift toward large loans and the portfolio composition shift toward higher-credit quality customers.\nOn a year-over-year basis, total revenue yield and interest and fee yield remained relatively flat.\nIn the first quarter, due to our seasonal pattern, we expect total revenue yield to be 180 basis points lower than fourth quarter and interest and fee yield to be 140 basis points lower.\nMoving to Page 10.\nOur net credit loss rate was 6.9% for the fourth quarter of 2020, a 210-basis-point improvement year over year and a 90-basis-point improvement from the third quarter of 2020.\nThe credit quality of our portfolio remains stable, as can be seen on Page 11.\nOur 30-plus day delinquency rate of 5.3% in December, continued to track near historic lows, even with the usage of borrower assistance programs remaining at pre-pandemic levels of 2.2%.\nOur delinquency level of 5.3% is 60 basis points higher than the third quarter, primarily due to normal seasonality, but it represents a 170-basis-point improvement year over year.\nWe expect the recent government stimulus will keep delinquencies muted for at least the first quarter of 2021 and perhaps longer, depending upon the level of the additional stimulus.\nTurning to Page 12, we ended the third quarter with an allowance for credit losses of $144 million or 13.6% of net finance receivables.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the allowance increased by $6 million to $150 million or 13.2% of net finance receivables.\nThe base reserve increased by $7.5 million due to portfolio growth and was partially offset by $1.5 million of COVID-specific reserves, resulting in $30.4 million of COVID-specific reserves as of quarter end.\nThe severity and the duration of our macroeconomic assumptions remained relatively consistent with our third-quarter model, including an assumption that unemployment is 9% at the end of 2021.\nOur $150 million allowance for credit losses as of December 31 and compares favorably to our 30-plus day contractual delinquency of $60.5 million.\nAnd at our current reserve levels, we are confident that we are sufficiently reserved if the pandemic continues for an extended period.\nFlipping to Page 13.\nG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020 were $44.8 million, up $3.9 million year over year but better than our sequential guidance for the quarter by $0.7 million.\nThe increase in G&A expense was primarily driven by $3 million in higher marketing expenses and digital investments to support our growth initiatives.\nAs Rob noted earlier, in 2021, we remain focused on investing in our digital capabilities and marketing efforts, all to drive new revenue opportunities, enhance our customers' omnichannel experience and create long-term operating leverage.\nOverall, we expect G&A expenses for the first quarter to be higher than the fourth quarter by approximately $1 million, encompassing investments in increased marketing, our digital capabilities and our state expansion plans.\nWe will continue to invest in our new growth initiatives in 2021 to drive receivable growth and to improve our operating leverage over the long term.\nTurning to Page 14.\nInterest expense of $9.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $1 million lower than in the prior-year period due to the lower interest rate environment.\nOur fourth-quarter annualized interest expense as a percentage of average net receivables was 3.3%, a 40-basis-point improvement year over year.\nWe purchased $50 million of interest rate caps in the fourth quarter to take advantage of the favorable rate environment.\nIn the first quarter, we expect interest expense to be approximately $9 million.\nAs Rob mentioned, earlier this week, we priced an approximately $250 million securitization at a record low average-weighted coupon of 2.08%.\nProceeds from the securitization will be used to retire our RMIT 2018-2 securitization, which had a weighted average coupon of 4.87%.\nIn the fourth quarter, we accelerated $0.8 million for the amortization of debt issuance costs related to the RMIT 2018-2 transaction in advance of the expected repayment this quarter.\nThe new securitization transaction will further reduce our cost of capital and strengthen our balance sheet moving forward.\nOur effective tax rate during the fourth quarter of 2020 was 23.3%, compared to 24.5% in the prior-year period, better-than-expected due to tax benefits on share-based compensation.\nFor 2021, we are expecting an effective tax rate of approximately 25.5%.\nPage 15 is a reminder of our strong funding profile.\nOur fourth-quarter funded debt-to-equity ratio remained at a very conservative 2.8:1.\nLow leverage, coupled with $150 million in loan loss reserves provides a strong balance sheet.\nAs of February 5, we had $452 million of unused capacity on our credit facilities and $203 million of available liquidity, consisting of a combination of unrestricted cash on hand and immediate availability to draw down cash from our revolving credit facilities.\nIn summary, we have more than adequate capacity to support the fundamental operations of our business, as well as our ambitious growth initiatives.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we repurchased 435,116 shares at a weighted average share price of $27.58.\nAs of the beginning of the year, we still had $18 million of availability remaining under our $30 million share repurchase program announced in third quarter of 2020.\nIn addition, our board of directors recently declared a dividend of $0.20 per common share for the first quarter of 2021.\nThe dividend will be paid on March 12, 2021, to shareholders of record as of the close of business, February 23, 2021.\nWe are very pleased that our strong balance sheet enables us to return excess capital to our shareholders.\nThat concludes my remarks.\nIn summary, 2020 was a challenging year for everyone.\nBut when times were the hardest, our team rose to the occasion.\nAs a result, we entered 2021 particularly well positioned to grow our market share while also maintaining a very strong balance sheet and excellent credit profile.\nWe're excited for the future as we continue to provide our customers with a best-in-class experience and deliver additional value to our shareholders.\nOperator, could you please open the line?\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Anatol Feygin, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Zach Davis, Senior Vice President and CFO.\nAnd actual results could differ materially from what is described in these statements.\nIn addition, we may include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow.\nAs part of our discussion of Cheniere's results, today's call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP, or CQP.\nWe do not intend to cover CQP's results separately from those of Cheniere Energy, Inc. the call agenda is shown on slide three.\nJack will begin with operating and financial highlights, Anatol will then provide an update on the LNG market, and Zach will review our financial results and guidance.\nBefore covering our results and outlook, I want to spend a minute addressing winter storm Uri and its impact on Cheniere.\nAs we described back in February, we were impacted by the widespread power outages in Texas, which resulted in our Corpus Christi facility being down for a few days.\nI'm extremely proud of our operating personnel at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi for rising to yet another weather challenge and working so diligently to manage our operations smoothly throughout the freeze event.\nFrom hurricanes to fog to now historic freezes, the Cheniere platform has withstood whatever mother nature throws our way and our focus on safe and reliable operations continues to benefit our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders.\nAs a result of the winter storm, there was no material impact on our assets or operations, and we were able to fill some cargoes at Sabine Pass and restore Corpus Christi to normal operating levels quickly to mitigate impacts on our delivery obligations.\nWe did recognize a financial benefit as a result of some optimization activity in the period leading up to the storm.\nBut the magnitude of that benefit is not material, which to our expected full year 2021 financial results.\nMore importantly, the global LNG market has recovered significantly for 2021 and beyond as demand has outstripped supply, resulting in higher prices even during the shoulder and summer months.\nI continue to believe in the long-term viability and sustainability of LNG as an essential fuel source in the low-carbon future.\nAfter delivering on our 2020 guidance, despite a myriad of challenges, we continued our momentum into the first quarter and are off to a fast start.\nNow full year 2021 is looking even better for us than it did on our last call in February.\nFor the first quarter, we generated approximately $1.5 billion of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, approximately $750 million of distributable cash flow and almost $400 million in net income on revenue of approximately $3.1 billion.\nWe've often described 2021 as Cheniere's cash flow inflection point, and you can see progress on that early in the year in our first quarter financial results.\nZach will cover these numbers in more detail in a few minutes.\nDuring the first quarter, we exported a quarterly record of 133 cargoes of LNG from our two facilities, with production incentivized by strong global LNG margins during the quarter, and we had the benefit of Corpus Christi Train three commissioning volumes.\nThis record production is also despite Corpus being down a few days as a result of the winter storm in February.\nA sustained stronger LNG margin environment, together with our results for the first quarter, contribute to our ability to raise our full year 2021 financial guidance for the second consecutive quarter.\nOur outlook for the balance of the year has improved since our last call in February, with a slightly higher production forecast, augmenting the impact of the improved LNG margins we see throughout the balance of the year.\nWe now forecast consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $4.30 to $4.6 billion, and distributable cash flow of $1.60 to $1.9 billion for the full year 2021.\nNear the end of the quarter, Train three at Corpus Christi achieved substantial completion within budget and in line with the accelerated time line we've previously communicated, with the completion of train three, the Cheniere and Bechtel relationship has now delivered eight LNG trains ahead of schedule and within project budgets, which is truly world class execution.\nAnd that execution excellence continues with our ninth Train.\nAs construction on Train six at Sabine Pass continues to progress against accelerated schedules.\nThe estimated substantial completion timeline has accelerated once again.\nSubstantial completion is now projected to be achieved in the first half of next year.\nThe carbon offsets covered full life cycle emissions.\nFrom the wellhead through consumption, with Cheniere delivering the cargo to Shell FOB at Sabine Pass and Shell delivering the cargo to a our European regasification facility.\nThis first carbon neutral cargo is another step in Cheniere's environmental efforts I've discussed over the past several months.\nOur efforts emphasize enhanced transparency as a critical step toward improving environmental performance, and maximizing the benefits of our LNG for Cheniere, our customers and our value chain partners.\nToday's carbon neutral cargo announcement follows our February announcement of cargo Emissions Tags development.\nThe response to our CE tax from current and prospective customers has been extremely positive and has spurred further engagement.\nOur focus is to ensure the long-term benefits of natural gas as an affordable, reliable and clean energy source for the world.\nTurn now to slide six.\nWhere I'll discuss what I'm seeing in the market today and why I'm so optimistic about Cheniere's future prospects.\nIn the short term market, we're beginning to see the impact of the structural shift to natural gas as a primary energy source for the world, as evidenced by the global LNG demand growth we saw in 2020 despite the pandemic.\nThere was constructive LNG demand tension between Europe and Asia earlier this year that left some countries short of natural gas.\nIn addition, South America is entering its winter demand month and is contributing to the tightness in the global LNG market.\nWith natural gas storage below normal levels in Europe and precious little new supply entering the market this year, we also have a constructive backdrop in the LNG market for the balance of this year and into next year in 2023.\nWith Corpus Christi Train three completed very early and the completion time line for Sabine Pass Train six recently accelerated again to the first half of next year.\nWe are ideally positioned to benefit from these near-term market dynamics.\nIn the longer term, the supply and demand fundamentals in the global LNG market are even stronger and reinforce our confidence in the value of our existing platform and in our ability to commercialize our Corpus Christi Stage III expansion project.\nIn the four year period from 2017 to 2020 and the global LNG market added almost 120 million tons of capacity, an average of almost 30 million tons per year.\nIn the subsequent four year period, that average is expected to drop to approximately 11 million tons a year, a significant slowdown in supply growth, which will be amplified by output declines from older legacy projects.\nOn the demand side, the structural shift to gas on a global basis is evidenced by the near-term doubling of LNG importing nations in the last 10 years, and hundreds of billions of dollars of natural gas oriented infrastructure being built around the world today.\nLNG consumers recognize and value LNG's flexibility, reliability, affordability and the critical role natural gas plays in improving environmental performance and achieving decarbonization goals.\nWe forecast that global LNG trade will approximately double, expanding by approximately 350 million tons per annum to over 700 million tonnes per annum by 2040, which would support additional, approximately 225 million tons per annum of incremental global supply.\nOur constructive long-term view on the LNG market was recently reinforced for the results of a comprehensive climate scenario analysis we conducted with a leading global management consulting firm.\nWe published this analysis last month, and it's available on our website.\nThis study analyzed Cheniere's business over the long-term under various energy transition scenarios and concluded that even under the most aggressive energy transition scenario analyzed.\nDemand for LNG and natural gas is expected to grow for decades to come.\nIn that not only are Cheniere's existing assets well positioned to take advantage of that, but new LNG capacity will be needed to meet that demand.\nWith regard to Cheniere specifically, our accomplishments and progress over the past five years of LNG operations have been nothing short of transformative and position the company to take full advantage of the constructive market we see in front of us.\nWe have established ourselves as a premier LNG operator, demonstrating LNG buyers worldwide the reliability and certainty associated with a long-term supply agreement with Cheniere.\nIn addition, our continuous improvement efforts have yielded efficiency gains and debottlenecking has unlocked a significant amount of extremely cost-effective volume across our projects, which further improves our competitive position and increases financial returns.\nAs construction ramps down, the long-awaited financial results of our multiyear capital programs are bearing fruit as evidenced by today's results.\nThis year, we expect to generate well over $1 billion of free cash flow, and we are quickly approaching our expected run rate metrics.\nOur run rate forecast of $11 per share and distributable cash flow not only has a high degree of visibility but also empowers us to execute on an all of the above strategy for capital allocation, which includes achieving investment-grade credit metrics, funding a significant portion of Corpus Christi Stage three with cash flow after that project is commercialized and returning significant capital to shareholders via buybacks and dividend.\nZach and his team and I are working diligently with the Board and the rest of management on our detailed capital allocation plans, which we will communicate to you later this year.\nI'm excited about what we are seeing in the LNG market, how Cheniere is positioned to capitalize with our portfolio volumes, a shovel-ready brownfield expansion project commercial offerings tailored to customers' needs and an improving credit and cash flow profile.\nThe global LNG market exited 2020 on a positive note as cold weather across Asia and continued economic expansion in China helped contribute to an increase in Asian LNG imports in Q4.\nAs non-U.S. supply was slow to respond, markets tightened as Asia pulled cargoes from Europe, a trend which continued in Q1 of 2021.\nThe in the first quarter, global LNG supply showed positive year-on-year growth for the first time since the first quarter of 2020, but net growth was modest as a healthy 17% growth in U.S. exports was largely offset by declines at several LNG facilities around the globe, which were either shut down or underperforming, including facilities in Norway, Nigeria, Australia, Trindad, Tobago and Russia.\nExtreme cold weather in Asia and then Europe during the first quarter, combined with the supply constraints and a tight shipping market, caused unprecedented price spikes in JKM in the early part of the quarter to all-time highs of over $30 in January.\nSince then, extreme temperature conditions have passed and JKM prices have moderated.\nHowever, price levels are still well above where they were a year ago with March JKM settling at $8.26 and June trading above $9 currently.\nWell above prices around the $2 in MMBtu level a year ago, indicating an underlying structural tightening of the market, supported by strengthening demand fundamentals.\nAs I just mentioned, in Asia, LNG imports were very strong in Q1, up over seven million tons or 11% year-on-year.\nChina added nearly five million tons of LNG demand despite robust domestic gas production and increased Russian pipeline gas imports.\nEarly reports of total gas demand in China show an increase of approximately 15% year-on-year in Q1.\nWeather, continued coal-to-gas switching and a remarkable over 18% increase in Q1 GDP drove the demand increase.\nIn the Japan, Korea, Taiwan area, LNG imports increased 8% or three million tons year-on-year due partly to scheduled nuclear and coal outages.\nFrom a structural demand level, 10 years after the Fukushima earthquake, most Japanese nuclear plants remain offline with only nine units, totaling 9.1 gigawatts resuming operation as of Q1 '21 compared with 42 gigawatts in 2010, solidifying LNG as a critical fuel for the stability of the energy system in Japan and in the region as a whole.\nIn Europe, gas demand in major markets rose by 9% year-on-year during Q1 and stronger heating and gas-fired power demand.\nSignificant drawdowns from storage through winter and into April has left European storage approximately 34 bcm or around 50% lower than the prior year by the end of April and approximately 11 bcm or approximately 375 Bcf below the five year average.\nTo attract LNG volumes away from Asia to help replenish storage, TTF prices remain elevated.\nApril TTF settled higher than JKM at $6.46 an MMBtu that was 13% higher on the month and up almost 200% year-on-year.\nCurrent prop margins are in the $3 range, inclusive of a dramatic upward shift in charter rates from the $30,000 a day range well above the $80,000 a day range today.\nBased on these demand fundamentals, although specific conditions during the first quarter led to some dramatic LNG price volatility, we believe we have also seen indications that the structural tightening that we've been predicting for some time is now under way.\nAs such, we have continued to transact incremental volumes aligned with our midterm strategy.\nThe team has secured an additional approximately 1.7 million tons, locking in over $200 million in fixed fees across 2022 and '23.\nWe see strong appetite for midterm agreements as both intermediaries and end users add diversity, security and flexibility to their portfolios.\nTurning now to slide nine, where I will discuss some longer-term aspects of the market.\nWe've discussed over the last few years that we viewed 2021 as a transition year to a tight market.\nAnd as we just described, that has played out so much faster than we expected.\nForward margins today during the Northern Hemisphere Spring shoulder season, are higher than they have been at any point for this season since we began operating just over five years ago.\nA number of market conditions that have been headwinds to entering into long-term commitments have more recently become tailwinds.\nAnd such as oil price, prompt margins and forward supply growth, just to name a few.\nWe remain quite sanguine on the long-term contracting market for our products over the coming quarters and years as the demand for LNG will continue to increase over time with many current markets expanding and new markets continuing to be added.\nSpecific to Asia, along with China and India, markets in South and Southeast Asia have shown keen interest in expanding their natural gas infrastructure.\nFrom pipelines to power plants to support their rapidly growing economies.\nIn power generation, forecast suggests that gas is expected to be the second highest growth segment after renewables in terms of capacity additions.\nThe need to expand access to reliable energy across the region means that natural gas is expected to play a crucial role in ensuring sustainable economic growth while reducing emissions intensity.\nOf the roughly 3,000 gigawatts of forecast incremental power generation capacity in Asia by 2040, over 300 gigawatts is expected to be gas fired.\nJust for reference, a gigawatt of combined cycle natural gas generation operated as baseload, requires approximately one million tons of LNG per annum.\nA significant portion of that sum will be in China, but almost half of it is expected to satisfy growth in South and Southeast Asian countries, such as India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Vietnam and the Philippines.\nSome of these countries are already well-established gas users with indigenous resources, which are mature and declining.\nData from Wood Mackenzie suggest that the region could lose more than 20 Bcf a day of domestic output by 2040, and while current upstream developments are considered unlikely to offset more than just a small fraction of that decline.\nIn addition, gas demand in the region is currently expected to grow by at least 18 Bcf a day during the period to 2040, creating a gap of more than 35 Bcf a day of gas, which we expect to be satisfied in large part by LNG.\nAgain, for reference, 35 Bcf a day is equivalent to approximately 250 million tons per annum of LNG.\nLNG demand growth across the various markets of South and Southeast Asia is in aggregate very significant.\nLNG demand growth in South and Southeast Asia is expected to accelerate and potentially grow fivefold by 2040, adding between 160 million and 200 million tons to global trade.\nWe believe that over the next two decades, over 20% of the growth in Asian demand will come from China, and approximately 70% will come from South and Southeast Asia as these countries prioritize gas over coal to secure economic growth and meet their climate goals.\nThis region consumed over 17% of global coal and was responsible for more than 1/3 of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2019.\nWhile most net zero pledges came from outside the region, we believe that nations in South and Southeast Asia have been increasingly determined to improve environmental performance and find ways to fuel growth in a more environmentally sustainable manner.\nWe see Cheniere's LNG as a secure, reliable and cost-effective fuel for the region and which, along with renewables, will displace more polluting fuels.\nJack already touched on our leadership and initiatives in ESG and I'll just add that we are seeing increasing interest and engagement from both existing and potential customers on the environmental opportunities we are developing.\nCheniere stands ready to work with customers in the region and all over the world to create practical solutions that fit their commercial needs and satisfy global environmental imperatives.\nWe believe our low emitting LNG standards will play a role in supporting the region's environmental goals and its energy priorities.\nI'm pleased to be here today to review our first quarter financial results and key financial updates as well as our increased 2021 guidance.\nTurning to slide 12.\nFor the first quarter, we generated net income of $393 million, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.5 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $750 million.\nOur financial results for the first quarter were positively impacted by increased global LNG prices and margins, particularly margins realized on spot and short-term cargoes sold through our marketing affiliate and a higher-than-normal contribution from LNG and natural gas portfolio optimization activities due to significant volatility in LNG and natural gas markets during the quarter.\nAs we have discussed in prior quarters, our IPM agreements, certain gas supply agreements and certain forward sales of LNG qualify as derivatives and require mark-to-market accounting meaning that from period to period, we will experience noncash gains and losses as movements occur in the underlying forward commodity curves.\nThe impact of shifts in these curves on the fair value of our commodity and FX derivatives, during first quarter 2021 was a net loss of approximately $120 million, which was substantially all noncash.\nFor the first quarter, we recognized an income 456 TBtu of physical LNG, including 442 TBtu from our projects and 14 TBtu from third parties.\n84% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements.\nDuring and after this winter storm, we were able to work with our long-term customers on cargo schedules as well as shift some volumes from Corpus to Sabine, leading to no material impact to our production for the quarter.\nWe received no cargo cancellation notices and had no revenue related to cargo cancellations in the first quarter.\nHowever, we previously recognized $38 million of revenues during fourth quarter 2020 and related to canceled cargoes that would have been lifted in the first quarter.\nCommission activities for Corpus Train three went well, as Jack discussed, and we received $191 million related to sales of commissioning cargoes in the first quarter, corresponding to 25 TBtu of LNG.\nAs a reminder, amounts received from the sale of commissioning cargoes are offset against LNG terminal, construction and process, net of the costs associated with production and delivery of those cargoes.\nsix TBtu of LNG-related to commissioning activities was on the water at the end of the first quarter and will be recorded as an offset to construction in process upon delivery.\nTurning to the balance sheet.\nWe prioritized debt reduction since raising the Cheniere loan to refinance convertible notes last year and have committed to pay down at least another $500 million of outstanding debt in 2021.\nThe we made good progress toward that goal during the first quarter when we paid down $148 million in outstanding borrowings under the Cheniere term loan.\nI'll provide some additional color in a few moments.\nBut we are in an excellent position to reach, and likely surpass, our minimum debt reduction target this year.\nIn February, we locked in an approximately $150 million private placement of long-term amortizing fixed rate notes at SBL that are committed to fund in late 2021.\nAnd at a rate of 2.95%, the lowest yielding bond ever secured across the Cheniere complex.\nIn March, CQP opportunistically issued $1.5 billion of 4% senior notes through 2031, the proceeds of which, together with cash on hand, were used to extend the maturity and accretively refinance all of CQP's 5.25% senior notes due 2025.\nOur efforts on execution, performance and prudently managing the balance sheet throughout the Cheniere structure continue to be recognized by the credit rating agencies.\nAs we mentioned on our last call, in February, Fitch revised the outlook of SPL's senior secured notes rating to positive from stable while reaffirming its existing BBB minus investment-grade rating.\nIn April, S&P revised the outlook of both Cheniere Engineered Partners BB ratings to positive from negative, a signal that ratings upgrades may be coming.\nIn addition, S&P's commentary indicated a leverage level of 4.5 to five times on a debt-to-EBITDA basis in the next couple of years could be consistent with an investment-grade rating.\nCommentary, which is in line with, and supportive of, our deleveraging plan and goal of investment-grade credit metrics throughout the structure.\nTurning now to slide 13.\nAs Jack mentioned, today, we are again increasing our guidance ranges for full year 2021 consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow by $200 million, bringing total increases to $400 million above the original ranges we provided in November of last year.\nOur revised guidance ranges are $4.30 to $4.6 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $1.6 to $1.9 billion in distributable cash flow.\nToday's increase in guidance is largely driven by our strong results in the first quarter.\nThe continued improvement in global LNG market pricing and our ability to execute additional higher-margin forward sales into the stronger pricing.\nSince the last call, we have continued to lock in additional volumes for the remainder of the year.\nThough those sales have been offset by an upwardly revised production forecast driven by maintenance optimization, some favorable weather and a much faster than expected ramp-up to steady Train three volumes.\nWe currently forecast that a $1 change in market margin would impact EBITDA by approximately for full year 2021.\nAs we have now sold almost all of our production for the remainder of the year and have completed and placed Corpus Spring III into service, in line with our previously forecasted timing.\nOur remaining exposure this year is not material, and we only plan to provide another update if that were to change.\nWe are confident in our ability to deliver results within these upwardly revised guidance ranges for the full year.\nWith Train three now in operation, we've also now passed the free cash flow inflection point we have long discussed with our stakeholders.\nWe expect to generate meaningful free cash flow this year for the first time in Cheniere's history of well over $1 billion.\nWe originally committed to $500 million in debt reduction this year, but we now think $500 million is conservative due to our strong performance and cash flow generation year-to-date and the forward sales of LNG we have executed in a strong LNG market.\nWe are continuing to work on our long-term capital allocation strategy with our Board, and we anticipate communicating this multiyear plan to you in the second half of the year.\nIncluding more comprehensive plans for the remainder of free cash flow this year after meeting our initial 2021 debt reduction goal of $500 million.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.\nActual results may differ materially from these expectations due to changes in economic, business, competitive, market, political and regulatory factors.\nI'll also discuss today's announcement of our plan to acquire Midwest Warehouse & Distribution System.\nJohn will take you through our third quarter results, which exceeded our expectation again this quarter and review our disciplined capital allocation strategy focused on returns.\nI'll then discuss our updated 2021 outlook.\nLet me start with some key highlights about the market and our results.\nLong term transportation and logistics outsourcing trends continue to support our growth strategy and investments.\nTrends in warehousing and distribution as well as in e-commerce fulfillment and last mile delivery of big and bulky items have continued to accelerate since the pandemic began.\nOur strategic investments remain focused on leveraging these favorable outsourcing trends.\nUnprecedented challenges impacting labor, supply chains and truck production are providing us with additional growth opportunities because they help drive companies to make long term outsourcing decisions.\nWe're seeing record new contract wins in supply chain and dedicated, which we fully expect will contribute to long term profitable growth.\nFMS is also benefiting as companies are looking to source truck capacity in this extremely tight market.\nConsistent with our disciplined capital allocation strategy, we're investing in our higher return logistics businesses through our planned acquisition of Midwest Warehouse & Distribution System, which adds multi client warehousing capabilities in supply chain and accelerates growth.\nWe also announced plans to return capital to shareholders over time through discretionary and anti dilutive share repurchase programs.\nUse of the new discretionary program is anticipated to occur over time, dependent on several factors, including balance sheet leverage, the availability of quality acquisitions and the stock price.\nWe now expect to achieve ROE in the range of 18% to 19% for the full year.\nThe team has done an excellent job of leveraging favorable pricing trends in used vehicle sales and rental resulting in outperformance in both these areas.\nIn addition, we've continued to increase lease pricing resulting in improved portfolio returns and a 4% increase in revenue per average active lease vehicle.\nWe expect additional benefits going forward as leases are renewed and repriced and as we utilize data analytics to further segment customer pricing based on application, equipment type and other key drivers of lease returns.\nMoving to cash flow.\nWe generated strong year to date free cash flow of over $800 million and have increased our full year free cash flow forecast to $1 billion to $1.1 billion, up from our prior forecast of $650 million to $750 million.\nOur full year forecast reflects an estimated cash flow benefit of $400 million from deferred capital expenditures due to OEM delivery delays as well as record proceeds from the sale of our used vehicles.\nWith balance sheet leverage currently well below our target range, we have additional capacity to enhance shareholder value by deploying capital consistent with our disciplined capital allocation strategy.\nslide five provides an overview of the investments we're making to drive accelerated growth in supply chain and dedicated, a key element of our strategy to generate higher returns.\nDeveloping new and enhanced products such as Ryder Last Mile, e-commerce fulfillment and freight brokerage provides opportunities to leverage profitable growth areas.\nInnovative technology enables us to deliver value added logistics solutions that are in high demand.\nLast quarter, I highlighted Ryder Last Mile offering.\nThis quarter, I'll discuss RyderShare, our real time freight visibility and collaboration tool that has proven to be a key differentiator in winning new business.\nSales and marketing are key to our brand awareness and ensuring customers are aware of our full array of supply chain capabilities.\nOur Ever better campaign and the increased digital marketing presence have driven a significant increase in qualified sales leads.\nWe're also expanding our sales force and investing in their capabilities to drive additional growth opportunities.\nStrategic M&A opportunities, such as our planned acquisition of Midwest, are focused on adding new capabilities, geographies and/or industry verticals.\nThese opportunities are an important way to accelerate growth especially in Supply Chain and Dedicated.\nRyder Ventures, our corporate venture capital fund aims to invest $50 million over five years through direct investment in start-ups.\nOur investments here advanced strategic relationships where we typically are working together to develop new products and capabilities that benefit our customers and solidify our position as an industry leader.\nWe've made investments in numerous exciting areas such as e-commerce micro fulfillment and digital driver staffing and are working with these start-ups to address important customer needs.\nWe also recently announced strategic alliances with several autonomous technology firms, which enables us to leverage our expertise in asset management, maintenance and transportation, positioning us as an innovative leader in this emerging space.\nslide six takes a closer look at RyderShare, an innovative digital product that combines Ryder's nearly 90 years of logistics experience with best in class technology.\nRyderShare provides users with real time freight visibility throughout the life cycle of an order as well as the opportunity to share information between suppliers, carriers and shippers on one platform with Ryder's team of supply chain experts managing exceptions.\nRyderShare users benefit from improved service, from their, for their customers, increased employee productivity and the ability to readily access information from one source for decision making.\nAlmost 70% of Ryder's transportation volume and supply chain and dedicated now runs through RyderShare.\nThe platform has processed over 4.4 million transactions and has over 5,300 users to date.\nWe're also excited about our recent launch of RyderShare for warehousing.\nThis enhancement makes RyderShare, the only visibility platform that connects transportation with warehousing.\nWe expect this will be a key differentiator in winning new business.\nTotal company results for the third quarter on page seven.\nOperating revenue of $2 billion in the third quarter increased 11% from the prior year, reflecting revenue growth across all three of our business segments.\nComparable earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.55 in the third quarter as compared to $1.21 in the prior year.\nHigher earnings reflect improved performance in aftermaths from higher rental, used vehicle sales and lease results, as well as a declining depreciation expense impact related to prior residual value estimate changes.\nReturn on equity, our primary financial metric, reached 15.7% for the trailing 12 month period.\nROE reflects higher earnings from rental, used vehicle sales and declining depreciation expense impact.\nImproved lease performance also contributed to higher ROE and reflects the impact of our pricing initiatives.\nyear to date free cash flow was strong at $829 million, although down from the prior year when capital expenditures were unusually low due to COVID.\nTurning to FMS results on page eight.\nFleet Management Solutions operating revenue increased 8%, reflecting 37% higher rental revenue, driven by strong demand and higher pricing.\nRental pricing increased 9%, primarily due to higher rates across all vehicle classes.\nFMS realized pre-tax earnings of $186 million, up by $170 million from the prior year.\n$93 million of this improvement is from higher gains on used vehicles sold and a lower depreciation expense related to prior residual value estimate changes.\nImproved rental and lease results also significantly contributed to increased FMS earnings.\nRental utilization on the power fleet was a record 83% in the quarter and well above the prior year's 71%.\nResults also benefited from ongoing momentum from lease pricing initiatives, partially offset by a 3% smaller average active lease fleet.\nFMS EBT as a percentage of operating revenue was 14.9% in the third quarter and surpassed the company's long term target of high single digits.\nFor the trailing 12 month period, it was in line with the target at 9.7%.\npage nine highlights global used vehicle sales results for the quarter.\nUsed vehicle market conditions remain robust due to strong freight activity and timing supply from truck production constraints.\nHigher sales proceeds reflect significantly improved market pricing.\nGlobally, year over year proceeds more than doubled for both tractors and trucks.\nWhile sequentially tractor proceeds were up 32% and truck proceeds were up 27% versus the second quarter 2021.\nAs you may recall, last year, we provided a sensitivity noting that a 10% price increase for trucks and a 30% price increase for tractors in the U.S. would be needed by 2022 in order to maintain current residual value estimates.\nOur current tractor and truck proceeds significantly exceed these levels.\nAverage current pricing in the U.S. for tractors and trucks is well above our residual value estimates used for depreciation purposes.\nAs such, we are comfortable with our residual value estimates and we do not anticipate the need for any significant adjustments at this time.\nDuring the quarter, we sold 4,900 used vehicles, down 44% versus the prior year and down 18% sequentially, reflecting lower inventory levels.\nUsed vehicle inventory was 3,500 vehicles at quarter end, below our target range of 7,000 to 9,000 vehicles.\nTurning to supply chain on page 10.\nOperating revenue versus the prior year increased 14% due to new business higher volumes and increased pricing.\nGrowth was partially offset by the impact of supply chain disruptions and automotive production activity.\nWe expect this disruption to continue to impact our automotive customers until global supply chains normalize, and we continue to work with our customers to mitigate the impact.\nWe have included an estimated impact from potential shutdowns in our balance of year forecast as the situation remains fluid.\nSCS pre-tax earnings decreased 62% and trailing SCS EBT as a percent of op revenue of 6.2% was below target.\nThis reflects lower automotive earnings, higher labor costs and strategic investments, partially offset by positive earnings from these business.\nWe anticipate the pricing adjustments we're implementing to improve SCS EBT percentages in the first half of 2022 and to move around the target range or move to around the target range in the second half of next year.\nMoving to dedicated on page 11.\nOperating revenue increased 16% due to new business, higher volumes and increased pricing.\nNew contract wins and DTS continue to be robust with year to date sales results already reaching full year record levels.\nNew contract wins are driven by ongoing secular outsourcing trends as well as current labor and supply chain challenges that are driving companies to make long term outsourcing decisions.\nWe're signing larger deals across a diversified industry base and new contract wins are also benefiting from cross selling opportunities from FMS and SCS.\nDTS pre-tax earnings decreased 54% and trailing DTS EBT as a percent of op revenue was below target at 5.3%.\nThis reflects increased labor and insurance costs partially offset by positive earnings from new business.\nAlthough unprecedented labor challenges are affecting current results in DTS and SCS, we are increasing our recruiting efforts and successfully working with our customers to implement price adjustments to address higher market costs.\nWe're encouraged by the early progress we're making on these price adjustments as we continue to deliver the superior service our customers expect.\nWe're confident that our new and expanded customer base and pricing adjustments will improve DTS EBT percentages in the first half of '22 with it moving to around our target range in the second half.\nTurning to slide 12.\nLease capital spending of $807 million was above prior year's plan due to increased lease sales activity in the year.\nLease returns are benefiting from pricing initiatives and support a more normalized lease capital investment.\nRental capital spending of $583 million increased significantly year-over-year, reflecting a higher planned investment in the rental fleet.\nWe plan to grow the rental fleet by approximately 15% in 2021 and in order to capture the increased demand we've seen from strong e-commerce and overall freight activity.\nOur full year 2021 forecast for gross capital expenditures of $1.9 billion to $2 billion is below our initial forecast range.\nThis reflects an estimated impact of $400 million from deferred vehicle purchases due to OEM delivery delays that Robert highlighted earlier.\nTurning to slide 13.\nOur 2021 free cash flow forecast has increased to a range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, up from our previous forecast of $650 million to $750 million.\nThe full year forecast reflects our strategy to balance moderate growth in the capital-intensive FMS business, while generating positive free cash flow over the cycle.\nIt also reflects the impact from delayed OEM deliveries and record proceeds from used vehicles sold and, as noted earlier.\nBalance sheet leverage declined due to higher earnings and cash flow and is expected to remain below the low end of our target range this year.\nImportantly, we now expect to achieve ROE of 18% to 19% this year due to stronger than expected performance in FMS and a declining depreciation impact.\nHigher year to date comparable EBITDA, which excludes the impact of gains and losses on used vehicle sales, reflects revenue growth and improved operating performance.\nTurning to slide 14.\nI'd like to review our capital allocation priorities which are focused on creating long term shareholder value by investing in high return opportunities that generate positive free cash flow over the cycle.\nOur first priority for capital is investing in high return organic growth opportunities, which includes moderate FMS lease fleet growth and accelerating growth in SCS and DTS.\nIn our FMS business, we estimate investments of between $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion annually, and that is the amount needed to replace leased vehicles as contracts are renewed and to refresh the existing rental fleet.\nWe also estimate investing between $200 million to $500 million in annual fleet growth, which represents lease fleet growth of approximately 2,000 to 4,000 vehicles with commensurate growth in rental.\nReturns in both lease and rental are expected to continue to benefit from ongoing pricing initiatives.\nInvestments to accelerate growth in our higher return and less capital intensive supply chain and dedicated businesses as well as technology investments that expand or enhance our capabilities are also key priorities for organic growth capital.\nTargeted acquisitions such as our planned acquisition of Midwest, are focused on adding new services capabilities or industry verticals and provide us with important opportunities for long-term profitable growth.\nAccretive tuck-in acquisitions that supplement our base business as well as investments by RyderVentures provide additional opportunities for us.\nOur capital allocation strategy is also focused on returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nRyder has made an uninterrupted quarterly dividend payments for more than 45 years.\nOur dividend growth rate over the past 10 years is 7% and our current dividend yield is around 3%.\nThe new share repurchase programs discussed earlier allow for both anti-dilutive and discretionary share repurchases.\nWe remain committed to offsetting dilution through the use of the anti-dilutive program.\nThe discretionary program is planned to be utilized over time to manage leverage and its usage will be dependent on several factors, including balance sheet leverage, the availability of quality acquisitions and stock price.\nOur capital allocation priorities are focused on achieving ROE of 15% or higher over the cycle while generating positive free cash flow and maintaining target leverage.\nTurning now to our earnings per share outlook on page 15.\nWe're raising our full year comparable earnings per share forecast to $8.40 to $8.50, up from our prior forecast of $7.20 to $7.50 and well above a loss of $0.27 in the prior year.\nWe're also providing a fourth quarter comparable earnings per share forecast of $2.36 to $2.46, significantly above the prior year of $0.83.\nUsed vehicle sales, rental and lease are the key drivers of higher expected full year results.\nGains are expected to be down slightly in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, reflecting strong pricing, partially offset by fewer vehicles sold due to low inventory levels.\nLooking ahead to 2022, we expect both higher revenue and earnings.\nRecord new contract wins in 2021 in supply chain and dedicated are expected to benefit 2022 revenue growth.\nSupply chain and dedicated margins are expected to improve in the first half of next year and move toward the target range in the second half, reflecting price increases to address higher labor costs, barring any further market disruptions.\nWe expect strong freight conditions and truck production challenges to continue into 2022 benefiting FMS results.\nDeclining depreciation expense impact is expected to benefit year over year earnings comparisons by $85 million.\nHowever, this is expected to be fully offset by higher book values on vehicles being sold next year.\nUsed vehicle sales volumes are expected to be flat to modestly higher.\nUsed truck pricing for the year is expected to be flat to modestly higher in 2022, remaining strong through at least the middle of the year and potentially declining in the second half if new truck production ramps up and used vehicle inventories and the overall market begin to normalize.\nFree cash flow next year is expected to decline, largely reflecting the $400 million capital expenditure deferral from 2021 into 2022 due to OEM delivery delays.\nGiven the unusual OEM production situation, it would be appropriate to look at combined free cash flows in 2021 and 2022.\nOverall, we're pleased with the trends that favor outsourcing and our efforts in sales, marketing and new product development.\nWe're confident in the actions we're taking to increase returns, including higher pricing to offset labor challenges, positioning us well for 2022.\nBefore we go to questions, please note that we expect to file our 10-Q later today.\nSummary: ",

Abhishek Khandelwal, the company's chief financial officer.\nThe slides we'll be referring to today are available on CIRCOR's website at www.\nThese expectations are subject to known, and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors.\nFor a full discussion of these factors, the company advises you to review CIRCOR's Form 10-K, 10-Q, and other SEC filings.\nThe company's filings are available on its website at circor.com.\nActual results could differ materially from those anticipated, or implied by today's remarks.\nThese non-GAAP metrics exclude certain special charges and recoveries.\nThe CIRCOR Team has gone above and beyond to deliver essential products to our customers, while keeping each other safe, and maintaining business continuity.\nCIRCOR delivered a strong second quarter, despite unprecedented macro challenges.\nI'm proud of the portfolio transformation that we've executed over the last couple of years.\nWith the recent divestiture of distributed valves, we completed our shift out of upstream Oil & Gas and other commodity businesses.\nAs a result of this transformation, we've sharpened our focus on our core Mission Critical flow control platforms, and we positioned CIRCOR for strong future growth.\nOur current portfolio of Mission Critical business is more diversified and less cyclical mitigating the impact of the broader economic environment.\nIn addition, our portfolio of products has differentiated technology and a strong market position that has enabled us to raise prices through the current downturn.\nAll of our factories are operating in line with customer demand.\nAs of today, we're absorbing some inefficiencies associated with safety protocols we put in place to ensure our employee's safety.\nWe continue to manage some COVID-19 related challenges on the supply chain side.\nBeyond this, we're experiencing a limited direct disruption in operations from COVID-19.\nDespite these challenges, the CIRCOR operating system is delivering improved operating performance across most metrics.\nAnd finally, we're positioning CIRCOR to take advantage of a market recovery.\nWe remain on track to deliver on our commitment to launching 45 new products this year.\nWe continue to invest in front-end resources and strategic growth initiatives.\nWe're closely collaborating with suppliers and customers to ensure alignment as markets change.\nLastly, we continue to focus on deleveraging the balance sheet.\nNow, I'd like to provide some highlights from the second quarter.\nPlease turn to Page 4.\nWe booked orders of $193 million with the book-to-bill ratio slightly over 1.0, and a backlog build of $7 million.\nSales came in at $186 million, down 14% organically, largely driven by industrial.\nAerospace & Defense this top-line remained robust through the quarter.\nThe adjusted operating margin was 8.5% down 210-basis-points from last year.\nThe margin decline was primarily driven by lower volume in industrial.\nDespite lower revenue, we managed companywide detrimental to 22%, due to the aggressive cost and price actions we implemented earlier this year.\nOur cost actions remain in line with the targets we laid out in our first-quarter earnings call, and our price actions across the company are coming in as expected.\nLet's begin by reviewing our segment results.\nAll figures up from continuing operations and exclude divestitures.\nStarting with industrial in Slide 5.\nIn Q2, Industrial segment orders were down 16% organically, due to COVID-19 impact on most industrial-end markets.\nThe Industrial segment had sales of $124 million, down 19% organically.\nThe majority of our end markets within industrial were challenged, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe saw the capital projects and customer maintenance delays to the quarter.\nOur EOM margin was 10% representing a decline of 350-basis-points versus the prior year.\nThis was primarily driven by lower sales volume, and inefficiencies associated the need to maintain social distancing on the factory floor, among other safety policies, due to COVID-19.\nThe cost actions they've initiated at the end of 2019, coupled with further action stated the pandemic resulted in a drop-through 27% which is significantly lower than our contribution margin.\nIn Q2 in the Aerospace & Defense segment, we delivered orders of $77 million, down 18% organically, due to a difficult comparison.\nLast year, we received a large Joint Strike Fighter order for $17 million.\nWhile this year, we had the impact of COVID-19 on commercial Aerospace, although partially offset by the Virginia Class Submarine order for $9 million.\nAerospace & Defense had sales of $62 million, down 3% organically, due to COVID-19 impact on commercial Aerospace, and ongoing 737MAX delays.\nThis was partially offset by strong defense shipments, especially for the Virginia Class Submarine, and the Joint Strike Fighter programs.\nThe Aerospace & Defense operating margin was 21.1% up 500-basis-points.\nThe $2 million of lower revenue in the Aerospace & Defense team delivered $3 million of incremental operating income, driven by pricing, productivity, and cost actions.\nTurning to Slide 7.\nFor Q2, the adjusted tax rate was 14.8%, due to foreign tax-rate differential, and higher R&D tax credits.\nLooking at special items and restructuring charges, we recorded a total pre-tax charge of $17 million in the quarter.\nThe acquisition-related amortization & depreciation was a charge of $12 million.\nWanting professional fees were a charge of $4.6 million, attributable to last year's unsolicited tender offer, corporate governance actions, and other proxy related matters.\nInterest expense for the quarter was $8 million, down $5 million, compared to the prior year.\nThis was a result of lower-debt balances and a federal interest rate of 25-basis-points.\nOther income was at $2 million charge in the quarter primarily, due to foreign exchange losses, partially offset by pension income.\nCorporate costs in the quarter were $9.7 million, higher than normal, primarily driven by a write-off of $1.8 million against a written asset from a previously divested business.\nFor Q3 and Q4, we expect the corporate cost run rate to be approximately $7 million per quarter.\nTurning to Slide 8.\nOur free cash flow from operations was negative $28 million in the second quarter, which is in line with the guidance provided during our first-quarter earnings call.\nDuring the quarter, we disposed of our Distributor Valves business for a negative $8.25 million in cash.\nThe company also incurred approximately $10 million of cash disbursements associated with, last year's unsolicited tender offer to acquire the company, support for corporate governance changes, restructuring, investment, banking fees, and other professional services.\nAt the end of the second quarter, our net debt was $467 million, which was $205 million dollars lower than Q2, 2019.\nAs we mentioned in our Q1 quarterly call, we expect our Q3 free cash flow to be approximately break-even to slightly negative.\nAs we complete the final disbursements related to the exit of Distributed Valves and other restructuring expenses.\nQ4 is expected to be a strong positive cash flow quarter, largely clean of transition, and restructuring expenses.\nNow, I will hand it back over to Scott, to provide some color on our end markets, and outlook.\nNow, I'll provide an overview of what we're seeing in our end markets, as well as some of the actions we're taking to manage through the pandemic.\nPlease turn to Page 9.\nLet me start by recapping ou in-market exposure.\nFirst, we've completely exited upstream Oil & Gas.\nLooking at today's portfolio, approximately 46% of our revenue is General Industrial, 27% is Aerospace & Defense with defense approximately twice the size of commercial, and 27% as aftermarket sales and support.\nI'd like to point out a few aspects of our current portfolio.\nOur Aftermarket business is largely driven by Industrial and defense.\nAftermarket margins are higher than OEM margins.\nOrders driven by our large global installed base are mitigating the impact of the broader economic decline.\nAftermarket is a strategic growth area for CIRCOR, and aftermarket growth investments will continue through 2020 and beyond.\nWe expect the defense to remain robust.\nOur Defense team is winning new programs in next year's U.S. defense budget appears to be coming in at 2020 levels or slightly better.\nIn addition, we're seeing strong support from many of our larger defense platforms.\nOur Commercial business represents 8% of revenue, and less than half of it is driven by Boeing and Airbus commercial aircraft platforms.\nThe majority of the remaining commercial sales come from a long list of OEM platforms across business and regional aviation, Civil Helicopters, and Space programs.\nOur Industrial business is very diversified by the end market.\nOutside of downstream, Oil & Gas which represents 10% of revenue, no end-market represents more than 6% of revenue.\nThis offers significant diversification, reducing cyclicality, and our dependence on anyone end market.\nLet's start with the industrial.\nOrders overall in Q2 were down 16% organically.\nDuring the second quarter of the Industrial business, we saw the impact of COVID-19 across most major end markets.\nFor market orders were down 23%, impacted by an overall slowdown in global manufacturing, as well as large project delays linked to the global reduction in capex.\nWe saw a capital project delays in Commercial Marine, Machinery Manufacturing, Chemical Processing, and Building & Construction end markets.\nThe impact on water and wastewater was relatively modest compared to other end markets.\nconsumer goods manufacturing sector.\nThe COVID-19 environment coupled with some customers shifting consumer goods manufacturing from China to the U.S. created a moderate increase in orders in this sector.\nAftermarket orders were down 8% organically in Q2.\nOur global installed base combined with our dedicated Aftermarket Commercial team is mitigating the impact of steeper declines and for market capital projects.\nThe aftermarket weakness was most significant in Commercial Marine, due to lower utilization of Cruise ships, and offshore service vessels.\nWe're seeing pockets of growth in some areas like nuclear power in Asia and midstream Oil & Gas in Latin America.\nDownstream order intake in the quarter was relatively low, due to delayed capital projects and maintenance turnarounds.\nRefiners are minimizing short-term spending and reducing the scope of activities planned for the fall turnaround season.\nAftermarket backlog is expected to grow as we exit the year in preparation for the delayed maintenance activities from 2020, and layering on top of the already planned repair and maintenance work slated for 2021.\nBoating activity remains strong for long cycle capital projects in growth markets.\nFor Industrial overall in Q3, the end-market outlook is similar to market levels in Q2.\nWe expect the impact of COVID-19 to drive a year-over-year decline in revenue of 18% to 28%.\nWe expect most OEM end markets in Q3 to remain at Q2 levels, due to ongoing capital expenditure reductions, and capital project delays.\nOn the aftermarket side, we're starting to see some improvements sequentially in Europe and Asia, as those markets recover from the COVID related downturn.\nIn North America, we expect Q3 revenue to be in line with Q2.\nRegionally, the general industrial market is expected to decrease in Q3 versus the prior year in North America, Europe, and India.\nHowever, we expect to see growth in China.\nOur Aerospace & Defense segment delivered orders of $77 million in the quarter, driven by ongoing strength in Defense programs like the Joint Strike Fighter.\nthe US Naval Virginia Class Submarine, the CVN-80 aircraft carrier, and various missile programs.\nStrengthened Defense orders offset weakness in commercial Aerospace orders which were down from the previous quarter, due to the impact of COVID-19 on production rates at Boeing and Airbus, and 737MAX.\nOverall, we expect Q3 orders to decrease sequentially driven by the timing of Defense Program orders, and COVID related headwinds in the Commercial business.\nFor Aerospace & Defense and aggregate, we expect revenue to be up sequentially in Q3, but down 3% to 5% versus last year.\nCommercial revenue is expected to be down approximately 30% to 40% versus last year, while the defense should be up 12% to 17%.\nIt's important to note that we're increasing prices on both sides of the business, Defense and Commercial Aerospace.\nWith carryover pricing from 2019, and new increases this year, we expect to net a 4% price increase in Q3.\nThe price increases are heavily weighted in the aftermarket.\nBefore I wrap up, I want to read [audio gap] out last summer and have continued to make strong progress.\nWhile the pandemic has had a significant impact on our end markets, we've responded accordingly by accelerating, and expanding many aspects of the plan, particularly with respect to reducing structural cost, and leaning out the company.\n[Audio gap] and the growth capacity of the company, despite the expanded reduction of structural cost.\nNotably, we've increased our commitment to new products launched in 2020 to 45, up from 40 in the original plan.\nAnd finally, the price remains an important part of our playbook, due to the mission-critical nature of our products, we've been able to raise prices this year in line with the original plan we committed to last year, despite the recent market disruption.\nTo summarize, we're taking the appropriate steps to navigate the current environment while continuing to execute on our strategic plan.\nAs the market continues to change, we'll continue to adapt to ensure we're positioned to succeed.\nI'd like to close by once again [audio gap] the unwavering dedication to our customers.\nThey've been doing a remarkable job.\nWe remain committed to positioning CIRCOR for long-term growth, expanding margins, generating strong free cash flow, and deleveraging the company.\nNow, Abhi and I would be happy to take your question.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Information required by Regulation G of the Exchange Act with respect to such non-GAAP financial measures can be obtained via WESCO's website at wesco.com.\nReplay of this conference call will be archived and available for the next seven days.\nOn behalf of WESCO, I hope that all of you have been staying healthy and safe in these challenging times.\nWe prepared a very thorough update for you today.\nI'll lead off with a few introductory remarks, and then Dave will take you through our second quarter results, and then we'll provide a review of the excellent progress we're making on the Anixter integration, as well as the outstanding value creation that our transformational combination of WESCO and Anixter will create.\nSo first for an update on our business in the second quarter.\nResults exceeded our expectations across the board; that is for sales, operating margin, operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow.\nBusiness momentum improved through the quarter as we outperformed the market and built an all-time record backlog for the legacy WESCO business.\nImportantly, sales improved sequentially each month, and we saw continued growth in our utility business.\nAnixter also delivered a strong performance to close out the second quarter.\nOur positive momentum has continued into the third quarter.\nWe're very encouraged by that, with quarter-to-date sales through workday 28, that's quarter-to-date, down 8% versus prior year, but up a 11% sequentially, with a book-to-bill ratio above 1.0.\nAs we have done in prior economic cycles, we aggressively managed our business and took significant cost reduction and cash management actions, which enabled us to achieve a decremental margin of only 10%, and generate exceptionally strong free cash flow of $140 million or 250% of adjusted net income.\nAs you know, we increased debt to complete the Anixter combination.\nWe expect our consistently strong and counter-cyclical free cash flow generation to enable us to rapidly delever and get back within our financial target leverage levels within three to six [Phonetic] months.\nNow turning to Anixter.\nThe second quarter will prove to be a watershed period in our WESCO's history, as we've successfully closed on our industry-shaping merger of WESCO and Anixter.\nIn combining few industry-leading Fortune 500 companies was successful track record.\nWe are creating the premier electrical communications and utility distribution and supply chain solutions company in the world.\nIn May, we completed a well oversubscribed and highly successful capital raise of approximately $5 billion in bonds and bank debt, all with very favorable terms.\nWe satisfied the remaining closing condition when the waiting period for the Canadian Competition Bureau expired on June 18th, and then successfully closed the Anixter transaction on June 22nd.\nThis timing met our commitment to close this transaction in the second or third quarter.\nAgainst the challenges imposed by the global pandemic, the extraordinary determination of our WESCO and Anixter associates to execute a flawless day one closing, just five months after signing the merger agreement was very impressive.\nI could not be more proud or more appreciative of the entire team and their extraordinary efforts in achieving this noteworthy milestone.\nAs I mentioned before, we've been executing a detailed rigorous and process -oriented integration planning effort over the last several months.\nNow, all of our integration efforts and organizational focus shift from planning to execution and synergy realization.\nI'm happy to say, we are off to an excellent start in integrating the two businesses in our first six-weeks since closing, and have already completed actions to deliver over 50% of our year-one cost synergy target of $68 million.\nWe have also begun to realize our first sales synergies through leveraging our expanded global footprint and cross-selling what is now our broader product and services portfolio.\nThe strong cultural alignment between WESCO and Anixter is proving to be a key driver of our initial success.\nWe are both building on this early successes, and we remain highly confident in capturing the significant upside potential and exceeding our three-year cost savings, sales growth, margin expansion and cash generation synergy target.\nHe is going to walk you through our second quarter results and then discuss our integration, execution and synergy capture plan in more detail.\nI'll start with an overview of results beginning on Page 4.\nThis slide presents our second quarter walking you from our reported GAAP results to the legacy WESCO results.\nThe column on the left shows our reported GAAP numbers and to the right of that column are the various adjustments to our reported results to remove the transaction-related impacts.\nThe third column subtracts the merger-related adjustments from the reported results to show the underlying results of the business adjusted for all deal-related cost and activities.\nTo the right of that are the Anixter and WESCO components of these adjusted results, respectively.\nReported sales in the quarter were down 3% and down 12% organically, driven by lower demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nI'll walk you through our sales results in more detail in a moment.\nThe legacy WESCO business generated approximately -- operating profit of $70 million [Phonetic], approximately $28 million lower than the prior year and a sales decline of approximately $285 million, representing a decremental margin of 10%.\nSG&A was down $33 million compared to the prior-year quarter, reflecting COVID-related cost actions and lower volume.\nLegacy WESCO adjusted operating margin was 3.8% for the quarter and adjusted earnings per share was $1.04.\nThe legacy adjusted Anixter results for the period following the merger at gross margin of 20.3% and operating margin of 8.3%.\nThis exceptional result was driven by the strong Anixter sales during the nine-day ownership period in the second quarter, continued gross margin expansion and cost reduction actions initiated by Anixter in response to COVID-19.\nOn an adjusted basis, the combined WESCO and Anixter business generated operating margin of 4.2% and diluted earnings per share of $1.36.\nA brief comment on the merger-related adjustments.\nThe $73 million of SG&A primarily represents investment banking, legal and integration management fees.\nAdditionally, we recognized a one-time expense associated with the change of control provisions of the transaction.\nYou will also note several impacts below the operating profit line, including interest expense of $45 million.\nThis includes interest paid on the bonds issued and non-amortized financing fees.\nWe also recognized preferred dividends expense of just over $1 million in the quarter related to the preferred stock consideration to Anixter stockholders.\nWe will provide a detailed update on the Anixter acquisition a bit later in the call as we have made substantial progress on the integration of the businesses and the generation of synergies.\nTurning to Slide 5.\nThis summarizes the organic sales growth by end-market and geography for the legacy WESCO business and does not include any contribution from Anixter.\nYou can see on the right hand side that monthly organic sales in the quarter were down 16%, 10% and 13% in April, May and June respectively versus the prior year.\nAs John mentioned, sales improved sequentially through the quarter on a same workday basis with April down 13%, followed by increases of 9% and 5% in May and June respectively.\nDifferences in foreign exchange rates reduced growth by 90 basis points, primarily reflecting unfavorable Canadian dollar exchange rates.\nLooking at the sales results by geography, the U.S., which is roughly 75% of legacy WESCO overall revenue, was down 12%.\nCanada was down 17% organically.\nBoth the U.S. and Canada results were driven by declines in our industrial and construction end-markets, as many projects were delayed beginning in March.\nIndustrial sales were down 21% organically in the U.S. and 22% in Canada, as we saw broad-based weakness in market verticals we serve due to COVID-19.\nBidding and project activity remained strong, however, and a number of industrial markets improved sequentially from Q1.\nConstruction sales were down 16% in U.S. and 21% in Canada, reflecting the project delays due to COVID-19.\nOur legacy WESCO backlog reached a new Company record and was up 17% versus the prior year and up 4% sequentially from Q1.\nConsistent with what we saw through the end of April, construction projects have been delayed rather than canceled.\nUtility sales continued to be exceptionally strong in the quarter with the U.S. up 6% organically and Canada up 36%.\nSequentially, U.S. utility sales were up 8% and Canada utility sales were up 27% versus Q1.\nThis was our 12th consecutive quarter of organic growth in the U.S. utility business.\nCommercial, institutional and government or CIG, organic sales ended down approximately 5% for the quarter.\nThis end-market exhibited positive momentum in the quarter, and sales were up 13% and 11% sequentially from Q1 in U.S. and Canada, respectively.\nProjects related to data center builds, security and cloud computing projects with large technology customers, continue to provide significant sales growth opportunities.\nMoving to Slide 6, let me take a moment to remind you of our liquidity and some features of our new borrowing facilities that we closed on in June, as they position us to meet the challenges related to the economic impact of the coronavirus.\nOur liquidity, which is comprised of invested cash and borrowing availability on our bank credit facilities, is strong at $819 million.\nWe have maintained sufficient cash on the balance sheet of $265 million.\nCollections throughout the quarter and into August have performed at or above historical trends.\nBad debt reserves are also tracking consistent with historical levels.\nIn connection with our closing the Anixter merger, we raised new senior unsecured notes of approximately $2.8 billion, a portion of which was used to refinance Anixter's 2021, 2023 and 2025 notes.\nWe also entered into a new $1.1 billion ABL facility, and increased the AR facility commitment to $1.025 billion in June.\nOur bank credit facilities are low-cost LIBOR-based agreements and mature in June 2023 and 2025.\nWe expected our ratio of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt to be approximately 70% at closing, and it ended up at 72% at the end of June.\nOur credit facilities include limited operating covenants, and we easily passed some liquidity thresholds by which compliance is measured by a very large margin.\nHaving completed the Anixter merger, our capital allocation priority will be to support the integration, organic sales growth opportunities and to rapidly retire debt.\nWe do not expect to utilize any remaining amounts available under our Board authorized share repurchase program that expires on December 31st of this year.\nTurning to Slide 7.\nLet me recap our second half priorities.\nOur first priority is to build on the improving sales momentum we experienced this quarter.\nDespite weakness in certain markets in Q2, we capitalized on improving momentum within our business and are well-positioned to leverage our broad portfolio of products and services to drive sales ahead of the market.\nWe will maintain our cost discipline to meet or exceed the $50 million [Phonetic] in cost savings generated by the actions that we took in April in response to COVID-19.\nWe are planning to reinstate full compensation on October 1st for legacy WESCO employees that was temporarily reduced between 12% and 25% effective May 1st.\nWe will be deploying across the legacy WESCO business, Anixter's gross margin improvement programs that enabled Anixter to deliver seven consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement.\nWe will continue to rapidly execute our integration plan and deliver the year-one merger synergies with a high confidence of delivering substantial upside.\nAs we generate cash, our priority will be to retire debt consistent with our objective to return to our target leverage of 2 times to 3.5 times debt to adjusted EBITDA within 36 months post close of the transaction.\nFinally, beginning in the third quarter, we will begin reporting results for the three strategic business units announced as part of our new organizational structure in early June.\nSo I'd now like to reemphasize the outstanding value creation that our transformational combination of WESCO and Anixter will create.\nThere are seven key highlights regarding this industry shaping merger.\nNumber 1, the merger is a transformational combination that creates, as I said before, the industry leader in electrical, communications and utility distribution and supply chain services.\nNumber 2, the combined company benefit from a step change in scale and capabilities in what remains a highly fragmented electrical and communications distribution space.\nOn a combined basis, we're the industry leader in North America with approximately $17 billion in sales revenues and over $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA on a pro forma basis, including the identified cost synergies.\nNumber 3, the two businesses are highly complementary in terms of products, industries and geographies, which enables us to sell more products to more customers in more locations around the world, and more importantly, accelerate our sales growth by more than 100 basis points versus stand-alone projections.\nI've said this before.\nThis is an extraordinary combination of two successful companies, where one plus one is equal to three.\nNumber 4, we're executing an integration plan to deliver well over $200 million worth of cost synergies.\nAnd I mentioned previously, we're off to an excellent start, only six-weeks since closing this acquisition in late June.\nAnd Dave will take you through our notable progress in much more detail shortly.\nNumber 5, the financial benefits of this combination that will be generated will be exceptional.\nWe expect our earnings per share growth rate to double and adjusted EBITDA margins to expand by more than 100 basis points through the cost synergies I just discussed.\nNumber 6, both companies benefit from a highly resilient business model to generate substantial free cash flow through all phases of the economic cycle.\nThe combined company is expected to generate free cash flow of more than $600 million annually by year three, which we expect will enable rapid deleveraging to within our target range within 36 months, as well as provide future capital deployment options to drive value creation.\nAnd finally Number 7, the collective WESCO and Anixter management teams are result oriented and laser focused on driving an efficient integration and on generating these synergies to drive the substantial value creation.\nIn summary, with Anixter, the new WESCO will capitalize on the accelerating secular trends of electrification, increased bandwidth demand driven by higher voice, data, video and mobile usage and the digitization of our B2B value chain.\nWe are more bullish than ever in the substantial value creation that this transformational combination will create for our customers, our supplier partners, our employees, our investors and the communities in which we operate.\nWith that, I will now hand it back to Dave to provide additional details on the excellent progress we're making on the Anixter integration.\nMoving to Slide 10.\nThe enhanced scale that this merger creates is clear.\nIt brings together two highly complementary companies.\nCombining them benefits our customers and creates value through significant cross-selling opportunities, premier supply chain services, acceleration of our digital initiatives and improved operational and supply chain efficiencies.\nOn a trailing 12-month basis through June 30th, the business generated revenue of approximately $17 billion and adjusted EBITDA of over $1 billion on a pro forma basis, including the $200 million of cost synergies we are confident that we will deliver.\nTurning to Slide 11.\nThe North American electrical distribution industry is very large and highly fragmented, with an estimated total size of $114 billion per year.\nWith the merger, the Company has a share of approximately 13%.\nEven with this merger, the market remains highly fragmented and offers substantial opportunities for accelerated organic growth.\nBoth WESCO and Anixter have invested in supply chain services to differentiate our overall customer value proposition.\nThe combination of these two companies not only increases our overall scale, but also improves our ability to better serve our customers through an expanded product and services portfolio.\nMoving to Page 12.\nAs we consider the future of the combined enterprise, there are numerous ongoing and attractive secular trends and growth opportunities.\nThe demand for increased bandwidth driven by higher voice, data, video and mobile usage, greater connectivity needs for remote work, home and school applications, and the increasing electrification of our infrastructure are just a few of the growing secular trends that are directly aligned with the core capabilities of our combined business.\nThe right hand side of this page outlines the financial benefits of this transformational combination.\nWe are highly confident in exceeding our three-year cost savings, sales growth and cash generation synergy targets communicated earlier this year.\nWith the challenging economic cycle we're facing near term, this strategic combination remains compelling, as we're doubling the size of our Company and will transform the new enterprise through execution of the integration plan and delivery of these synergies.\nMoving to Slide 13.\nWe are focused on leading and exceeding the commitments we've made to our investors when we announced the merger in mid-January.\nWe raised approximately $5 billion in bank and bond debt with favorable terms and the bond offerings were substantially oversubscribed.\nWe closed the transaction near the end of Q2, in line with our initial commitments to close in Q2 or Q3.\nWe increased our liquidity to more than $800 million as of the end of Q2.\nWe are rapidly executing our integration plan and have already completed actions to deliver over 50% of our year one cost savings target of $68 million.\nWe're already generating sales synergies from the merger that are in addition to the minimum $200 million of cost synergies that we expect to generate.\nTurning to Page 14.\nOur top focus is executing a detailed, rigorous and process-oriented integration that delivers our committed synergies as well as the clear upside potential, while combining the best elements of each company.\nThe three objectives that our planning has encompassed are, first, executing a flawless Day 1 and first 100 days post closing that ensures business continuity and an effective on-boarding process.\nSecond, delivering the value of the combination through both the cost and sales growth synergies.\nAnd third, implementing an operating model for the new enterprise, which deploys cutting-edge digital tools and applications, and is led by an organization that is staffed with the best leaders of each company.\nValue delivery teams comprised of approximately 150 employees from both legacy organizations have identified more than 500 initiatives and 2,500 milestones to combine the best of our two companies.\nThe six value delivery work streams that we are working on in our integration planning and execution include commercial, digital and IT, supply chain, operations, marketing and the corporate functions.\nWe are also mindful of the critical importance that culture plays in the value creation opportunity of this combination.\nWe conducted a wide scale and thorough survey of all employees to understand the key attributes of the cultures and are developing a plan to combine the best of both.\nThe high degree of collaboration among and across these teams has been inspiring and underscores the strong cultural alignment between the two companies.\nWe are taking advantage of the opportunity to leverage the best talent and ideas of two successful organizations, as we create a new world-class enterprise.\nTuring to Slide 15.\nThis slide highlights our progress against the three core integration objectives outlined on the prior page.\nWe achieved our first priority, which was to execute a flawless Day 1.\nOur various value delivery teams have spent months preparing for Day 1, which I'm pleased to report was very successful.\nWe executed a detailed plan of communicating to our customers and suppliers, providing updates to our 18,900 colleagues and held multiple town hall events for our employees to get to know our new management team.\nOur second critical objective is to complete all of our master planning and value capture initiatives.\nHaving generated more than half of our year one target of $68 million of run rate synergies, we're on track to exceed this target.\nWe have deployed commercial targets for sales growth, margin improvement and cash flow, and are already experiencing success with our first cross-sell pilot programs.\nOur final critical objective is to build a new world-class company.\nWe have announced our three strategic business units and the first two levels of our senior management team.\nMoving to Page 16, you can see the detail of the composition and expected timing of our synergies.\nOf the 45% that is corporate and administrative, approximately two-thirds will come from the elimination of duplicative general and administrative costs and one-third will come from corporate overhead.\nOf the 55% that will be generated from supply chain and field operations, the majority will come from supply chain efficiencies.\nThe field operations estimate includes the footprint rationalization of both companies' branch networks.\nApproximately two-thirds of WESCO and Anixter facilities in the U.S. are within 20 miles of each other.\nAdditionally, with the combined $14 billion in total cost of goods, we have identified over $70 million of supply chain-related synergies.\nBoth the supply chain and field operation synergies are expected to begin in year one, but the bulk of these opportunities will be realized in years two and three.\nWe are confident in achieving the synergies and believe that they can be realized efficiently with minimal disruption to our day-to-day business.\nTo date, we have already executed more than 30 unique initiatives across the four synergy types, resulting in more than $35 million of run rate synergies.\nWe have eliminated duplicative public company related expenses of approximately $7 million, as well as C-suite and other duplicative roles that provide an additional $20 million in savings.\nMoving to Page 17.\nBoth WESCO and Anixter have strong track records of generating free cash flow throughout the economic cycle.\nOver the past five years, the business has generated an average of $370 million in free cash flow on a combined basis.\nWith the combination of earnings growth and the realization of cost synergies, we expect the annual cash generation of the combined company will expand to over $600 million per year, by year three.\nThis includes $75 million in free cash flow through the release of working capital.\nAs we mentioned earlier, the strong free cash flow and earnings growth will enable us to rapidly deleverage the balance sheet.\nOur ratio of debt to adjusted EBITDA was 5.7 times, as of June 30th, 2020.\nIncluding year one synergies of $68 million, our leverage ratio was 5.3 times.\nWe are expecting to return to leverage within our target range of 2 times to 3.5 times net debt to EBITDA within 36 months.\nMoving to Slide 18, both WESCO and Anixter benefit from several dynamics that make our Company highly resilient to economic cycles.\nFirst, our cash flow is counter cyclical as we release working capital during the downturn.\nSecond, a cost structure that allows for quick adjustments in response to changing demand levels.\nAnd third, no [Phonetic] required capital expenditures, given the nature of the business model.\nOver the past 10 years, WESCO and Anixter capital expenditures have averaged less than 0.5 point of sales.\nIn the current environment, this resilience has enhanced by WESCO and Anixter's high degree of diversification by customer, supplier, end market and geography.\nBoth WESCO and Anixter have proven abilities to delever through the economic cycle, as they both did from 2007 to 2011, when their net leverage was reduced to below two turns as a combined $1.9 billion of free cash flow was generated.\nAdditionally, both companies have demonstrated the ability to use their cash flow to rapidly pay down debt following a sizable acquisition.\nIn the case of WESCO, we reduced leverage from 4.5 turns to 2.7 turns following the acquisition of EECOL in 2012.\nIn Anixter's case, it reduced leverage from 4.1 turns to 2.8 turns in the two years following its acquisition of HD Power Solutions in 2015.\nThis quarter was an excellent example of our strong counter-cyclical free cash flow, as the combined company generated $142 million in free cash flow or approximately 248% of adjusted net income.\nMoving to Slide 19.\nWe had closed the merger on June 22, 2020, as the waiting period for the Competition Bureau expired on June 18, 2020.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, WESCO agreed to divest the legacy WESCO Utility and Datacom businesses in Canada.\nThis includes the utility businesses of Brews, Trydor and LaPrairie acquired some years ago.\nCombined, the WESCO Canadian Utility and Datacom businesses represent approximately $150 million in sales or less than 1% of the revenue of the combined organization.\nThe divestitures will have no impact to the overall outstanding value creation opportunity of this merger.\nI'd now like to hand it back to John for a quick summary, before we open it up to Q&A.\nWe responded to a quick and decisive actions in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe will continue to aggressively manage our business, as we have done in prior economic cycles and respond to this crisis as needed.\nJust five months after announcing the definitive Anixter agreement in January, we completed a very successful and oversubscribed capital raise in May, and then we successfully closed the Anixter merger on June 22nd.\nMost notably, all of this was done against the COVID-19 backdrop.\nAs I mentioned earlier, integration is off to an excellent start and execution is accelerating.\nWe expect to exceed our cost savings, sales growth, margin expansion and cash generation synergy targets and deliver the substantial upside potential and value creation associated with this transformational combination.\nAnd finally, it's the start of a new era for WESCO.\nAs an industry leader, we are now larger and more diversified with differentiated scale and capabilities and what remains a highly fragmented industry.\nAs a result, we are exceptionally well positioned to lead not only a digital transformation of our business, but also of our industry.\nOverall, we are doing what we said we would do, and we will continue to transparently provide our progress versus our plan and our commitment.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Speaking on the call will be Ocwen's chief executive officer, Glen Messina; and Chief Financial Officer June Campbell.\nYou should bear this uncertainty in mind when considering such statements and should not place undue reliance on such statements.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide a useful supplement to discussions and analysis of our financial condition and an alternate way to view certain aspects of our business that is instructed.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for the company's reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nSo we'll get started with some highlights for the third quarter.\nI'm really proud of what our team has accomplished and really appreciate all their hard work.\nWe delivered strong GAAP net income and adjusted pre-tax income, and our ROE exceeded guidance largely due to strong top-line performance.\nI believe this demonstrates the strong operating leverage we have in our business.\nThis was our eighth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted pre-tax income.\nOur team continues to execute well against our operating objectives, strong originations growth and servicing additions, solid operational execution, and performance.\nCost reduction is tracking ahead of targets.\nWe also closed our planned call rights transaction for the third quarter and have deployed more than 50% of MAM's investment commitment.\nOctober as well, we had some milestones.\nSo in October, we closed our acquisition of the RMS reverse mortgage servicing platform.\nAnd also in October, I'm pleased to announce that we exceeded our recapture rate objective.\nWe continue to make solid progress on our actions to expand our addressable market.\nWe're growing in higher-margin channels, services, and products giving us strong momentum, and the RMS platform acquisition gives us access to a potential $86 billion reverse mortgage subservicing market, which is an exciting new growth opportunity for us.\nAnd finally, we continue to navigate a volatile and unpredictable environment, and I'll talk a bit more about that later.\nOriginations again delivered really solid performance against our operating objectives.\nWe closed $20 billion in total servicing additions in the third quarter with very strong performance in subservicing additions.\nWith the closing of the TCB acquisition, correspondent volume doubled versus last quarter.\nThe TCB team is off to a really strong start, and I'm so glad to have them with us and appreciate the contributions they're making to the business.\nWe're seeing great results from our actions to grow subservicing.\nWe secured $20 billion in new awards and expect this volume to commence boarding in the fourth quarter.\nOur subservicing pipeline has never been more robust.\nOur top 10 prospects represent roughly $63 billion in opportunity, and our total prospect pipeline has grown to slightly over $200 billion.\nWe're excited about this activity level and believe we have a very compelling value proposition.\nI'll spend a little bit more time on our subservicing value prop a little bit later.\nOur enterprise sales approach and the TCP acquisition have allowed us to grow our base of sellers to 700 at the end of Q3.\nThat's roughly 2.5 times over third quarter last year, and we're continuing to grow.\nNondelegated and Best Efforts delivery services were rolled out as expected, and we're seeing steady adoption as well.\nOur Ginnie Mae product mix is improving.\nIt's up to about 10% of total originations, excluding co-issue, we're still well below industry mix in Ginnie Mae.\nSo I believe we have room for improvement here.\nWe recently attended the MBA, Mortgage Bankers Association Annual Convention and client attendance at our meeting room exceeded our expectations, and the response to the quality of our team and operating execution was very positive.\nWe look forward to serving them and supporting new clients as we expand our addressable market.\nOur Consumer Direct team continues to improve recapture performance.\nWe did see a little bit of slippage in the third quarter versus the second quarter due to accelerated runoff in select client portfolios versus Q2.\nThat said, we saw a very strong recovery in October with refinance recapture rate achievement of 36%, which is a milestone for us and a huge congratulations to our recapture team.\nWe believe we're on track to meet our 30% refinance recapture rate objectives in the fourth quarter.\nOverall, our originations team is making terrific progress against their objectives for this year, and they're energized for the fourth quarter and for 2022.\nThe team continues to make strong progress growing higher-margin products, channels, and services.\nThese actions do help us expand our addressable market, as well as deflect margin pressure, as industry buying mobiles contract.\nYear over year, consumer direct volume in both forward and reverse is up 61%, both forward and reverse delivered record retail funding and lock volumes in October.\nThe marketing eligible population for our forward recapture business increased about 43% from the second quarter to the third quarter.\nAnd we now have roughly 174,000 loans where borrowers could save $100 or more per month by refinancing, and our team will be focused on trying to help these borrowers.\nTotal reverse originations were up 86% year over year.\nTeam is executing very well.\nOur reverse market share is up from 6.5% in third quarter 2020 to 7% in third quarter 2021, and this compares to about 4.2% in the third quarter of 2019.\nSo great progress by the team, growing our share and our business.\nIn forward correspondent, we have meaningful opportunity to grow our best efforts and non-delegated delivery services.\nOur team is focused there, and we've launched those recently.\nToday, these services are just a fraction of the levels we see across the industry generally.\nOur long-term goal is to get best efforts in non-delegated to roughly 25% to 30% of volume and about 40% to 50% of our gain on sale revenues.\nIn servicing, continuing to improve cost and customer experience are the key objectives for us, and the team is performing really well.\nTo achieve these objectives, we're focused on moving the needle in four key areas: technology, process simplification, scale, and portfolio composition.\nThe results have been good so far.\nOverall, servicing operating costs are down roughly 25% from third quarter 2020 levels, and we've already achieved our full year target for 2021.\nTechnology is a big driver for us, and our technology agenda has a three-part focus.\nThat's reduce cost, improve execution and improve the customer experience.\nWe believe our actions to improve client borrower and investor experience are critical elements to support our growth and recapture rate objectives over the long run.\nAnd with technology as the enabler, we can reduce cost and improve execution at the same time.\nIn terms of scale, we've increased our total servicing UPB about 33% versus the third quarter of 2020.\nAnd our percentage of prime servicing is now 70% of our total servicing UPB.\nIn terms of portfolio composition, increasing the percentage of agency loans is helping to increase average loan balance and decrease delinquencies, both of these trends will improve our ratio of operating expenses as a percent of UPB.\nWe believe we have tremendous operating leverage in our servicing platform, and we're focused on increasing scale by growing our own servicing and subservicing.\nAgain, here, the team continues to perform very well in several areas.\nAverage beat of answer and call abandonment rate continued to outperform the industry average as reported by the MBA.\nOur average speed of answer is just a fraction of the MBA average, and abandonment rates are roughly half the industry average.\nWe continue to be laser-focused on supporting borrowers who are exiting forbearance and helping them understand their options.\nWe believe the best path for the homeowner and the investor is to find what works within investor guidelines to keep the consumer in their home.\nIn this regard, we outperformed the industry as reported by the MBA, relating to the percentage of borrowers with an agency loan who exit forbearance with the reinstatement or loss mitigation solution in place.\nBetween September 2020 and June 2021, roughly 93% of our borrowers who exited forbearance had a reinstatement or loss mitigation plan in place, and that compares to the industry average of 83%.\nAnd what that means is about 7% of our borrowers on forbearance have exited without a reinstatement plan or a loss mitigation solution versus over 17% for the industry.\nBased on the MBA data, we're delivering 20% more loss mitigation solutions for homeowners versus the industry average.\nAnd again, I believe this demonstrates how our servicing capabilities deliver superior performance for homeowners and investors.\nNPS is up 6 points over third quarter 2020, and that's even with the impact of boarding over 280,000 loans in the third quarter onto our servicing platform and helping over 4,700 borrowers exit forbearance.\nAlso worth noting, Moody's and S&P upgraded our servicer quality assessment as Master servicer, along with Fitch -- and along with Fitch, all three affirmed our servicer ratings.\nSome of the key strengths noted by the agencies were our reporting and remitting processes, proactive servicer oversight in master servicing, management and organization, industry experience, multiple levels of internal controls, and our diligent response to the pandemic, as well as our enterprisewide risk and compliance management framework.\nWe've put significant effort into diversifying our servicing revenue streams over the last two years.\nOur focus has been on growing own servicing, growing our subservicing, and taking advantage of ancillary or intrinsic revenue streams in our business, Ginnie Mae EBO gains at call right opportunities.\nThese efforts have paid off as the percentage of our servicing revenue derived from the NRZ subservicing agreement has been reduced by more than 50%.\nIt's now just 17% of our revenues.\nFrom a loan count perspective, the NRZ loans are down to 33% of the total as, compared to 54% in third quarter of last year, and the NRZ loans also comprise about two-thirds, 67% of our total nonperforming loans as of the third quarter of 2021.\nEBOs and call rights continue to be an opportunity for us.\nWe settled our planned call rights transaction in the third quarter, involving seven deals, and we're pleased with the results.\nAs of the third quarter of 2021, our call rights, our owned call rights were approximately 121 deals.\nAnd we estimate the near-term opportunity for call rights that could potentially be actionable is about 30 to 40 deals.\nMarket appetite for seasoned non-agency loans remain strong, and there is sustained activity from other legacy non-agency servicers.\nWith respect to our previously announced fourth quarter transaction, we received a request from the trustee Deutsche Bank asking us to pause the cleanup calls.\nThey wanted to confirm the call price, met the requirements of underlying PSAs.\nWe believe the call price we've calculated is consistent with the applicable PSAs in our course of conduct with Deutsche Bank and relevant third parties and with established industry practice.\nWe intend to work with Deutsche Bank in their analysis, including if Deutsche Bank chooses to seek input from a court of competent jurisdiction.\nMeanwhile, we have agreed to pause our calls to allow that analysis to take place.\nRegarding EBOs, we realized $12.3 million in EBO gains year-to-date third quarter with loans now emerging from forbearance, we expect to see an increase in EBO activity as loans are modified throughout 2022.\nWe believe we've built a best-in-class servicing platform for performing and special servicing with capacity for growth that can offer a compelling value proposition to existing and prospective clients.\nDuring 2020 and 2021, we performed an end-to-end review of our platform and capabilities against what we believe are client expectations.\nBased on this review, we believe our platform delivers best-practice performance levels for clients across six C's of performance.\nThese include competency, putting the client first, customer centricity, technology-enabled capabilities, a well-staffed bank-grade risk, and compliance model and a strong value-based culture that underpins everything we do.\nWe've made several investments in bar and client-facing technology to address the needs of clients and consumers and to streamline our business and improve the ability for consumer and client self-service.\nWe can offer swift onboarding, responsive service to our clients and consumers.\nAnd as we covered on Pages 7 and 8, industry-leading operating performance.\nWe believe our operations can deliver superior total cost and service-level performance versus our peers.\nAnd we've been rewarded for the investments we've made in our platform.\nWe've secured $28 billion of subservicing additions in the last 12 months.\nWe secured $20 billion in new awards in the third quarter, and we have a $63 billion opportunity with our top 10 prospects and a potential prospect pipeline of $200 billion and growing.\nWith the closing of RMS as well, we are positioned to enter the $86 billion reverse mortgage servicing market once the integration is complete.\nSo while these opportunities do have a longer sales cycle, I'm nonetheless very excited about the opportunity we have here.\nGenerally, this year, industry volume levels continue to be very robust, certainly as compared to historic levels of both forward and reverse.\nWe continue to deal with incredible interest rate volatility in August.\nThe 10-year treasury rate was trading at 117 basis points.\nBy quarter end, it was 153.\nIt's now in the high 140s.\nSo it's been volatile.\nWe are seeing non parallel interest rate movements, as well as mortgage to treasury spread compression, and discount margin volatility in reverse as well.\nThese risks are not covered by our hedging program, and we did feel the effects of this in the third quarter.\nJune will talk a little bit more about that later.\nConsensus industry forecast is for rising rates and about a 28% average reduction in industry origination volumes.\nThis is based upon the consensus of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and MBA forecast.\nThat said, 2022 projected volume levels are still relatively high compared to historic levels, especially in the 2018, 2019 time frame.\nReverse mortgage endorsement volume remained strong and is expected to remain strong compared to last year.\nIn a contracting market, we would expect some continued pressure on originations margins until capacity -- excess capacity in industry could be eliminated.\nThat said, margins were roughly stable in the third quarter.\nWith rising rates, we would expect increased servicing profitability and MSR values as payoffs and runoff -- portfolio runoff decreases.\nAnd we also expect perhaps some M&A and bulk purchase opportunities may emerge as market participants consider exiting as the origination market contracts.\nAnd we also expect to see the agencies buy box expand a bit with higher loan limits and support for first-time and low- to moderate-income buyers.\nTo address the dynamic environment, we're focused on a few straightforward strategies, prudent growth by expanding our client base, product, services, and addressable markets.\ncontinuing to drive best-in-class operating performance to deliver superior value proposition to clients, investors, and consumers, providing a service experience that delivers on our commitments, enhancing our competitiveness through scale and low cost aggressively pursuing our subservicing opportunity pipeline, and expanding into reverse subservicing.\nAnd lastly, continuing to be prudent in bulk purchases through MAV and M&A opportunities to increase scale and capabilities.\nBy now, you're familiar with our key operating objectives for 2021, and we're well on our way to achieving our targets.\nIn each of the five categories, we believe we've got strong momentum.\nAnd our key operating objective framework will remain the same for 2022.\nWe are targeting over $100 billion in total owned servicing and subservicing additions.\nWe're targeting to maintain recapture rates over 30% with the long-term objective of industry best practice levels by investor type.\nContinuous cost and process improvement is part of our DNA, and we're driving base cost and variable cost productivity improvement to support our competitiveness.\nWe're targeting roughly another 1-basis-point reduction in servicing and overhead opex as a percent of UPB from third quarter 2021 levels.\nIndustry-leading operation execution and delivering on our commitments to clients, borrowers, and investors is a critical component of our value proposition.\nSo this will continue to be a focus and emphasis for us in 2022 and beyond.\nAnd for 2022, we're targeting about 50% growth in subservicing additions and harvesting embedded EBO and call rights income to diversify and grow our revenue.\nConsistent with our operating objectives this year, we continue to target low double-digit to mid-teen after-tax operating ROEs in 2022.\nWe reported $37 million in adjusted pre-tax income and 32% in adjusted pre-tax ROE.\nThis is the eighth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted pre-tax income.\nNet income in the quarter was $22 million, including $27 million in unfavorable notables, largely driven by MSR fair value changes from higher actual prepayments than modeled, Negative effects of basis risk, partially offset by higher market interest rates net of hedging.\nWe achieved 19% after-tax GAAP ROE exceeding our low double-digit to mid-teen guidance.\nOur earnings per share was $2.35, beating analyst consensus by over two times.\nOn the top right bar chart, you can see that we're delivering on our growth objectives and cost leadership.\nRevenue increased 38% year over year, largely due to higher servicing fees on an additional $66 billion in UPB and executing the call right transactions.\nOperating expense as a percentage of average UPB was favorable year over year after absorbing cost to maintain capacity for both the new bulk volume reported in August and September, incurring temporary interim subservicing expense on MSR bulk acquisitions and as I mentioned previous quarters, carrying excess costs during foreclosure moratorium and expectation of borrower need.\nEquity increased to $470 million, and book value per share increased $2 to $51 per share.\nThis slide demonstrates that our balanced business model is operating well with originations growth replenishing our servicing portfolio more than offsetting runoff.\nThe replenishment rate in the quarter was 170%.\nOn the left side of the slide, you can see that volume is up across all channels, approximately 77% versus the same quarter last year.\nAdjusted pre-tax income was impacted by lower revaluation gains on MSR cash window and flow purchases and expected margin normalization.\nYou can see on the margins graph, Consumer Direct margins increased slightly versus last quarter but lower than this time last year.\nMix-adjusted correspondent lending margins were relatively flat versus last quarter.\nThe adjustment in the second quarter correspondent margins is attributed to gains recognized in the second quarter on certain loans that were acquired under favorable circumstances, resulting in higher than market average margins for these loans.\nAdjusting for these loans, second quarter margins were consistent with the first quarter at approximately 12 basis points.\nAs Glen mentioned, we're growing higher-margin products, channels and services, which we believe will help deflect margin pressure as industry volume levels contract.\nOn the right side of the slide, you can see the results in our Servicing segment from building scale.\nThird quarter total servicing UPB is $248 billion, a $62 billion increase over the third quarter of 2020.\nThe Subservicing plus NAV UPB, and as you know, we began subservicing NAV this quarter, doubled year over year, largely replacing the NRZ UPB decline.\nNRZ UPB concentration dropped from 46% to 24% year over year.\nWe expect this trend to accelerate as we grow subservicing for other clients in NAV.\nServicing adjusted pre-tax income of $41 million was largely driven by higher servicing fees from higher UPB, expanding servicing revenue with approximately $23 million in call right gains, as well as cost leadership.\nYou saw earlier that servicing operating costs are down 3 basis points year over year, and we expect continued improvement, which I'll show you on the next slide.\nThis is our road map page.\nWe told you last quarter that we were positioned for a step function change in profitability in the second half of the year, and we delivered on this in the third quarter with GAAP earnings and 19% ROE.\nThis is our operating framework for 2022 assuming a stable interest rate environment and no adverse changes in market conditions or legal and regulatory environment.\nThe page is broken down by our operating objectives in the origination, servicing, and corporate segments.\nI'll provide a few highlights, but please let me know if any of you want to review in more detail separately, and I'd be happy to.\nWe reflect the full quarterly impact from the bulk transactions closed in June we talked about last quarter.\nflow MSR volume was redirected to MAV in the third quarter, and we continue to grow performing subservicing, which results in a mix shift to higher-margin consumer direct and reverse channels.\nWe expect EBO, call rights, and other revenue diversification in the range of $20 million to $25 million, and the segments continue to achieve productivity targets.\nA couple of comments just to wrap up before questions.\nWe had a great quarter, delivered really strong financial performance.\nI'm proud of how the team is executing and we're excited about the opportunities ahead.\nWe're demonstrating a solid track record of delivering on our operational and financial commitments and continued development of our balanced and diversified business model.\nWe're focused on a few straightforward strategies to navigate this dynamic market environment, prudent growth by expanding client base product services to expand addressable markets.\nsuperior value proposition to clients, investors, and consumers through best-in-class operating performance, providing a service experience that delivers on our commitments and enhancing our competitiveness through scale and low cost.\nI'm proud of what our team accomplished in the third quarter and very appreciative of all their efforts.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Joining me on the call today are Johnson Controls' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Chief Financial Officer, Olivier Leonetti.\nIn discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted earnings per share, EBITA and EBIT exclude restructuring and integration costs as well as other special items.\nAdditionally, all comparisons to the prior year are on a continuing ops basis.\nI'm going to start off with a quick look back at 2021 and update you on a few of our long-term strategic priorities.\nOlivier will provide a detailed review of our fourth quarter results and provide you with our fiscal 2022 guidance.\nLet's get started on slide three.\nWe rounded out fiscal '21 with another quarter of solid financial results, having met or exceeded all of our original commitments for the year, in what turned out to be a much more difficult environment than originally planned.\nThe ability to deliver these results, while navigating through unprecedented levels of inflation and supply chain disruptions, is a testament to the operational discipline and agility demonstrated throughout the organization.\nAnd for that, I am incredibly grateful for the efforts of the entire Johnson Controls team.\nDespite the challenging external environment, our end market demand remains strong.\nRobust retrofit activity, coupled with a pickup in new nonresidential construction we are starting to see, creates a strong future demand trend.\nThis is evidenced by the continued momentum we are seeing in our order books and the record backlog we have built.\nWe also remain focused on the big picture, moving ahead with bold new commitments, doubling down with ambitious new ESG goals set earlier this year, embarking on a substantial new productivity program designed to drive a step-function change in profitability.\nAnd just recently, at our Investor Day in September, we committed to a new set of three year financial commitments.\nWe made significant progress in advancing our growth strategy, scaling our OpenBlue digital platform, launching eight new major offerings and greatly expanding our partner ecosystem, investing in the refresh of our product portfolio, focusing on accelerating our service growth and improving our attachment rate.\nAnd we are capitalizing on strong secular trends for healthy buildings, decarbonization and smart connected equipment and buildings.\nAs end markets continue to recover and the adoption of these trends continue to expand globally, I am confident we are uniquely positioned from a competitive standpoint to continue to outperform.\nIn addition to the strong financial results and advancement on our strategic initiatives, we have also continued to lead in ESG, including continued progress toward both our 2025 sustainability goals and our new ESG commitments.\nThis is not, by any means, an exhaustive list, but I am extremely pleased with what our teams have accomplished in the last year.\nWe are committed to net zero, committed to reducing emissions within our own operations and that of our customers.\nOur science-based targets have been approved.\nOur leadership team is aligned from a governance perspective, and we are extending our leadership in sustainable financing as well.\nTomorrow, I travel to COP26 in Glasgow.\nWe made great progress in driving home the understanding that buildings represent approximately 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and there is no tackling climate change without substantial investment in buildings.\nGovernments are now acting on this and mobilizing billions to upgrade buildings.\nAnd Johnson Controls is perfectly positioned to deliver those solutions.\nAt COP26, I will meet with government and business leaders to build momentum and ensure action.\nTurning to slide five.\nI wanted to take a few minutes to highlight several new strategic developments in the quarter.\nMost recently, we signed an MOU with two significant technology leaders, Accenture and Alibaba, to address sustainable infrastructure needs.\nThis collaboration will focus on an estimated multibillion-dollar market for digital solutions serving data centers in China.\nWe also signed a foundational technology agreement with Tempered Networks, building upon our recent cybersecurity partnerships with Pelion and DigiCert.\nEach of these partnerships embeds a critical layer of trust, security and operational capability into our OpenBlue platform and connected devices.\nThese elements differentiate our products and services to help protect the integrity of our customers' operations and data.\nTempered brings an industry-leading zero-trust secure network capability that helps us drive customer confidence and, in turn, accelerate the adoption of OpenBlue services.\nOur partnerships with UL, Safe Traces and with Phylagen are powerful examples of how we are innovating to extend our Healthy Buildings leadership, providing new indoor environmental quality solutions to address our customers' most pressing challenges.\nOur near-term focus is on the education vertical as there is a clear and compelling need to help those customers optimize their investments.\nWith an estimated $195 billion in government stimulus earmarked for K-12 spending, this provides a significant opportunity.\nAdditionally, we entered into an exclusive joint development agreement and investment with Phylagen, a leading biotech company working on the identification of indoor bacteria and viruses that are all around us in buildings.\nOur work with Phylagen is a commitment to developing the cutting-edge capabilities to deliver and maintain healthy buildings.\nAt our Investor Day, we shared with you our three pillars for delivering above-market growth over the next three years and beyond.\nOne of those pillars related to gaining share through innovative product development centered around digital and sustainability.\nAs planned, we launched over 150 new products in fiscal 2021, spanning nearly all business units, resulting in continued share gains in both Q4 and the full year.\nIn 2022, we are well positioned to gain share with another 175 new products across four main categories: sustainability, smart buildings, digital and residential, with heat pumps central to our product development strategy.\nThese are just a sample of what is expected to launch over the next 90 days, with a steady pipeline behind us.\nTurning to slide seven.\nService plays a central role in everything we do.\nOver the last 18 months, we have strengthened our market-leading capabilities to best position ourselves for the shifting industry demographics and evolving digital technologies that are enabling outcome-based solution models.\nAt the start of last year, we began articulating our intentions to accelerate service growth to a couple of points above market levels, part of which would be the result of increasing our attachment rate by leveraging our large installed base and the digital transformation of our business.\nIn fiscal 2021, we saw the early benefits of our efforts shine through.\nWe exited the year with service revenues up 8% in the fourth quarter with high single-digit growth in all three regions in nearly all business domains.\nFor the full year, service revenue grew 4%, which is up two to three points over 2019 levels, despite a slow start to the year as we manage through lingering site access restrictions and abnormal customer budget pressures.\nLooking ahead, we see service accelerating through fiscal 2022, in line with our goal to outpace the market.\nThe order strength we've seen in the second half of the year bolsters that view.\nService orders were up 7% in Q4 and, importantly, up low single digits organically versus 2019 levels.\nAdditionally, we improved our attach rate to approximately 40%.\nTurning to slide eight.\nThe third pillar is our vectors of growth, which we believe, on a combined basis, represents an incremental market opportunity of $250 billion over the next decade.\nOur unique portfolio is a competitive advantage across all three areas.\nAnd from a financial performance perspective, we have significantly increased both revenue and orders in fiscal 2021.\nThis positions us very well for continued strong performance as we move forward.\nNext, on slide nine, I wanted to highlight a key customer win related to one of our key vectors of growth.\nIn Q4, we were awarded a Buildings as a Service project by one of our long-standing customers, the University of North Dakota.\nThis is the second long-term Performance Infrastructure contract we have been awarded with this university in the last two years.\nIt leverages not only our expertise in Performance Contracting, but also the OpenBlue Enterprise Manager software.\nThe total contract value was nearly $220 million over the life of the project, with a smaller portion of that booked during the quarter.\nBefore I turn things over to Olivier, let me conclude with a few thoughts.\nI remain extremely encouraged by the demand patterns we are seeing across most of our end markets and the ability of our teams to capitalize on more than our fair share of that demand.\nWe see this decade as being one of the most exciting for the smart building industry, which Johnson Controls is positioned to lead.\nUnderlying momentum in our short-cycle businesses continues to improve despite pressure from ongoing supply chain and component availability constraints.\nOur longer-cycle install business, driven by the new buildings market, also continues to recover, although extended lead times and inflation are delaying some investment decisions, particularly on larger projects.\nRetrofit activity remains an important driver of our business, and we see plenty of opportunity to capitalize on this activity going forward.\nAll of that said, we are very mindful of the macro backdrop and our outlook does not assume any significant near-term improvement in supply chain conditions or inflation over the next couple of quarters.\nOn price/cost, given the progressive rise in inflation for almost all input costs throughout the year, we took decisive steps on pricing and cost to stay ahead of the curve.\nAnd I am confident we will continue to manage through these challenges.\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2022, our focus turns to accelerating and demonstrating our growth capabilities.\nOur proven product technology leadership, combined now with OpenBlue, truly differentiates the solutions we can bring to our customers.\nIn fact, we believe we are best positioned to lead the revolution of smart buildings, and we are fully committed to creating healthier, safer and more sustainable buildings.\nLet me start with a brief financial summary on slide 10.\nSales in the quarter were up 5% organically, led by Global Products, which is truly a reflection of the team's strong execution.\nUnderlying momentum in this business continue to improve, as evidenced by mid-single digits growth on a two year stack basis.\nOur longer-cycle field business continue to recover, led by strong growth in services, up 8% in the quarter.\nSegment EBITA increased 10% versus the prior year, margin expanding 30 basis points to 15.9%.\nBetter leverage on higher volumes, favorable mix and the incremental benefit of our SG&A actions more than offset the headwind from the reversal of temporary cost reductions and price/cost, including significant supply chain disruptions.\nEPS of $0.88 was at the high end of our guidance range and increased 16% year-over-year, benefiting from higher profitability as well as lower share count.\nFree cash flow in the quarter was approximately $300 million, reflecting the reversal of timing benefits experienced in the first three quarters of the year, as expected.\nOn a full year basis, we achieved 105% free cash flow conversion.\nOrders for our field businesses increased 9%, led by low double-digit growth in install on strong double-digit growth in retrofit activity.\nWe are also seeing continued strength in our service business, with orders up 7%, driven by strong growth in North America and EMEALA.\nBacklog grew 10% to more than $10 billion, with service backlog up 5% and install backlog up 11%.\nThe sequential improvement was led by strong retrofit activity as new construction continues to recover from depressed level in fiscal '20, particularly in North America.\nTurning to our earnings per share bridge on slide 12.\nLet me touch on a few key items.\nOverall, operations contributed $0.09 versus the prior year, including a $0.04 benefit from our SG&A productivity program, achieving our targeted savings in fiscal '21.\nWe are well on track to achieve our SG&A and COGS savings in fiscal '22 and beyond.\nSimilar to last quarter, excluding the headwind from the prior year temporary actions, underlying incrementals in Q4 were approximately 30%.\nCorporate was a $0.03 headwind year-over-year and other items netted to a $0.06 tailwind, primarily related to lower share count, lower net financing charges and FX.\nLet's discuss our segment results in more details on slide 13.\nMy commentary will also refer to the segment end-market performance included on slide 14.\nNorth America revenue grew 4% organically, led by strength in services, which was higher in all domain.\nInstall revenue was up low single digits, primarily due to strong demand from shorter-cycle retrofit and upgrade projects, and positive growth in new construction.\nBoth our internal and customer supply chain restrictions negatively impacted our North America install business.\nBy domain, Commercial Applied HVAC revenue grew mid-single digits, while Fire & Security increased low single digits in the quarter.\nWe had another strong quarter in Performance Infrastructure, which grew revenue low double digits, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, a good reflection on our customers' demand for decarbonization solution.\nSegment margin decreased 20 basis points year-over-year to 15.2%, primarily due to the reversal of temporary cost from the mitigation actions in the prior year.\nOrders in North America were up 11% versus the prior year, with high single-digit growth in both Commercial HVAC and Fire & Security.\nPerformance Infrastructure orders were up nearly 40%.\nApplied HVAC orders increased 10% overall, driven by strong retrofit activity, with another strong quarter of equipment orders up over 20% in Q4.\nBacklog of $6.5 billion increased 10% year-over-year.\nRevenue in EMEALA increased 3% organically, led by continued strength in our service business, particularly in our Applied HVAC and Industrial Refrigeration businesses.\nFire & Security, which account for nearly 60% of segment revenues, grew at mid-single digits rate in Q4, with strength across our enterprise accounts and residential security businesses, including a rebound in our retail platform.\nIndustrial Refrigeration also grew mid-single digits, while Commercial HVAC & Controls declined low single digits.\nBy geography, revenue growth was broad-based, with strength in Europe and Latin America, partially offset by low double-digit decline in the Middle East.\nSegment EBITA margins declined 30 basis points, driven by a prior year gain on sales.\nUnderlying margin performance improved as favorable mix, positive price/cost and the benefit of SG&A savings this year more than offset the temporary mitigation actions taken in the prior year.\nOrder in EMEALA continued to accelerate, increasing 7% in the quarter, with strong mid-teens growth in Commercial HVAC and high single-digit growth in Fire & Security.\nAPAC revenue increased 7% organically, led by low double digits growth in Commercial HVAC & Controls.\nEBITA margins expanded 80 basis points year-over-year to 15.5%, driven by a favorable reserve adjustment.\nAPAC underlying margin declined year-over-year as volume leverage and net productivity was offset by unfavorable mix and negative price/cost.\nAPAC orders grew 4%, driven by continued strength in Commercial HVAC.\nGlobal Products revenue grew 7% on an organic basis in the quarter, with broad-based strength across the portfolio.\nOur Global Residential HVAC business was up 5% in the quarter.\nNorth America Resi HVAC grew 4% in the quarter, benefiting from both higher volume and pricing.\nOutside of North America, our Residential HVAC business grew mid-single digits, led by strong double-digit growth in Europe and driven in part by the launch of our new Hitachi air-to-water residential heat pump, which was well received by the market.\nIn APAC, Residential HVAC declined low single digits as a result of softer industry demand in Japan, given the COVID-related state of emergency in place for much of the quarter.\nWe continue to gain shares in Japan, up more than 100 basis points in the quarter, as we continue to launch new premium products with indoor air quality technologies.\nAlthough not reflected in our revenue growth, our Hisense JV revenue grew over 40% year-over-year in Q4, expanding our leading position in China.\nCommercial HVAC product sales were up low double digits overall, led by mid-teens growth in our indirect Applied business, including strong chiller demand within the data center end market.\nLight Commercial grew high single digits overall, with North America unitary equipment down 2% and VRF up high single digits.\nOur Light Commercial business in Asia was up low double digits, including a significant win in Taiwan to supply high-efficiency ductless unit with indoor air quality technology to all schools across the country.\nFire & Security products grew high single digits in aggregate, led by our access and control and video solutions business and return to pre-pandemic levels for parts of our fire suppression business.\nEBITA margin expanded 90 basis points year-over-year to 18.7% as volume leverage, higher equity income and the benefit of SG&A actions more than offset the temporary cost action in the prior year and price/cost, including the significant supply chain disruptions.\nTurning to slide 15.\nCorporate expense increased significantly year-over-year off an abnormal low level to $83 million.\nFor modeling purposes, we have included an outlook for some of our below-the-line items in financial year '22.\nI will point out that amortization expense reflects the full year run rate impact of Silent-Aire as well as additional software R&D.\nNet financing charges returned to a more normal level as fiscal '21 benefited from significant FX gain.\nNoncontrolling interest reflects continued growth in our Hitachi JV.\nTurning to our balance sheet and cash flow on slide 16.\nOur balance sheet remains in great shape.\nWe ended the year with $1.3 billion in available cash and net debt at 1.8 times, still below our targeted range of two to 2.5 times.\nOn cash, we generated a little over $300 million in free cash flow in the quarter, bringing us to nearly $2 billion year-to-date and achieving our target of 105% conversion for the year.\nAs you will recall from our guidance last quarter, we expected a reversal in some of the timing benefits we experienced earlier in the year.\nI am extremely pleased with our cash performance and remain confident that we will sustain 100% conversion over the next several years.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we repurchased a little over four million shares for approximately $300 million, which for the full year, brings us to around 23 million shares or $1.3 billion.\nAs you can see, Q1 typically represents less than 15% of our full year earnings per share given our normal seasonality.\nFor Q1 of fiscal '22, we expect to be above that level, with Q1 guidance representing about 16% of our full year at the midpoint.\nAdditionally, we expect an improving first half, second half versus historical seasonality.\nAs we look at fiscal '22 overall, on slide 18, we are entering the year with record backlog, and underlying markets are continuing to improve.\nWith that said, we do expect supply chain constraints and the inflationary environment to continue, at least over the next couple of quarters.\nOn a full year basis, we expect high single-digit organic revenue growth, with 70 to 80 basis points of segment EBITA margin expansion.\nAlthough we expect to remain price/cost positive on an earnings per share basis, the inflated level of pricing will result in margin headwinds of approximately 40 basis points for the year.\nUnderlying margins are expanding to 110 to 120 basis points.\nAdditionally, we expect another year of strong earnings growth, with adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.22 to $3.32, which represents year-over-year growth of 22% to 25%.\nTurning to slide 19.\nWe can see that our expectations for fiscal '22 are very much in line with the growth expectations we provided at our recent Investor Day, and we are accelerating growth in each area.\nLast, on slide 20, I want to reiterate that we are well on our way to our '24 targets.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:regional and global economy, and the financial condition and results of operations of the company and its tenants.\nJoining us today are Tom O'Hern, chief executive officer; Scott Kingsmore, senior executive vice president and chief financial officer; and Doug Healey, senior executive vice president, Leasing.\nWe had releasing spreads of 5% and occupancy at nearly 91%.\nAt the end of the third quarter, most of our town centers were open with only our three closed centers in Los Angeles remaining closed by government mandate.\nThose centers reopened in early October.\nSo as of today, all of our centers are open and our tenants are eagerly planning for a busy holiday season.\nMost of the results were better than the second quarter, but we were obviously adversely impacted in the quarter due to COVID in general and specifically due to the protracted California and New York City closures.\nI'm very appreciative of the entire Macerich team that did a tremendous job of getting our centers reopened safely in some cases for a second time.\nSome of the self-health and safety measures we took went way beyond CDC recommendations that included significantly upgrading our air filtration systems to include hospital quality air filtration with [Inaudible] filters; engage the clinical head of Infectious Disease at UCLA Medical Center to review and advise us on our protocols and policies.\nWe hired a nationally renown engineering firm to advise us on advanced HVAC systems and protocols.\nWe implemented modified hours, increased cleaning and sanitizing protocols, CDC guidelines, and approved products that are baseline for our services.\nIn terms of rent collections, we are much better off in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.\nDuring the third quarter, our average rent collections were 80%.\nOctober is trending above 80%.\nFor most of the tenants not paying rent during the closure period, we would generally come to terms with them.\nIn general, we agreed to rent relief usually in the form of deferred rent for the closure months with repayment in 2021.\nIn many cases, in exchange for landlord-favorable amendments to leases.\nThere were some large reserves for uncollectible rents in the quarter, which Scott will comment on.\nCash flow continues to improve by the month as we move into the fourth quarter, and I expect that to continue.\nAs of today, we have significant liquidity and currently have approximately $675 million of cash on the balance sheet.\nThe tenant reactions to reopening has been good.\nOur tenants, almost without exception, were eager to get reopened.\nBy October, for centers opened at least eight weeks, sales were up to 90% of pre-COVID levels.\nThe consumer is shopping with a purpose and there has been pent-up demand.\nOur second quarter was more about getting centers opened and getting our tenants open safely and less about leasing.\nThe focus in the third quarter was collecting past due rents and started to shift back to leasing.\nLooking at traffic, in general, it's running about 80% compared to a year ago.\nSome of that has to do with capacity limits, particularly for restaurants and also for having no seating in the food court.\nSales, on the other hand, are running on average 90% of a year ago, which means there, I'd say, higher capture rate.\nThis year will be a different holiday season.\nWe believe it's going to start earlier.\nOperating hours will be shorter.\nThere will be capacity limits.\nWith consumers not spending money on vacations and entertainment during COVID, most of our consumers in our markets have money to spend this holiday season.\nTop categories are expected to be fitness and wellness, home furnishings, electronics and athletic leisure.\nThere will be [Inaudible] but with lots of social distancing.\nWe've got a number of questions about potential for property tax increases in California, although small in the political scheme of things.\nThere was a proposition in California that would have increased property taxes on commercial property.\nIt is known as Proposition 15.\nThat proposition would have removed the protection of Prop 13 from commercial properties in California.\nFor us, generally, we structure our leases to pass-through taxes to the tenant as a recoverable expense with a significant bottom line impact that the [Inaudible] shows Prop 15 passing.\nAs of today, it is trailing.\nThe yes votes stand at 48.7%, the no are at 51.3%.\nSo hopefully, that means no increase for commercial taxes in California.\nLooking at the balance of 2020.\nThe pandemic has shown that good retail is not going away, especially in A quality centers.\nDigitally native brands appreciate, more than ever, the profitability of their physical stores.\nBig format retailers got active again in the third quarter, and you'll hear some of the specifics from Doug.\nAlthough we are still in the midst of COVID, our centers are operating at 90% capacity, sales levels of 90% pre-COVID.\nAnd even if you look at one of the more challenging categories, restaurants, in our portfolio, we have 247 restaurants and 94% of those are open today.\nThe second quarter was an extremely unique quarter and some of the second quarter challenges carried into the third quarter and may even carry partially into the fourth quarter.\nBut many metrics got better in the third quarter, specifically collections.\nAnd the number of tenants opened and the progress we are making on leasing activity.\nThe impact on reserves for adoption accounts was less than 20 — second quarter of '20, but still much higher than normal.\nWe expect to gradually improve to a more normal level in the first quarter of '21.\nAlthough there are still too many uncertainties to give guidance, we expect the fourth quarter of 2020 and the year 2021 to be much better than the second and third quarters of 2020.\nDisruption from COVID-19 continued to severely impact 2020 results in the third quarter.\nFunds from operations for the third quarter was $0.52 per share, down from the third quarter of 2019 at $0.88 per share.\nSame-center net operating income for the quarter was down 29%, and year to date, it was down 17%.\nChanges between the third quarter of 2020 versus the third quarter of 2019 were driven primarily by the following factors and the numbers I'm going to cover [Inaudible] for the company: One, $20 million — $21 million in bad debt allowance in the form of the $14 million of increased net debt expense versus the third quarter of 2019, coupled with $7 million of lease revenue reverse for tenants, that are accounted for on a cash basis per GAAP within the third quarter; two, over $20 million of short-term nonrecurring rental assistance; three, a $9 million decline in common area and ancillary revenue as well as percentage rents; four, a $4 million decline in parking income driven by protracted property closures and reduced parking utilization at our urban centers in New York City and Chicago primarily; five, interest expense increased $4 million due to a decline in capitalized interest; six, net operating income declined from the Hyatt Regency Hotel [Inaudible], it was about a $2 million decline; seven, a negative $0.03 per share dilutive impact from shares issued in the second quarter relating to our stock dividend issued in the second quarter.\nThese factors were all offset by increased lease termination income of $7 million and land sale gains totaling $11 million net impact.\nRevenue declines from occupancy loss also contributed to declines in both net operating income and FFO for the third quarter.\nAs Tom mentioned, we are not providing updated 2020 earnings guidance given continued uncertainties.\nWe do anticipate continued volatility operating results in the fourth quarter.\nWhile we're not providing guidance for 2021, as we mentioned last quarter, we still believe that 2020 will be a trough in the company's operating results including primarily to the following factors: The pandemic has effectively accelerated the financial troubles with numerous [Inaudible], resulting in a wave of bankruptcy filings that were funneled and due 2020.\nWe do not anticipate this volume to recur in 2021.\nThe majority of the filings have resulted in reorgs and not full fleet liquidations.\nWe do expect approximately a 3% cumulative drop in occupancy from lease rejections, approximately half of which is already embedded within the 90.8% reported occupancy [Inaudible] third quarter, and the balance of these stores will close within the fourth quarter.\nYear to date, we have reported $57 million in additional bad debt reserves versus 2019, including $50 million of bad debt expenses and $7 million of lease revenue reversals for tenants accounted for on a cash basis.\nSimilar levels of reserves are certainly not anticipated going forward.\nWe've recorded well over $20 million in nonrecurring short-term rental assistance year to date and we expect those to continue into the fourth quarter of 2020.\nAnd then lastly, we anticipate increases to transit revenue line item going forward into 2021, namely the percentage rent, temporary tenant income, parking garage revenue, advertising, sponsorship, vending and other ancillary property driven revenue.\nWe look forward to providing 2021 guidance on our typical cadence this time next quarter.\nGiven the continued improvement in rent collections of 80% in the third quarter and over 80% in October, liquidity continues to improve.\nCash on hand has increased from $573 million at June 30 to $630 million at September 30.\nAnd as Tom noted, liquidity continues to improve to this day.\nThis improved liquidity is solely due to improved operating cash flow and is a testament to the herculean efforts by our people to both secure the right to open all of our properties and to negotiate thousands of agreements with our retailers.\nWith continued progress in these negotiations, which Doug will soon elaborate upon, we anticipate further improvement to operating cash flow throughout the year.\nWe are closing on a 10-year $95 million financing on Tysons Vita, the residential tower at Tysons Corner.\nThe loan will have a fixed rate of 3.3% and will include interest-only payment during the entire loan term.\nThis will provide approximately $47 million of liquidity to the company, and we expect the loan closing to occur within the next several weeks.\nWe secured a short-term extension on Danbury Fair through April 1, 2021.\nThe loan amount and interest rate remain unchanged following that extension.\nWe have agreed to terms with the loan servicer for a three-year extension on Fashion Outlets of Niagara, which will extend the loan maturity through October of 2023.\nWe expect the loan amount and interest rate also to be unchanged following that extension.\nAnd then lastly, we continue to work with our lenders to secure loan extensions for the nonrecourse mortgages on each of FlatIron Crossing, Green Acres Mall and the power center adjacent to that Green Acres Commons, and we anticipate securing extended term within the coming weeks.\nLike the second quarter, the majority of our efforts in the third quarter involved getting our retail partners open as quickly and as safely as possible once our centers were allowed to reopen.\nTo date, all of our properties are open, and I'm happy to report that 93% of the square footage that was opened pre-COVID is now open today.\nAs I discussed on our last call, it has been the case in the third quarter, much of our time and energy was spent working with those retailers that did not have the ability to pay rent while closed.\nAnd we've made great progress.\nIn fact, as we look at our top 200 rent paying retailers, we've either received full rent payment or secured executed documents with 147 and are in LOI with another 23, all of which totals approximately 93% of the total rent these top 200 pay.\nConsequently, collections continue to improve.\nThird quarter saw an average collection rate of 80%, that's compared to 61% in the second quarter.\nAnd as of today, as Tom mentioned, our collection rate for October stands at about 81%.\nBut the third quarter wasn't all about collection.\nAs our centers continue to open and as our retailers opened and were able to trade with some consistency, the leasing climate began to improve.\nRetailers began executing leases that have been out since before COVID.\nBut most importantly, the retailers began committing to new deals again.\nA true sign that for the first time in months, we're now looking forward rather than solely focusing on the past.\nI'll expand on this in a moment, but first, let's take a look at some of the third-quarter metrics.\nPortfolio-related sales for the third quarter were $718 per square foot, and that's computed to exclude the period of COVID closures for each tenant.\nThe $718 is down from $800 per square foot at the end of the third-quarter 2019.\nFor centers opened the entire month, sales in September were actually 92% of what they were a year ago, once we exclude Apple and Tesla.\nOccupancy at the end of the third quarter was 90.8%.\nThat's down 50 basis points from last quarter and down 3% from a year ago.\nThis is primarily due to store closures for bankruptcies and from our local tenants that couldn't survive the pandemic.\nTemporary occupancy was 5.7%, that's down 70 basis points from this time last year.\nTrailing 12-month leasing spreads were 4.9%, that's down from 5.1% last quarter and down from 8.3% in Q3 2019.\nAverage rent for the portfolio was $62.29, down from $62.48 last quarter, but up 1.8% from $61.16 one year ago.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the leasing environment continues to improve.\nIn the third quarter, we signed 120 leases to 342,000 square feet.\nThis is over 3x the number of deals and square footage that was signed in the second quarter, and these stats do not include any COVID workouts.\nSome leases signed in the third quarter of note include Gucci, Fashion Outlets of Chicago, Ducati Paris at Scottsdale Fashion Square; Kids Empire and State 48 Brewery at SanTan; Barbarie's Grill at Danbury Fair; Starbucks at Fashion District Philadelphia; Madison Reed at 29th Street; Polestar at The Village at Corte Madera; finally, Lucid Motors at Scottsdale Fashion Square and Tysons Corner.\nBoth Lucid and Polestar are new additions to the electronic car category and first to the Macerich portfolio.\nAs we head toward the end of the year, much of our focus is on our 2021 lease expiration and finalizing deals in order to secure as much expiring square footage in 2021 as possible.\nAt this point in time, by virtue of COVID workouts and through the normal course of leasing, we have commitments on 26% of our 2021 expiring square footage with another 67% in the LOI stage.\nThis brings our total leasing activity on 2021 expiring square footage to just over 90%.\nTurning to openings in the third quarter.\nWe opened 44 new tenants and 276,000 square feet, resulting in total annual rent of $11.3 million.\nThis represents 65% of the openings we had at the same quarter last year, but with 15% more square footage and virtually the same total annual rent.\nGiven the conditions our industry has faced over the last several months, I think this speaks volumes to the strength of the leasing pipeline we had pre-pandemic.\nNotable openings include adidas and Tory Burch at Fashion Outlets of Niagara Falls; Aerie at Vintage Faire; West Elm at La Encantada; and Golden Goose, Capital One Cafe and a new Levi's store at Scottsdale Fashion Square.\nIn the large-spread — in the large-format category, we opened Dick's Sporting Goods at Deptford Mall, in a portion of a former Sears store; Saratoga Hospital at Wilton Mall, also in a former Sears store; a new and spectacular looking restoration hardware gallery at The Village at Corte Madera.\nAnd all of this was in the third quarter.\nIn October, we finished the repurposing of Sears at Deptford with the opening of Round One.\nAnd also in October, we remained active with Dick's Sporting Goods, opening them at Vintage Faire in a portion of Sears, and at Danbury Fair in the former Forever 21 box.\nThe digitally made of and emerging brands continue to expand their omnichannel presence by opening stores.\nAnd the third quarter was no exception.\nWe opened Amazon 4-Star and Indochino at Scottsdale; two Warby Parker stores at Scottsdale and 29th Street, along with Amazon Books and Tempur-Pedic at FlatIron Crossing.\nAnd our pipeline remains strong.\nAt this point, we have signed leases with 190 retailers scheduled to open throughout the remainder of 2020 and into 2021.\nThis totals 1.7 million square feet for a total annual rent of $63 million.\nAnd since the pandemic, only nine of these retailers with signed commitments have informed us that they won't be reopening — they won't be opening.\nTotal impact of this is only 60,000 square feet of the 1.7 million square feet and only $3 million of the $63 million in total rent.\nLastly, I want to address the issue of traffic.\nThere's been a ton of focus on traffic and the fact traffic is down compared with last year, and it is.\nThere's no arguing that.\nHowever, I struggle with the notion that traffic seems to be perceived as the sole means to a retailer's success.\nWhy aren't we talking more about conversion or sales or the combination of both?\nDespite less traffic, the Macerich portfolio is seeing tremendous success in the reopening of stores that were forced to close due to COVID, like Primark at Danbury, being the No.\n1 store in its region since reopening; or like Bath & Body Works at Freehold, beating last year's sales three months in a row with capacity limited to 50%; or HomeGoods at Atlas Park, outperforming last year by 15% while also at 50% capacity; or Burlington, reopening at Kings Plaza and selling through inventory that took a month to replace; or Sephora at Broadway Plaza, is currently ranked as one of the top stores in the company by virtue of conversion rates that are 20% to 30% higher than last year; or Round One at Deptford and Valley River, operating at full capacity with hour-long waits at night and on weekend; luxury retailers at Scottsdale Fashion Square such as Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Golden Goose, all exceeding planned by 25% to 40%; or North Italia, a restaurant at La Encantada, back to pre-COVID sales even at 50% occupancy; and Tillys at Arrowhead, reported double-digit sales increases since reopening in May and is expecting their best holiday season ever at this location.\nAnd the list goes on and on.\nUnfortunately, these success stories are too often overshadowed by the overwhelming focus on the effect this pandemic has had on traffic in the short-term and pre-vaccine.\nMake no mistake, traffic is important.\nThere's no denying that.\nHowever, I do think it's time we stop thinking so one dimensionally and focus on other metrics in addition to simply traffic.\nAnd when we do, I think we'll all find that we are in a much better place than many think.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We started this year off on a positive note, and we're excited about our momentum.\nWe took share in the contact lens market with strength in our silicone hydrogel portfolio led by MyDay and Biofinity.\nOur myopia management portfolio continued to strengthen, including MiSight growing 82% to 3 million and CooperSurgical posted a very strong quarter with Paragard growing 16% and fertility 10%.\nWith both businesses outperforming, we delivered robust earnings and cash flow and expect continued strong performance moving forward.\nRegarding the quarter and reporting all percentages on a constant currency basis, even with continuing COVID challenges, we posted consolidated revenues of 681 million with CooperVision revenues of 507 million, up 1%, and CooperSurgical revenues of 174 million, up 7%.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share were $3.17.\nFor CooperVision, we saw strength in our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio and in our Biofinity franchise, along with general strength in torics and multifocals.\nBy geography, the Americas grew 6% led by strength in Biofinity and daily silicones, including nice growth from both Clariti and MyDay.\nEMEA was down 4% as several countries continued managing through stringent COVID-related restrictions.\nWe did see growth in our daily silicones and Biofinity, though, so that bodes well for the future.\nAsia Pac was up 3% led by strength in MyDay, especially in Japan.\nOverall, sales exceeded expectations, and we're well positioned to continue growing and taking share with current and future product launches driving momentum.\nMoving to some additional quarterly numbers.\nOur silicone hydrogel dailies grew 8% with both MyDay and Clariti growing.\nParticular strength was noted in MyDay and especially MyDay toric as we continue rolling that product out around the world.\nOverall, dailies silicones are leading the market right now as health and wellness trends drive adoption, and we believe that will continue as there's still 2.4 billion in annual global sales of older hydrogels that need to be traded up.\nMoving to our FRP portfolio.\nBiofinity grew 6% with strike noted in Biofinity Energys and Biofinity toric multifocal.\nI've mentioned these products before, but as a reminder, Energys is a truly unique and innovative lens that uses digital zone optics to help alleviate eye fatigue from excessive screen time.\nIn today's world, this product has the ability to perform well, and we're seeing that.\nAnd our Biofinity toric multifocal was launched last year and is doing extremely well.\nThis is a made-to-order product and part of our extensive offering of unique products that differentiate our business.\nRegarding product launches, we remain incredibly active.\nWe now have regulatory approval to launch Clariti in Japan, and we'll be doing that shortly.\nAnd that's in addition to our ongoing successful launch of a second base curve for MyDay sphere in that market.\nWe're also continuing to launch and relaunch MyDay sphere and toric in many other markets around the world.\nWe're continuing the rollout of Biofinity toric multifocal, including launching in Europe shortly, and we're rolling out extended toric ranges for Clariti and Biofinity.\nAdditionally, our pipeline is strong, and we expect to remain very active going forward.\nAnd lastly, we're incredibly busy with our myopia management portfolio of MiSight and Ortho-k lenses, which grew 46% for the quarter to 12 million.\nWithin this, MiSight grew 82% to 3 million and Ortho-k grew 37%, including 1 million of revenue from our acquisition of GP Specialists from August of last year.\nWith respect to MiSight, we now have over 30,000 kids around the world wearing the lens, including over 2,000 in the U.S., and our momentum is accelerating.\nOur launch activity continues to go extremely well, and we expect similar success in new markets such as South Korea where we'll be launching in the next few months.\nWe've also made advancements in discussions with several large retailers and buying groups regarding MiSight and even moved into a test phase with one large retailer for roughly 70 stores.\nWe've also received several awards recently, including from Contact Lens Spectrum and Popular Science, and we're making advancements with multiple professional associations, helping to get myopia management recognize the standard of care.\nAnd we made great progress with several universities, supporting the training and education of their optometry students as many schools are now adding myopia management training courses to their curriculums.\nFrom a fitting perspective, if we look at U.S. data, the average age for a new MiSight wear remains 11 years old, and in a positive sign, it's trending younger.\nComparing this to the average age of a regular new contact lens wear of 17 shows we're bringing kids into contacts at a much younger age, which is fantastic.\nThis is all extremely exciting and supports our goal of reaching or exceeding 25 million of MiSight sales this fiscal year and over 50 million next year.\nMoving to myopia management spectacles, I want to touch on our recent acquisition of SightGlass Vision and our partnership with EssilorLuxottica.\nSightGlass Vision has developed innovative spectacles to reduce the progression of myopia in children, and our joint venture with EssilorLuxottica will leverage our shared expertise and global leadership in myopia management to accelerate the commercialization of these spectacles around the world.\nWe're now working through the typical regulatory requirements to form the JV, and we started developing launch plans in certain markets as we await the two-year clinical data, which will be out in the next couple of months.\nThe SightGlass technology is a great complement to our existing myopia management portfolio of contact lenses.\nAnd working with a great partner like EssilorLuxottica will accelerate growth of the entire pediatric vision marketplace.\nMore to follow on this exciting opportunity as we continue making progress.\nTo wrap up on myopia management, we're at the forefront of an extremely exciting global pediatric opportunity.\nThis market is in its infancy, but the growth is exciting, and having the only FDA-approved product in MiSight has been a game-changer.\nWe're continuing to invest in sales and marketing programs and new launches, regulatory approvals and R&D to keep driving adoption on a global basis.\nProactively addressing the progression of myopia in pediatric patients offers immediate visual correction, along with many long-term health benefits, such as reducing the risk of serious eye disease later in life, such as retinal detachment, cataracts and glaucoma.\nSo, this effort is important, and it's why so many eye care professionals are getting involved and strongly supporting this activity.\nTo conclude on vision, let me add that the continuing rollout of vaccines will definitely benefit us given the consumer nature of our business.\nIn the near term, we expect better foot traffic in retail outlets, especially malls, along with increasing service capacity and better staffing attendance in optometry offices.\nWe also expect a strong back-to-school season as in-person learning returns around the world.\nOn a longer-term basis, our growth drivers remain strong and are likely improving with the macro trend of people spending more time on electronic devices.\nIt's estimated that roughly one-third of the world is currently myopic, and that's expected to increase to 50% by 2050.\nCombining this trend with a continuing shift to daily silicones, geographic expansion and growth in torics and multifocals, our industry has a very bright future.\nFor CooperVision, our robust product portfolio, active product launch activity, momentum with myopia management and strong new fit data puts us in a great position for long-term sustainable growth.\nWe had a very strong quarter led by Paragard and fertility.\nOverall revenues were 174 million, up a healthy 7% as markets rebounded and we took share.\nI'm really excited about the state of CooperSurgical right now under the fantastic leadership of Holly and our team, and the future looks extremely bright.\nRevenues grew 10% year over year to 70 million with strikes seen around the world and throughout our product portfolio.\nWe're taking share, and we're well positioned for future gains with improving traction in our key accounts.\nOne of the strengths of our fertility business is our broad product portfolio, which essentially covers the full spectrum of fertility clinics' needs outside of pharma products.\nWe've done a great job cross-selling and building relationships with the larger clinics around the world, and this has resulted in solid growth in areas ranging from consumable products like pipettes, media and RI Witness, our RFID lab-based management system that I discussed last quarter, to equipment such as incubators and workstations to genetic testing.\nFrom a market perspective, COVID is still negatively impacting patient flow, and some important countries like India are still significantly hampered, but we're definitely seeing a pickup in activity.\nIn the meantime, we're taking market share, and we expect that to continue.\nOverall, the fertility market has extremely positive long-term macro growth trends, and we're well positioned to capitalize on these trends to drive growth.\nWithin our office and surgical unit, we were up 5% led by Paragard's growth of 16%.\nAs the only 100% hormone-free IUD in the U.S. market, the product offers a fantastic, long-lasting birth control option that addresses the needs and interest of women looking for a healthy alternative.\nWe're very bullish on Paragard right now and believe we'll continue posting solid growth this year.\nElsewhere, we've seen deferred elective procedures steadily rescheduled, and our medical device sales have improved.\nSeveral of our focus products grew in the quarter, including Endosee Advance, our direct visualization system for evaluation of the endometrial, INSORB, our patented surgical skin closure device, and our portfolio of uterine manipulators.\nWe made great progress over the past several years, and we have a lot of exciting things happening today.\nWe just completed an ESG materiality assessment to ensure we stay focused on the right areas, and my passion and commitment to this type of work remains very strong.\nIf anyone has any questions or interest in our ESG efforts, please reach out and let's connect.\nOur fourth-quarter consolidated revenues increased 5% year over year, or 3% in constant currency to $681 million.\nConsolidated gross margin increased 50 basis points year over year to 67.8%.\nThis improvement was driven by strength in CooperSurgical with higher-margin Paragard and fertility consumable products performing extremely well, along with favorable currency.\nMoving forward, we're in excellent shape to continue delivering solid gross margins.\nWe completed our manufacturing restructuring activity in Q1, so we're well positioned for the current environment, along with being ready to efficiently ramp up quickly as demand continues to rebound.\nWe still have absorption-related inefficiencies, but we expect those to go away with sales growth.\nOpex was up only 2.1% year over year as we kept expenses under control.\nThis resulted in consolidated operating margins of 26.9%, up nicely from 25% last year.\nThis performance exceeded expectations, and we expect to continue posting strong results, balancing expense control against investment opportunities that we see within our business, particularly within myopia management.\nInterest expense for the quarter was $6.4 million driven by lower rates and lower average debt, and the effective tax rate was 11.3%.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share was $3.17 with roughly 49.7 million average shares outstanding.\nFree cash flow was solid at $92 million comprised of $148 million of operating cash flow, offset by $56 million of capex.\nNet debt increased slightly to $1.7 billion, while our adjusted leverage ratio decreased to 2.1 times with improving EBITDA.\nAnd finally, we repurchased $25 million worth of stock this past quarter at an average price of $357 per share.\nIn addition to our strong operational performance, we completed several tuck-in acquisitions recently.\nDuring the quarter, we acquired Embryo Options to add a cryo storage software solution to our fertility portfolio, allowing clinics to automate the management of cryopreserved embryos, eggs and sperm.\nThe business did $4.7 million in sales last year and added $500,000 in revenue in our Q1.\nWithin CooperVision, as Al mentioned, we acquired the remaining 80% stake of SightGlass Vision in January for $41 million in cash plus aggregate potential earn-outs of up to $139 million based on revenue milestones and regulatory approvals.\nAfter the close of the quarter, we entered into an agreement to form a 50-50 joint venture with EssilorLuxottica that we hope to close soon.\nAlso subsequent to quarter end, we closed two more tuck-in deals at CooperSurgical.\nThe first was the GA Medical, a pre-revenue manufacturer of an in-office water vapor ablation system that will launch shortly, and Safe Obstetric Systems, owner of Fetal Pillow, a balloon device used during c-sections to make the delivery less traumatic for the mother and baby.\nThe business did $4.4 million in sales last year.\nAnd we repurchased -- I'm sorry, we purchased it for $52 million in cash plus a potential earn-out of up to $14 million.\nThis is directly tied to the tax item I discussed last quarter where CooperVision's intellectual property and related assets were transferred to the U.K. in November 2020.\nFor non-GAAP purposes, we adjusted for this activity and will continue doing so moving forward.\nWe continue to monitor and evaluate the scope, duration and impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results.\nWhile we still view resurgences as a significant risk factor, our visibility has improved.\nSo, we're now providing full-year 2021 guidance to provide a better feel for our expected upcoming performance, including our anticipated myopia management investments.\nThe guidance includes consolidated revenues of 2.8 to 2.845 billion, up 15 to 17%, or up 12 to 14% in constant currency, with CooperVision revenues of 2.090 to 2.120 billion, up 13 to 15%, or up 9 to 11% and in constant currency, and CooperSurgical revenues of 710 to 725 million, up 21 to 23%, or 19 to 22% in constant currency.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $12.90 to $13.10.\nLastly, on free cash flow, we now expect to approach 500 million this year as operating cash flow improves, and capex reduces.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:During our call, management may discuss certain items, which are not based entirely on historical facts.\nAnd of course, on the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management uses in its review of the business and believes will provide insight into the company's ongoing operations.\nBrinker's fourth quarter was one of our more profitable quarters in recent history, marking a solid finish to a successful, albeit unusual year.\nUnderpinning our fiscal '21 results is a consistent strategy that differentiates us in the marketplace and an exceptional team that executes every day in our restaurants.\nWe were already growing sales and taking share before the pandemic hit, and we made the decision to lean further into our strategy of providing convenience, value, and a great guest experience by doubling down on third-party delivery and improving our take-out systems.\nIn a year of social distancing, our teams came together safely to lead the industry on traffic and regained positive sales momentum.\nIn a year of closures and shutdowns, we opened our first virtual brand in over 1,000 restaurants by leveraging our technological infrastructure, It's Just Wings surpassed our $150 million target in our company-owned restaurants.\nAnd along with the support of our franchise partners, It's Just Wings became more than $170 million business in the U.S., with many of our international franchisees also now operating the brand.\nIn a year that started with unemployment near record highs, we kept all our management teams employed and paid them solid bonuses.\nWe put a retention plan in place for our strongest team members to encourage them to stay with us as the staffing environment continued to change through the spring and summer.\nIn a year where gatherings and special occasions at Maggiano's were restricted, Steve and the team restructured the value proposition, the takeout proposition, and reengineered the Heart of House.\nThe brand is already delivering much more profitable sales as volumes come back and guests have responded very positively to the changes.\nIn a year, we thought we might have to borrow money more to survive the pandemic, we paid down our debt by over $300 million and we're committed to continuing that trend this year.\nAnd in a year where we worried we wouldn't be able to support our charitable partners at levels we're used to, our team set a record, raising more than $10 million for St. Jude during an exceptionally critical time for their patients and families.\nOur teams have raised nearly $90 million for St. Jude's patients during our partnership.\nIn fact, we've positioned ourselves to invest aggressively to grow this business during fiscal '22 and beyond and to keep our balance sheet strong.\nThe ability to make these kinds of investments starts with owning our restaurants; having the opportunity to leverage our fleet and realize the full potential -- the full profitability of our efforts.\nThe pandemic solidified our commitment to corporate ownership.\nDespite the challenges of owning restaurants like dealing with labor issues and commodity cycles because ownership gives us the scale to effectively manage the issues, it allows us to steward our brands consistently and have control over the investments we make to grow the business.\nThis year, our investments will target more ways to offer convenience, value, and a great guest experience.\nBy doubling our pipeline of new restaurant openings, reimagining to keep our assets strong and vibrant, accelerating our technology advantages, and expanding our portfolio of brands.\nCurrently, we're in the middle of rolling out our second virtual brand, Maggiano's Italian Classics.\nIt's now in over 250 restaurants today and doing very well.\nThis one will be a slower roll for a couple of reasons.\nIt's a little more complex.\nAnd since we're back to fully operational dining rooms, we're being very intentional about the experience for our operators and our guests.\nWe're excited about it.\nWe're getting great guest feedback, and we're anticipating being in restaurants 900 restaurants by the end of the fiscal year.\nWe're also investing in both takeout and delivery by pursuing opportunities to increase visibility and drive awareness of these channels across all four of our brands.\nWe recently implemented technology enhancements to our curbside takeout system, which is already simplifying the operational side of the business and improving guest metrics.\nIt's Just Wings has gone live with a website that offers online ordering for takeout as well as delivery, and we're excited about the growth potential for the brand.\nThese technology investments are helping us do a better job handling the increased mix of off-premise business from pre-pandemic mid-teens to what's now more than 30%, and as well as leveraging the full capacity of our assets with very little incremental capital.\nIt isn't every day you more than double your off-premise business and add a couple of brands to your base.\nIt only happens well with best-in-class systems to enable it and a strong team to execute it.\nOur team is critical to our success, and we take the current staffing environment very seriously.\nWe've executed a full-court press to hire, train and retain our talent.\nWhile the challenges came fast and furious for all of us in March, I'm pleased with the progress we've made.\nThere are still opportunities, but isolated to specific trade areas, and we're confident we'll get these staffing challenges resolved in the near future.\nTo further support our operators, we're rolling out a new service system with handheld devices that we've worked on for three years to perfect.\nIt isn't as easy as some might claim it.\nTo implement a system that operators can execute during high volume that saves labor and still delivers a great guest experience.\nOurs is also putting more money in our team members' pockets, so they're staying with us longer, which is crucial in this environment.\nIt's in more than 250 restaurants now, and we anticipate full implementation by November.\nAnd finally, because we chose not to take price at Chili's during fiscal '21, we have room to take some price this year as consumers return to work and income levels return to normal.\nWe're evaluating how we'll address those opportunities, especially in channels like delivery while all while protecting our industry-leading value proposition.\nWe spent last year learning to run a much more efficient and robust revenue-generating model.\nWe're spending this year and beyond capitalizing on the opportunities for growth that are not just available, but achievable for Brinker.\nThere's nobody who's doing this better than this team, and I'm honored to be part of their story.\nAs Wyman indicated, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to our fiscal-year 2021.\nFor the fourth quarter, Brinker reported total revenues of $1.009 billion, with a consolidated comp sales of 65%.\nIn keeping with our ongoing strategy, the majority of these sales were driven by traffic, up 53% for the quarter, a 10% beat versus the industry on a two-year basis.\nThese sales translated into solid earnings per share with fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.68.\nAt the brand level, Chili's comparable restaurant sales were positive 8.5% versus the fourth quarter of fiscal-year '19, which we believe is the more appropriate comparison for the quarter.\nAdditionally, on an absolute dollar basis, the fourth quarter was Chili's largest sales quarter on record, topping $900 million in total revenue.\nMaggiano's, while down 18% compared to fourth quarter of fiscal '19, made very solid progress with its recovery curve and built positive momentum to carry into the current fiscal year.\nMoving down the P&L.\nOur fourth-quarter restaurant operating margin was 16.9%.\nAdjusting this performance for the impact of the 53rd week, the resulting 16% operating margin still represents a material year-over-year improvement and more importantly was a 110-basis-point margin improvement versus the pre-COVID fourth quarter of fiscal '19.\nFood and beverage expense for the fourth quarter as a percent of company sales was 20 basis points unfavorable as compared to prior year.\nThis variance was driven -- primarily driven by increased commodity costs, particularly for chicken and pork products.\nLabor expense for the quarter, again, as a percent of company sales was favorable 240 basis points versus prior year, primarily driven by the extra week sales leverage versus fixed labor expenses and the slower reopening pace in a couple of high wage states such as California.\nDuring the quarter, our managers focused considerable efforts toward staffing our restaurants to support the solid demand for our brands.\nScale clearly matters in this area, as they were effectively supported by our experienced HR teams who help deploy hiring tools and events to assist in the process.\nGiven the more challenging hiring environment, the dynamic of hiring, training, and retaining team members resulted in an increase in labor inflation in the mid-single-digit range, a dynamic we expect to continue in the near term.\nTo reward our operator's strong performance throughout the fiscal year, we also chose to further invest in our hourly team members and managers through a variety of incremental bonus structures, totaling approximately $4 million for the quarter beyond our normal payout formulas.\nThis incremental investment impacted quarterly earnings per share by approximately $0.06 and increased labor expense margin by roughly 40 basis points, well worth the benefits it will accrue.\nRestaurant expense was 830 basis points favorable year over year as we fully leveraged many of our fixed costs, particularly from the benefit of the additional week in the quarter.\nThe continued positive operating performance did result in a meaningful increase in our quarterly tax rate, 15% for the quarter, which includes a catch-up adjustment to increase the annual income tax accrual.\nThis increase negatively impacted fourth-quarter earnings per share approximately $0.06.\nOur operating cash flow for the fourth quarter and fiscal year remained strong with $101 million and $370 million for those time frames, respectively.\nEBITDA for the quarter totaled $144 million, bringing the fiscal-year EBITDA total to $368 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we continued to use a significant portion of our cash flow to further reduce revolver borrowings.\nBy year-end, our revolver balance was reduced to $171 million.\nThis decreased our total funded debt leverage to 2.5 times and our lease-adjusted leverage to 3.6 times at year end.\nSpeaking of the revolver, we have reached agreement on terms and conditions for a new revolving credit facility with our bank group.\nThe new $800 million five-year revolver includes improved pricing allows the return of restricted payments and provides ample liquidity and flexibility to support our growth strategies.\nOur board of directors has also reinstated the share repurchase authorization that was suspended in the early days of the pandemic with an authorization amount of $300 million.\nNow turning to our outlook for fiscal-year '22.\nAt this point, with the volatility and unknowns of the current operating environment, we can only share some high-level thoughts for certain annual metrics.\nFor example, we expect commodity and labor inflation percentages each in the mid-single digits with commodity inflation toward the lower end of the range.\nCapex of $155 million to $165 million, an annual effective tax rate of 14% to 15%, and weighted annual share count of 45 million to 47 million shares.\nAs we now move ahead with fiscal 2022, the reality of the pandemic with all its uncertainties is still part of our everyday operations.\nThat being said, all now four of our brands are well prepared and positioned to perform in whatever environment they face throughout the year.\nWe are very proud of their efforts during the past fiscal year and are confident of the experiences, the growth, and the strength of their business models will continue to deliver quality results as we move forward from here.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Please read the forward looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.\nLinde employees delivered another solid quarter, continuing Q2's record earnings per share performance, despite increasingly challenging market conditions.\nOperating cash flow and return on capital reached record levels, and our project backlog nearly doubled, providing a strong foundation for high quality, long term growth.\nWe also stepped up our commitment to reducing our greenhouse gases emissions footprint, and Sanjiv will share that road map with you.\nBut frankly, this isn't something new.\nIt's what we committed to our shareholders since the merger and had been delivering on ever since, irrespective of the macro environment.\nMost of you know this, but I think it bears repeating: our operating culture runs deep at Linde, our people take great pride in demonstrating continuous improvement across the key operating metrics in their business.\nThe best day of the month for our management team is when we review the operating performance of each of our regional business units.\nThis is what we do for fun in Danbury, among other things.\nWhile I'm sure you've seen the announcement earlier this week where I will become the Chairman of the Board, and Sanjiv will become CEO effective March first.\nHis appointment is the culmination of a diligent three year succession planning process, in which Sanjiv clearly demonstrated he was the right choice to lead this company going forward.\nI will continue to provide guidance, both from the perspective of a Director and a significant shareholder.\nBut my primary responsibility shifts to chairing the Board of Directors, while Sanjiv takes over day to day management of the company.\nSupporting Sanjiv is a highly capable and experienced leadership team.\nI have been CEO for 15 years, and I have never felt better about how the company is positioned.\nObviously, our strategy is working well and the team is executing at a high level.\nSome say we are a well oiled machine.\nWe are a company for all seasons, and I'm confident Linde's best days lie ahead.\nI'll now hand the call over to Sanjiv.\nI'm honored to be given the opportunity to lead this outstanding company into the future.\nI appreciate your confidence and support over the years.\nBefore I jump into the slides, I wanted to build on Steve's comment of a seamless leadership transition.\nHere at Linde, we are proud of our industry leading performance, which starts with living our core values while maintaining a disciplined execution culture.\nAs CEO, I fully intend to build upon our foundation.\nMy focus will be on areas that are aligned with the interest of our shareholders: profitable growth, optimize the business, cash generation and, of course, the truth serum for our industry, ROC.\nLinde will remain focused on the things that create value for Linde owners such as strong pricing and productivity culture, an active commitment to sustainability, a disciplined investment philosophy, a shareholder friendly capital policy, and of course, pursuing high quality and sustainable growth initiatives with emphasis on ROC.\nUltimately, it's about being the best performing industrial gases and engineering company in the world.\nStated differently, you can expect a seamless transition with minimal change.\nNow with that said, let's move on to slide three for an update on our growth initiatives.\nLast quarter, I mentioned some key growth drivers, including the secured project backlog, accretive base capex investments and the strength of our growth in low capital intensity areas such as healthcare, food and beverage, engineering and our packaged gas business.\nToday, I'm happy to report that our project backlog has increased from $7.5 billion to $13.4 billion or up 81% sequentially from the last quarter.\nYou will recall, this backlog only includes contractually secured incremental growth with fixed payments to ensure targeted returns.\nWe're also beginning to see a return of the capital cycle, especially in upstream operations, such as natural gas production that bodes well for our overall pipeline of opportunities.\nOn top of that, the electronics sector continues to be very active.\nWe recently announced a $600 million investment, sale of gas investment indeed to supply a world class fab in Phoenix, Arizona.\nThis will supply only the first phase of this project, and we expect to see further opportunities as that area builds out.\nOverall, I'm pleased to see how the entire Linde team has come together and is leveraging our combined strengths to secure high quality growth opportunities through our leading high density industrial gas network combined with the world class engineering capabilities.\nThis backlog, combined with our supply network density, enables profitable and secured growth for years to come.\nNow before moving to the quarterly results, I want to update you on Linde's new and more ambitious greenhouse gas emission goals.\nA good way to stop this is to first explain the role our products play in people's lives and the overall economy.\nYou'll find this on slide four.\nWe make products that are critical for society, products such as medical oxygen for hospitals, ultra high purity nitrogen for semiconductors, liquid nitrogen for food freezing, krypton to insulate windows and hydrogen to produce cleaner fuels to give you just a few examples.\nIn order to make these products, we expect to have a total of 39 million metric tons of Scope one and Scope two emissions this year.\nAs you know, the production of gases require significant amounts of electricity.\nWhen such electricity is generated using hydrocarbons, we're penalized for those indirect emissions called Scope two emissions.\nWe also have Scope one emissions, which are significantly lower than our Scope two emissions, but are significant nonetheless.\nNow these emissions are largely as a result of using natural gas to make hydrogen, which is used by refiners to produce cleaner fuels.\nOur gases play a critical role in the economy.\nIn addition to saving lives, improving energy efficiency, increasing shelf life, our products also help our customers eliminate or reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn 2020, we generated a total of 37 million metric tons of emissions to make products that helped our customers avoid more than twice our emissions or 85 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent.\nIn other words, without Linde's products, there would be significantly higher net carbon emissions in our world.\nAt Linde, we have been doing our part to support our planet for many decades, but we know we need to do more.\nIn 2019, we set a goal to reduce the carbon intensity of Linde 35% by 2028.\nWe are well ahead of that goal and expect to exceed it, which is, of course, good news.\nBut an intensity goal doesn't fully address the absolute Scope one and Scope two emissions.\nSo we are determined to continue on our mission of making our world more productive, enabling our customers to decarbonize and commit to reducing our own carbon footprint.\nWith that in mind, I'd like to announce Linde's new medium and long term emission goals, which you will find on slide five.\nThe first goal is to achieve a 35% reduction in our Scope one and Scope two emissions by the year 2035 or simply 35 by 35.\nTo achieve this goal, we must materially reduce our Scope one emissions, which are driven by hydrogen production.\nWe will do this by focusing our efforts on carbon capture and sequestration, developing blue and green hydrogen production and progressively transitioning to a zero emission fleet.\nOur Scope two emissions are related to electricity consumption.\nToday, we consume approximately 45 terawatt hours of power, a 1/3 of which is from renewable and low carbon sources.\nIn order to achieve the 35 by 35 goal, we will triple, triple our renewable and low carbon power sourcing by 2035 through new PPAs and by supporting renewable energy projects with offtake agreements and even co-investment.\nTo put this goal in perspective, the amount of renewable energy we were planned to purchase is equivalent of all the power consumed annually in New York City.\nThat's a big number.\nOf course, in addition to that, we will continue improving the energy efficiency of our plants as well.\nThese goals are being embedded across the entire global organization, being reviewed as part of our operating rhythm and will be incorporated into our annual variable compensation.\nThis is what gives me the confidence in our ability to deliver these goals, which is no different than how we would approach anything of importance in our company.\nNow in addition to the 35 by 35 goal, we are also committed to pursuing our goal of becoming climate-neutral by 2050.\nWe will do our part to achieve this goal, but we also need strong policy support and regulatory support.\nLet me summarize this journey on slide six.\nWe have defined a road map to reach climate neutrality.\nThe road map is underpinned by numerous initiatives and milestones, which will be embedded into our operating system, providing us the greatest opportunity for success.\nGoing forward, we will continue to share our progress, ensuring accountability and transparency for our stakeholders.\nSales of $7.7 billion increased 12% over last year, and 1% from the second quarter.\nCost pass through, which represents the contractual billing of energy cost variances, primarily in the on site business, rose 3% over last year and 2% sequentially.\nRecall that cost pass-through has no effect on profit dollars, but will impact profit margins as we gross up or down sales and variable costs.\nForeign exchange was a 2% tailwind versus prior year, but a 1% headwind sequentially, as most currencies have recently devalued against the U.S. dollar.\nExcluding these items, underlying sales grew 11% over prior year and 1% sequentially.\nThe 8% volume increase over last year was broad based across all geographies and end markets, as we continue to see recovery from the pandemic.\nSequentially, volumes are flat as contribution from project start-ups were mostly offset by lower volumes in China.\nPricing levels are up 3% from last year and 1% from the second quarter, as we continue to adjust merchant and packaged gas product pricing in line with local inflation.\nNote that some of these contracts have lagging recovery mechanisms, which may not take effect for two to six months, depending upon the terms and conditions.\nOperating margin of 23.6% is 150 basis points above 2020, but 60 basis points below the high mark set in the second quarter.\nExcluding the impact of cost pass-through, operating margin would have increased 220 basis points above last year and had a negligible decline sequentially.\nAs mentioned, merchant and package cost recovery can lag one to two quarters.\nSo going forward, I expect continued pricing momentum.\nEPS of $2.73 is up 27% over last year from higher volumes and price over a relatively stable cost base.\nAs both Steve and Sanjiv mentioned, Linde has a strong productivity culture, which enables consistent profit growth, irrespective of the economic climate.\nThis is also evident in the 16.7% return on capital, which represents another record as profit continues to grow double digit percent over a flat capital base.\nThe reason we've been able to maintain such a steady capital base is due to a combination of disciplined capital management and healthy cash generation, which I'll cover on slide eight.\nYou can see to the left, our operating cash progression resulting in a record level of $2.6 billion in the third quarter.\nThe three main drivers are stronger earnings, timing benefits from last quarter and engineering contract prepayments.\nIn light of the record sale of plant backlog, I anticipate further project repayments into the next few quarters.\nAs far as how we allocated year to date cash, the pie chart to the right shows $2.3 billion invested into the business and $4.8 billion distributed back to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.\nNote that investments exclude sale of plant since we are paid in advance for engineering projects, which means that we are committing much larger amounts toward contractually secured growth than what's shown on this chart.\nIn addition to generating significant surplus cash we have access to very attractive capital through the debt markets.\nIn September, we issued almost EUR two billion at five, 12 and 30 year maturities, with all-in coupons of 0%, 0.38% and 1%, respectively.\nOverall, the combination of excess cash generation and low cost incremental debt gives us a high degree of confidence to maintain shareholder friendly allocation policies over the long term.\nI'll wrap things up with guidance on slide nine.\nThe fourth quarter earnings per share guidance range of $2.60 to $2.70 is 13% to 17% above last year and 38% to 43% above 2019.\nConsistent with prior quarters, we believe it's important to distinguish true multiyear growth from mere recovery of 2020 recessionary conditions.\nVersus the third quarter, this range represents a sequential decrease due to normal seasonal declines plus an estimated 1% foreign currency headwind.\nUnderlying volumes are assumed to be roughly in line with the third quarter, but if current conditions hold, I'd expect to be at the upper end of this range.\nThis quarterly update results in a new full year guidance of $10.52 to $10.62, which represents a growth rate of 28% to 29% over 2020 and 43% to 45% over 2019.\nIn summary, another solid quarter despite some challenging conditions.\nAnd regardless of the macro, we remain confident in Linde's ability to continue delivering industry-leading performance.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today.\nOn the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our chief financial officer.\nRevenues in the quarter were $2.9 billion, up from $2.8 billion in last year's first quarter.\nDuring this year's first quarter, we reported net income of $0.75 per share.\nAdjusted net income on a non-GAAP measure was $0.70 per share for the first quarter of 2021, compared to $0.35 per share in the first quarter of 2020.\nAdjusted net income for 2021 excludes $6 million of pre-tax special charges, $0.02 per share after tax related to the 2020 restructuring plan, and $15 million of pre-tax gain on the sale of TRU Canada, $0.07 per share after tax.\nSegment profit in the quarter was $256 million, up from $156 million in the first quarter of 2020.\nManufacturing cash flow before pension contributions totaled $71 million, up $501 million from last year's first quarter.\nOverall, the first quarter was a strong quarter for Textron.\nSegment margins were up 330 basis points in the quarter, driven by strong execution across all of our segments.\nAt Bell, revenues were up in the quarter on higher commercial revenues, partially offset by lower military revenues.\nOn the commercial side of Bell, we delivered 17 helicopters up from 15 in the last year's first quarter.\nWe saw solid order activity in the quarter across our commercial models, both domestically and internationally and across multiple end markets, including corporate, private, utility, and emergency medical services.\nOn future vertical lift, that was awarded a contract modification of $293 million for the second phase of the competitive demonstration and reduction program for FLRAA.\nAs we conclude final flight activity on the V-280, I think it's important to highlight the impressive performance milestones that the aircraft has demonstrated in over 215 flight hours over the past three-plus years.\nThis included 305 knots of demonstrated true airspeed, level 1 handling qualities, and autonomous flight.\nOn FLRAA, Bell is continuing with its build of the Invictus 360 prototype, where we are about a third of the way through the manufacturing process in anticipation of first flight in Q4 of next year.\nMoving to Textron Systems.\nRevenues were flat in the quarter while the business continued to execute well with improved operating margins.\nIn the quarter, Systems was awarded a contract to up to $607 million from the U.S. Army for the sustainment and modernization of existing shadow systems to the upgraded Block III configuration.\nAlso in the quarter, Systems successfully participated in the U.S. Army's Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Systems rodeo at Fort Benning and completed direct soldier flight demonstrations of our platform, the Aerosonde HQ.\nSystems is currently responding to the FTUAS RFI, which will help inform the next phase of that program.\nSystems also delivered the first RCV medium prototype to the Army customer as they look to test these vehicles and define requirements for the future of robotic combat vehicle programs.\nAt ATAC, we are continuing to ramp F1 flight hours at the operating sites related to the three awards of the U.S. Air Force CAPCAS program.\nAt the end of the quarter, we had 16 F1 aircraft certified for operation and deployed across our customer sites.\nIn Aviation, revenues were up -- I'm sorry, revenues were eventually flat in the quarter with slightly lower volume, reflecting lower aftermarket revenues, partially offset by higher pricing.\nWe delivered 28 jets, up from 23 last year and 14 commercial turboprops, down from 16 in last year's first quarter.\nOrder activity was strong in the quarter, resulting in backlog growth of $450 million to $2.1 billion at quarter-end.\nIn the quarter, we delivered our 1,560 XL-based Citation jet.\nThis milestone delivery is a testament to the value and performance of this platform, as well as Textron Aviation's commitment to the ongoing support of the fleet.\nWe also announced the new CJ4 Gen2 and delivered five aircraft in the quarter.\nThis model upgrade is another example of our continued investment in our existing portfolio of aircraft.\nOn the new product front, the Cessna SkyCourier aircraft certification program continues to progress well as we work toward entering to service targeted toward the second half of this year.\nRevenues were up from last year's first quarter, primarily driven by higher volume and price in our specialized vehicle product line.\nAt specialized vehicles, we continue to see strong retail demand across our customer end markets.\nAt Kautex, we saw our volume of fuel systems for hybrid electric vehicles more than double to about 9% of our total production volume in the quarter, the start-up of four new models.\nWhile the retail demand in industrial-owned markets has been improving, channel inventory remains below targeted levels as we work through supply shortages and disruptions, which we expect will improve throughout the course of the year.\nIn summary, it was a great start to the year.\nWe've seen improving customer demand in our end markets, increased commercial order flow at Aviation and Bell, and continued solid execution in our military businesses with strong cash generation in the quarter.\nLet's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation.\nRevenues at Textron Aviation of $865 million were down $7 million from a year ago largely due to lower aftermarket volume, partially offset by higher pricing.\nSegment profit was $47 million in the first quarter, up from $3 million of profit last year primarily due to a favorable impact from performance and the mix of products sold.\nBacklog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.1 billion.\nRevenues were $846 million, up $23 million from last year on higher commercial revenues, partially offset by lower military revenues.\nSegment profit of $105 million was down $10 million primarily due to higher research and development in the quarter, largely related to future vertical lift programs.\nBacklog in the segment ended the quarter at $5.2 billion.\nAt Textron Systems, revenues were $328 million, flat with a year ago.\nSegment profit of $51 million was up $25 million due to a $27 million favorable impact from performance and other.\nBacklog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.4 billion.\nIndustrial revenues of $825 million were up $85 million from last year, primarily from higher volume and mix, as well as price at specialized vehicles and foreign exchange fluctuations.\nSegment profit was $47 million, up $38 million from the first quarter of 2020 primarily due to higher volume and mix, price, net of inflation, and favorable performance at specialized vehicles.\nFinance segment revenues were $15 million, and profit was $6 million.\nMoving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $40 million, and interest expense was $35 million.\nWith respect to our 2020 restructuring plan, we recorded pre-tax charges of $6 million on the special charges line.\nWe also completed the sale of TRU Canada in the quarter and realized a pre-tax gain of $15 million.\nCash performance in the quarter was strong with $71 million on manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions, a $501 million improvement over last year's first quarter as we continued our focus on inventory and working capital management.\nIn the quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares, returning $91 million in cash to shareholders.\nTo wrap up with guidance, we're raising our expected guidance of adjusted earnings per share to a range of $2.80 to $3 per share, up $0.10 from our prior outlook.\nWe're reiterating our outlook for manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions of $600 million to $700 million with planned pension contributions of $50 million.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm Monica Vinay, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer at Myers Industries.\nIf you've not yet received a copy of the release, you can access it on our website at www.\nMyersIndustries.com, it's under the Investor Relations tab.\nThese comments are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nSuch statements are based on management's current expectations and involve risks, uncertainties, and other factors, which may cause results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements.\nFurther information concerning these risks, uncertainties and other factors is set forth in the company's periodic SEC filings and may be found in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.\nFirst, I want to say how proud I am of our employees, especially how they pulled together to deliver solid results during a challenging quarter while also staying safe.\nDue to the focus and dedication of our teams, we were able to deliver sales and operating results that were better than we had originally expected.\nAs we noted in today's release, our businesses performed well during the quarter.\nWe continue to meet our customers' needs, we delivered higher than anticipated sales despite challenges the complexities resulting from the COVID-19 crisis.\nSales in our consumer end market increased significantly year-over-year as a result of higher demand for our fuel containers.\nWe were also encouraged by the increase in demand that took place in our auto aftermarket sector, once stay at home restrictions were lifted and more vehicles returned to the road.\nOur businesses delivered gross margin expansion again this quarter.\nAdjusted gross profit margin increased to 36% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with 35% a year ago.\nThis was due to solid operational execution and favorable price-cost margin, which more than offset the lower sales volume during the quarter.\nAs a result, of the gross margin expansion and SG&A cost reductions, our operating margin was flat during the quarter despite the 12% decline in sales.\nWe're also pleased that we generated positive free cash flow of $3.7 million during the quarter.\nAs a result, our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to have significant liquidity to support our operations and our growth initiatives.\nOur entire team remains dedicated to staying safe while meeting our customers' needs and profitably growing our businesses.\nWe remain confident that our company has the financial strength, a high-quality product, and the right growth strategies to emerge as a stronger organization in the future, once this crisis subsides.\nMost importantly, our second-quarter performance-as our second quarter performance demonstrates we have an industry-leading team capable of generating strong results even in the most challenging of circumstances.\nNet sales for the second quarter were $118 million, a decrease of 12% compared with the second quarter of 2019.\nThe increases we saw from the fuel container sales in the consumer end market, and the Tuffy acquisition in the distribution segment were more than offset by sales decreases across the rest of our end markets.\nGross profit margin increased 100 basis points to 36%, this was primarily due to favorable price-cost margin and lower operating costs.\nOur adjusted operating income decreased 14% to $12.3 million for the quarter.\nThe adjusted operating income margin was flat despite the lower sales volume.\nThis was the result of the higher gross profit margin, as well as lower adjusted SG&A expenses year-over-year due primarily to lower variable compensation and cost reductions.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.23 compared to $0.27 for the second quarter of 2019.\nIn the Material Handling segment, net sales decreased by 15.7%.\nAs anticipated the challenging business environment led to sales declines in the Food and Beverage, vehicle, and industrial end markets.\nThese declines more than offset large sales increase in the consumer end-market.\nHowever, the lower overall sales volume was partially offset by favorable price-cost margin, a positive sales mix, and lower operating costs.\nAs a result, the segment's adjusted operating income margin increased to 19.5% compared with 18.3% for the second quarter of last year.\nIn the Distribution segment, sales decreased 2.2% as the incremental sales from the August 2019 acquisition of Tuffy Manufacturing partially offset a decline in sales across the remainder of the segment.\nAs Mike mentioned earlier, demand in this end market improved throughout the quarter as stay at home restrictions were lifted, closures eased and more vehicles were on the road.\nConsequently, sales during the quarter were better than we had anticipated.\nDistribution's adjusted operating income decreased to $1.6 million for the second quarter of this year, compared with $3.3 million a year ago, primarily due to unfavorable sales mix.\nThis was the result of two factors.\nFirst, an unfavorable product mix due to higher sales of equipment versus consumables during the quarter.\nAnd second, an unfavorable mix of acquisition versus base sales volume.\nAs a result, the segment's adjusted operating income margin was 4.4% compared with 8.7% for the second quarter of 2019.\nTurning to slide six, I'll review our balance sheet and cash flow.\nFor the second quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow of $3.7 million compared with $9.4 million last year.\nWorking capital as a percent of sales at the end of the second quarter was 9.9%, which was higher than in previous quarters.\nThe increase in working capital was primarily due to higher accounts receivable and inventory balances due to strong sales in June, and strategic investments in inventory to protect our supply chain during the crisis.\nWe expect working capital to return to normal levels by the end of the year.\nCash on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter was $72 million and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.2 times, which is consistent with previous quarters.\nIt's important to note that this outlook is based on current and projected market conditions, and there is still a lot of uncertainty around these projections.\nFor the full year, we now anticipate a percentage sales decline in the mid to high single-digit range, which is a slight improvement from our previous expectation of an approximate 10% decline year-over-year.\nNow let's review our current outlook for each of the end markets.\nStarting with our consumer end market, the increase in demand during the second quarter was even greater than what than we had anticipated.\nAs a result, we now expect the sales increase in the mid-single digits for the year in this market compared with our previous outlook about low single-digit increase.\nIn our Food and Beverage end-market we continue to anticipate a mid-single-digit increase in revenue for the full year.\nBecause last year's demand for seedboxes was unfavorably impacted by a late spring season and customer consolidations.\nWe anticipate improved demand in the upcoming season which as a reminder, will occur in the fourth quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 2021.\nTurning to our vehicle end market while demand in the RV market has begun to improve, we do not anticipate that the second half improvement will be enough to offset the decline in sales that we experienced during the first half of the year.\nAdditionally, demand in the automotive end market continues to be soft, therefore, as a result of the anticipated full-year decline in both RV and automotive customer sales, we continue to expect vehicle end-market sales to be down double-digits for the full year 2020.\nIn our industrial end market, we continue to expect a soft demand environment in industrial manufacturing throughout the remainder of the year.\nAs a result, we have maintained our industrial end market outlook of our percentage to be pretty in the low teens for the full year.\nAnd finally, in our auto aftermarket, because demand begin improving more quickly than we had anticipated once stay at home restrictions were lifted, we are now forecasting sales to decline in the low single-digit range, compared with our previous outlook of our high single-digit decline.\nTurning to slide eight, you can see our guidance for 2020.\nAs I just discussed, we anticipate sales for the full year will be down mid to high single digits, which is a slight improvement over our previous forecast of an approximate 10% decline.\nWe continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $21 million, net interest expense to be $4 million, a diluted share count of approximately 36 million shares, and capital expenditures to be roughly $15 million.\nLastly, we anticipate an effective tax rate of 26%, which is slightly lower than our previous guidance of 27%.\nAnd before we take questions, I'd like to close with a few comments.\nIn the coming months, we'll have a sharp focus on delivering profitable growth and increasing shareholding value.\nIn our Material Handling segment, we intend to use a disciplined M&A process to acquire businesses that build on our technological strength in plastics manufacturing.\nIn addition to M&A, we aim to grow organically, building out our commercial, sales, and marketing capabilities.\nWe are strengthening our teams and our focus in these areas and expect to see positive results in the future.\nIn Distribution, we will continue to execute our transformation and continuous improvement initiatives.\nThese include winning new business, growing key accounts, enhancing and expanding our e-commerce platform, and optimizing our supply chain to lower costs, while improving service level.\nFocusing on our strategy and driving an execution mindset, we will continue to deliver solid results into the future.\nI'm excited to be on this journey and I believe our teams are well-positioned for growth.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Please note, that the information presented is preliminary and based upon data available at this time.\nExcept to the extent required by law, we expressly disclaim any obligations to update earlier statements as a result of new information.\nFor the fourth quarter 2020, Hilltop reported net income of $116 million or $1.35 per diluted share, representing an increase from the fourth quarter 2019 of $67 million or $0.81 per diluted share.\nThis included a final settlement from the sale of National Lloyds of $3.7 million or $0.05 per diluted share.\nReturn on average assets for the period was 2.8% and return on average equity was 21%.\nFull-year 2020 net income equated to $448 million or $5 per diluted share.\nThis was an increase from $225 million or $2.44 per diluted share in 2019.\nFull-year results reflect a discontinued operations from National Lloyds of $38 million.\nThe fourth quarter capped off remarkable year of growth for the organization.\nWe continued to capitalize on a tremendous mortgage market, as originations for the quarter totaled $6.8 billion, an increase over prior year of $2.4 billion.\nDriven by PPP loan balances, the Bank's average loans for the fourth quarter increased 8% from prior year, and average deposits grew by $2.3 billion or 26% from prior year as well.\nNet revenues at the broker-dealer increased for the same period by $37 million or 33%, primarily due to robust volumes in Structured Finance, Public Finance and Fixed Income businesses.\nOur strong capital position in 2020 enabled us to distribute $241 million in both dividends and share repurchases.\nThis includes the Dutch auction tender that was executed in the fourth quarter, were Hilltop paid $193 million to repurchase approximately 8 million shares of common stock.\nYesterday, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per common share, an increase of 33% from the prior quarter.\nThis dividend is payable on February 26th, 2021.\nDuring the period, we continued to support our impacted banking clients through the approval of COVID-related loan modifications.\nThe balance of total active deferrals as of December 31 was $241 million -- excuse me, $240 million, down from $968 million at the end of the second quarter.\nOur allowance for credit losses as of December 31 totaled $149 million or 2% of the Bank's loan portfolio.\nThis reflects a reduction in the reserve balance of $6.2 million from the third quarter, which was driven by fourth quarter payoff, lower-than-expected charge-offs and a shift in the economic outlook.\n2020 was a challenging year for all of us, where I believe made us a stronger and better company.\nI'm very proud of our teammates companywide and how they responded to take care of each other, as well as our clients and the communities we serve.\nAt the onset of the pandemic, our treasury and capital markets teams immediately pulled together to manage the volatility which occurred and to ensure our businesses had ample liquidity to serve the needs of our clients.\nAs well, the coordinated efforts of our technology, property management and human resources groups, enabled us to effectively transition 90% of our employees to a work-from-home model, in less than 30-days.\nAlthough the pandemic caused Hilltop to change the way we work, it did not deter our company from making progress on large and complex initiatives.\nAlso notable, our team at PlainsCapital Bank originated 2,800 PPP loans and deferred loan payments in a few short months, for their commercial and consumer clients that were most impacted by the pandemic.\nTheir efforts in partnering and supporting our banking clients, highlight the culture of PlainsCapital and the quality of our bankers.\n2020 was also a record-breaking year for the company.\nAs prime lending funded a record $23 billion in mortgage loan, Hilltop Securities generated record net revenues of $530 million and Hilltop produced record earnings.\nImportantly, we do not expect these favorable market conditions to continue indefinitely.\nAs we embark upon 2021, we believe that Hilltop is well positioned with established businesses, synchronized leadership and substantial capital.\nMoving to Slide 4.\nPlainsCapital Bank had a solid quarter, with pre-tax income of $59 million, as a negative provision of $3.6 million was recorded.\nNet interest income increased $11 million from Q4 2019, driven by fees and interest income from PPP loans.\nNet interest margin was 3.37% during the period, a linked quarter increase of 35 basis points, as the Bank utilized cash proceeds from PPP loan pay-offs to reduce sweep deposits from Hilltop Securities.\nPrimeLending had an outstanding fourth quarter and generated pre-tax income of $84 million, an increase of $76 million from Q4 2019.\nThat was driven by a 54% increase in origination volumes and a gain on sale margin of 448 basis points, a strong finish to an incredible year for the PrimeLending team.\nHilltopSecurities, also had an outstanding quarter with pre-tax income of $34 million, an increase of $10 million or 42% from the fourth quarter of 2019.\nStructured Finance grew net revenue by 92% from Q4 2019, driven by a 57% increase in TBA lock volume.\nPublic Finance Services grew net revenue by 32% and Fixed Income Services grew net revenue by 45%, both driven by robust volumes, improved capabilities and key talent addition.\nMoving to Slide 5.\nIn late 2017, we announced a broad set of initiatives to enhance our platform and streamline operations with the goal of lowering operating costs, and building a foundation for future growth.\nOur goal was to deliver $84 million and run-rate PPNR benefit by the end of 2021.\nThrough the end of 2020, we have completed projects that have resulted in $90 million in revenue and cost benefits.\nThis program was centered around three main areas.\nEnhanced Business Operations, Strategic Sourcing and Shared Services.\nIn the first area of Enhanced Business Operations, we streamlined front-end operations through the replacement of legacy core systems with the Blue Sage loan origination system at PrimeLending and with the FIS platform in HilltopSecurities.\nAlso, we improved the alignment of leadership and management through affecting succession plan and making certain large organizational changes, such as the PrimeLending staff reorganization in 2018 and the restructuring of Hilltop's [Indecipherable] organization in 2019.\nAdditionally, we established a agency MBS group at HilltopSecurities, which is a securitized product platform that complements our mortgage origination businesses.\nIn the second area of Strategic Sourcing, the focus was to take advantage of the size of our organization, in order to improve our pricing and discounts with all vendors.\nIn order to do this, we implemented an enterprise contract and procurement platform to better enable the organization to work effectively with contracts and across vendors.\nA single travel and entertainment platform to aggregate data and leverage our scale for better rates and discounts and a consolidation of supplier sourcing, which includes IT hardware and software, it's in janitorial services, and office supply.\nNotably, Strategic Sourcing has been a huge effort and is showing very positive results, that we will continue to leverage as we negotiate contracts.\nThe focus of the third and last area was to build a Shared Services organization to support the entire enterprise.\nWe had redundancy across the organization in most functional departments.\nAnd through the centralization of certain responsibility, we now have better controls, communication and run rate costs.\nMost importantly, our Shared Services organization has positioned us for enhanced scalability to support both organic and acquisitive growth.\nI'll start on Page 6.\nAs Jeremy discussed, for the fourth quarter of 2020, Hilltop reported consolidated income attributable to common stockholders of $116 million, equating to a $1.35 per diluted share.\nHilltop produced income from continuing operations of $113 million or $1.30 per diluted share during the fourth quarter.\nFor the full-year of 2020, Hilltop reported consolidated income attributable to common stockholders of $448 million or $5.01 per diluted share.\nIncome from continuing operations available to common stockholders equated to $409 million or $4.59 per diluted share.\nEarnings per share from continuing operations effectively doubled from $2.30 reported in 2019.\nDuring the fourth quarter, revenue related to purchase accounting was $5.7 million and expenses were $1.4 million, resulting in a net purchase accounting pre-tax impact of $4.3 million for the quarter.\nIn the current period, the purchase accounting expenses largely represent amortization of deposit and other intangible assets related to prior acquisitions.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the provision for loan losses reflected a net recovery of $3.5 million and included $2.7 million of net charge-offs.\nThe impacts of the improvements in the macroeconomic assumptions, as well as client pay-downs and pay-offs, yielded a net reduction in the allowance for loan losses during the quarter.\nAs a result of the earnings performance and capital actions taken in 2020, Hilltop's year-end capital ratios remain strong with common equity Tier 1 of 18.97% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.64%.\nMoving to Page 7.\nAs shown here on Page 7, Hilltop's allowance for credit losses declined by $6 million versus the third quarter of 2020, as modest improvements in the macroeconomic outlook versus the prior quarter and lower specific reserves resulting from payoffs, whereby clients were able to refinance their debt with other institutions, lowered our at-risk assets.\nYear-end allowance for credit losses of $149 million, yielded ACL to bank loans HFI ratio of 2.05% as of the year-end 2020.\nOf note, we continue to believe that the allowance for credit losses could be volatile and the changes in the allowance will be driven by net loan growth in the portfolio, credit migration and changes to the macroeconomic outlook over time.\nI'm turning to Page 8.\nNet interest income in the fourth quarter equated to $107 million, including $6.3 million of PPP origination fees and the previously referenced purchase accounting accretion.\nVersus the prior year -- quarter, net interest income decreased by $3.4 million or 3%.\nNet interest margin, which declined versus the prior year period, increased versus the third quarter of 2020 by 15 basis points, driven by the recognition of deferred PPP origination fees and a decline in our cash balances of approximately $500 million.\nLoan yields remain pressured and deposit cost remain somewhat elevated as a result of higher brokered deposit and CE balance.\nDuring the quarter, loan originations including credit renewals, maintained an average book to yield of 3.97%, which is lower than the third quarter of 2020 originations by approximately 7 basis points.\nAlthough interest bearing deposit costs declined by 5 basis points in the quarter, as we continue to lower customer deposit rates and return broker deposits where appropriate.\nWe expect that net interest income and net interest margin will remain pressured as overall market rates remain low, putting pressure on loan, held-for-sale yields and new production yields across the commercial portfolio and the competition could remain aggressive over the coming quarters.\nI'm moving to Page 9.\nTotal non-interest income for the fourth quarter of 2020 equated to $448 million.\nFourth quarter mortgage-related income and fees increased by $140 million versus the fourth quarter of 2019.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the environment in mortgage banking remained strong and our business outperformed our expectations in terms of origination volumes, principally driven by lower mortgage rates, which drove improved demand for both refinance and purchase mortgages.\nVersus the prior year quarter, purchase mortgages increased by $725 million or 25% and refinance volumes improved substantially, increasing by $1.7 billion or 116%.\nWhile volumes during the quarter were very strong, gain on sale margins also improved by 8 basis points to 448 basis points versus the third quarter of 2020.\nWhile we're expecting wholesale margins could be somewhat volatile during 2021, we expect full-year average margins to move within a range of 360 basis points to 385 basis points, contingent on market conditions.\nOther income increased by $31.5 million, driven primarily by improvements in sales and trading activities in both Capital Markets and Structured Finance businesses at Hilltop Securities.\nFavorable market conditions resulted in a 57% increase in TBA lock volumes versus the prior year period.\nThese businesses continue to realize the benefits of the investments we have been making to improve our securitized products, structuring, sales and distribution capabilities since the third quarter of 2018 and while we believe these investments will continue to provide ongoing benefits, it is important to recognize that these businesses can be volatile from period-to-period, as they are impacted by interest rates, overall market liquidity and production trends.\nTurning to Page 10.\nNon-interest expenses increased from the same period of the prior year by $94 million to $402 million.\nThe growth in expenses versus the prior-year were driven by an increase in variable compensation of approximately $79 million at HilltopSecurities and PrimeLending.\nThis increase in variable compensation was linked to strong fee revenue growth in the quarter, compared to prior year period.\nLooking forward, we expect that in 2021, our revenues will decline from the record levels of 2020, which will put pressure on our efficiency ratio.\nThat said, we remain focused on continuous improvement, leveraging the investments we've made over the last few years to aggressively manage fixed cost, while we continue to further streamline our businesses and accelerate our digital transformation.\nTurning to Page 11.\nTotal average HFI loans grew by 7% versus the fourth quarter of 2019.\nGrowth versus the same period in the prior year, was driven by growth in PPP loans, principally during the second quarter.\nEnd of period banking loans remained stable versus the prior year period, as commercial loan demand has remained tepid throughout the pandemic.\nAs we noted on our prior earnings call, we are planning to retain between $30 million and $50 million per month of consumer mortgage loans originated at PrimeLending, that have offset demand from our commercial clients, subject to market conditions.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, PrimeLending locked approximately $145 million of loans to be delivered to PlainsCapital over the coming months.\nThese loans had an average yield of 2.79% and average FICO and LTV of 780% and 62% respectively.\nMoving to Page 12.\nThis page highlights the ongoing work our banking and credit teams have been doing to support our clients throughout this pandemic.\nAs noted, as of 12/31/2020, Hilltop had approximately $240 million of loans on an active deferral program.\nThis represents a decline of 75% from the active deferrals of $630 million.\nIn total, this portfolio of loans carries an allowance for credit losses of 17.3% and is concentrated in our Hotel and Restaurant portfolios.\nIt is important to note, that we are managing this portfolio of clients and exposure, consistent with our existing credit policies and as a result, during the third and fourth quarters of 2020, the credit rating of these clients were reviewed and in many cases were adjusted to reflect the current financial situation for each of these borrowers.\nAs a result, of the $240 million of loans on active deferrals, $202 million are currently rated as criticized loans.\nWe remain focused on supporting our clients through the challenging times, while continuing to protect the Bank's capital.\nTurning to Page 13.\nDuring the quarter, net charge-offs equated to $2.7 million or 15 basis points of total HFI loan.\nAs is shown on the graph at the bottom right of the page, the allowance for credit loss coverage at the bank ended 2020 at 2.05%, including both mortgage warehouse lending, as well as PPP loans.\nWe continue to believe that both mortgage warehouse lending, as well as our PPP loans, will maintain lower loss content over time.\nExcluding mortgage warehouse and PPP loans, the Banks' allowance for credit loss to loans HFI ratio equates to 2.48%.\nTurning to Page 14.\nFourth quarter average total deposits were approximately $11.2 billion and have increased by $2.3 billion or 26% versus the fourth quarter of 2019.\nThroughout the pandemic, we've continued to experience abnormally strong deposit flows from our customers, driven by government stimulus efforts and shifting client behaviors, as customers remain cautious during these challenging times.\nDuring the fourth quarter, customer deposits grew by approximately $392 million from 9/30/2020.\nOffsetting this growth in the fourth quarter, was the return of an additional $200 million in HilltopSecurities sweep deposits and the maturity of $272 million of broker deposits, which we have and will continue to allow them to enroll over the coming quarters.\nAt 12/31, Hilltop maintained $731 million of broker deposits and maintain a blended yield of 44 basis points.\nOf these broker deposits, $469 million will mature by 6/30 of 2021.\nThese maturity broker deposit maintain an average yield of 40 basis points.\nWhile deposit levels continue to remain elevated, it should be noted that we remain focused on growing our client base and deepening wallet share through our treasury products and services.\nThese efforts have been successful in 2020 and we expect that they will continue to accelerate in 2021.\nI'm moving to Page 15.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, PlainsCapital Bank generated solid profitability producing $59 million of pre-tax income during the quarter.\nThe Bank benefited from the previously mentioned provision for credit losses recapture of $3.5 million and the recognition of $6.3 million of PPP dues.\nNon-interest expenses in the quarter reflect a writedowns on certain OREO assets of $3.8 million, which did cause the efficiency ratio to drift higher this period.\nThis year has presented a number of challenges for PlainsCapital, we were very pleased with the resiliency of our client and teammates across the business.\nAs Jeremy mentioned, the team delivered for our clients by providing approximately 2,800 PPP loans in 2020 and deferring payments for those customers that have been most impacted by the pandemic.\nThe work this year demonstrates a solid balance of customer support, while protecting the principle of the Bank and Hilltop.\nIn 2021, the team remains focused on providing great service to our client and delivering profitable growth, while maintaining a moderate risk profile.\nI'm moving to Page 16.\nPrimeLending generated pre-tax profit of $84 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by strong origination volumes that increased from the prior year by $2.4 billion or 54%.\nAs noted earlier, gain on sale margins expanded during the fourth quarter.\nIn previous calls, we discussed the retention of MSRs during the second and third quarters.\nThis continued during the fourth quarter and the MSR asset ended the year with a value of $144 million.\nThroughout the second half of 2020, we reduced our retention percentage of servicing rights on sold loans for 57%.\nWe expect to continue to retaining servicing assets at these levels during the first half of 2021, subject to market conditions and we will be looking to potentially execute bulk sales throughout the year, if market participation is robust.\n2020 reflects a record year for PrimeLending by almost all measures.\nWe are grateful for the teamwork and effort put forth across Hilltop and PrimeLending to deliver these outstanding results for our customers and our company.\nIn 2021, PrimeLending will remain focused on generating profitable mortgage volume and continue to execute on delivering operational efficiencies across the business.\nMoving to Page 17.\nHilltopSecurities delivered a pre-tax profit of $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by solid execution in Structured Finance, Capital Markets and Public Finance businesses, which have benefited from our ongoing investments in talent and infrastructure over the last few years and a constructive market backdrop.\nWhile activity was strong in the quarter, we continued to execute on our growth plan, investing in bankers and sales professionals across the business, to support additional product delivery, enhance our product offerings and deliver our differentiated solutions set to municipalities across the country.\nThis is highlighted in the fourth quarter in Public Finance Services, which was able to deliver net revenue growth of $8 million for 32% versus same period in the prior year, even as overall market issuance volumes declined.\nThe team at HilltopSecurities is focused on delivering profitable revenue growth, optimizing operating expenses, while managing market and liquidity risk within a moderate risk profile.\nTurning to Page 17.\nAs a result of the teams' work over the past few years, we were well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities the market presented, by leveraging our franchise and our enhanced infrastructure to serve customers, while keeping our teams and clients as safe as possible during some very challenging times and circumstances in 2020.\nIn 2021, we remain focused on remaining nimble, as the pandemic evolves, to ensure the safety of our teammates and our clients.\nFurther, our financial priorities for 2021 remains centered on delivering great customer service to our clients, attracting new customers to our franchise, supporting the communities where we serve, maintaining a moderate risk profile and delivering long-term shareholder value.\nGiven the current uncertainties in the marketplace, we are not providing specific financial guidance, but we are continuing to provide commentary as to our most current outlook for 2021, with the understanding of the business environment, including the impact of the pandemic, could remain volatile throughout the year.\nThat said, we will continue to provide further updates during our future quarterly calls.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:A playback of today's call will be archived on our Investor Relations website located at investors.\ndicks.com for approximately 12 months.\nAnd finally, a few admin items.\nFirst, a note on our same-store sales reporting practices.\nOur consolidated same-store sales calculation include stores that we temporarily closed last year as a result of COVID-19.\nThe method of calculating comp sales varies across the retail industry, including the treatment of temporary store closures because of COVID-19.\nAccordingly, our method of calculation might not be the same as other retailers.\nNext, as a reminder, due to the uneven nature of 2020, we planned 2021 off of the 2019 baseline.\nAccordingly, we will compare 2021 sales and earnings results against both 2019 and 2020.\nAnd lastly, for your future scheduling purposes, we are tentatively planning to publish our fourth quarter 2021 earnings results before the market opens on March 8, 2022, with our subsequent earnings call at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.\nWe're extremely pleased to announce another very strong quarter in which we delivered significant sales and earnings growth over both last year and 2019.\nOur strategies continue to work as we reimagine the athlete experience in our core business and with the new concepts.\nWe have driven strong profitable growth at DICK's.\nAnd earlier this year, we launched two DICK'S House of Sport stores, highly experiential destinations that are redefining sports retail.\nThe innovations we've made in our Golf Galaxy business are performing extremely well.\nAnd our second Public Land store recently opened, focusing on the outdoor activities.\nLooking ahead, I couldn't be more excited about the future of DICK's Sporting Goods.\nWe now expect to deliver comp sales of over 20% for 2021, and remain very confident in the long-term prospects of our business.\nBefore diving into our Q3 results, I think it's important to recognize that our current success is a result of a transformational journey that began in the back half of 2017 when we started to make meaningful changes across our business.\nWe also improved our service and selling culture, made our stores more experiential and reallocated floor space to regionally relevant and growing categories.\nThese changes fueled improved results and significantly improved our comp sales trajectory, well before the pandemic.\nFor years, we've also invested in technology and data science to build our best-in-class omnichannel platform.\nThis allowed us to quickly capitalize on athlete needs and strong consumer demand throughout 2020, and deliver our full-year comp sales increase of nearly 10%.\nWe announced today that we've raised our full-year guidance for the third time this year, and now expect our comp sales to increase between 24% and 25%.\nDuring a time when consumers are making lasting lifestyle changes with an increased focus on health and fitness and greater participation in outdoor activities, we believe that DICK's Sporting Goods has become synonymous with sport in the United States.\nNearly, our entire category portfolio has rebaselined meaningfully higher versus pre-COVID sales levels.\nWe've capitalized on strong consumer demand and have gained considerable market share in key categories, driven by enhanced product access, service, and omnichannel capabilities.\nLooking ahead, we are well positioned to continue gaining share and we remain optimistic about the long-term demand trends in our most important categories like athletic apparel, footwear, team sports and golf.\nWe also remain very optimistic about longer-term EBT margin, driven by a number of permanent changes versus pre-COVID levels.\nThese changes include a highly differentiated product assortment that is less susceptible to broader promotional pressures; more granular management in promotions and significantly higher profitability of our eCommerce channel.\nNow getting back to our Q3 results.\nConsolidated same-store sales increased 12.2% on top of a 23.2% increase in the same period of last year, and a 6% increase in Q3 2019.\nDriven by our strong sales and gross margin rate expansion, on a non-GAAP basis, our third quarter earnings per diluted share of $3.19, increased 59% over last year and 513% over Q3 2019.\nOur Q3 comps were supported by broad-based growth across our business, as our strong execution, diverse category portfolio and world-class omnichannel platform helped us continue to capitalize on and meet robust consumer demand despite a dynamic global supply chain.\nWe're continuing to see strong retention of the 8.5 million new athletes we acquired last year, and we added another 1.7 million new athletes during this quarter.\nOur active athlete database is at a record high.\nOur increasingly differentiated product assortment, combined with our disciplined promotional strategy and cadence is continuing to drive significantly higher merchandise margin rate.\nDuring the quarter, we expanded our merchandise margin rate by 301 basis points versus 2020 and by 578 basis points versus 2019.\nAs we discussed previously, we're focused on enhancing the athlete experience across our entire omnichannel ecosystem.\nIn our stores, we continue to make DICK's a great place to work, as we know that our people are our competitive differentiator and a great teammate experience drives a great athlete experience.\nIn fact, we recently earned a place on Fortune's list of Best Workplaces in Retail for 2021.\nWe're also engaging our athletes with new and elevated service standards and making our stores more experiential.\nThese strategies are working and continue to set us apart within the marketplace.\nDuring the quarter, our brick-and-mortar stores comped up approximately 15% versus last year and delivered a 31% sales increase when compared to 2019.\nImportantly, our stores continue to be the hub of our omnichannel strategy, enabling over 90% of our total sales and fulfilling approximately 70% of our online sales in Q3.\nMoving to our eCommerce business.\nDuring the quarter, we were pleased to deliver online sales growth of 1%, which was on top of a 95% increase in the same period last year.\nOur online sales remained substantially above pre-COVID levels, increasing nearly 100% when compared to the same period in 2019.\nImportantly, we also continue to drive a significant improvement in the profitability of our eCommerce channel by leveraging fixed costs, sustained athlete adoption of in-store pickup and curbside, as well as fewer and more targeted promotions.\nBeyond our omnichannel platform, our portfolio of brands is a tremendous asset.\nWe continue to invest substantially in our highly profitable and growing vertical brands.\nKey brands including DSG, CALIA and VRST are driving exclusivity within our assortment and gaining meaningful traction with our athletes.\nAt the same time, while many national brands continue to narrow distribution and focus more on their most strategic partners, DICK's offers them something unique and valuable.\nWe are rooted in sport and can showcase an entire brand of portfolio, including apparel, footwear and hard lines across our over 800 stores and online.\nOur brand partners continue to make significant investments in our business every year and provide us with increasing allocations of exclusive and differentiated products.\nThese top-of-the-line products are highly coveted and rarely promoted, driving significant sales and margin momentum.\nOur strategic partnerships with key brands have never been stronger, and we're making big bets with important brand partners.\nTo that end, we recently announced a groundbreaking new partnership with Nike that we see as truly transformative for the sports industry.\nThrough this collaboration, DICK'S and Nike will create unmatched value for our athletes through exclusive products, experiences, content and other specialized offers.\nTogether, we'll embrace our collective strengths and capabilities to expand our reach, connect with even more athletes and most importantly serve them better.\nOur companies have a long and successful history of working together, and this demonstrates a deepening of the DICK's and Nike relationship.\nThis partnership is aimed at driving growth for both companies, while serving our customers in a personalized way.\nAt DICK's, part of our strategy is to lead with mobile, and we're excited to launch this partnership through a connected marketplace exclusively in our DICK's mobile app.\nLooking ahead, we will explore additional opportunities to work with Nike and our other strategic partners across our respective physical and digital properties to further enhance convenience, experiences and content for our athletes.\nNow, I'd like to provide a few updates on our newest concept.\nFirst, we remain very pleased with our first 2 DICK's House of Sport stores in Rochester and Knoxville.\nHouse of Sport is built around experience, service, community and product, setting an unparalleled standard for sports retail and athlete engagement.\nMoving forward, we are excited to continue to refine and grow House of Sport, while pulling key learnings into the rest of the DICK's chain.\nWe're also excited by the early results of our first two Golf Galaxy performance centers located outside of Boston and Minneapolis, St Paul.\nGolf Galaxy Performance Center has been completely redesigned and equipped with TrackMan and BioMech golf technologies.\nWe've also invested in talent to ensure our teammates become trusted advisors to golf enthusiast of all levels.\nIn addition to innovating within our core business, we also launched Public Lands, a new omnichannel specialty concept to better serve outdoor athletes.\nOur first Public Lands store recently opened here in Pittsburgh, and our second store opened in Columbus just a few weeks ago.\nWe also launched publiclands.com, a complete eCommerce experience for the outdoor enthusiasts.\nWhile it's still early, Public Lands is off to a strong start and we are very enthusiastic about this growth opportunity and its goal to get more people outside, exploring and protecting Americas Public Lands.\nBefore concluding, I want to spend a moment on the supply chain.\nAmidst the very dynamic environment, our team has done an excellent job working with our vendor partners and with our vertical brand manufacturers to ensure a robust flow of product to meet strong demand.\nWe ordered aggressively to get ahead of this disruption and our quarter ending inventory levels increased 7.3% compared to the end of the same period last year.\nWhile there will continue to be inventory challenges across the marketplace, our fourth quarter is off to a strong start and we feel that we are well positioned within our industry this holiday season.\nIn closing, we have exciting growth opportunities ahead of us.\nAnd as Ed said, we are very confident in the longer-term prospects of our business.\nAs we continue to execute against our strategic priorities and reimagine the athlete experience, we believe the investments we've made to transform our business will strengthen our leadership position within the marketplace.\nOur teammates are at the center of this transformation.\nAfter joining the company in 2017 as SVP of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer, Navdeep was appointed to the CFO position last month.\nNavdeep's impact on our business has been phenomenal.\nOver the last four years, he has led most of the finance functions in the organization and he has become a trusted partner to our entire executive team.\nHe has also driven companywide productivity efforts, served on our long-term Strategic Committee and he played a really critical role in securing financing at the outset of COVID.\nPrior to DICK's, Navdeep spent 11 years at Advance Auto Parts in various leadership roles, most recently serving as Senior Vice President of Finance.\nEarlier in his career, Navdeep held a variety of management roles at Sprint Nextel and he served as a lieutenant in the Indian Navy.\nNavdeep's keen financial acumen and strategic vision will be instrumental to the continued growth and success of DICK's.\nAnd with that, Navdeep, it is my pleasure to hand it over to you.\nWith three quarters of the year now behind us, our consistent, strong results have demonstrated our ability to serve our athletes in a very differentiated way, while driving toward another record sales and earnings here in 2021.\nLet's begin with a brief review of our third quarter results.\nLike Lauren said, we are excited to report a consolidated sales increase of 13.9% to approximately $2.75 billion.\nConsolidated same-store sales increased 12.2% on top of a 23.2% increase in the same period last year, and a 6% increase in Q3 of 2019.\nOur strong comps were driven by growth across each of our three primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear, as well as an 8.5% increase in transaction and a 3.7% increase in average ticket.\nWhen compared to 2019, consolidated sales increased 40%.\nOur brick-and-mortar stores comped up approximately 15% versus 2020, and delivered a 31% sales increase when compared to 2019, with roughly the same square footage.\nOur eCommerce sales increased 1% versus last year on top of a 95% online sales increase in the third quarter of 2020.\nCompared to Q3 of 2019, our eCommerce sales increased 97%.\nAs a percent of total net sales, our online business has grown from 13% in 2019% to 19% in the current quarter.\neCommerce penetration was 21% last year.\nMoving to gross profit.\nGross profit in the third quarter was $1.06 billion, or 38.45% of net sales, and improved 354 basis points compared to last year.\nThis improvement was driven by merchandise margin rate expansion of 301 basis points and leverage on fixed occupancy costs of 111 basis points from sales increase.\nThe increase in merchandise margin was primarily driven by fewer promotions due to our increasingly differentiated assortment and disciplined promotional strategy, as certain categories in the marketplace continue to be supply constrained.\nWe also saw a favorable sales mix.\nIn addition, we were able to pass through selective price increases to help cover merchandise cost increases from higher supply chain and input costs.\nAs expected, these improvements were partially offset by higher freight costs resulting from global supply chain disruptions and our prioritization of inventory availability over costs.\nCompared to 2019, gross profit as a percent of net sales improved 886 basis points, driven by merchandise margin rate expansion of 578 basis points due to fewer promotions, as well as leverage on fixed occupancy costs of 370 basis points, which again was partially offset by higher freight costs.\nSG&A expenses were $631.9 million, or 23% of net sales, however, leveraged 151 basis points compared to last year due primarily to the increase in sales.\nSG&A dollars increased $40.8 million, due primarily to current year cost increases to support the growth in sales.\nIn the prior year quarter, SG&A included $43 million of COVID-related costs.\nHowever, in the current year, we transitioned our hourly teammates to compensation programs with a longer-term focus, including increasing and accelerating annual merit increases and higher wage minimums, partially offsetting last year's COVID-related costs.\nCompared to 2019 and on a non-GAAP basis, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales leveraged 325 basis points due primarily to the increase in sales.\nSG&A dollars increased $116.8 million due to increase in store payroll and operating expenses to support the increase in sales, as well as hourly wage rate investments.\nDriven by our strong sales and gross margin rate expansion, non-GAAP EBT was $415.6 million, or 15.12% of net sales, and increased $171.8 million, or 501 basis points from the same period last year.\nCompared to 2019, non-GAAP EBT increased $355.6 million, or approximately 1,200 basis points as a percentage of net sales.\nIn total, we delivered a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.19.\nThis compares to a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.01 last year, a 59% year-over-year increase, and a non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.52 in 2019, a 513% increase.\nOn a GAAP basis, our earnings per diluted share were $2.78.\nThis included $7.7 million in non-cash interest expense, as well as 12.8 million additional shares that we have designed to be offset by our bond hedge at settlement, but are required in the GAAP diluted share calculation.\nBoth of these are related to our convertible notes we issued in Q1 of 2020.\nNow looking to our balance sheet.\nWe are in a strong financial position, ending Q3 with approximately $1.37 billion of cash and cash equivalents, and no borrowings on our $1.855 billion revolving credit facility.\nOur quarter-end inventory levels increased 7.3% compared to end of Q3 last year.\nLooking ahead, we continue to aggressively chase product to meet demand and prioritize inventory availability over costs.\nAs part of this, we expect elevated freight expenses to continue at least in the fourth quarter and have included the impact of this within our outlook.\nTo reiterate Lauren's comment, while there will continue to be supply chain challenges across the marketplace, we feel that we are very well positioned within our industry this holiday season.\nTurning to our third quarter capital allocation.\nDuring the quarter, net capital expenditures were $54.1 million.\nWe paid $503 million in dividends, which included a special dividend of $5.50 per share that we announced last quarter.\nWe also repurchased 2.17 million shares of our stock for approximately $273 million at an average price of $125.80.\nWe have approximately $605 million remaining under our share repurchase program.\nYear-to-date, we have returned nearly $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nLooking ahead, we will continue to invest in the profitable growth of our business, while maintaining an appropriate level of cash on the balance sheet.\nReturning capital to shareholders will also continue to be an important component of our capital allocation strategy.\nNow, let me move on to our fiscal 2021 outlook for sales and earnings.\nWhile still early, Q4 is off to a strong start.\nTaking this into account, along with our significant Q3 results, an expectation of a continued strong consumer demand and our confidence in our ability to navigate the global supply chain challenges, we are raising our consolidated same-store sales guidance and now expect the full-year comp sales to increase by 20% to 25% compared to our prior expectation of up 18% to 20%.\nThis is on top of 9.9% increase in consolidated same-store sales last year and a 3.7% increase in 2019.\nAt the midpoint, our updated comp sales guidance represents a 39% sales increase versus 2019 compared to our prior expectation of up 33%.\nOn a non-GAAP EBT basis, we expect the full-year results to be in the range of $1.89 billion to $1.92 billion compared to our prior outlook of $1.61 billion to $1.67 billion, which at midpoint and on a non-GAAP basis is up 333% versus 2019 and up 160% versus 2020.\nAt the midpoint, non-GAAP EBT margin is expected to be approximately 15.7%.\nWithin this, gross margin is expected to increase versus both 2019 and 2020, driven by leverage on fixed expenses and higher merchandise margins.\nThis assumes higher freight costs and fewer promotions compared to both 2019 and 2020 for the fourth quarter.\nSG&A expenses is expected to leverage versus both 2019 and 2020, due to the significant projected increase in full-year sales.\nIn total, we are raising our full-year non-GAAP earnings per diluted share outlook to a range of $14.60 to $14.80, compared to our prior outlook of $12.45 to $12.95.\nAt the midpoint and on a non-GAAP basis, our updated earnings per share guidance is up 298% versus 2019 and up 140% versus 2020.\nIn closing, the work that we have done over the past several years to rearchitect our strategy, operations and financial, sets us up well to deliver improved value to our shareholders over the long term.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We all appreciate what a difficult year this has been.\nEven in the face of this incredible adversity, Stride has been able to thrive.\nWe've only been able to do so because of the commitment of our thousands of team members.\nThese folks have been dedicated to our customers and the families that need an alternative approach to education, now more than ever before.\nThis is also a year in which the country and the world took notice of online and distance learning in a mainstream way, but the experience is not always positive.\nAcross the country, many schools struggled with uncertainty and inconsistency for students and families, as they vacillated between online and in-person instruction.\nOur teachers, platforms, content and curriculum are all developed to meet this need.\n[Technical Issues] many have not embraced it.\nOthers realize its potential if done the right way.\nWe stand-alone, having served millions of students in our online bundle.\nAnd while many schools struggled with learning loss and deteriorating test scores, our result outpaced them in the phase of on-boarding a record number of families for our programs.\nI will get to how we are turning to this formula.\nFirst, I am going to review some of our fiscal 2021 accomplishment.\nBy almost any measure, we had a record year, by a long-shot.\nWe helped over a quarter of a million full-time learners and millions of other users became interested in our programs.\nLearning loss became the norm, except in the schools we managed.\nNo wonder the national data showed an overall enrollment decline of [Technical Issues].\nWe published our first ever ESG report backed by a number of key initiatives.\nA new partnership with National Association of Black Male Educators designed to increase the diversity of teachers across the country.\nA program with Teach for America to share practical online experience to student and teachers.\nOur We Stand Together College Scholarship, a $10 million multi-year commitment to support underrepresented students.\nBut we are not relying on the tailwinds of the pandemic to set our long-term path forward.\nWe rebranded our company from K12 to Stride to ensure that our name better reflects the commitment to providing educational opportunities for learners of all levels.\nWe acquired two high growth, higher margin companies to expand our adult Career Learning offers.\nWe held an Investor Day to outline our strategy and growth trajectory through fiscal year 2025, a trajectory that I believe we are well on track to hit and we raised almost $360 million through a convertible note offering to facilitate further investment in both organic and inorganic growth.\nIn our General Education business, we saw student enrollment increase by almost 50%.\nWith all the uncertainty this past year, we saw dramatic improvements in retention, in both our General Education as well as our Career Education business.\nAnd we did not see the mass withdrawal of students in the second half of the school year, as many states began to reopen their brick and mortar schools.\nThis is a testament to the stickiness and value propositions of our programs.\nAs we've mentioned previously, students who enrolled in our Career Learning programs tend to retain at a higher level than our General Education students and we believe this trend will continue.\nWe also had a record number of reregistration families, indicating that they will be returning for the fall.\nOur Career Learning business finished the year with over $250 million in revenue.\nThis is an increase from less than $10 million just four years ago, a 150% compounded annual growth.\nThis year, we saw a growth of over 125% to almost 30,000 students.\nThese programs offer a career path without the need for expensive college degree.\nAnd we're increasing the programs from our MedCerts acquisition that we will offer the high school students the certificates in the healthcare industry.\nBoth our MedCerts and Tech Elevator acquisitions continue to grow and contribute to the bottom line and are exceeding our expectations from when we purchased.\nThey are high growth, high margin market opportunity platforms for us that we will continue to leverage into other areas of our business, particularly our high school programs.\nWe will continue our focus on IT and healthcare training because these industries are projected to add more than 2.5 million new positions in the US by 2029.\nOn the other hand, our Galvanize acquisition has not performed according to our plan.\nWe've restructured this business and believe we now have a glide path to both renewed growth and profitability heading into next year.\nWe will also look for ways to invest behind and expand our adult learning offerings with a lens for making Career Learning a $1 billion plus business.\nIn June, we released our inaugural ESG initiatives report.\nAs an Education and Career Learning company, we have a significant opportunity to help achieve global education, workforce and diversity and inclusion goals.\nAll of our ESG initiatives are based on the four cornerstones; extending lifelong learning for today's competitive workforce; supporting racial and socio-economic equity and inclusion; fostering transparent leadership, governance and professional development; and contributing to a more sustainable world.\nFor me, our focus on learning outcomes is the most important aspect of all our ESG efforts.\nStride is in a unique position to influence the lives of millions of students of all ages.\nNot many of our companies have that kind of impact or carry that responsibility.\nWe don't take that responsibility lightly.\nBy now, everyone is aware of the significant shortages impacting the workforce.\nStride is well-positioned to help alleviate that shortage.\nTo that end, we have set 10-year goals that are driven by learner outcomes.\nSo by 2030, our goals are to graduate over 100,000 students from our Stride career high school program, to graduate hundreds of thousands of students from our adult programs, and to achieve leading graduation of learning growth rates for over a million students.\nOur report contains a lot more specific information on our ESG efforts.\nI encourage everyone to read it.\nNow I want to turn to fiscal year '22.\nThe long-term trends, prospects for our General Education and Career Learning businesses, both remain tremendous.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has raised consumer awareness around the need for and the benefits of online education in grades K through 12 and in adult learning.\nWhile it doesn't work for everyone, many students and families have realized that online learning and the flexibility it provides is a preferred alternative.\nIncreased awareness and openness to different options to meet educational needs fundamentally provides for a long-term tailwind for all aspects of our business.\nAs we do every year, we will try to provide formal fiscal '22 guidance during our first quarter earnings call in October.\nSo while we're not providing guidance right now, I do want to provide some insights into how the current enrollment season is trending.\nEven now in August, we're still less than halfway through the volume of our typical enrollment season.\nAnd this means that these trends could shift in the coming weeks.\nAdditionally, the pandemic has increased uncertainty around all these metrics, so please do not extrapolate what I am about to say.\nWe have not seen the massive return to brick and mortar school [Technical Issues].\nWe are currently exceeding the number of reregistrations that we saw during fiscal '21 and in previous years.\nRight now, we're well ahead of where we would be normally in enrollments versus pre-pandemic levels.\nAwareness for our offerings is at an all-time high, the pandemic helped to drive awareness [Technical Issues] and now they just need to choose.\nConversion rates from our new leads are an all-time high.\nSo when families seek us out, they're more likely to enroll.\nWe believe that health and safety continue to be top priority for families and we're seeing that and we're seeing even stronger demand in states where the Delta variant has surged.\nOur goal is clear, is to grow every year and importantly, we remain on track to achieving the long-term revenue and profitability targets that we outlined during the Investor Day last fall.\nWe still anticipate achieving revenue of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion, adjusted operating income of $250 million to $350 million by the year 2025.\nNow I'll hand the call over to Tim to discuss our full year 2021 results.\nFirst, let me recap our reported results.\nRevenue for the full fiscal year 2021 was $1.54 billion, an increase of 48% over the prior fiscal year.\nAdjusted operating income was $161.4 million, up 160% compared to the prior year.\nCapital expenditures were $52.3 million, an increase of $7.3 million over last year.\nIn each case, these results met or beat the expectations we provided in our guidance last quarter.\nThe outperformance was primarily driven by favorable revenue for enrollment and retention.\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2022, it is still too early to confidently forecast our current date enrollments for the reasons James just outlined.\nGiven where we are in the process, there remains variability around two key factors; firstly, ongoing reregistration and new enrollments and secondly, the retention of these enrollments once school starts and through the month of September.\nNow here's what I can say today about fiscal year 2022.\nWe expect to grow adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA year-over-year compared to our strong fiscal year 2021 results.\nFurthermore, we believe that the increased awareness and acceptance of online and hybrid education accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic has sustainably reset the baseline for the General Education business.\nTherefore, we are confident that General Education revenue in fiscal year 2022 will be significantly larger than it was in fiscal year 2020.\nAs we have done in the past, we will refrain from providing guidance until we report our first quarter fiscal 2022 results in October.\nBy that time, we will have much greater visibility into enrollments for the new school year.\nReturning to our results for fiscal year 2021.\nRevenue from our General Education business increased $346 million or 37% to $1.28 billion.\nThis is due primarily to higher enrollments, partially offset by lower revenue per enrollment.\nGeneral ed enrollments rose 45% year-over-year to more than 156,000, while revenue per enrollment declined 5%.\nThe decline in revenue per enrollment was due primarily to state budgetary pressures, resulting from COVID-19 and a higher mix of lower funded states.\nAs we stated last quarter, we expect revenue per enrollment to improve next year, given what we know today about state budgets and policy.\nCareer Learning revenue rose to $256.6 million in FY '21, an increase of 140%.\nThis growth was driven by significantly higher volumes in our Stride Career Prep Programs, as well as organic growth and new acquisitions in our adult learning businesses.\nWe expect to continue growing our Stride Career Prep Programs in FY '22 with plans to open four new programs and expand eight existing programs in FY '22.\nGross margins were 34.8%, up 140 basis points compared to fiscal 2020, driven by an increased contribution from the higher margin adult learning businesses and lower costs from efficiencies and automation initiatives.\nWe expect margin improvement to continue into fiscal 2022.\nWe are confident that we will achieve our 36% to 39% gross margin targets much sooner than fiscal 2025, which was our original target communicated during our November 2020 Investor Day.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $424.4 million, up 35% from fiscal 2020.\nThe increase in SG&A was driven primarily by higher costs associated with our enrollment growth and increase in stock-based compensation expense and the annualization of expenses for our adult learning businesses.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $239.9 million reflects an increase of 87% over FY '20.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin improved 400 basis points from 12% of revenue in FY '20 to 16% in FY '21.\nThe margin improvement and growth in adjusted EBITDA are driven by higher revenue and improved operating leverage.\nStock-based compensation expense came in at $39.3 million, up 67% year-over-year, driven by the timing of certain stock-based grants tied to our Career Learning business.\nWe currently expect stock-based compensation expense to decline to a range of $30 million to $34 million in FY '22.\nInterest expense totaled $18 million for fiscal 2021, in line with the expectations we provided last quarter.\nThis consisted of approximately $5 million in cash interest and $13 million in non-cash amortization of the discount in fees on our convertible senior notes.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we early adopted new accounting guidance related to our convertible notes.\nThis will result in the elimination of the non-cash debt discount expense among other impacts.\nAs such, we expect our interest expense in FY '22 to be materially lower and more in line with the cash interest we recognized in FY '21.\nOur full year tax rate for FY '21 was 26%, below the guidance range we provided last quarter.\nWe had some positive tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and had the effect of lowering our tax rate for the year.\nIn FY '22, we anticipate an increase in non-deductible compensation that will cause our tax rate to be closer to the 28% to 30% range.\nCapital expenditures for the year totaled $52.3 million, up 16% from the prior year, due mainly to higher capitalized software development costs associated with adult learning, automation and improvements to our platforms.\nCapex, as a percent of revenue was 3.4% and that is lower than our historical average of approximately 4% to 5% over the past few years.\nFree cash flow defined as cash from operations less capex totaled $81.9 million for FY 2021.\nThis was approximately $45 million below the expectations provided at Investor Day last November due entirely to the timing of receipts, which drove lower than expected cash from operations.\nSome of the timing issues were associated with our growth in states that regularly pay in the following year and some were related to delayed payments due to COVID.\nIn fiscal 2022, we expect to have significantly higher free cash flow, reflecting these timing issues from fiscal 2021.\nFinally, we ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $386.1 million, an increase of $173.8 million compared to the same period a year ago.\nWe believe that our strong free cash flow generation and liquidity will continue to provide the financial flexibility to fund our existing operations and pursue strategic acquisitions.\nTo summarize, fiscal 2021 was a landmark year for Stride.\nWe saw record enrollments in both our General Ed and Career Learning businesses, which drove double-digit growth in revenue, adjusted operating income, and adjusted EBITDA.\nOur Career Learning assets, which accounted for less than $7 million of revenue four years ago, generated over a quarter billion dollars in revenue during the year, a sign of the tremendous demand for Career Education offerings, and Stride's innovation and leading position within this market.\nIn addition, we continue to improve our margin profile and bolster our cash and liquidity position while maintaining a low level of indebtedness.\nAs James mentioned, we could not be more excited about the prospects for our business and we'll continue to execute on our high growth, career learning strategy and margin expansion initiatives.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These statements are not guarantees of future performance and therefore you should not place undue reliance upon them.\nAlso, our discussion today may include references to certain non-GAAP measures.\nI'm joined today by Harp Rana, our chief financial officer.\nFollowing our strong performance in the second half of last year, we carried forward the momentum into 2021.\nIn the first quarter, we generated record bottom-line results of 25.5 million of net income and $2.31 of diluted EPS.\nOur growth initiatives helped to reduce our typical first-quarter seasonal liquidation and the impact of new stimulus payments, which in turn drove strong revenue performance.\nAt the same time, we maintained a superior credit profile with historically low 30-plus day delinquencies.\nDespite pressure from a combination of tax refunds and two stimulus payments in the quarter, our core small and large loan portfolio grew by $18 million, or 2%, over the prior-year period, and was down only $28 million, or 2.5%, quarter over quarter.\nThis strong result was driven, in part, by the new growth initiatives that we implemented in 2020, which continued to perform very effectively.\nWe originated $231 million of loans in the quarter, up 1% year over year and up 5% from the first quarter of 2019, with 29 million [Inaudible] originated loans derived from new growth initiatives.\nThe second round of $600 stimulus checks appeared to have been spent relatively quickly.\nThe third round of $1,400 stimulus checks led to a temporary period of higher loan payment activity along with some weakening of loan demand.\nAs a result, while the stimulus payments impacted first-quarter demand, the overall impact on our typical first-quarter seasonal loan portfolio liquidation was much lower than we expected and much lower than what some others in our industry and in the prime credit space experienced.\nOur large loan portfolio actually grew sequentially in the first quarter by $4 million or 0.6% as the stimulus measures disproportionately impacted our higher-rate small loan portfolio.\nLoan demand remained relatively soft in April due to the impact of the distribution of the remaining 20% of stimulus payments along with additional tax refunds.\nHowever, we saw demand start to pick up in the latter part of April, and we expect demand to continue to rebound in May and June, which should enable us to generate modest loan growth in the second quarter.\nWe continue to believe that loan demand in the second half of the year will be strong as the economy more fully reopens.\nCredit quality continued to remain very solid in the quarter, and our balance sheet remains robust.\nOur net credit loss rate during the quarter was 7.7%, a 280 basis points improvement from the prior-year period.\nAnd we ended the quarter with a record-low, 30-plus day delinquency rate of 4.3%, a 230 basis points improvement from the end of March of 2020.\nAs of April 30, our 30-plus day contractual delinquency rate further improved to approximately 3.7%.\nWe expect that our credit performance will continue to be strong throughout 2021.\nAny COVID-related net credit losses will occur in late 2021 at the earliest, though we anticipate that our delinquency rate will begin to normalize throughout the balance of the year as the benefits of federal stimulus dissipate.\nGiven our continued superior credit performance, we released $6.6 million in COVID-19 reserves in the first quarter and $3.8 million of additional reserves as a result of the seasonal runoff in the portfolio.\nour 139.6 million allowance for credit losses as of March 30 first continues to compare quite favorably to our 30-plus day contracts of delinquency of 47.7 million.\nOur allowance includes a 23.8 million reserve for additional credit losses associated with COVID-19.\nWe remain conservative in our maintenance with COVID reserves as the overall economy has not yet fully recovered from the pandemic.\nWe also continue to further strengthen our overall balance sheet and liquidity position.\nIn April, we enhanced our warehouse facility capacity by closing on two new warehouse facilities with our current lenders, Wells Fargo and Credit Suisse, and by adding a third warehouse facility with a new lender JPMorgan.\nWhile our prior facility only funded large loans, the new facilities fund multiple collateral types, including small loans, large loans, convenience checks, and digitally originated loans.\nWe are very pleased with this outcome.\nIt represents yet another step in the evolution of our capital structure as we continue to pursue new avenues of funding diversification and additional capacity to support our business growth plans and our capital return program.\nTo that end, we are happy to announce an increase of our quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.25 per share.\nIn addition, in May, we completed a $30 million stock repurchase program that began in the fourth quarter of 2020, having repurchase, in total, 951,841 shares at a weighted average price of $31.52 per share.\nOur board of directors recently authorized a new $30 million stock repurchase program, which we plan to commence later this month.\nOur outstanding performance and financial results over the past year have enabled us to maintain and expand an attractive capital return program for our shareholders.\nAs we discussed on our last call, 2021 is a year of investment in our long-term growth.\nWe remain focused on investing in our digital capabilities to complete our omnichannel model, geographic expansion into new states, and new product and channel development to drive additional long-term growth.\nIn the first quarter, we completed development of and began testing our improved digital pre-qualification experience for our customers.\nDigitally sourced originations represented 33% of our total new borrower branch volume in the first quarter and 25% of all branch originations we bought remotely in March.\nWe are very pleased to see the success of our digital and technological investments, and the adoption of our expanding omnichannel model by our customers.\nIn the second and third quarters, we expect to roll out the new prequalification experience to all our states and to begin integrating the new functionality with our existing and new digital affiliates and lead generators.\nIn addition, within the next few months, we will begin testing a new guaranteed loan offer program, which is an alternative to our convenience check loan product and offers online settlement with ACH funding into a customer's bank account.\nWe also remain on track to be in testing our end-to-end digital origination products for new and existing customers later this year.\nAnd by the first quarter of 2022, we expect to roll out an improved online customer portal and the mobile app.\nAs we communicated previously, we entered Illinois, our 12th state, in mid-April and are excited to begin offering our valuable loan products to millions of new consumers in the state.\nWe plan to open 15 to 20 net new branches in 2021.\nWe also expect to enter up to two additional states by the end of 2021 and an additional four to six states over the next 18 months.\nOur geographic expansion will be supported by our digital and new growth initiatives, allowing our branches in these states to maintain a wider geographic reach, resulting in higher average receivables per branch and the need for fewer branches.\nOur digital investments and geographic expansion will also offer new products to our customers including our new auto secured product which we began testing in the first quarter, and we expect to roll out to all our states by the end of the third quarter.\nWe are very excited about the rest of this year and what the future holds for our franchise.\nWe will continue to invest throughout the year and our growth initiatives while maintaining our focus on credit quality and optimizing our overall underwriting capabilities.\nAs of March 31, approximately 70% of our total portfolio had been originated since April 2020.\nThe vast majority of which was subject to enhance credit standards that we deployed following the outset of the pandemic.\nOur credit performance and underwriting capabilities continue to be foundational to our operational success and provide us with confidence as we pursue our long-term growth strategies.\nWe could not be happier with our first-quarter performance, which is a testament to the strength and dedication of the entire regional team.\nWe remain fully committed to our customers and our path forward, and we are in a prime position to generate strong top and bottom-line growth for the full year.\nAs we execute on our priorities this year, we are also looking ahead to 2022 and beyond.\nWe are focused on our key strategic initiatives of digital innovation, geographic expansion, and the development of new products and channels, all of which will allow us to gain market share and create sustainable, long-term value for our shareholders.\nLet me take you through our first-quarter results in more detail.\nWe generated net income of 25.5 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.31, resulting from our growth initiatives, stable operating expenses, lower funding costs, and strong credit.\nAs illustrated on Page 4, branch originations were comparable to prior year as we ended first quarter, originating 169.7 million of loans.\nMeanwhile, we grew direct mail and digital origination by 9% year over year to 61.7 million.\nOur total originations were 231.4 million, 1% higher on a year-over-year basis and 5% higher than the first quarter of 2019 despite two rounds of government stimulus payments in the first quarter.\nOur new growth initiative [00:13:13.23] [Inaudible] 29 million of first quarter origination.\nPage 5 displays our portfolio growth and mixed trends through March 31.\nWe closed the quarter with net finance receivables of 1.1 billion, up 3 million from the prior-year period as we continue to successfully execute on our new growth initiatives and marketing efforts.\nOur core loan portfolio grew 18 million, or 1.7%, from the prior year and decreased only 2.5% from the end of the fourth quarter, in line with normal seasonal liquidation despite the two rounds of government stimulus.\nSmall loans decreased 8% quarter over quarter due to the disproportionate impact of the stimulus payments on this portfolio, while large loans grew slightly at 0.6% versus the fourth quarter of 2020.\nFor the second quarter, as Rob noted, we expect some trailing impact from the third round of stimulus and tax refunds due to the extended tax season in April, followed by a rebound in demand this month and next.\nOverall, we expect to see modest quarter-over-quarter growth in our finance receivables portfolio in the second quarter.\nOn Page 6, we show our digitally sourced originations, which were 33% of our new borrower volume in the first quarter.\nAnother high watermark for us.\nThis demonstrates our commitment to meeting the needs of our customers and serving them through our omnichannel strategy.\nDuring the first quarter, large loans were 64% of our digitally sourced originations.\nTurning to Page 7, total revenue grew 2% to 97.7 million.\nInterest in field increased 10 basis points year over year, primarily due to improved credit performance across the portfolio as a result of the government stimulus, tightened underwriting during the pandemic, and our overall mix shift toward higher credit quality customers.\nThis resulted in fewer loans in nonaccrual status and fewer interest accrual reversals, offset in part by the continued product mix shift toward lower yielding large loans.\nSequentially, interest in field and total revenue yield decreased 80 and 90 basis points, respectively.\nDue to a combination of seasonality, our continued portfolio mix shift to larger loans, and the second stimulus payment, which is noted previously, had a disproportionate impact on our small loan runoff in the first quarter.\nAs of March 31, 65% of our portfolio were large loans and 81% of our portfolio had an APR at or below 36%.\nIn the second quarter, we expect total revenue yield to be approximately 30 basis points lower than the first quarter, and our interest in field to be approximately 20 basis points lower due to the impact that the third and largest stimulus payment is expected to have on our higher-yielding small loan portfolio.\nMoving to Page 8, our net credit loss is 7.7% for the first quarter, a 280-basis-point improvement year over year, while delinquencies remain at historically low levels.\nNet credit loss is roughly 80 basis points from the fourth quarter.\nThis is due to normal seasonal increases of NPLs in the first quarter, but the rate of increase of 80 basis points in frst quarter was below the 150 and 180 basis point seasonal increases that we experienced in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDue to government stimulus improving economic conditions and our lower delinquency levels, any COVID-related losses will occur in late 2021 at the earliest.\nAs a result, we expect that our full-year net credit loss rate will be approximately 8%.\nOur 30-plus day delinquency levels as of March 31 was a record 4.3%, a 230 basis point improvement from the prior year and 100 basis points lower than December 31.\nAt the end of April, we saw 30-plus day delinquencies dropped further to a record low of approximately 3.7%.\nMoving forward, we expect 30-plus day delinquencies to gradually rise off the April low to more normal levels.\nTurning to Page 10, we ended the fourth quarter with an allowance for credit losses of 150 million or 13.2% of net finance receivables.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, the allowance decreased by 10.4 million to 12.6% of net finance receivables.\nThe decrease in reserves, including the base reserve release of 3.8 million from portfolio liquidation and a COVID-19 reserve release of 6.6 million.\nAs a reminder, going forward, as our portfolio grows, we will build additional reserves to support this new growth.\nAt the moment, the severity and the duration of our macro assumptions remain relatively consistent with our fourth-quarter model, including an assumption that the unemployment rate will be below 10% at the end of 2021.\nWe will review these assumptions every quarter to reflect changing macro conditions as the economy begins to rebound.\nOur 139.6 million allowance for credit losses as of March 31 continues to compare very favorably toward 30-plus day contractual delinquency of 47.7 million.\nWe remain confident that we remain sufficiently reserved.\nLooking to Page 11, G&A expenses for the first quarter of 2021 were 45.8 million, an improvement of 0.4 million or 0.9% from the prior-year period.\nPrimarily driven by reductions in executive transition costs and operating costs related to COVID-19, partially offset by an increase in personnel expenses, marketing expenses, and investment in digital and technological capabilities to support our new growth initiatives and omnichannel strategy.\nOur operating expense ratio was 16.3% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 16.5% in the prior-year period.\nOn a sequential basis, our G&A expense rose 1 million, in line with our expectations due to lower deferred loan origination costs and fewer seasonal loan originations in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter.\nOverall, we expect G&A expenses for the second quarter to be approximately 2.2 million higher than the first quarter.\nWe expect to further ramp up investments in the back half of 2021 as we continue to invest in digital capabilities to complete our omnichannel model, geographic expansion into new states, and new products and channels to drive additional long-term growth.\nThese investments will help drive our receivables growth and lead to improved operating leverage over the longer term.\nTurning the Page 12, interest expense was 7.1 million in the first quarter of 2021 and 2.6% of our average net finance receivables.\nThis was a 100 basis point improvement year over year and 3 million, or 30%, lower than in the prior-year period.\nThe improved cost of funds was driven by lower interest rate environment, improved funding costs from our recent securitization transactions, and a favorable 785,000 mark-to-market increase in value this quarter on our interest rate cap.\nWe currently have 400 million of interest rate caps to protect us against rising rates on our variable priced funding, which as of the end of the first quarter, totaled 193 million.\nWe purchased 100 of additional interest rate caps in the first quarter to take advantage of the favorable rate environment.\nWe purchased a total of 300 million of interest rate caps since the beginning of the pandemic at a LIBOR strike price range of 25 to 50 basis points.\nAs rates fluctuate, the value of these hedges will be marked to market accordingly.\nLooking ahead, normalizing for the hedge impact in the first quarter, we expect interest expense in the second quarter to be approximately 8.5 million.\nOur effective tax rate during the first quarter was 24%, compared to a tax rate of 36% in the prior-year period.\nFor 2021, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 25%.\nPage 13 is a reminder of our strong funding profile.\nOur first-quarter funded debt-to-equity ratio remained at a very conservative 2.7-1.\nWe continue to maintain a very strong balance sheet with low leverage and 140 million in loan loss reserves.\nAs of March 31, we had 573 million of unused capacity on our credit facilities and 207 million of available liquidity, consisting of unrestricted cash and immediate availability to draw down our credit facility.\nAnd as Rob noted earlier, we recently enhanced our warehouse facility, capacity closing on three new warehouse facilities with our current lenders, Wells Fargo, and Credit Suisse, and adding JPMorgan to our roster of lenders.\nOur total warehouse capacity has expanded by 175 million to 300 million, and the average term on the new warehouse is approximately 22, roughly a four-month extension from the prior facility.\nAs of April 30th, we had 758 million of unused capacity on our credit facilities, providing us with even more capacity to fund our operations, our ambitious growth plans, and our capital return program.\nIn the first quarter, the company repurchased 352,183 of its common stock at a weighted average price of $33.57 per share.\nunder the company's 30 million stock repurchase program.\nThe company completed the 30 million stock repurchase program in May, having repurchased in total 951,841 of its common stock at a weighted average price of $31.52 per share.\nAs Rob noted earlier, the company's board of directors has declared a dividend of $0.25 per common share for the second quarter of 2021.\nThe dividend is 25% higher than the prior quarters' dividend and will be paid on June 15, 2021, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 26, 2021.\nIn addition, as Rob mentioned earlier, we are pleased to announce that our board of directors has approved a new 30 million stock repurchase program.\nOverall, we are very happy with our top and bottom-line performance, resilient balance sheet, ability to turn excess capital to our shareholders, and our prospects for strong growth.\nThat concludes my remarks.\nIn summary, it was an excellent first quarter for Regional, as our omnichannel operating model, new growth initiatives, and superior credit profile contributed to record performance.\nWe're excited to execute on our key strategic initiatives, which will position us to sustainably grow our business for years to come and ensure that our customers continue to receive the first-class experience they have come to expect.\nThrough our long-term investments in digital innovation, entering new markets and developing new products and channels, we are positioned to expand our market share and create additional value for our shareholders.\nOperator, could you please open the line?\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We appreciate you joining us for our 2020 year-end earnings call today.\nWith me as usual are Joe Bergstein, our chief financial officer; Greg Dudkin, the head of our Pennsylvania utility business; Paul Thompson, the head of our Kentucky utility business; and Phil Swift, who heads up our U.K. utility business.\nMoving to Slide 3.\nI'll also share a few updates on regulatory and ESG matters.\nLater, Joe will provide a more detailed overview of year-end and fourth-quarter financial results.\nI'll then share some closing thoughts on our key focus areas for 2021.\nTurning to Slide 4.\nI'm incredibly proud of how PPL performed in 2020, a year unlike any we've seen in our lifetimes.\nIt was a year that tested our resolve, our resilience and our ability to adapt very quickly to dynamic conditions.\nImportantly, we provided electricity and natural gas safely and reliably to more than 10.5 million customers when it mattered the most.\nThis included the hospital workers and the first responders who were on the front lines.\nAnd it included customers whose homes became offices, whose kitchens and bedrooms became classrooms and who were counting on us to deliver without fail.\nWe're extremely honored that our continued operational excellence resulted in further recognition from these very same customers in 2020.\nThis included topping all large utilities in the east for the ninth straight year for residential customer satisfaction and all mid-sized utilities in the Midwest for both residential and business customer satisfaction.\nIn the U.K., at the end of 2020, we again finished with scores of over nine out of ten in all four of our DNOs and are on track to receive the maximum incentive reward under Ofgem's broad measure of customer satisfaction.\nWe also received the U.K.'s customer service excellence award for the 28th time since 1992.\nAs we focused on our commitment to provide a superior customer experience, we also recognized the need to support our local communities and assist customers struggling with COVID-19.\nWith that in mind, we continued to offer payment assistance programs, flexible payment options and referral services to help customers manage their energy bills.\nShifting to our financial performance.\nWe achieved financial results that are within our original earnings guidance range, despite the challenges of COVID-19.\nThis achievement included overcoming a $0.12 per share unfavorable impact from COVID, due primarily to low sales volumes in the U.K. and lower commercial and industrial demand in Kentucky, as well as a $0.05 per share unfavorable impact due to mild weather compared to normal conditions.\nWe were able to offset some of the impact through effective cost management and several other factors without negatively impacting the long-term strength of the business.\nregulatory construct provides recovery for any under-collected revenues from lower sales volumes, which was a significant portion of the 2020 impact.\nWe also maintained a strong financial position and delivered on our commitment to return capital to share owners, something PPL has done each quarter for 75 consecutive years.\nTurning to Slide 5.\nAs we dealt with the challenges of COVID-19 during the year, we also remained very focused on the future.\nBuilding on the $27 billion we had invested over the prior decade to improve service to our customers, during 2020, we completed more than $3 billion in infrastructure improvement, in line with the original expectations we outlined for you at the beginning of the year.\nThe vast majority of this investment, nearly 90%, was focused on transmission and distribution infrastructure to strengthen grid resilience, incorporate new technology and advance our clean energy strategy.\nShifting to a few sustainability highlights.\nWe continued to advance our clean energy strategy in 2020.\nAt the outset of the year, we set a more aggressive carbon reduction goal.\nAnd throughout the remainder of the year, we invested in our networks to enable increased electrification and large-scale additions of distributed energy resources in the future.\nIn Kentucky, we secured regulatory approval for a 100-megawatt solar power purchase agreement to meet increasing customer demand for clean energy solutions.\nWe also continued to expand customer participation in our Solar Share Program, securing full subscription for two additional phases of Solar Share construction that will begin this spring.\nIn addition, our Safari Energy business also added more than 90 megawatts of solar capacity to its portfolio, increasing its own capacity to 110 megawatts.\nThis new capacity is all contracted via long-term power purchase agreements.\nAnd in August, we joined a five-year industry initiative to accelerate the development of low-carbon energy technology and advance affordable pathways to economywide decarbonization.\nWe recognize that going even further, faster than the goals that we've set to address climate change requires new ideas, technology and systems that can be delivered safely, reliably and affordably.\nThat's why we're partnering with EPRI and GTI on their new Low-Carbon Resources Initiative.\nAs part of our sustainability efforts, we also remained focused on advancing a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion across PPL and supporting meaningful change in progress in the communities we serve.\nTo build on PPL's prior momentum in this area, the company adopted a new enterprisewide DEI strategy with five supporting DEI commitments.\nIn the wake of the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others in 2020, PPL led focused discussions with our employees and in our communities on race and social justice that will continue to guide our efforts moving forward.\nIn addition, we provided initial contributions to support local organizations focused on DEI initiatives and launched a new scholarship program that aims to award $1 million over the next decade to support minorities and females pursuing careers in engineering, IT, technical and trade roles.\nAs a reflection of PPL's continuous focus on embracing diversity, inclusion and advancing equity for all, we were named a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ equality by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, once again earning a perfect score.\nLastly, on this slide, I would note that we continued to enhance our ESG disclosures in 2020, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to transparency, and to keeping stakeholders informed.\nThis included our disclosures around political spending, an area in which the Center for Political Accountability and the Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research gave PPL their Trendsetter ranking on the CPA-Zicklin Index.\nTurning to Slide 6 for some regulatory updates.\nIn November, we took steps at our Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities businesses to support continued infrastructure investments that benefit our customers.\nLG&E and KU filed rate requests with the Kentucky Public Service Commission on November 25, seeking approval for a combined revenue increase of about $331 million in electricity and gas base rates.\nThe requested increases will support continued modernization of the grid to strengthen grid resilience, as well as upgrades to LG&E's natural gas system to enhance safety and reliability.\nIn addition, we are seeking approval for full deployment of advanced metering infrastructure, faster electric vehicle charging stations and an updated net metering tariff.\nIf approved by the Commission, LG&E and KU's requested revenue increases would take effect July 1, 2021.\nGiven the COVID pandemic and in an effort to reduce the near-term impact of the rate adjustment for our customers, we sought to minimize the size of the requested increase and have included in our request for approval a $53 million economic relief surcredit to help mitigate the impact of the rate adjustment until mid-2022.\nIn addition, we have proposed to implement AMI in a manner, which based on current projections will not require an increase in the combined revenue of LG&E and KU in this rate case or in the future as operating cost savings are projected to more than offset the incremental capital cost of the project.\nAdditionally, pending the outcome of the proceeding, it's our goal not to request another base rate adjustment for several years.\nIn other notable Kentucky updates, LG&E and KU on January 7 issued a request for proposal for generation capacity to meet a potential energy shortfall that may be created by the anticipated retirements of 1,000 megawatts of coal-fired generation during this decade.\nBrown Unit 3 are expected to be retired by 2028 as they reach the end of their economic useful lives.\nWe've also included in the appendix a slide that details the projected economic lives with our baseload generation plan.\nThe utilities are seeking 300 to 900 megawatts of capacity beginning in 2025 to 2028.\nAdditionally, we're asking for proposals for at least 100 megawatts of battery storage.\nProposals are due March 31, and we anticipate making a decision by mid-2021 and potentially filing for regulatory approvals in early 2022.\nLastly, in the U.K., Ofgem issued its RIIO-ED2 sector-specific methodology decision in mid-December.\nThe decision was largely in line with our expectations and underscores the vital role DNOs will play in supporting decarbonization in the U.K. to achieve a net zero economy.\nIn January, WPD became the first DNO to issue a draft business plan for RIIO-ED2.\nThat draft plan proposes GBP 6 billion in new investments to support decarbonization, digitalization and enhanced network utilization.\nTurning to Slide 7 and the 2021 to 2025 capital plan.\nWe've outlined more than $14 billion from 2021 to 2025 to support continued modernization of our transmission and distribution networks and to advance a cleaner energy future.\nThis forecast spending represents $1 billion of incremental capex from 2021 to 2024 compared to our prior plan.\nThose increases include $400 million in Kentucky to support full deployment of advanced metering infrastructure, $300 million in Pennsylvania for additional transmission investments, as well as incremental funding for IT initiatives focused on digital transformation investments in work optimization, smart grid technology and the customer experience and $200 million in the U.K. due to a shift of certain investments from 2020 to 2021 as a result of COVID-19, additional funding for telecommunications projects and updates to our RIIO-ED2 capital plan.\nI'll begin with a brief overview of our fourth-quarter results on Slide 9.\nPPL delivered fourth-quarter 2020 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.59 per share compared to $0.57 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nWeather in the quarter was about $0.01 unfavorable compared to 2019, as our Kentucky segment experienced slightly milder temperatures.\nThe estimated impact of COVID on our fourth-quarter results was about $0.02 per share, $0.01 due to lower U.K. sales volumes and $0.01 driven by lower demand in Kentucky.\nWe continue to experience improvement in this area as C&I demand steadily improves across our service territories.\nOverall, these results were in line with our expectations.\nMoving to our full-year 2020 earnings results on Slide 10.\nWe achieved 2020 earnings from ongoing operations of $2.40 per share compared to $2.45 per share a year ago.\nAs Vince mentioned earlier, our 2020 financial results reflect an estimated $0.12 unfavorable variance due to COVID-19.\nDuring 2020, we also experienced a $0.06 unfavorable variance due to weather compared to 2019, primarily in Kentucky.\nIn terms of dilution for the year, we experienced $0.11 per share of dilution year over year, primarily reflecting the impact of the equity forward settlement in late 2019.\nMoving to the segment drivers, excluding impacts from weather and dilution.\nregulated segment earned $1.33 per share, a $0.01 year-over-year decrease.\nThe decrease in U.K. earnings was primarily due to lower adjusted gross margins, driven by lower sales volumes primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19, lower other income due to lower pension income, higher operation and maintenance expense and higher depreciation expense.\nThese decreases were partially offset by higher foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior period with 2020 average rates of $1.47 per pound compared to $1.32 per pound in 2019.\nIn Pennsylvania, we earned $0.65 per share, which was $0.07 higher than our results in 2019.\nOur Pennsylvania results were primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investments in transmission and lower operation and maintenance expense.\nThese increases were partially offset by higher depreciation expense and other factors that were not individually significant.\nTurning to our Kentucky segment.\nWe earned $0.55 per share in 2020, a $0.03 increase over comparable results one year ago.\nThe increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from higher retail rates effective May 1, 2019, and lower operation and maintenance expense.\nPartially offsetting these items were lower commercial and industrial demand revenue, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and higher depreciation expense.\nResults at corporate and other were $0.03 higher compared to the prior year.\nFactors driving earnings results at corporate and other primarily included lower overall corporate expenses and other factors not individually significant.\nTurning to Slide 11.\nWe outlined the trends we observed in weather-normalized sales for each segment by customer class since the beginning of the pandemic.\nOverall, lower demand in the C&I sectors continued to be partially offset by higher residential load in each of our service territories.\nWe also experienced a steady recovery in the C&I space as certain restrictions were eased during the year.\nIn Pennsylvania, residential usage steadily declined following the sharp spike we experienced at the onset of COVID, yet remains up about 3.5% compared to last year, signaling strong demand from customers still working from home.\nAs for the C&I sector, we saw incremental recovery from the lows experienced in the second quarter.\nAnd by year-end, we're tracking less than 3% behind prior year levels.\nThe largest declines remain primarily in the retail trade and services industry, which we expect will remain depressed until restrictions are lifted.\nIn Kentucky, residential usage was up about 7% in Q4 compared to the last year, consistent with what we experienced in Q3.\nWe continue to experience a moderate recovery in the C&I sectors in Kentucky, up substantially from the second quarter.\nC&I volumes were down 3.5% from last year's usage in Q4, which was an improvement from the 7% decline observed during Q3.\nSimilar to Pennsylvania, the largest declines in the C&I sector continue to be seen in the services industry.\nHowever, sales to the manufacturing sector returned closer to the 2019 levels in Q4.\nAnd finally, in the U.K., residential usage also remained higher, with volumes being up about 6% compared to last year.\nC&I sectors has lagged our domestic jurisdictions overall, but has continued to make a strong comeback, down about 9% versus the prior year, a substantial improvement from the second-quarter lows of over 20%.\nWhile additional incremental lockdowns were put in place during the fourth quarter, these impacts did not restrict the construction and housing industries, and we have not seen a slowdown in operational activity in these sectors.\nAnd as a reminder, any revenue shortfall in the 2020-2021 regulatory year will be recovered by WPD in the 2022-2023 regulatory year adjusted for inflation.\nBefore I briefly highlight our 2021 strategic priorities, I just want to reiterate how proud I am of what we were able to achieve in 2020 under truly remarkable circumstances.\nOperationally, we didn't miss a beat, delivering very strong results.\nFinancially, we overcame stiff headwinds to achieve our earnings guidance and returned capital to share owners.\nInternally, I saw our businesses collaborate like never before, as we worked to keep each other safe and tackle COVID-19.\nAnd at the end of the day, I truly believe we made a positive impact on society, and that's the common purpose that really unites employees at all levels across PPL.\nIn 2020, we demonstrated PPL's tremendous resilience and agility.\nAnd as I've shared with our employees, I truly believe we will emerge from this pandemic stronger and more united than ever before.\nWith that in mind, our clear focus moving forward is on delivering long-term value for our customers and our share owners.\nIn 2021, that includes completing the process to sell our U.K. utility business and repositioning PPL as a purely U.S.-focused utility company.\nI'm pleased to report that the process to sell WPD remains on track, and we continue to expect to announce a transaction in the first half of this year.\nAs we shared previously, we believe the sale of the U.K. business will simplify our business mix, strengthen our balance sheet and enhance the company's long-term earnings growth rate.\nIn addition, we believe it will give the company greater financial flexibility to invest in sustainable energy solutions.\nAnother top priority of ours this year is, as always, delivering electricity and natural gas safely, reliably and affordably.\nNo job we do is more important than that.\nAnd this year, we will remain focused on continuous improvement, innovation, benchmarking and best practice sharing as we seek to once again deliver industry-leading operational performance and provide a superior customer experience.\nOther notable priorities for 2021 include advancing our clean energy strategy and reducing PPL's carbon footprint, further enhancing the DEI culture I spoke about earlier and building strong communities through philanthropy, volunteerism and customer assistance.\nIn conclusion, as we look to 2021 and beyond, I'm excited about the opportunity we have to reposition PPL for future success.\nAnd I'm confident we will continue to deliver long-term value for our customers, our share owners and the communities we serve.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Due to the material impact of COVID-19 on our business in fiscal 2020, we will also include comparisons to our fiscal 2019 results.\nOur performance was strong across all of our brands, particularly in our direct-to-consumer channels of distribution.\nWhile we are benefiting from some favorable market conditions, the numbers that we delivered are the direct result of our team's ongoing efforts to navigate through the short-term challenges posed by the pandemic, while staying focused on our long-term strategic objective of delivering happiness to our customers.\nOur excellent results are attributable to the strength of our brand portfolio and how we communicate our aspirational upbeat brand messages through beautiful inventory, differentiated products and exceptional customer experiences.\nTo deliver superior customer experience in today's market, we need to stay focused on our long-term North Star Objective of continuing to improve our customer centric, digitally driven, seamless, cross channel shopping experience, with an emphasis on mobile.\nWe continue to invest heavily in further improving the customer experience, with enhancements to our mobile apps, search engine optimization, customer data and insights, customer service and much more.\nThe boundaries between our retail and e-commerce businesses are becoming increasingly blurry.\nWe recognize that an ever-growing number of customer journeys to purchase, include both physical and digital elements.\nMost consumers no longer distinguish between the relationship with the digital aspect of the brand and their physical relationship with our brands, they simply think of their relationship with our brands.\nThey want and expect to be able to mix and match digital and physical elements at will.\nWe are determined to fulfill this desire and continue to invest in the people, processes and technology, that will allow us to do so.\nWe have talked many times about our ability to ship from store, as an example of the blending of these two channels.\nWe have also routed capabilities, such as drive-to-store digital marketing; buy online, pickup in store; reserve online, pickup in store; virtual shopping appointments; and cross-channel customer service, to better meet the needs of our customers.\nThe better we are at providing a truly seamless omnichannel experience, the better our customers' overall experience will be, which will ultimately result in increased brand loyalty, and a stronger business over the long term.\nOur team's relentless focus on improving our customer experience is evident in our numbers, which exceeded 2019 levels.\nDuring the second quarter, our combine to direct-to-consumer, full price store and e-commerce comp grew by an impressive 22% compared to 2019 with 15% growth in our biggest brand, Tommy Bahama and a remarkable 31% growth in Lilly Pulitzer.\nGrowth in our direct-to-consumer channel was led by our highly profitable e-commerce business, which grew by 49% over the second quarter of 2019.\nIn addition to the impressive top line growth, we were able to simultaneously expand our e-commerce gross margin.\nOur e-commerce business has been enhanced by our ship from store capability, which allows us to leverage inventories located in stores, to serve the e-commerce demand, as well as demand from other stores.\nFor the year, we expect our total e-commerce business to be roughly a third of consolidated sales, compared to 23% in fiscal 2019.\nWhile e-commerce is our fastest growing channel, physical stores remain an incredibly important part of our direct-to-consumer business.\nIn certain instances, there is no substitute for the personal interaction and high level of service that we are able to provide in stores.\nOur retail stores grew top line during the quarter, modestly over 2019 levels, despite lower traffic with sequential improvement through the second quarter across all regions of the country.\nAs we did in e-commerce, we were also able to expand retail store gross margins during the quarter, driven by full price selling and higher IMUs.\nFor this year, we expect retail stores to be just under 40% of our total business.\nWe further differentiate our omnichannel approach to delivering happiness to our customers, with our food and beverage offering.\nRestaurant and bar sales grew 26% during the quarter compared to 2019.\nWe have positive comp growth in all locations as compared to second quarter of 2019, with all, but a couple at double-digit levels.\nFor this year's second quarter, we have five additional Marlin Bar locations as compared to 2019.\nOur food and beverage capabilities give us a unique and powerful way to build relationships with new customers as well as reinforce the love that existing customers have for our Tommy Bahama brand.\nBased on the strong start to 2021 and our growing footprint, we expect our restaurant and bar business to achieve close to $100 million in revenue this year.\nFinally, while our wholesale business only comprises about 20% of our total sales, it remains an important channel of distribution.\nIn situations, where both we and our wholesale partner can be profitable, wholesale can be an important vehicle for exposing new customers to our brands, and another way in which we can serve our customer, when and how she wants to be served.\nThe excellent performance across the enterprise for the quarter was driven by stellar achievements within each of the individual brands.\nStarting with Tommy Bahama, the brand delivered double-digit top line growth over 2019.\nHigher sales combined with improvement in gross margin and excellent expense control, drove 1,000 basis points improvement in operating margin to a very strong 22.7%.\nDuring the quarter, much of the growth was driven by knit tops and shorts in both men's and women's, including many of our IslandZone Performance styles.\nThe strength in these categories is a terrific example of how Tommy Bahama benefits from and is capitalizing on the long-standing trend toward casual, easy care and easy-to-wear product.\nAt the same time, Lilly Pulitzer achieved top line growth, up 16% over 2019, expanded their gross margin and also controlled expenses well.\nCombined, these results drove a 230 basis point improvement in the operating margin to an impressive 29.5%.\nFrom a product perspective, we have seen a nice rebound in woven dresses, which has been a historical strength for Lilly, but the biggest growth category has been our Lilly Luxletic activewear, which is now about 12% of our business.\nIn our Southern Tide business, excellent growth in e-commerce, plus the addition of our new retail stores, drove 17% sales growth, which, combined with expanded gross margins, resulted in a 21% operating margin.\nWhile it is early in Southern Tide's retail journey, operating just a handful of company-owned stores in Florida, we are encouraged by the results that we are seeing.\nFinally, our early stage businesses, The Beaufort Bonnet Company and Duck Head, while currently small, are an important part of our overall enterprise growth strategy.\nWith our strong e-commerce businesses and growing wholesale businesses, both The Beaufort Bonnet Company and Duck Head delivered strong growth and expansion in both gross and operating margin.\nIn addition, we are thrilled to have signed our first lease for a company-owned store for The Beaufort Bonnet Company, and look forward to opening later this year.\nAs we head into the second half of the year, while being mindful of the ongoing COVID-related challenges in supply chain and store and restaurant operations, we believe that our focus on executing our long-term strategic initiatives will continue to drive strength in our business.\nWe have built a powerful and profitable, seamless, digital and mobile-first omni-channel platform, that is driving growth by providing a superior, modern customer experience.\nFrom a product perspective, the trend toward casual, easy care and easy-to-wear, plays right into the sweet spot of our brands, and we are doing a great job of capitalizing on the market opportunity.\nAs Tom just mentioned, outstanding performances in each of our brands in the second quarter, resulted in record breaking revenue, gross margin, operating margin and earnings.\nOn the top line, demand for our products remained high, and revenue exceeded 2019 levels in each of our direct-to-consumer channels, and in each of our brands.\nConsolidated sales in the second quarter were $329 million, compared to $302 million in the second quarter of 2019.\nOur gross margin continue to track significantly higher than 2019.\nOn an adjusted basis, gross margin expanded 450 basis points over 2019 to 64% in the second quarter.\nDriving this improvement was a higher proportion of full price sales, our overall shift in our sales mix to higher margin direct-to-consumer channels of distribution and improved IMUs.\nHigher freight costs put some pressure on margin in the quarter, partially offsetting some of the improvement.\nWe gained SG&A leverage in the second quarter, improving from 47% of sales in 2019 to 44% of sales.\nSG&A dollars increased modestly from 2019 levels, with the increases in performance based incentive compensation and marketing expense, partially offset by decreases in other employment costs, due to headcount reductions and lower occupancy cost.\nIn the second quarter, our consolidated adjusted operating margin expanded 820 basis points over 2019 to 22%, with operating margin expansion in all operating groups.\nOur business is well supported by our solid balance sheet and strong cash flow from operations.\nOur liquidity position is strong with $180 million in cash and no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at the end of the second quarter.\nCash flow remains very strong.\nIn the first half of 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $149 million compared to $24 million in the first half of 2020.\nOn a FIFO basis, inventory decreased 34% compared to the end of the second quarter of 2020.\nExcluding Lanier Apparel, which we are exiting, FIFO inventory decreased 26% as compared to the end of the second quarter of 2020.\nTommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer and Southern Tide each lowered inventory levels year-over-year, conservative purchases of seasonal inventory and higher than expected first half sales.\nOngoing enhancements to enterprise order management systems were also contributing to a more efficient use of inventory.\nOn a LIFO basis, inventory decreased 48%, and excluding Lanier Apparel, decreased 39% compared to the end of the second quarter of 2020.\nOur outlook for the back half of the year reflects our expectation of strength in our full price direct-to-consumer business.\nWe expect full price direct-to-consumer sales growth and consolidated gross margin expansion over 2019.\nWhile we have raised our outlook for the second half, year-over-year improvement in our full price direct business is expected to be partially offset by a handful of specific headwinds in the back half of the fiscal year.\nThe strong first half full price sales has left us with less inventory for our second half clearance events, including an expected $15 million reduction in Lilly Pulitzer's third quarter flash clearance sale, compared to 2019.\nIn addition, initial spring wholesale shipments, which have historically shipped in the fourth quarter, are likely to ship in the first quarter of 2022, due to supply chain delays.\nFinally, the exit of Lanier Apparel is expected to impact revenue in both the third and fourth quarters.\nWe expect sales from Lanier Apparel to be approximately $25 million lower than 2019's third quarter, and $20 million lower than 2019's fourth quarter.\nFor the full year, we now expect sales in a range of $1.085 billion to $1.105 billion, as compared to sales of $1.12 billion in 2019.\nAdjusted earnings per share is expected to be between $6.45 and $6.70, a significant increase from our previous guidance.\nThis compares to earnings of $4.32 per share on an adjusted basis in 2019.\nFor the full year, sales from Lanier Apparel are expected to be $25 million in 2021 compared to $95 million in 2019.\nFor the third quarter, we expect sales to be between $220 million and $230 million, compared to sales of $241 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect earnings of $0.20 to $0.30 per share on an adjusted basis compared to earnings of $0.10 per share on an adjusted basis in the third quarter of 2019.\nOur outlook includes strong quarter-to-date results, with August as the most impactful month of the quarter in 2021.\nThe company's effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be approximately 23%.\nWe continue to support our business in fiscal 2021 with investments for future growth.\nCapital expenditures are expected to be approximately $40 million in fiscal 2021, as we focus on technology related to digital marketing, customer service, mobile enhancements and improve distribution.\nIn addition, we will be investing in additional brick-and-mortar locations with our newest Marlin Bar at Town Square in Las Vegas slated to open tomorrow.\nThis Marlin Bar is replacing the recently closed full service restaurant in the same center.\nFinally, we are proud of our long history of returning value to our shareholders through dividends, which we have paid every quarter since going public in 1960.\nThis quarter, our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $0.42 per share.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We have prepared slides to supplement our comments during this conference call.\nJoining me on the call today are Ed Breen, chief executive officer; Lori Koch, our chief financial officer; and Jon Kemp, president of our electronics and industrial segment.\nOur 2020 Form 10-K, as updated by our current and periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risk and uncertainties which may cause such differences.\nUnless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today exclude significant items.\nWe will also refer to other non-GAAP measures.\nI will provide comments on another overall strong quarter, including continued advancement of our strategic priorities as a premier multi-industrial company aimed at growth and creating value for our shareholders.\nAs a result of the principles and protocols that we adopted over the last year, we continue to operate safely and productively on site and remotely.\nWe have encouraged all employees to get vaccinated, and where possible, we are working with local governments to facilitate access, including on-site vaccinations at some locations.\nOur Wilmington- based office locations have fully reopened, and I have to say it is great to be back in the office with our teams.\nStarting on Slide 2.\nLori will take you through the specifics but in summary, broad-based organic growth was driven by continued strength in our key end markets, including ongoing recovery in those most impacted by the pandemic.\nDespite a challenging production environment with escalating raw material costs and continuous supply chain and logistics constraints, strong operating discipline and quick pricing actions resulted in about 460 basis points of margin expansion versus the year-ago period.\nWith strong order trends continuing and confidence in our teams' ability to continue to navigate through raw material and supply chain challenges, we are raising our full-year guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS.\nI will provide more details on our updated guidance shortly.\nIn addition to our financial results, we continue to execute on our balanced approach to capital allocation during the quarter.\nIn May, we further delevered our balance sheet by redeeming $2 billion of bonds, thereby reducing our gross financial debt to $10.6 billion at the end of the quarter.\nSince the end of last year, we have paid down a total of $5 billion of debt and do not have another debt maturity until the fourth quarter of 2023, which further solidifies our sound liquidity position.\nWe also returned approximately $800 million of capital to shareholders during the second quarter through share repurchases and dividends.\nDuring the second quarter, we purchased a total of $640 million in shares, which includes completion of our previous share repurchase program and the start of repurchases under our new authorization announced last quarter, which expires on June 30, 2022.\nThrough the first 6 months of the year, we repurchased approximately $1.1 billion in shares and plan to be opportunistic with our remaining authorization as we move throughout the year.\nAnd in July, we repurchased an additional $125 million of shares.\nWith respect to dividends, we returned about $160 million of cash to shareholders during the quarter.\nAs we previously mentioned, we intend to work with the board to increase our dividend annually as we grow earnings.\nBefore I close, I'm pleased to note that in late June, we closed on the previously announced divestiture of our Solamet business for approximately $190 million.\nAnd on July 1, we completed the acquisition of Laird performance materials utilizing cash on hand.\nThe Laird acquisition advances DuPont's strategy of growing as a global innovation leader and strengthens our leadership position in advanced electronic materials.\nJoining us today is the president of our global E&I segment, Jon Kemp.\nIt's an exciting transaction for DuPont that significantly advances our position in the electronics industry and accelerates the transformation of our interconnect solutions business into a total solutions provider.\nWe've been following Laird for several years and have admired their capabilities as a leading provider of electromagnetic shielding and thermal management solutions and are excited to have added their capabilities and history of growth to our portfolio.\nAs a reminder, Laird delivered $465 million of revenue with approximately 30% EBITDA margin in 2020.\nE&I and Laird are both recognized for innovation, quality and reliability and have strong relationships across the electronics industry.\nThis combination brings together DuPont's premier applied material science expertise with Laird's industry-leading application engineering capabilities.\nIt also adds more content on many of the devices that we're already in.\nWe have already begun the process of integrating Laird into our existing interconnect solutions business, providing opportunities to further optimize business structure, functional support and our global site network.\nWe expect $60 million in run rate cost synergies by the end of year 3 with approximately 60% realized in the first 18 months.\nWe expect to achieve cost synergies through a mix of G&A, procurement and site consolidation initiatives.\nOn the next slide, I'll share some of the key benefits of this transaction and describe how the combination enhances DuPont's position as a leading electronic materials provider.\nThe second way it enhances our position is through innovation.\nThis acquisition strategically aligns us to critical needs across thermal management, signal integrity, power management, miniaturization and high reliability.\nAnd it enables us to have early engagement with OEMs in both system design and material specification, creating both greater product differentiation and higher margins.\nThe next benefit of the acquisition is that it broadens our portfolio of solutions.\nWith Laird's unique multifunctional capabilities, we will leverage an expanded customer base, broad product portfolio, global scale and deep technical expertise to increase speed to market, create new efficiencies in the development of integrated and multifunctional solutions and provide high-value next-generation products that will deliver additional growth in the next several years.\nWe believe customers will see immediate benefits as the combined E&I organization engages across value chains to address the increasingly complex challenges in the industry.\nOur combined organization will advance our leadership to help customers accelerate solutions necessary for the adoption of high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, 5G communications, smart and autonomous vehicles and the Internet of Things.\nWe will be well positioned to capture growth in these key secular growth areas.\nI'll cover our second-quarter financial performance, beginning on Slide 5.\nOur results for the quarter reflect the diversity and strength of our portfolio and our teams' continued ability to execute in the face of escalating raw material costs and global supply chain and logistics headwinds.\nNet sales of $4.1 billion were up 26% versus second quarter of 2020, up 23% on an organic basis.\nThe organic sales growth resulted from a 20% increase in volume and a 3% increase in price.\nCurrency provided a 4% tailwind in the quarter, which was slightly offset by a 1% headwind as a result of non-core business divestitures in the prior year.\nOverall sales growth was broad-based with double-digit growth on an organic basis in all 3 reporting segments and across all regions.\nThe most notable increase versus the year-ago period was in our M&M segment, reflecting the sizable change in the global automotive market versus the prior year and disciplined pricing actions.\nI will provide additional color on our segment top-line results on the next slide.\nFrom an earnings perspective, we delivered operating EBITDA of $1.06 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.06 per share, up 53% and about 240%, respectively, versus the year-ago period.\nThe earnings improvement resulted from volume gains most notably reflecting ongoing recovery in key end markets adversely impacted by the pandemic and the absence of approximately $150 million in charges associated with temporary idling certain facilities, partially offset by the absence of a $64 million gain associated with a joint venture that has since been divested.\nStrong operating EBITDA leverage drove operating EBITDA margin expansion of 460 basis points.\nIncremental margins for the quarter were about 43%.\nGiven the unique nature of 2020 and the discrete items that impacted our operating results in the prior year, it's important to evaluate our year-over-year operating performance for our core results on an underlying basis.\nSpecifically, operating EBITDA for our core results during the quarter was up about 40% versus last year after excluding the impact of the $150 million in idle mills incurred in the prior year, with about 240 basis points of margin expansion and operating leverage of one and a half times.\nSimilarly, I continue to track our growth versus 2019 given the significant impact that the pandemic had in key end markets last year.\nIn comparing our current second-quarter results to a more normalized performance before the pandemic, all reported sales in the quarter were up 6% versus the second quarter of 2019 and up 10% versus that same period for our core sales.\nOperating EBITDA for our core results during the quarter was up 15% versus second quarter of 2019 or one and a half times leverage.\nFrom a segment perspective, E&I delivered operating EBITDA margin of 32%, with 190 basis points of expansion driven by broad-based volume gains.\nM&M delivered significant operating EBITDA improvement, driven by an overall recovery in automotive markets and the absence of approximately $130 million in charges associated with temporarily idling polymer capacity in the year-ago period.\nOperating EBITDA margin for the quarter was 23%, reflecting volume growth and net pricing gains resulting from actions taken ahead of escalating raw material costs.\nIn W&P, operating EBITDA increased 4% versus the year-ago period.\nOperating EBITDA margin and leverage were adversely impacted primarily by 2 key drivers.\nFirst, given contractual commitments with customers, local selling price increases lagged the headwind from raw materials and supply chain cost escalation.\nWe expect this to resolve in the second half as price increases start to kick in.\nSecond, production volumes for Tyvek protective garments were at peak levels in the year-ago period given the company's response to the pandemic.\nThis enabled us to minimize manufacturing changeovers to other Tyvek grades, resulting in an overall increase to production rates.\nAs Tyvek output shifted from protective garments to multiple other applications, the resulting increase in expected changeovers in the current quarter decreased production rates, leading to lower volumes.\nFor the quarter, cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow were $440 million and $224 million, respectively.\nWhile these amounts have improved since the first quarter, cash flow and conversion are not where we need them to be.\nThe headwinds we faced are related to increased working capital levels and capital spending in excess of D&A as we advance critical capacity expansion projects.\nWith respect to working capital, we saw an increase in inventories due to our efforts to create a more stable supply chain for our customers given the strong demand environment and numerous raw material and logistics constraints.\nIn the second half of the year, we expect higher cash flow and conversion rate as the global supply chain and logistic environment stabilizes.\nSlide 6 provides more detail on the year-over-year changes in net sales for the quarter.\nOrganic sales were up 17% on 17% volume growth with double-digit volume growth increases in all regions.\nVolume gains were led by mid-20s percent growth in Industrial Solutions, reflecting broad-based demand strength across most product lines but most notably for OLED displays for new phones and television launches, medical silicones in healthcare and Kalrez seals within electronics.\nInterconnect solutions also delivered organic growth over 20% with high-teens volume growth.\nThe volume growth was driven by higher material content in premium next-generation smartphones, partially resulting from timing shifts as select OEM demand shifted from the second half this year, along with some share gains for printed circuit board.\nSemiconductor technologies continues to benefit from strong electronics demand and advancements in key growth areas such as 5G, high-performance computing and electric vehicles.\nDuring the quarter, new technology ramps in advanced nodes within logic and foundry and higher demand for memory in servers and data centers drove double-digit volume growth.\nContinued recovery of key end markets within W&P drove organic growth of 11%, driven by volume increases.\nSales gains were led by recovery in construction with Shelter Solutions reporting organic sales growth of more than 30%, which reflects continued strength in North American residential construction for products like Styrofoam and Tyvek house wrap and in retail channels for do-it-yourself applications.\nCommercial construction recorded higher sales in the quarter for Corian surfaces as global demand continues to improve.\nWithin safety solutions, organic sales were up high single digits, reflecting strong volume improvement for aramid fibers in industrial, oil and gas and automotive end markets.\nAs previously noted, lower production volumes for Tyvek reduced overall safety volume.\nIn water solutions, broad-based demand for water technologies remained strong.\nHowever, logistics challenges primarily in our Ultrafiltration business impacted our ability to supply, resulting in a low single-digit volume decline versus the year-ago period.\nWe expect organic sales growth for the year for water solutions to be in the mid to high single digits.\nThe most notable increase in top-line improvement was in our M&M segment, which had organic sales growth of over 50%.\nThe improvement was driven by the continuing recovery of the global automotive market, which represents about 60% of the segment from an end market perspective and helped deliver strong volume growth across all 3 lines of business.\nLocal pricing gains of 13% also contributed to organic sales growth, reflecting our actions taken to offset raw material costs and higher metals pricing in the advanced solutions business.\nExcluding metals pricing, local price was up about 8%.\nWithin engineering polymers, global supply constraints of key raw materials continues to improve but are expected to remain tight through the end of the year.\nWe continue to expect to recover lost volume related to these disruptions as the raw material constraints are alleviated.\nTurning to Slide 7.\nI mentioned earlier that adjusted earnings per share of $1.06 per share was up over 240% from $0.31 per share in the year-ago period.\nHigher segment earnings resulted in a net benefit totaling over $0.40.\nThis net benefit resulted mainly from higher volumes and the absence of idle mills recorded in the prior year, offset slightly by portfolio changes, which includes the absence of the gain recorded in the prior year in corporate.\nAlso providing a significant benefit to adjusted earnings per share versus last year was an approximate $0.30 per share benefit due to a lower share count.\nBenefit from lower interest expense in the current quarter as a result of our recent delevering actions was mostly offset by a higher base tax rate compared to last year.\nOur base tax rate for the quarter of 19.8% was higher than the year-ago period due to the absence of certain discrete gains benefiting the prior year rate.\nFor full-year 2021, we currently expect our base tax rate to be closer to the lower end of our expected range of 21% to 22%.\nLet me discuss our financial outlook on Slide 8, which includes our view of the third quarter and full-year 2021.\nWe are raising our full-year guidance range for net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS.\nAlong with the underlying improvement that we are expecting compared to our previous estimates, our revised guide also reflects the acquisition of Laird and the divestiture of the Solamet business.\nAt the midpoint of the range provided, we now expect net sales for the year to be about $16.5 billion and operating EBITDA to be about $4.235 billion.\nAlso, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be $4.27 per share at the midpoint of the range provided, which reflects about $0.23 underlying raise to our original estimate, a $0.10 benefit from the portfolio changes and about $0.27 full-year benefit related to the amortization reporting change.\nFor the third-quarter 2021, we expect net sales to be about $4.2 billion, operating EBITDA to be about $1.07 billion and adjusted earnings per share to be about $1.12 per share, all at the midpoints of the ranges provided.\nBefore opening up for Q&A, I'd like to provide some highlights on our commitment to ESG and what we are doing to sustainably grow and operate our businesses for the long term.\nIn June, we published our 2021 sustainability report, which reflects our first full-year progress against the 2030 goals that we set in 2019.\nOur report highlights more than 50 examples of how our teams are addressing the environmental and social needs of our customers and communities.\nSome of the highlights from this report are reflected on Slide 9.\nESG is fundamental to our core long-term strategy, which is why the board of directors and I made the decision to incorporate the progress on our sustainability goals into our incentive compensation program beginning this year.\nAs an innovation leader, we believe our biggest lever to affect economic, environmental and social progress is through working directly with our customers.\nToday, our R&D investment is focused on the intersection of key market trends and the needs of sustainable development.\nOne example of how we are doing this is in the area of addressing the global need for clean water.\nOur water solutions business recently launched its B-Free technology.\nThis pretreatment solution enables a significant improvement in the reliability of reverse osmosis desalination plants.\nAnother example is within advanced mobility.\nThe broad adoption of electric vehicles is fundamental in addressing climate change.\nThrough leveraging our broad portfolio of expertise in battery assembly and thermal management for electric vehicles, our DuPont M&M collaborated team with General Motors to develop an advanced adhesive solution for use in electric vehicles.\nIn June, as a result of our close collaboration, GM recognized the DuPont team with the GM Supplier of the Year award.\nThe power of customer partnerships to drive sustainability is a key element to our long-term growth strategy, and I am confident that we will continue to deliver these types of wins in the future.\nWith that, let me turn it to Leland to open the Q&A.\nWe will allow for one question and one follow up question per person.\nOperator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of Packaging Corporation of America.\nAnd with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Chief -- Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.\nI'll then wrap things up and we'd be glad to take questions.\nYesterday, we reported fourth quarter 2020 net income of $124 million or $1.30 per share.\nExcluding the special items, fourth quarter 2020 net income was $127 million or $1.33 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2019's net income of $163 million or $1.71 per share.\nFourth quarter net sales were $1.7 billion in both 2020 and 2019.\nTotal company EBITDA for the fourth quarter, excluding special items, was $293 million in 2020 and $335 million in 2019.\nFourth quarter net income included special items of $3 million primarily for facilities closure and restructuring costs.\nIn addition, we also reported full year 2020 earnings excluding special items of $550 million or $5.78 per share compared to 2019's earnings excluding special items of $726 million or $7.65 per share.\nNet sales were $6.7 billion in 2020 and $7 billion in 2019.\nExcluding the special items, total company EBITDA in 2020 was $1.23 billion compared to $1.45 billion in 2019.\nExcluding special items, the $0.38 per share decrease in fourth quarter 2020 earnings compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our Packaging segment of $0.30; the Paper segment, $0.05; lower volumes in our Paper segment of $0.27 and higher scheduled maintenance outage costs of $0.08.\nHigh demand for trucks due to low inventories along with driver shortages and rail rate increases drove higher freight expenses of $0.07 and our tax rate was $0.05 per share higher primarily due to some of the benefits we had in 2019 that were not repeated in 2020.\nThese items were partially offset by higher volumes in our Packaging segment of $0.40 per share and excellent management of costs during the quarter, which resulted in lower operating costs of $0.01 and lower other costs of $0.03 per share.\nLooking at the Packaging business.\nEBITDA excluding special items in the fourth quarter of 2020 of $303 million with sales of $1.54 billion resulted in a margin of 20% versus last year's EBITDA of $303 million and sales of $1.46 billion or a 21% margin.\nFor the full year 2020, Packaging segment EBITDA excluding special items was $1.2 billion with sales of $5.9 billion or 21% margin compared to full year 2019 EBITDA of $1.3 billion with sales of $5.9 billion or 22% margin.\nDemand in our Packaging segment remained very strong as sales volumes in both the containerboard mills and the corrugated products plants set all-time records.\nAlthough we were able to replenish some inventory during the quarter by postponing a large discretionary outage at the DeRidder mill and utilizing the Jackson mill for additional containerboard production, we again ended the period with inventory levels lower than planned and at a new low from a weeks of supply standpoint due to much stronger-than-expected demand.\nAs we mentioned on the last quarter's call, during the fourth quarter, we did begin producing high-performance virgin linerboard on the number three machine at Jackson, Alabama to help meet the continued strong demand from our box plant customers and also to build some much-needed inventory prior to the year-end.\nThe machine's capabilities met our expectations for the quarter, producing excellent quality, lightweight, high-performance grades for the months of November and December.\nAlthough as we said previously, these tons are currently at a very high cost, we were able to refine our previous studies and assumptions in order to more accurately estimate the future capital investment and process changes required in a phased approach to fully utilize the potential of the mill to produce containerboard at an optimal cost and quality.\nIn order for us to address our strategic integrated containerboard supply needs capable of providing the necessary runway to grow our downstream box plant demand, this analysis along with other options we've been evaluating will be reviewed by the Board of Directors in our February meeting.\nWe'll then be able to discuss this further with you.\nAs Mark mentioned, our corrugated products plants established new all-time quarterly records for total box shipments up 9.9% compared to last year's fourth quarter as well as shipments per day up 11.7% compared to last year.\nSaid another way, although there were three less shipping days this quarter compared to the third quarter, our total fourth quarter shipments exceeded the third quarter by 2.2%.\nFor the full year, annual corrugated shipment records were set as well, both in total and per day, up 5.8% and 5.4%, respectively, with one more shipping day compared to 2019.\nOutside sales volume of containerboard was 16,000 tons below last year's fourth quarter as we ran our containerboard system to supply the record needs of our box plants.\nDomestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.31 per share lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 and down $0.11 per share versus the third quarter of 2020 primarily due to a less rich mix as the graphics and point-of-purchase display business as well as the produce business in the Pacific Northwest tails off during this period.\nExport containerboard prices were $0.01 per share above both the fourth quarter of 2019 as well as the third quarter of 2020.\nAs expected, late in the quarter, we began to see the initial benefit of our recently announced Packaging segment price increases.\nWhile we don't comment on forward pricing specifics, we would expect to realize the vast majority of the increases during the first quarter of 2021.\nLooking at the Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the fourth quarter was $10 million with sales of $156 million or 6% margin compared to fourth quarter 2019 EBITDA of $53 million and sales of $244 million or a 22% margin.\nFor the full year 2020, Paper segment EBITDA excluding special items was $73 million with sales of $675 million or an 11% margin compared to the full year 2019 EBITDA of $213 million with sales of $964 million or a 22% margin.\nMarket conditions in the Paper segment continued to be challenged due to the nationwide responses to help control the spread of the pandemic.\nAs expected, sales volume was below seasonally stronger third quarter levels and over 30% below the fourth quarter of 2019.\nAs mentioned previously, with the scheduled outage at our International Falls mill, the Jackson mill was restarted on white paper in October and produced both paper and containerboard during the fourth quarter.\nWe'll continue to assess our outlook for paper demand and optimal inventory levels and will run our paper system accordingly.\nAverage paper prices and mix were 1% below the third quarter of 2020 and approximately 3% below the fourth quarter of 2019.\nFor the fourth quarter, we generated cash from operations of $271 million and free cash flow of $103 million.\nThe primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $168 million.\nCommon stock dividends totaled $75 million, $51 million for federal and state income tax payments and net interest payments of $40 million.\nWe ended the year with $975 million of cash on hand or just over $1.1 billion, including marketable securities.\nOur liquidity at December 31 was just under $1.5 billion.\nFor the full year 2020, cash from operations was $1.03 billion.\nWe had capital spending of $421 million.\nFree cash flow was $612 million.\nOur final recurring effective tax rate for 2020 was 25% and our final reported cash tax rate was 18%.\nRegarding full year estimates of certain key items for the upcoming year, we expect total capital expenditures to be between $500 million to $525 million, which excludes any potential capital spending related to the Jackson conversion since that is still being evaluated, as Mark indicated earlier.\nDD&A is expected to be approximately $407 million.\nPension and post-retirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million, which is net of a nonoperating pension benefit of almost $20 million primarily due to our pension asset performance in 2020.\nWe also expect to make cash pension and post-retirement benefit plan contributions of $52 million.\nBased on the recent 27% increase to our dividend, we expect dividend payments for the year of $380 million.\nOur full year interest expense in 2021 is expected to be approximately $95 million and net cash interest payments should be about $93 million.\nThe estimate for our 2021 combined federal and state cash tax rate is about 20.5% and for our book effective tax rate, approximately 25%.\nCurrently, planned annual maintenance outages at our mills in 2021 will result in approximately 81,000 less tons of containerboard production compared to 2020.\nThe annual earnings impact of these outages, including lost volume, direct costs and amortized repair costs, is expected to be $0.90 per share compared to the $0.65 per share we had in 2020.\nThe current estimated impact by quarter in 2021 is $0.10 per share in the first quarter, $0.25 in the second, $0.13 in the third quarter and $0.42 per share in the fourth.\nAs they've done through this pandemic, our employees demonstrated tremendous resiliency to overcome adversity in both their personal and work lives to deliver significant accomplishments throughout the company, not the least of which was running our manufacturing and office locations safely during these times of constant change and distraction.\nWithout question, we experienced difficulties and unique challenges during the year.\nHowever, our employees never lost their resolve to succeed.\nOur manufacturing and sales organizations continued to successfully adapt to the needs of our customers during this period of unprecedented demand in our packaging business and also effectively manage the market challenges in our paper business brought on by the pandemic as well as working through the impact of multiple hurricanes.\nOur engineering and technology organization has stayed on track with the key capital projects and process improvements for our box plants and mills and our corporate staff groups found innovative solutions for remote working conditions to ensure we continue to manage the company effectively as well as perform all of the necessary administrative activities that are necessary for our employees or are required as a public company.\nI'm very proud of our accomplishments and the strong partnerships we've built with our customers and suppliers over the many years.\nLooking ahead, as we move from the fourth into the first quarter, our Packaging segment demand should remain strong with shipments exceeding those of last year's record first quarter.\nThis will require us to continue producing containerboard at our Jackson mill in addition to an appropriate amount of white paper to maintain optimal inventory levels for servicing the paper customers.\nAs Tom mentioned, we expect to realize the majority of our recently announced Packaging segment price increases during the first quarter and we expect average export prices to move higher as well.\nHowever, higher freight costs are expected to continue and labor costs will be higher with annual wage inflation and timing related increases to fringes and benefits as we start the new year.\nSeasonally colder weather will increase energy and wood costs.\nAnd we also expect higher prices for recycled fiber.\nFinally, scheduled outage expenses should be lower although inflation-related increases with our operating supplies and repair costs are expected to offset much of that benefit.\nShelter-in-place and lockdown conditions are constantly changing across the country.\nAnd with the new federal administration in place, we expect that guidelines and requirements will continue to evolve.\nThere continues to be numerous events and actions that could significantly impact our expectations and assumptions for the upcoming quarter in both our Packaging and Paper segments.\nThis is true not only for the operation of our facilities but also for the needs of our customers and the availability of services and products we rely on for our -- from our suppliers.\nAs a result, we are not able to appropriately quantify our guidance for the first quarter.\nWith that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions.\nThese statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC.\nAnd with that, Holly, I'd like to open up the call to questions, please.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Joining you today from First Bancorp are Aurelio Aleman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Orlando Berges, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nWe wish you all a healthy 2021.\nPlease let's move to Slide 4 to discuss the highlights of the year.\nWe're definitely very pleased with our results for the year.\nI'm truly proud of what our team was able to accomplish, overcoming all the many challenges posed by the pandemic in the operating environment.\nIt really was a transformational year for our Company with the acquisition that closed on September 1, which has further expanded our market share, solidified our position in Puerto Rico.\nWe have now over 30% growth in our customer base, reaching 675,000 customers.\nWe're also very pleased with the technological advancements on the year and our data preparedness.\nOur clients' adoption of digital channels continued to improve during 2020, reaching an increase of over 33% in logins and digital transaction increasing over 55% for the year.\nIt is a priority to continue investing in technology infrastructure projects on digital.\nAnd so, we continue driving efficiency as we progressed in parallel with the integration.\nWe are definitely very focused on the integration and has been running on schedule and it's planned to be completed by the end of the summer.\nOn the economic side, the macro and geopolitical landscape in Puerto Rico seems -- continue to be improving.\nEconomic measures stemming from additional stimulus and disaster relief funding will definitely provide additional support to those impacted by the pandemic and the overall environment.\nLockdowns continue at a different layer, but when we look at December activity, it was actually fairly healthy considering the limitations in operating hours.\nMost impacted sectors, as we know, continued to be hospitality and retail.\nOn the other hand, we are entering 2021 on very solid foot and a fortress balance sheet to support that economic recovery.\nWe have very strong liquidity, solid research coverage, and very strong capital to begin the year with.\nFor the year, we generated $102 million in net income, $0.46 per share, shy to the $167 million that we generated in 2019, definitely impacted by the economic effects on the pandemic and the increased provision driven by CECL and the acquisition.\nPre-tax preparation was strong, increasing 6% to $300 million, with actually only four months of our combined company.\nAnd in spite of COVID, actually loan activity -- COVID -- loan activity -- which impacted loan activity.\nWe'll cover that later.\nAnd obviously, in spite of the yield curve that the banks are operating, which definitely impact the topline revenue.\nLoan origination and renewal for the year reached $4.4 billion, and organic core deposit growth, a record growth of $2 billion.\nSo, it was really a very positive core year for the Company.\nNow let's move to Slide 6 to cover the highlights of the quarter.\nThis compares to $28 million in the past quarter.\nIt's important to highlight that this is the first full quarter of operation of the combined franchise.\nPPNR came in very strong with $86 million, up from $77 million in the prior quarter.\nAnd I think importantly, we are past the moratoriums, and we are very closely monitoring asset quality metrics.\nAsset quality metrics remain stable.\nAnd obviously, there is focus on those borrowers negatively impacted by the effects of the pandemic.\nWe really say it is early to predict final -- final inflows to NPA created by the pandemic, but when we look at initial metrics post-moratorium, delinquency metrics as of year-end still compared better when we look at December '19 pre-pandemic levels.\nAs I said, we continue to invest in technology to better share our customer.\nDuring this quarter, we implemented a new online and mobile platform for credit cards.\nWe also continue the rollout of our new branch digital one [Phonetic] platform.\nAnd then, when we look at capital, CET1 17.3%, definitely post acquisition impact still very strong and among the highest.\nSo please let's move to Slide 7.\nI'd like to expand a bit on loans and loan activity and deposits.\nAs I say, loan origination activity was robust for the quarter, $1.4 billion.\nThis excludes credit card activity.\nPrimarily, growth was in the commercial and the auto portfolio.\nI think we all know that commercial activity is seasonal, and yes we have a very solid quarter of deals that got delayed in the year.\nWe also have some volumes on the Main Street loan programs and PPP.\nSo, if we exclude Main Street and PPP, origination still increased by $278 million to $1.2 billion, so still strong.\nThe overall portfolio, now it's at $11.8 billion, declined slightly from prior quarter.\nI will say primarily due to strategic reductions in residential.\nWe continue to originate primary conforming loans, which has helped the non-interest income.\nAnd also we received repayments of about $49 million on the PPP loan forgiveness process.\nFor this quarter, we anticipate another approximately $100 million of repayment in PPP.\nObviously, it depends on the speed that SBA process, the forgiveness.\nAnd we are now, obviously as you know, working in Round 2 of PPP, which was recently approved.\nOur initial estimates are around $250 million in loans during the first half of 2021 on PPP loans.\nWe know that this could replace some of the normal commercial volume over the next months, as it happens in the first round of PPP.\nBut definitely, this is a great support to small businesses.\nWe expect loans -- this loans to be smaller, more granular and to be more focused on the smaller businesses.\nOn the deposit front, there is ample liquidity in the market.\nWe continue to see inflow of funds.\nWe continue to see deposit growth.\nAnd we expect the year to continue on that trend.\nSo, we really focus on increasing loan generation.\nWe have excess liquidity that we need to deploy.\nAnd when we look at the quarter, core deposits were up another $257 million.\nThe pipeline is growing.\nObviously, consumer and mortgage trends continue very solid and very consistent.\nAnd as always, commercial is always model-driven.\nSo, we're working hard to build that pipeline.\nNow let's please move to Slide 8.\nI think it's important to highlight that the earnings power of our franchise now reach a new high with $86 million of PPNR on the combined operation, again being only the first quarter of this.\nThe enhanced funding profile of the combined institution will also contribute to mitigating some of the yield curve impact on the overall yield of the portfolios.\nAnd obviously, now we have more customers to reach -- more customers to go after for loan generation.\nLooking into 2021, obviously, there is going to be some noise still because of the integration.\nThe first half of the year is definitely focused on integration.\nWe want to finish that by summer.\nSo, there is some expenses that are there to be able to achieve the full benefit of integration.\nSo, they will be primarily focused in the first half of the year.\nAnd then on the second half of the year, it's important to know that as we -- market recovers, everything reopens which is what we expect.\nAnd as we grow revenue, there is also some variable expense tied to these revenues that could bring some increase.\nWe are targeting a long-term efficiency ratio of 55% following the completion of the integration.\nI want to make comment that we really need to realize that -- recognize that it is challenging for banks to achieve mid-50s in the current yield curve environment.\nSo, we also expect hopefully some improvement in the curve at some point in time at the end of the year.\nLet's move to Slide 6 to slightly touch on the capital and the balance sheet.\nAgain liquidity continued to build in the quarter.\nSo we have -- we continued to see excess cash, reserve coverage remain at the similar levels of prior quarter, so very strong reserve coverage at 3.3%.\nAnd then, capital is again very strong with CET1 at above [Phonetic] 17%, after completing the acquisition.\nAs I said in the last call, capital deployment opportunities remain a priority and are the focus of management and Board.\nLast night, we announced the approval to increase the dividend this quarter to $0.07 per share, definitely driven by current and predicted earnings.\nAnd as I commented in the past earnings call, during this quarter, we're actively working on the data stress test, an updated capital plan to be presented to our Board in order to conclude on potential additional capital actions moving forward.\nAurelio mentioned we had a strong quarter, $50 million in the quarter, $0.23 a share, which compares with $28 million last quarter, $0.13 a share.\nAgain, keep in mind that the quarter does reflect the first full quarter effect of the acquired operations.\nWe only had one month of those results in the third quarter of 2020.\nThe quarter included still some merger and restructuring costs of $12.3 million this quarter compared with $10.4 million last quarter.\nAnd also keep in mind that last quarter, we had a Day 1 CECL allowance for the corporation [Phonetic] of almost $39 million and we recognized an $8 million reversal -- a partial reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which also reflected on the results.\nNet interest income for the quarter, it's up $29 million.\nA lot has to do with the $1.7 billion higher average loan balance we have in the quarter, which includes the Santander acquisition, obviously the full effect, but also new originations on the commercial and consumer loans for the quarter.\nThose were partially offset by, as Aurelio made reference to also, the fact that we have continued to reduce the mortgage portfolio, which is down about $130 million [Phonetic] as compared to September 30, as well as the $49 million reduction in PPP loans.\nSome loans have been submitted for forgiveness, and they were paid off in the quarter.\nThe quarter also -- we recognized $1.1 million of interest income we collected on non-accrual loans, mostly charge-off non-accrual loans that were recovered.\nAnd the repayment of the PPP loans resulted in the acceleration of $700,000 of commissions on those loans.\nOn the quarter, we also had a reduction of over [Phonetic] $800,000 in interest expense.\nThis is even though the overall interest bearing liabilities went up $2 billion from the full quarter effect of the transaction and continued increase on deposits.\nSo that is significant.\nWe saw an 18 basis points reduction on the funding cost during the quarter as compared to last quarter.\nNon-interest income for the quarter is $30 million.\nIt is up $5 million.\nIf we consider that last quarter had $5 million of gains on loss -- the gain on sales of securities, we didn't have much this quarter.\nSo excluding that -- those $5 million, non-interest income went up again $5 million.\n$2.5 million was service charges on deposits, full quarter of Santander acquisition plus increases that we are starting to see on volume of transactions.\nThe second and third quarter expenses were lower.\nThe variable component of the expenses were lower in transaction related fees -- transaction related volume, therefore fees were also down.\nWe continue to see strong originations, lot of refinancings.\nSignificant part of it, it's a conforming paper that we end up selling.\nSo we had $500,000 increases in those gains on sales of some of those mortgage loans.\nAlso during in the quarter, we recognized $1.4 million on fees on Main Street loans we originated during the quarter.\n$184 million of loans were originated under the Main Street Lending Program.\nAnd we sold the 95% participation through the government as tabulated in the program.\nExpenses for the quarter were $134 million, almost $135 million, which is up from $107 million; again full quarter effect.\nThose expenses again include the $12 million in merger and restructuring costs for the quarter.\nSo far from the start of the process, we have incurred approximately $36 million in merger and restructuring costs.\nIt's part of the transaction.\nAnd we expect that there will be an additional somewhere between $26 million and $30 million happening mostly on the first half of 2021, as we complete integrations, conversions and a number of other things that are ongoing in the integration process.\nPandemic expenses, again, cleaning cost, additional security and things like that was -- were $1.1 million, basically similar to the $1 million we had in the third quarter.\nIf we exclude all these items, expenses went up $25 million, mostly again from having the full quarter of the acquired operations, but also the higher transaction volumes on debit, credit card and some other components increase cost, plus some additional items and some $900,000 in incentive compensation increases.\nWe had $2.3 million in technology fees.\nThe increased amortization of the intangibles associated with the transaction was about $1.5 million higher for the quarter.\nOn the other hand, if we look at credit-related expenses that were slightly down were $1.8 million compared to $2.2 million last quarter.\nThere is one item that has been affected by -- obviously by the moratorium programs and the delays on foreclosures and some other legal processes in the market.\nOver the next couple of quarters, we expect some increases in these categories as foreclosures and other legal processes come back to normal levels.\nAllowance for credit losses at December was $401 million, slightly down from about $402.6 million we had at September.\nHowever, the allowance for credit losses on loans was $385 million, $386 million almost, which is $1.2 million higher than September.\nThe ratio of the loans allowance was 3.28% as compared to 3.25% in September.\nThe provision for the quarter, as you saw on the release, was $7.7 million, which compares to almost $47 million in the quarter.\nBut again, third quarter included the $38.9 million provision, Day 1 provision we put in to comply with CECL requirements for non-PCD loans on the acquired operations.\nFor this quarter, the projected macroeconomic scenarios used for calculations of the allowance for credit losses showed improvements in many of the economic variables, including unemployment, which is a critical driver as compared to what we used in the third quarter.\nHowever, the CRA index shows deterioration in the quarter, mostly due to longer projected recovery time frames, especially on commercial retail real estate.\nAs a result of the required provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolios went up and we booked a provision of $22.3 million in the fourth quarter and the reserve or the allowance for credit losses increased $252.7 million or 2.7% of loans from our 2.3% of loans last quarter.\nIn the case of residential mortgages on the other hand, the improvement on macroeconomic variables combined with the reduction in the portfolio that I mentioned, the $130 million [Phonetic] reduction, resulted in a release of credit losses of $9.8 million for the quarter.\nAnd same thing on consumer side, the improvement on the macroeconomic variables resulted in a release of $2.3 million in reserves requirements.\nIf we exclude the PPP loans on a non-GAAP basis, the ratio of the allowance to loans would be 3.39%, which is still very healthy allowance coverage for possible losses at December.\nIt was 3.38% at September, so it stayed very consistent.\nIn terms of our asset quality, in non-performing, we're basically flat from last quarter, $294 million.\nNon-performing loans increased $3.80 million in the quarter, $2.6 million of the increase was in residential portfolio and $1.4 million in the consumer portfolio.\nOn the other hand, the other real estate owned came down by $6 million, driven by sales.\nWe sold $5.8 million of residential real estate, all the real estate that we had on the books.\nWith the expiration of the moratoriums, what we did see in this quarter was an increase in inflows.\nInflows of non-performing were $32.9 million compared to $18.4 million in the third quarter.\nBut if you compare the inflow -- this inflow level to pre-pandemic, these were very much in line to what we had -- what we saw in December of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020.\nEarly delinquency showed similar trends.\nWe also saw increases in early delinquency from September levels, but it still at levels that are below what we had at December of last year.\nSo, it's been still very consistent.\nRegarding capital ratios, I think that on the non-performing -- before we go to capital, I think that it's important to mention on the non-performing, the way we see it.\nWe do expect that there could be some increases, not major numbers, but some increases in non-performing on the first half of 2021, as we complete some of this process with the customers and win moratoriums and had impacts associated with the pandemic.\nAnd then by the second half of the year, those would get back to normal levels.\nSo it's temporary thing.\nWe feel it's going to be seen in the first half of 2021.\nRegarding capital again, Aurelio already touched, it's strong capital ratios.\nI do want to mention that leverage ratio shows a decrease from September, but it's all related to the fact that September we only had one month of acquired operation.\nTherefore, average balance which are used for the leverage were lower.\nThe level of leverage resulting of 11.3%, still very healthy and well in line with what we had expected at completion of the transaction.\nRegarding the year, again Aurelio touched on this.\nI don't want to go into a lot of detail, but clearly, the biggest impact was the provision.\nNet income for the year was $102 million or $0.46 a share, but it was affected by $130 million increase in provision, which includes pandemic impact and the fact that we did record the Day 1 CECL allowance of $39 million I mentioned before required for the loans -- the non-PCD loans we obtained under transaction.\nAdjusted pre-tax pre-provision for the year was up 6% to $300 million from $284 million.\nSo, it was a pretty good improvement.\nAnd that obviously includes some additional months from the acquired Santander operation.\nNPAs year over year decreased $24 million to $294 million, and we continue to work on the process of getting those numbers down.\nSummary: ",

Lucas and sea trials for DDG 121 Frank E. Peterson, Jr., both planned for the second half of this year.\nAnd on the LPD program, LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale remains on track to complete sea trials later this year.\nAnd LPD 29, Richard M. McCool, Jr., remains on schedule for launch early next year.\nThe team at Ingalls is also working closely with the Navy to put LPD 32 and 33, along with LHA nine under contract.\nThis bundle acquisition approach is the most affordable method to buy these ships.\nAnd when complete, affords predictable savings for the Navy.\nAt Newport News, the team was awarded a $3 billion contract for the refueling and complex overhaul of CVN 74 USS John C. Stennis, and also received a contract modification for construction of the 10th Virginia-class Block V submarine.\nThese key awards are additional building blocks for a record backlog, which now stands at nearly $49 billion.\nShifting to program status, CVN 79 Kennedy is approximately 81% complete.\nThe team is finalizing plans to support the single phase delivery requirements while continuing to focus on compartment completion and key initial test milestones.\nCVN 73 USS George Washington is approximately 87% complete and continues to make progress with the crew recently beginning to move back aboard the ship.\nThis is another key milestone is supported redelivery to the Navy planned for next year.\nOn the VCS program, SSN 794 Montana continues test program activities in preparation for delivery to the Navy planned for later this year.\nIn addition, SSN 796 New Jersey remains on track to achieve the float off milestone as planned in the second half of this year.\nAt Technical Solutions, the team booked several key awards during the quarter.\nThis included a $175 million fleet to statement recompete and a position on a Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific, ISR and cybersecurity IDIQ contract.\nAdditionally, production of the first Orca XLUUV modules is now under way at our unmanned systems center of excellence.\nApproximately 75% of all structural components have been fabricated, and assembly has commenced with final unit delivery to Boeing plan later this year.\nAnd finally, our Nuclear and Environmental Services business continues to perform very well with strong performance across our Department of Energy contracts at Los Alamos, Nevada and Savannah River.\nToday, I will briefly review our first quarter results.\nThis was primarily due to growth at Newport News and Ingalls that was largely offset by a decline of Technical Solutions due to divestitures associated with the portfolio-shaping actions we have taken.\nSegment operating income for the quarter of $191 million increased $35 million from the first quarter of 2020 and segment operating margin, 8.4%, increased 149 basis points.\nThe improvement was driven by higher risk retirement at Ingalls and improved performance to Technical Solutions.\nOperating income for the quarter of $147 million decreased by $68 million from the first quarter of 2020 and operating margin of 6.5% decreased 35 basis points.\nThese decreases were primarily driven by a less favorable operating FAS/CAS adjustment, partially offset by the stronger segment operating results compared to the prior year.\nThe tax rate in the quarter was approximately 15% compared to approximately 20% in the first quarter of 2020.\nThe decline in tax rate was primarily due to the divestiture of our oil and gas business as well as the recognition of R&D tax credits for the current year and prior periods.\nNet earnings in the quarter were $148 million compared to $172 million in the first quarter of 2020.\nDiluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.68 compared to $4.23 in the first quarter of 2020.\nExcluding the impact of pension, diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.56 compared to $2.43 in the first quarter of 2020.\nCash from operations was $43 million in the quarter and net capital expenditures were $59 million or 2.6% of revenues, resulting in free cash flow of negative $16 million.\nThis compares to cash from operations of $68 million and net capital expenditures of $66 million and free cash flow of $2 million in the first quarter of 2020.\nCash contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plan were $72 million in the quarter, of which $60 million were discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plans.\nDuring the first quarter, we paid dividends of $1.14 per share or $46 million.\nAs noted on our fourth quarter earnings call, we did reinitiate share repurchases earlier this year and continue to view the return of excess free cash flow via share repurchases as an integral part of our capital allocation strategy over the long term.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased approximately 292,000 shares at a cost of approximately $50 million.\nMoving on to pension.\nWith the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act, we have reviewed the five-year pension outlook that we provided on our last earnings call and continue to believe that remains the most appropriate view.\nDue to the limited nature of our projected contributions and the impact of lower cash sensitivity with safe harbor implementation, the passage of the legislation does not have a meaningful impact on our outlook.\nWe plan to provide an update to near-term pension expectations on our Q3 call, consistent with our prior cadence.\nIngalls revenues of $649 million in the quarter increased $20 million or 3.2% from the same period last year, driven primarily by higher revenues on the DDG program.\nIngalls operating income of $91 million and margin of 14% in the quarter were up from the first quarter of 2020, mainly due to higher risk retirement on LHA, which was related to the 25% completion milestone that Chris mentioned earlier.\nNewport News revenues of $1.4 billion in the quarter increased to $66 million or 4.9% from the same period last year due to higher revenues in both aircraft carrier and submarine construction as well as fleet support services.\nNewport News operating income of $93 million and margin 6.6% in the quarter were down slightly year-over-year, primarily due to lower risk retirement on CVN 73 RCOH, partially offset by higher risk retirement on VCS Block IV boats.\nTechnical Solutions revenues of $259 million in the quarter decreased 18.3% from the same period last year, mainly due to the divestitures of both our oil and gas business in the San Diego shipyard on February one of this year, partially offset by a full quarter of results from Hydroid, which was acquired at the end of the first quarter of 2020.\nTechnical Solutions operating income of $7 million in the quarter compares to a loss in the first quarter of 2020.\nThis was driven primarily by improved performance in Defense and Federal Solutions and Nuclear Environmental Services as well as a gain related to the sale of our oil and gas business.\nTurning to Slide nine.\nWe continue to expect we will finish the year with strict building operating margin in the 7% to 8% range with the significant remaining risk retirement events weighted toward the end of the year.\nIn addition, we expect shipbuilding margin for the first half of 2021 to be around the midpoint of our annual guidance range.\nWe continue to view the remainder of our 2021 guidance as appropriate with the exception of the effective tax rate, which we now expect to be approximately 18%.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We had another outstanding performance in the third quarter earning $0.81 per share.\nThis reflects, several factors, our consistently growing repairing net income, our larger scale, our focus on increasing digital utilization and customer service differentiation, and Puerto Rico's nascent economic and post-pandemic recovery.\nAll this continues to validate our optimism on Puerto Rico's economy and OFGs future.\nOur third quarter results confirm this across all businesses.\nTotal core revenues were $135 million, a 4% annualized increase compared to the second quarter.\nNet interest income increased to $103 million, in part that benefited from a 17% decline in cost of funds.\nBanking and financial services revenues rose 3%.\nProvision for credit losses was a $5 million net benefit as asset quality continue to trend to levels closer to U.S. peer banks.\nNon-interest expenses fell 5%, reflecting in part reduced credit-related expenses.\nAnd pre-provision net revenues increased to $56 million from $52 million in the second quarter.\nLooking at the September 30th balance sheet, customer deposits increased $154 million to $9.2 billion, reflecting even greater liquidity on the part of both commercial and consumer customers.\nAs a result, both cash and assets grew.\nLoans held for investment declined $87 million.\nExcluding PPP loan forgiven, they increased $5 million.\nNew loan origination remain strong at $556 million.\nEx-PPP originations now total more than $1.6 billion as of the nine months, that is up 69% compared to the same period last year and 79% compared to the same period in 2019 pre-COVID.\nDuring the third quarter, we also successfully executed on our capital actions.\nWe acquired $40.2 million of shares as part of our current $50 million buyback program.\nWe increased our common stock dividend to $0.12 per share from $0.08 in the first and second quarters, and $0.07 in the year ago quarter.\nAnd we completed our $92 million redemption of all preferred stock.\nPlease turn to Page 4.\nAt OFG, we believe better banking is built upon fulfilling our purpose, mainly helping our customers, our people and our communities achieve their financial well-being.\nDuring the third quarter, for our customers, we continue to demonstrate our agility by launching the first digital residential mortgage process in Puerto Rico.\nWith one click, in just minutes, a customer can get a pre-qualification letter, access valuable information about the mortgage process and apply online all in one place.\nWe also quickly process forgiveness for our PPP customers.\nWe have now processed forgiveness for 91% of first and 25% of second loan PPP loans using our proprietary all digital system.\nWe believe faster, better solutions like these, show our retail and commercial customers the value of doing business with Oriental.\nOnline and mobile banking 30 and 90-day utilization levels continue well above pre-pandemic levels.\nThese continues to validate our long-standing digital strategy and its growing acceptance by our customers in the market in general.\nFor our people, we have decided on a mandatory COVID vaccination policy to keep our customers and people safe.\nWe have also implemented a hybrid work model to increase flexibility for our people.\nAnd as we mentioned on the previous slide, we have increased the hourly base pay rate for non-salaried staff.\nFor our communities, PASH Global and Oriental closed on a $15 million financing for a joint venture between PASH and Puma Energy.\nThis is enabling 200 Puma gas stations in Puerto Rico to install solar panels to produce and consume solar energy.\nThis project is the first of its kind and scale on the island.\nWe have also been working on several new corporate social responsibility programs, one program launched in the third quarter is a farming developing program with the Puerto Rico conservation trust to help several communities achieve economic sustainability.\nWe are extremely proud of these achievements.\nAt the end of the day, there is nothing more rewarding them being part of a team that delivers on its purpose.\nThis quarter's overall performance energizes us at OFG to work harder and to aspire for more.\nNow, here's Maritza to go over the financials in more detail.\nPlease turn to Page 5 to review our financial highlights.\nTotal core revenues were $135 million.\nThere is an increase of about $1.4 million or about 4% analogized from the second quarter.\nThis is as a result of positive impact of $1.8 million declining in cost of funds, a $1 million increase in core non-interest income and $800,000 increase from cash and investment securities and $730,000 as a result of one additional day.\nThis more than offset a $2 million decline from B2B loans and a $700,000 loan prepayment that benefited fee income in the second quarter.\nThe PCD decline was due to a combination of lower volume, mainly from mortgage pay down on lower rates.\nNon-interest expenses totaled $79 million.\nThere is a decrease of $3.8 million from the second quarter.\nThe third quarter included a $2.2 million benefit in credit-related expenses.\nThis was mainly driven by gains on sales of real estate.\nThe second quarter included a $2.2 million technology project write down.\nThe third quarter also included a combination of increased compensation from hourly staff on our previously announced cost savings.\nOverall, we continue to see recurring operating expenses in line with our previously announced plans for the year.\nThe higher revenues and lower net-interest expenses resulted in increased operating leverage.\nThe efficiency ratio improved to 58.6%.\nThis compares to 62% in the second quarter.\nOur goal is to continue to improve our efficiency ratio to the mid to lower 50% range.\nReturn on average assets was 1.6%, return on average tangible common equity was 70.7%.\nWe continue to build capital.\nTangible book value per share was $18.59.\nThis is an increase of 3% from the second quarter.\nPlease turn to Page 6 to review our operational highlights.\nAverage loan balances totaled $6.5 billion.\nThere is a decline of $133 million from the second quarter.\nThis was due primarily to residential mortgage pay downs on PPP loan forgiveness.\nIn turn, this was partially offset by new commercial and auto loans.\nThe change in mix resulted in a 7 basis point decline in loan yields.\nHigher levels of residential mortgage breakdowns reflected increased liquidity on the part of consumers.\nOur residential mortgage portfolio consists of legacy Oriental mortgage loans and mortgage loans from the BBVA and Scotiabank acquisition.\nThose are new origination worth $556 million, ex-PPP that is down $85 million from the second quarter, but it is up $109 million year-over-year.\nWe believe we are continuing to see generally a strong trends in mortgage, commercial and auto.\nWe continue to see increase in demand from commercial loans to expand business operations, with the new stores and warehouses, buying inventory or making acquisitions.\nCommercial portfolio [Indecipherable] ex-PPP has increased two consecutive quarters.\nAverage core deposits totaled $9.1 billion.\nThere is an increase of 1.6% or $140 million from the second quarter.\nIncreases in non-interest bearing accounts, savings accounts and non-accounts were partially offset by the decline in customer CDs.\nCore deposit costs continue to fall.\nThey were 30 basis points in the third quarter.\nThat is a reduction of 8 basis points from the second quarter.\nThis reflects general rate reductions and the continued maturity of older, higher price CDs.\nAs a result of the increase in deposits, average cash balances totaled $2.7 billion billion.\nThere is an increase of 7% or $180 million from the second quarter.\nThe average investment portfolio was $750 million that increased $100 million or 70% from the second quarter.\nThat includes the partial impact of $250 million of MBS purchases at the end of the quarter, taking advantage of market conditions.\nNet interest margin was 4.12%, a decline of 10 basis points from the second quarter.\nThey increased amount of cash, reduced NIM by 6 basis points.\nOur current strategy is to continue to look for opportunities to deploy excess liquidity through lending, capital actions for investments.\nPlease turn to Page 7 to review our credit quality and capital strength.\nAsset quality metrics continue trend positively.\nOur net charge-offs were 37 basis points.\nThird quarter net charge-off of $6 million [Phonetic] included $6.5 million for our previously reserved amount on our commercial loans.\nThe early and total delinquency rates were 2.06% and 3.82% respectively, some of the lowest levels in the last five quarters.\nThe non-performing loan rates on the non-PCD loan portfolio was 1.93%.\nIt's lowest level in the last five quarters.\nAs a result of all of these, provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $5 million, that reflects $4.3 million of net reserve release.\nOur allowance coverage was 2.82% on a reported basis and 2.88% excluding PPP loans.\nThe CET1 ratio remains high compared to our U.S. peers at 13.52%.\nStockholders' equity was $1.05 billion, a decline of $26 million from the second quarter.\nThis reflected the redemption of Preferred Stock Series D and the common stock buyback, a good portion of this was offset by the increase in [Indecipherable].\nThe tangible common equity ratio was 8.86%.\nPlease turn to Page 8 for our conclusion.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we had a strong performance this quarter at all levels.\nOur performance and credit metrics continue to be equal to or better than Mainland peers.\nWe executed most of our stock buyback program in addition to increasing our common share dividend and redeeming our preferred stock.\nLooking at the big picture, Puerto Rico continues to benefit from federal reconstruction and COVID stimulus.\nBut the relative economic impact here is more meaningful than in other U.S. jurisdictions, given the size of our economy and average incomes.\nAs a result, we continue to see incremental business sector optimism, confirming Puerto Rico's economic revival.\nOur plan is to continue to take advantage of our momentum in this improved economic environment.\nWe intend to deploy excess liquidity for loan growth and/or capital return initiatives.\nWe also intend to accelerate the speed of our transformation, further simplify operations and improve efficiencies, all part of our effort to serve customers faster and better, while helping them achieve their financial well being.\nWe at OFG are more than ready.\nOperation, please begin the question-and-answer session.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:They are based on management's assumptions, which may or may not occur.\nIn addition, some of our comments today reference non-GAAP adjusted measures.\nWe expect to file our 10-Q later today.\n[Operator Instructions] and will be available on our website following the call.\nPlease note these calls are designed for the financial community.\nI hope you, your families, your work colleagues are safe and well.\nLike all of you, we continue to navigate these unusual times.\nCities within our service territory began reopening in the second quarter.\nAnd like many parts of our country, we began seeing an increase in COVID cases in late July.\nBut it has appeared to plateau lightly.\nNow more than ever, we are tapping into our core value of caring for each other and the communities we serve.\nFrom a business perspective, we continue to focus on providing safe and reliable service while ensuring the health and safety of our employees.\nWe continue to benefit from a conservative business model with stable utility margins.\nA majority of our revenues have recovery mechanisms in place to weather normalize and to decouple margins.\nWe also remain focused on efficient operations.\nThat, combined with the decline in natural gas prices, has led to natural gas bills that are about 40% lower today than they were 15 years ago, which is very good news for our customers.\nThe third leg to our strategy is to look for growth that fits our conservative risk profile.\nMost recently, this has been a new contractual revenue stream from the North Mist gas storage expansion and, of course, our water and wastewater businesses.\nOur solid business strategy allows us to adapt to unforeseen challenges, such as the coronavirus.\nAnd our core values of integrity, safety, caring, service ethic and environmental stewardship are the foundation and guiding principles for all we do.\nSafety continues to be a value at the forefront of our minds, and we remain vigilant during this pandemic regarding the safety of our 1,200 employees and, of course, the 2.5 million people that we serve.\nOur natural gas and water utilities are critical infrastructure.\nWe've continued all essential options to provide reliable service while following relevant health and safety guidelines, including guidance from OSHA and the CDC.\nWe've created a specialized field team that takes extra precautions when responding to calls where there's a known or suspected case of COVID.\nIn the vein of caring and customer assistance, we temporarily stopped disconnecting customers and charging late fees on past-due bills.\nWe are also providing financial assistance through a variety of programs, including our corporate philanthropy fund, easy for me to say, our gas assistance program, several state and federal programs and, of course, a special employee giving campaign.\nIn June, we issued a $17 million bill credit to Oregon customers, which is a record amount under this sharing mechanism.\nAt the same time, we continue to see strong customer growth.\nNew construction plus conversions translated into connecting over 13,000 new customers during the last 12 months, which equated to a growth rate of 1.7%.\nWhile we can't predict the full economic effects of the pandemic, we continue to see mitigating factors for our business with our resilient business model, the timing of the onset of the pandemic and our conservative and efficient business operations.\nNot only do we care for customers, we also care deeply about our employees, and I am proud of how quickly our employees have adapted adopted rather, new safety procedures and embraced working remotely, all the while they have maintained the highest service and productivity levels.\nDuring this excuse me, we're also reminded of the importance of social justice in our workplace.\nAs a company, we have publicly stated that racism in any shape or form is not tolerated at Northwest Natural.\nAnd for years, we have actively progressed in the anti-racism and equity agenda, not only internally with our employees, but also founding and supporting wider community diversity initiatives and meeting aggressive goals to provide business opportunities to minority and female-owned businesses.\nToday, our culture is one of accountability, creativity and collaboration that is inclusive and supports opportunities for all employees.\nThis work is not easy, and there are no shortcuts.\nWe are focused on continuous improvement and we'll keep fostering such an environment, building diverse workforce across all levels in our organization, providing equity in pay and development opportunities and ensuring inclusion so all voices are heard and respected.\nNow turning to the progress we've made related to environmental stewardship.\nI'm pleased to share that in July, we've reached an important milestone here in Oregon.\nRulemaking was completed on groundbreaking renewable natural gas legislation, what we call Senate Bill 98, which enables us to put renewable natural gas, or RNG, on our system and take the next step in our state's energy transition.\nRNG is a zero-carbon resource produced from organic materials like food, agriculture and forestry waste, wastewater or landfills that can be added into the existing natural gas system.\nAll forms of RNG are supported in the law, including renewable hydrogen.\nThe law enables us to acquire RNG on behalf of Oregon customers and goes further than any other law by outlining goals for adding as much as 30% RNG into the state's pipeline system by 2050.\nIt allows up to 5% of a utility's revenue requirement to be used to cover the incremental costs of RNG.\nCurrently, that equates to about $30 million annually for Northwest Natural.\nGas utilities are also allowed to rate base interconnections with the gas system and could include RNG facilities and rate base, if that is the lowest-cost option for customers.\nWe're pleased to take this significant step forward with the support of the legislator legislature, governor and regulators.\nLast week, Northwest Natural and all parties in the Oregon general rate case filed a comprehensive stipulation with the Public Utility Commission of Oregon.\nThe filing includes a $45.8 million increase in revenue requirement compared to a requested $71.4 million amount.\nThis stipulation is based on the previously settled capital components, including a capital structure of 50-50 debt and equity and a return on Equity of 9.4% and a cost of capital of just under 7%.\nIn addition, the stipulation reflects average rate base of approximately $1.45 billion.\nNorthwest Natural's filing is subject to OPUC approval.\nAnd if approved, new rates are expected to take effect on November one this year.\nThis is also the time that our revised purchased gas adjustment, or PGA, takes effect.\nThis year's PGA forecasts a reduction to customers' bills, which offset the majority of this base rate increase we just settled on.\nWe commend the commissioners and parties for their ability to continue working virtually under less-than-ideal conditions.\nI'll begin with a summary of our second quarter and year-to-date financials, and then discuss the key metrics and financial implications of COVID-19 on our business and guidance for 2020.\nI'll describe earnings drivers on an after-tax basis using the statutory tax rate of 26.5%.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.6% as a result of the return of excess deferred income taxes to our Oregon customers.\nAlso note that earnings per share comparisons were impacted by the issuance of 1.4 million shares in June of 2019 as we raised equity to fund investments in our gas utility.\nFor the quarter, we reported a net loss from continuing operations of $5.1 million or $0.17 per share compared to net income of $2.1 million or $0.07 per share for the same period in 2019.\nThe decline in earnings for the quarter reflects two key drivers.\nFirst, the second quarter results reflect the financial impacts of COVID-19 on margin, O&M and interest expense.\nWe estimate the total impact of COVID-19 to be in about approximate to be approximately $4 million or $0.12 per share, most of which hit in the second quarter.\nWe have recorded a deferral for a portion of these costs with an offsetting reserve until we have more clarity with regulators as to the recoverability of these costs.\nSecond, last year's second quarter results benefited from the reversal of an earnings test reserved for environmental remediation expenses that we booked in the first quarter equal to $0.11 per share.\nLooking at the gas distribution segment.\nUtility margin decreased $1 million.\nHigher customer rates in Washington, customer growth and revenues from the North Mist expansion project contributed $2.9 million, which was more than offset by a $3.2 million increase in environmental remediation expense due to the reserve release in the prior year.\nCOVID impacts on margin are estimated to be $1.5 million, including a $700,000 decline in revenues from lower late charges and disconnection fees as we temporarily and voluntarily suspended these charges in March.\nIn addition, we experienced slightly lower usage from industrial and commercial use customers that were not decoupled.\nUtility O&M increased $2.8 million in the quarter as we incurred higher contractor service costs related to pipeline and meter safety as well as moving expenses as we transition to a new headquarters and operations center.\nIn addition, compensation costs increased related to additional IT staff and higher wages under the new five-year union contract.\nFinally, O&M increased $200,000 due to the higher reserve for bad debt related to COVID.\nDepreciation expense and general taxes increased $2 million related to our continued investment in our system, including the North Mist gas storage facility, which was placed into rates in May of 2019.\nInterest expense increased $1.1 million related to several financings undertaken in March to increase cash on hand as a precautionary measure during a significant market period of significant market volatility amid the early stages of the pandemic.\nFor the first six months of 2020, we reported net income from continuing operations of $43.1 million or $1.41 per share compared to net income of $45.5 million or $1.56 per share for the same period in 2019.\nLast year's results included a regulatory disallowance of $0.23 per share related to an Oregon Commission order.\nExcluding that disallowance, on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.79 for 2019.\nThe $0.38 per share decline is largely due to year-over-year growth in expenses and the effects of COVID-19.\nIn the gas distribution segment, utility margin increased $100,000.\nHigher customer rates in Washington, customer growth and revenues from the North Mist expansion project contributed an additional $10.1 million.\nThis was partially offset by lower entitlement and curtailment fees related to pipeline constraints in 2019 and warmer weather in 2020 compared to 2019, which collectively reduced margin by $4.9 million.\nThe remaining $5.2 million decline in utility margin is a result of the March 2019 Oregon order related to tax reform and pension expense.\nWith the exception of the first quarter pension disallowance, this order has no impact on net income as offsetting adjustments were recognized through expenses and income taxes, as I'll describe in a moment.\nUtility O&M and other expenses declined $6.9 million during the first six months of 2020.\nThis decrease is the result of accounting entries associated with the 2019 Oregon order, which resulted in $14 million of additional expense in the first quarter of 2019, as discussed previously.\nThis was offset by a $5.8 million increase in underlying O&M related to the cost drivers I described in the quarterly results.\nOver the last several years, we have invested in our gas system at historically high levels, and we placed the North Mist gas facility into service.\nAs a result, depreciation expense increased $4.9 million.\nFinally, 2019 utility segment tax expense included a $5.9 million benefit related to implementing the March order with no significant resulting effect on net income.\nNet income from our other businesses declined $1.5 million from lower asset management revenues due to less favorable market conditions.\nNow regarding the financial effects of COVID-19.\nWhile our business model is resilient and the initial timing of the event occurred after Northwest Natural's peak heating season, we are experiencing some financial impacts related to the pandemic.\nThrough June 30, we have an estimated $4 million of combined incremental costs and lower revenues.\nBased on our experience to date and expectations for the future, we'll closely monitor the following items.\nFirst, we continue to track commercial customer losses as a result of businesses closing their doors and today have not seen a significant change or near-term implications on customer growth, but it is still very early in the economic contraction.\nSecond, we are also monitoring the loss of late fee revenue and potential bad debt expense.\nWe have doubled our reserve for bad debts from $800,000 in June 2019 to $1.6 million at June of 2020.\nThird, we have experienced some decline in industrial and large commercial customer usage, but have not seen a substantial reduction to date.\nAs discussed, we took several steps to improve our liquidity position by increasing cash on hand.\nAs a result, we had over $470 million of cash at the end of the first quarter.\nAs market conditions have improved, we reduced that to $137 million.\nWhile there is an incremental interest costs associated with these financings, we believe it is relatively inexpensive insurance given the volatility in the market.\nWe've applied for regulatory deferrals to recover certain of these costs and are working closely with our regulators to reach agreement on the type and amount of costs that will be eligible for recovery.\nIn addition, we are taking actions to ensure we are operating effectively and efficiently, and these savings also moderate the impact of COVID.\nIn summary, second quarter results are coming in about where we expected them to be, and we continue to monitor this evolving situation as we approach the next heating season.\nToday, we reaffirm guidance for the continuing operations in the range of $2.25 to $2.45 per share and guide toward the lower end of the range due to the potential implications of COVID-19.\nGuidance also assumes continued customer growth, average weather conditions and no significant changes in prevailing regulatory policies, mechanisms or outcomes or significant laws, legislation or regulations.\nFinally, this guidance excludes any gain related to the sale of Gill Ranch and associated operating results.\nThese items are reported in discontinued operations.\nWe continue to monitor the impact of the pandemic on our capital programs.\nAt this time, we do not expect a material change in our capital expenditure range of $240 million to $280 million.\nWe are anticipating some lower expenditures related to customer acquisition due to the economic downturn, but the majority of our capex is maintenance in nature and includes some large projects that have already begun.\nWhile we continue to focus on day-to-day operations, we're also advancing key long-term objectives.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we strive to provide stable earnings while adding new earnings streams with similar risk and cash flow profiles as our regulated gas utility.\nWe believe the regulated water utility sector fits this profile and aligns with our core capabilities.\nFurthermore, the investment potential is promising as the water industry is highly fragmented, and in many cases, these utilities have not been able to adequately invest in their infrastructure.\nTo that end, in 2017, we began building our water utility business, and I'm very proud of the progress we've made to date with regulatory policies, mechanisms.\nWhile we've seen some decline in activity lately due to travel restrictions related to COVID, so far, in 2020, we closed several transactions, including Suncadia in Washington State and our first water utility in Texas.\nIn addition, we continue to execute on our tuck-in strategy and around our existing systems.\nJust a few days ago, we closed our first municipal transaction in Idaho, acquiring water and wastewater utilities near our falls water system in Idaho Falls and signed another agreement to acquire a small water system in the region.\nCumulatively, we've invested $110 million in this space.\nOperationally, the water utilities continue performing well amid the pandemic.\nWe leveraged our natural gas expertise to follow best practices regarding health and safety guidance for COVID, provide centralized resources and planning as well as provide a larger, stronger balance sheet.\nThe ability of our water utilities to work together along with our gas utility during this crisis further validates our roll-up strategy.\nIn closing, our company has weathered many things in the last 162 years, and I'm confident in our ability to handle the challenges at hand.\nI stand behind our commitment to customers to provide safe and reliable service, and I believe in our regulated business strategy and the resilience of this team.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports.\nYou should also note that we will be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data.\nOur core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business.\nReconciliation of core results to comparable GAAP value can be found in the investor relations section of our website at corning.com.\nYou may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the interactive analyst center.\nWe encourage you to follow along.\nThey're also available on our website for downloading.\nToday, we reported third quarter results demonstrating that the company is strong, financially healthy and well positioned for growth.\nSales were $3 billion, up 16% sequentially.\nEPS grew 72% sequentially to $0.43, as higher sales and strong manufacturing execution resulted in operating margin expanding to 18.3%, up 710 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points year-over-year.\nWe generated $518 million of free cash flow and finished the quarter with $2.5 billion in cash.\nOur financial performance has improved significantly since April, and we expect a strong fourth quarter.\nNevertheless, we remain vigilant and continue to adapt appropriately to multiple disruptive forces playing out around the world from the pandemic, the civil unrest to recession and geopolitical struggles.\nWe've been rising to the challenges since day one, and our priorities remain clear.\nFirst, we must make our values evident in our actions.\nOur commitment to the health, safety, and well-being of our employees underlines every facet of our operations.\nWe're dedicating resources and providing leadership to support our communities around the world.\nWe've launched Unity campaigns as well as racial and social equality programs targeting the multitude of hardships people are confronting right now.\nAnd when it comes to the global health fight, we're all in, mobilizing our capabilities to combat the virus directly.\nWe must also safeguard our financial health.\nOur third-quarter results show that our decisive actions are providing clear benefits as we leverage cost savings and increase efficiencies across the company.\nRegardless of the depth or duration of global uncertainty, we're doing everything in our power to keep the company strong, and it's working.\nNow to ensure that we emerge even stronger, we're continuing to invest to create additional revenue streams.\nWe're inventing new-to-the-world materials and manufacturing processes as well as co-innovating new solutions in partnership with our customers.\nThe relevance of our portfolio puts Corning at the heart of ongoing innovation with industry leaders, and we continue to solve our customers' toughest technology challenges.\nYou may have seen Apple's recent promotion of ceramic shield for the iPhone 12.\nTheir featuring are new-to-the-world material, which is the world's first, highly transparent color-free glass ceramic with performance that meets the rigorous demands put on smartphone cover materials.\nThis latest innovation with Apple exemplifies our ongoing strategy of consistent, long-term value creation by combining our deep expertise in glass science, ceramic science and optical physics with our unparalleled manufacturing and engineering capabilities.\nCeramic shield melds the attributes that we love about glass, create optics and retain strength with the attributes we love about ceramics, most notably, it's toughness.\nCeramics shield consist of ceramic crystals within a glass matrix.\nThere were two big inventions here.\nThe first was keeping the best damage-resistant attributes of both glass and ceramics.\nThe second was ensuring high optical transparency by growing index-matched nanocrystals inside the glass matrix that are one-tenth the wavelength of late.\nAs you recall, Apple made two investments in Corning, totaling $450 million, as part of their advanced manufacturing fund and their commitment to foster innovation among American manufacturers.\nWe could not be prouder to be a key component in the iPhone 12.\nNow, it's important to note the iPhone 12, and many other flagship phones that we are also proud to be part of, support 5G.\n5G matters to us.\nThe density of fiber necessary to deliver its promise is yet another example.\nYou've seen us illustrate that up to 100x more fiber is required to deploy 5G in a city than 4G.\nThis week, we announced a new product design to help operators dramatically boost the speed and reduce the cost of their outdoor deployments.\nAnd we're embarking on new work to support Verizon's efforts to extend 5G indoors.\nThe relevance of our portfolio and our deep customer relationships, as illustrated by these advancements, keep us at the center of the inexorable shift to optical.\nStepping back, in all the industries we serve, important market trends offer new challenges.\nThe Corning is uniquely qualified to address and new opportunities to integrate more Corning content into products.\nThis is an especially powerful value creation lever in times of economic uncertainty, because we aren't exclusively relying on people buying more stuff.\nWe're putting more Corning into the products that people are already buying.\nWe are clearly seeing the benefits of this lever in today's results as innovation adoption drove specialty materials sales up 23% year-over-year despite a declining smartphone market.\nThis type of outperformance is not unique.\nFrom 2016 to 2019, we added $500 million in sales, or 42% cumulatively, while smartphone sales actually went down.\nAnd we're extending that growth streak this year.\nIn environmental technologies, we grew sales 16% in 2019, much faster than the underlying unit demand as automakers added gas particulate filters to cars.\nAnd we, again, saw outperformance this quarter with sequential sales up 68%.\nThese are additional examples of the more Corning strategy at work and why the content story is so powerful for us.\nI want to stress one additional point.\nYou often hear us say that our core technologies enable life-changing capabilities.\nIn these times, we're increasing focus on life-saving innovations.\nSafe widespread vaccine delivery is one of society's top priorities, and glass packaging is critical.\nOur Valor innovation will help enable faster filling line speeds and increased patient safety.\nRight now, we're expanding capacity and supplying glass vials for vaccines as part of operation work speed, all while leveraging our leadership in life sciences to help support COVID diagnostic testing and virus research efforts.\nAdditionally, reduced fine particulate pollution, the objective of our filtration products, appears to be helpful for reducing infection rates.\nAnd we're excited about recent university lab test, showing that our guardian antimicrobial glass particles, kill bacteria and viruses, including SARS-COV2.\nWe're also well-positioned to contribute as consumers continue to adapt to a world with social distancing.\nFor example, fiber increases the capacity and performance of networks, and glass provides the primary window to information and entertainment.\nWe're confident that we can bring further innovations to bear in many vital areas as the world addresses and recovers from these current challenges.\nOverall, we had a very strong quarter on almost every dimension.\nFrom an innovation perspective, I just reviewed our significant advancements.\nFinancially, we grew sales at double-digit rate sequentially and expanded margins to grow profitability even faster.\nOperationally, we performed well, and I'd like to share a few examples.\nIn the midst of the pandemic, we deployed expert engineering teams to start-up our Gen 10.5 melting operations in both Wuhan and Guangzhou.\nThese facilities are positioning on us well to capture the fast-growing demand for large TVs.\nIn mobile consumer electronics, we successfully scaled up a new-to-the-world manufacturing process and product to meet Apple's iPhone launch.\nIn automotive, we flexed our operations to adjust to the fast pace ramp-up at OEMs after they significantly reduced production in Quarter 2.\nIn optical communications, we successfully adjusted our cost to the current market environment, resulting in significant profitability expansion, despite flattish sales, on a quarter-over-quarter basis.\nWe also remain vigilant in our actions to safeguard the company's financial strength.\nWe're proud of our execution, especially given the current global uncertainties.\nClearly, our employees around the world are dedicated to living our values and giving their best every day.\nWe had a very strong third quarter.\nAs Wendell highlighted, we executed effectively, and we bolstered our healthy balance sheet despite the ongoing macroeconomic challenges.\nSales growth and cost actions led to strong sequential margin expansion, further demonstrating that our operational adjustments are working.\nWe've made significant adjustments to align our cost and operating plan with the lower anticipated sales.\nIn total, Corning continues to demonstrate that it has the resources to deliver on our commitments and extend our leadership as we continue to focus on operational excellence, cash flow generation, and prudent capital allocation.\nBefore I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to call out the changes at Hemlock during Q3 and cover the differences between GAAP and core results.\nOn September 9, Hemlock Semiconductor group redeemed DuPont's 40.25% ownership interest in the company, which transformed Corning's longtime ownership in Hemlock into a majority position.\nIn the second transaction, Hemlock purchased certain manufacturing assets from DuPont and gained control of a critical raw material, thereby becoming a leading, low-cost producer of ultra-pure polysilicon to the semiconductor industry.\nHemlock's leadership position is backed by attractive the long-term take-or-pay customer contracts with upfront payments.\nNow, we're very excited about these transactions.\nThey are good for Hemlock, good for Corning, and good for our shareholders.\nWe didn't put any money into the transaction, and Hemlock generates a lot of cash so its debt is mostly paid back in one year.\nCorning improves its financials by adding sales and earnings.\nIn the third quarter, we recognized $31 million of sales from the newly consolidated Hemlock.\nAnd Hemlock will add approximately $150 million in annual cash flow.\nPlease see our web disclosure for helpful consolidation details.\nNow on to GAAP.\nThe largest differences between our third-quarter GAAP and core results are a noncash gain associated with the Hemlock transaction, ongoing restructuring charges, which are primarily noncash, and a mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts.\nNow with respect to the mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter.\nFor us, this reduced GAAP earnings in Q3 by $103 million.\nTo be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.\nOur currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth, and our future shareholder distributions.\nOur non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant-currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions.\nWe're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides.\nWe've received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since our inception more than five years ago.\nNow, I'll walk through our third quarter performance.\nAt the outset of the pandemic, we committed to preserving our financial strength and positioning the company to emerge even stronger.\nIn Q1 and Q2, we told you we were responding to economic uncertainty by making significant operational adjustments.\nWe said we reduced cost and capital spend to align with lower anticipated sales.\nAnd while ramping down production and reducing inventory impacts margins, we said that when sales growth resumed, we expect improved profitability.\nNow, looking at the third quarter, we grew 16% -- sales grew 16% sequentially to $3 billion, and our operating margin expanded by 710 basis points sequentially, to 18.3%.\nThis resulted in net income of $380 million and earnings per share of $0.43, up 72% sequentially.\nWe also said we would maintain a strong cash balance and generate positive free cash flow for the year.\nIn the third quarter, free cash flow grew to $518 million, cumulative free cash flow for the first three quarters was $484 million.\nWe ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.5 billion and expect to generate additional positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter as we continue to reduce cost, control inventory and execute well overall.\nAs a result, I'm confident that we will succeed on our free cash flow goals.\nThese actions -- the actions we're taking are clearly working.\nWe have delivered great operational improvements, which started to show results in Q2, and really accelerated in Q3.\nWe expect the benefit of these actions to continue in Q4, contributing to another strong quarter.\nNow, let's review the business segments.\nIn display technologies, third quarter sales were $827 million, up 10% sequentially, and net income was $196 million, up 29% sequentially.\nDisplay glass volume grew approximately 10% sequentially, as panel makers increase utilization, resulting in strong incrementals.\nSequential price declines were moderate, as expected.\nFrom an end-market perspective, it appears that the impact from COVID-19 has been a positive.\nIn developed markets, consumers are prioritizing in-home entertainment.\nGlobally, work and study from home trends are growing.\nThis is increasing demand for TV and IT products.\nOn the other hand, smartphone demand has been down.\nIn total, the retail market, as measured in square feet of glass, is up mid-single digits year-to-date through August.\nOf course, the upcoming holiday retail season will be a big factor in how the market actually plays out for the full year.\nLonger term, we remain confident that TV screen size will continue to grow.\nTVs at 65 inches or larger grew 40% year-to-date through August.\nAnd we are well positioned to capture the majority of that growth with Gen 10.5, which is the most efficient gen size for large TV manufacturing.\nWe continue to expect display pricing to decline by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2020.\nWe believe that three factors drive a favorable glass pricing environment: First, we expect glass supply/demand to be balanced to tight.\nFor Corning, we are ramping our Gen 10.5 tanks to align with panel makers' schedules.\nSecond, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels.\nAnd third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations.\nGlass prices must support acceptable returns on those investments.\nIn optical communications, third-quarter sales grew 10% sequentially to $909 million, as carrier spending and deployments remain stable and enterprise sales grew slightly.\nNet income grew by $34 million or 42% to $115 million, driven by improving cost performance.\nLooking forward, demand on the network is at an all-time high, and we are seeing positive statements on capacity expansion from network operators.\nCurrently, COVID-related factors hampered the ability to invest broadly in networks, and operators are focusing efforts on addressing capacity bottlenecks.\nWe believe operators will begin additional investments to reestablish normal network headroom and expand offerings.\nLarge-carrier and enterprise capital projects are inevitable.\nBut as we've said before, it's always hard to predict the timing.\nEnvironmental technology sales in the third quarter were $379 million, up 68% sequentially as markets recovered and OEMs continued to adopt GPS in Europe and China.\nWe effectively adjusted our operations to pace with the market recovery and delivered net income of $69 million, compared to breakeven in the second quarter.\nThe business team did a great job over the last six months in reacting to the rapid shutdown and restart of auto production by controlling cost and maintaining flexibility.\nAutomotive sales increased 1% year-over-year as continued strong adoption of GPS helped us exceed vehicle production, which declined 6% year over year.\nIn the quarter, we saw continued strong market performance in China, up slightly year over year.\nNorth America and European OEMs more than doubled production sequentially, but declined 5% on a year-over-year basis.\nDiesel sales improved 49% from the second quarter, but we're still down 15% year-over-year.\nThe North American heavy-duty truck market improved, but remains in a cyclical downturn with vehicle production down 46% year-over-year.\nThird-quarter sales of heavy-duty vehicles in China, however, continue to exceed 2019 levels, and adoption of advanced content increased in preparation for China 6 regulations.\nNo doubt, this has been a challenging year for our automotive market access platform.\nHowever, we are recovering faster than the market due to increasing content, primarily GPS and advanced heavy-duty products.\nOur content-driven strategy continues to drive strong results.\nSpecialty materials sales were $570 million in the third quarter, up 23% year-over-year and in sharp contrast to the smartphone market, which declined.\nNet income grew 59% year over year to $146 million.\nSales growth was driven by Ceramic Shield, our new-to-the-world glass ceramic on the iPhone 12 as well as premium glass sales, IT and tablet glass sales in support of work from home trends, and strength in our advanced optic products.\nIn brief, strong adoption and commercialization of our innovations produced strong year-over-year results for the third quarter for specialty materials, and we expect that to be true for full year 2020 as well.\nIn life sciences, North America lab utilization is increasing, and the pandemic is driving demand for laboratory diagnostic test in consumables.\nAs a result, we are seeing increased demand for our products.\nIn July, we carried out our long-term plan to ramp a new, larger distribution center needed to support our growth and enhance our ability to address our customers' increased needs around the world.\nStarting up this center in the middle of a pandemic proved to be more difficult than we expected, which constrained third-quarter sales.\nSales declined 8% sequentially.\nNet income declined 10%, in line with the lower volume.\nWe have added resources where required implemented recovery plans and are confident that operations will support the required output in Q4.\nAs a result, we expect strong sequential life science growth in the fourth quarter.\nNow, I'll turn to our balance sheet and our dedication to financial stewardship.\nAs I mentioned at the outset of the pandemic, we committed to preserving our financial strength and positioning the company to emerge even stronger.\nI've discussed the operational improvements we've implemented and our strong free cash flow generation.\nIt is also important to note that we continue to maintain a conservative balance sheet with a strong cash position that ended the quarter at $2.5 billion.\nAnd we have a debt structure that is conservative by design and relatively unique.\nToday, our average debt maturity is about 25 years, the longest in the S&P 500.\nOver the next 15 months, we have under $70 million coming due.\nLess than half of our total debt is due within the next 20 years.\nAnd during this time, there is no single year with debt repayment over $500 million.\nOur balance sheet is built for times like these.\nAs I've previously mentioned, we expect to generate positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter and for the year.\nWe also expect to maintain a strong cash position and to maintain our dividend.\nWe have the financial resources needed for the duration of the economic slowdown.\nIn closing, we demonstrated outstanding operational performance in the quarter with significant sequential improvement in sales, net income, earnings per share and free cash flow.\nWe are successfully carrying out the operational and financial goals we set up to stay strong during the crisis.\nWe expect another solid quarter to end the year.\nWe remain aware of potential impacts from the pandemic, the global recession, civil unrest, and geopolitical tensions.\nRegardless of how long or what shape the recovery takes, Corning is effectively safeguarding its financial strength, our growth drivers are intact and we continue advancing important growth initiatives with leaders in industries we serve.\nWe are confident that our execution and market leadership positions us to emerge from the current global uncertainty even stronger.\nWith that, let's move to Q&A.\nWe're ready for our first question.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings.\nThese risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.\nWe closed on the acquisition of Apple Leisure Group on November 1, and we are collectively even more thrilled about the prospects for the combined company today than we were when we first announced our plans back in August.\nAs I reflect over the past several months during which I've gotten to know the ALG team much better, met with hotel owners and toured a number of stunning AMR collection resorts.\nI'm energized and really excited about the bright future for ALG as a part of Hyatt.\nThe cultural fit between our two companies with a joint focus of care could not be better.\nAnd the timing is proving to be very auspicious as leisure demand continues to be durable and a growing proportion of our segment mix.\nWe look forward to keeping you well informed on the progress of our integration efforts and performance of the ALG platform moving forward.\nTurning to our results.\nWe are another quarter into the recovery and have again produced results that demonstrate the strength of our business and reinforce that we are emerging from this challenging period as a more agile and stronger company.\nIn the span of just two quarters, our quarterly adjusted EBITDA has improved $130 million, recovering to nearly 70% of 2019 levels in the third quarter.\nWe've worked tirelessly to evolve and reimagine aspects of our operating model and the financial results and our momentum demonstrate our progress.\nImportantly, while we have been focused on preserving cash and managing expenses tightly, we've invested in areas that are driving growth, and we have not wavered from our long-term strategy.\nWith vaccination rates continuing to rise, travel restrictions around the world easing and borders reopening, I am as confident as I've ever been that we are on a path to full recovery.\nI'm optimistic that the most recent trends in our business and also the important developments over the past quarter, including, of course, the acquisition of ALG demonstrates significant progress toward realizing the benefits of our long-term strategy.\nBefore diving deeper into the progress on our strategy, let's take a look at the latest business trends.\nRevPAR in the third quarter continued to recover at a robust pace, accelerating nearly 30% compared to the second quarter and doubling RevPAR levels in the first quarter.\nAs discussed on our last earnings call, we experienced a wave of leisure demand during the summer with systemwide RevPAR eclipsing $100 in July, which was approximately 75% recovered as compared to 2019.\nAs we moved into August, RevPAR decelerated by approximately 10% as compared to July driven by seasonality, coupled with reimposed travel restrictions in certain markets related to the Delta variant.\nHowever, this deceleration was short-lived.\nDemand rebounded throughout September and has strengthened further as we move into the fourth quarter.\nAbsolute RevPAR in October is nearly as strong as July at $98.\nWhat is encouraging is that the recovery has broadened, whereas our strength in July was primarily driven by resort locations, the improvement more recently has been from urban locations, which experienced RevPAR growth of 10% in October as compared to July.\nFrom a segmentation perspective, Leisure Transient remains the top-performing segment.\nSystemwide Leisure Transient revenue was at 96% of fully recovered levels in the third quarter, an incredible performance when considering the significant restrictions that were still prevalent in many parts of the world.\nStrong leisure transient demand is proving to be far more than the summer surge as Leisure Transient revenue booked in October for all periods was over 20% ahead of 2019 levels.\nFurther, total transient revenue at our Americas resorts is pacing 25% ahead of 2019 levels for the last weeks of December.\nAt this pace, we anticipate the festive season could be one of the strongest we've ever experienced.\nWe've also been pleased with the progression of group and business transient demand.\nWhile demand did not accelerate immediately following Labor Day due to the Delta variant, the upward momentum has been steady throughout September and October.\nThe rate of improvement in group during October has been particularly meaningful after seeing elevated levels of cancellations in August and early September due to the Delta variant.\nSince that time, cancellations have receded while short-term group demand has strengthened.\nOverall, systemwide group revenue jumped 16% in October as compared to September and is trending at 50% of fully recovered levels.\nGroup bookings for 2022 are also showing significant improvement.\nIn October, our leads for 2022 grew by 38% as compared to September, and we're now 10% ahead of 2019 levels for group business that is likely to book.\nWhile group pace for 2022 is approximately 80% recovered, a bit weaker than what we reported last quarter.\nThe strong current level of group bookings, coupled with growing lead volume provides confidence that momentum will build as we head into 2022.\nAs for business transient, the recovery has been softer than group, but is still showing steady momentum with demand recovering to 46% of 2019 levels in October.\nWe continue to see stronger growth in our regional accounts as compared to our larger national accounts.\nHowever, that gap is narrowing.\nOur largest corporate accounts have grown by 50% since June and we continue to be encouraged by dialogue with our corporate customers who are returning to offices in bigger numbers with many planning on a more robust return to travel in 2022.\nThe recovery momentum has also expanded geographically.\nOne of the areas with the most pronounced improvements is Europe, which is now trending at roughly the same level as the United States after seeing RevPAR quadruple over the past five months.\nWe're also seeing occupancy of 70% in the Middle East, which is similar to 2019 levels, driven by very strong demand from the Dubai Expo, which kicked off in October and runs through March of 2022.\nLastly, occupancy in India, which was below 20% just a few months ago due to the Delta variant, is now trending at almost 60% as we exit October.\nWhen you add up the trends, both from a geographic and purpose of visit perspective, coupled with the most recent data on forward bookings, the underlying momentum in the business is clear, and it's consistent with our conviction that we are on a path to full recovery.\nTurning to our long-term strategy.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we've been actively positioning Hyatt for the future with intense focus on advancing three pillars of our long-term strategy, namely: first, to maximize our core business; second, to integrate new growth platforms; and third, to optimize our capital deployment.\nI cannot recall a quarter where we advanced our long-term strategy as much as we did in the third quarter of this year.\nLet me start with the first pillar of our strategy, maximizing our core business as it underpins everything that we do.\nWe've been particularly focused on three key areas within this pillar to drive performance.\nFirst, focusing on the high-end traveler going deeper into the segment, not extending outside the segment.\nSecond, driving more business to our direct channels through engagement supported by data and analytics.\nAnd third, operating with excellence through agility and responsiveness to market dynamics.\nOur progress in these areas is not only reflected in the third quarter financial results I commented on earlier, but is also demonstrated in the results of our core metrics as compared to the third quarter of 2019.\nSeveral highlights include market share growth, stronger direct channel mix, a higher percentage of arrivals to our hotels from existing loyalty members and better comparable O&L margins as compared to the same period in 2019.\nThe ultimate test is investment by owners and our brands, which is best demonstrated through our net rooms growth and pipeline.\nOur net rooms growth was 6.9% in the third quarter, again, leading the industry with notable openings, including the Thompson Hollywood, the Park Hyatt Toronto and the Hyatt Ziva Riviera Cancun.\nAnd our pipeline at 103,000 rooms again expanded from the prior quarter, represents an industry-leading 41% of our existing property portfolio.\nWe were also able to achieve significant progress; with the second pillar of our long-term strategy, integrating new growth platforms through our acquisition of Apple Leisure Group, an exciting new asset-light growth platform for Hyatt.\nALG now as part of Hyatt, immediately doubles the number of resorts in our portfolio, increases our European footprint by more than 60% and positions us as the world's largest operator of hotels in the fast-growing luxury all-inclusive resort segment.\nFurther, we expect it to increase our systemwide stabilized leisure transient revenue mix to over [50%].\nWe also expect the ALG brands to drive accretive rooms well into the future similar to what we've achieved with our Two Roads Hospitality acquisition in 2018, which has been a significant driver of growth for Hyatt this year, including conversions and expansion of our pipeline.\nIn 2021, ALG through the AMR collection is expected to finish the year with net rooms growth of 35% with the addition of 31 hotels and approximately 8,500 rooms and taking the AMR collection to 101 hotels in total with 33,000 rooms by the end of 2021.\nThe ALG acquisition represents a brand-defining moment in Hyatt's more than 60-year history, much like the company's international expansion into Hong Kong or the launch of the Park Hyde brand.\nWe are now marking the beginning of a new chapter for Hyatt.\nIn addition to the exciting growth the acquisition represents for Hyatt, and the new experiences the ALG platform provides our guests.\nThe earnings base from ALG also allows us to make significant progress on the third pillar of our long-term strategy, which is to optimize our capital deployment.\nWe are very encouraged that ALG is on track to outperform its 2019 results in 2021, exceeding the expectations of our underwriting.\nThis earnings base allows us to execute an essential part of our capital strategy to unlock the value of our real estate assets by selling assets over time and prioritizing the reinvestment of proceeds into growth opportunities for Hyatt.\nIn August, at the same time, as the acquisition announcement, we committed to a $2 billion expansion of our asset disposition commitment.\nThe proceeds from these future asset sales will allow us to deleverage our balance sheet on an accelerated basis as we reduce the debt incurred to fund the ALG acquisition.\nWe've initiated this effort with two properties currently in the market and other active discussions underway.\nWe feel very confident in our ability to execute on this expanded asset disposition commitment.\nWe've realized over $3 billion in proceeds since our original announcement in 2017 at a very attractive multiple, and we have a high quality and a highly desirable asset base that remains on our balance sheet today.\nAs a reminder, the $3 billion commitment was in two parts, $1.5 billion in 2017 and an additional $1.5 billion in 2019.\nDuring September, we completed the sale of two assets, the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe and Alila Ventana Big Sur, for approximately $500 million in gross proceeds and reached cumulatively over $3 billion in total gross proceeds from asset sales since 2017 at an average aggregate multiple of 17.4 times.\nWe retained long-term management agreements for both of the hotels that we recently disposed of and exceeded our disposition target well ahead of schedule.\nIn summary, we look forward to continuing our track record of realizing proceeds in excess of the valuation implied by the multiple for Hyatt and simultaneously transforming our earnings mix to an expected 80% fee-based proportion by the end of 2024.\nImportantly, with the earnings from our ALG acquisition, coupled with fees driven by our industry-leading growth, we'll be able to achieve this progress while maintaining investment capacity for future opportunities.\nOverall, I'm extremely pleased with the progress we are making toward our long-term strategy as we remain intently focused on executing the three key areas I've outlined as we position ourselves for the future.\nFinally, I want to touch upon the owner's meeting we recently held a couple of weeks ago at the beautiful Hyatt Regency Huntington Beach Resort.\nThe attendance was as strong as it's ever been, and the energy from gathering in person was truly palpable.\nI was struck by the collective optimism we share about the future and how our purpose of caring for people so they can be their best has resonated with and been felt by our owners during the most of year downturn this industry has ever experienced.\nTheir feedback centered on our attention to listening intently, focusing on the important issues and staying connected to their needs.\nWe have much to do to ensure we are attracting the best talent in a challenging labor environment, to ensure we're doing everything possible to drive market share and operating margins for our brands and owners, and to make sure our systems and services keep pace with quickly shifting trends in technology.\nI left the meeting feeling energized at the progress we are making and the opportunities ahead to continue to deliver value to all of our constituents.\nWe made significant progress toward realizing the benefits of our long-term strategy.\nAnd as the recovery continues to unfold, we have positioned Hyatt to emerge from this pandemic a stronger and more agile company.\nOur view to sustainable demand in the future continues to sharpen and with each passing month, our conviction and our enthusiasm grows.\nJoan, over to you.\nLate yesterday, we reported a third quarter net income attributable to Hyatt of $120 million and a diluted earnings per share of $1.15 with our results favorably impacted by gains on the sale of real estate of $307 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $110 million in the third quarter effectively doubling our adjusted EBITDA from the second quarter, again demonstrating our ability to translate improving demand into a strong increase in earnings.\nIn a RevPAR environment that is improving but still challenging, we were able to narrow our adjusted EBITDA decline to only 32% in the third quarter versus the same period in 2019, which is the same as our systemwide RevPAR decline of 32%.\nAdditionally, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.4% for the third quarter, an improvement of 50 basis points from the adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.9% we reported in the third quarter of 2019, serving as yet another marker of operating excellence in a lower demand environment.\nSystemwide RevPAR was $94 in the third quarter, representing a 29% increase compared to second quarter.\nBoth occupancy and rate contributed to the sequential growth with occupancy improving by 700 basis points and rate growing by 12%.\nThe improvement in rate is especially notable as it reached 96% of 2019 levels on a systemwide basis.\nOur base incentive and franchise fees totaled $96 million in third quarter reaching 71% of 2019 levels, with base and franchise fees more fully recovered than RevPAR as a result of our strong net rooms growth over the past two years.\nTurning to our segment results.\nOur management and franchising business delivered a combined adjusted EBITDA of $85 million, improving 33% from the second quarter.\nThe Americas segment accounted for the vast majority of the sequential growth and recovered to approximately 80% of 2019 segment adjusted EBITDA levels.\nHotels and resort locations were the primary driver of the recovery during the first two months of the quarter, with a more notable improvement from urban locations in September, driven by growing demand for business transient and group.\nOur Europe, Africa, Middle East and Southwest Asia segment also experienced material improvement in the third quarter as it benefited from the easing of travel restrictions and reopening of borders across Europe.\nFees from our European hotels more than doubled from the prior quarter with France and Southern Europe leading the recovery.\nThe Asia Pacific segment did not see the same level of improvement as our other two segments and the recovery in this part of the world remains uneven.\nMainland China RevPAR had a strong start to the quarter trending 4% ahead of 2019 levels in July before dropping to less than 50% of 2019 levels in August due to reimposed travel restrictions.\nDemand has improved since with RevPAR strengthening to 78% of 2019 levels in October.\nAdditionally, the recovery in Asia Pacific, excluding Mainland China, has progressed at a slower pace than other areas of the world as more stringent travel restrictions remain in place.\nHowever, we remain optimistic that results will improve in the region as vaccination rates continue to rise allowing for restrictions to be eased.\nTurning to our owned and leased hotels segment.\nThe business delivered $51 million of adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter representing an improvement of $39 million from the second quarter.\nThe performance was significantly ahead of expectation, driven by the ingenuity and responsiveness of our teams to market dynamics.\nOwned and leased RevPAR was $117 for the third quarter, improving 39% from the second quarter with notable improvement from group revenue, which jumped 87% sequentially and accounted for over 28% of the room night mix.\nWe previously discussed how strong performance has been in our resorts during the quarter and it's important to highlight outperformance in some of our larger owned convention hotels as well.\nIn the third quarter, Hyatt Regency Orlando, Hyatt Regency Phoenix and Grand Hyatt San Antonio, collectively had a stronger EBITDA contribution in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to 2019.\nThis is quite notable considering group business accounted for approximately 70% of the rooms revenue mix for these hotels during the third quarter of 2019.\nThis year, these hotels were still able to generate a significant amount of group business, representing 57% of rooms revenue and we're also able to grow transient revenue nearly 30% above 2019 levels through creative tactics such as repositioning the hotels for families and other leisure business.\nThis is a great example of how we are evolving go-to-market sales strategies real time to meet the current demand profile and maximize performance of our owned and leased hotels.\nOverall, excellent revenue management and strong operational execution have resulted in significant margin expansion for our owned and leased hotels.\nComparable operating margins were 20.3% in the third quarter, which is an improvement of 490 basis points relative to 2019 levels despite RevPAR that was only 75% recovered.\nOpen positions have also contributed to lower operating costs, and we continue to closely monitor the labor environment and are working hard to fill open positions.\nThe situation remains challenging, but we're making progress.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, we continue to see some pressure on wages, and our general managers have made significant adjustments based on competitive market factors and the challenge and our response varies by market.\nI'd also like to provide an update on our liquidity and cash.\nAs of September 30, our total liquidity inclusive of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and combined with revolver borrowing capacity was approximately $4.3 billion compared with $3.2 billion as of June 30.\nWe received a USD254 million tax refund in July, $491 million of net proceeds from the sale of Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe and Alila Ventana Big Sur, and raised $575 million in net proceeds from our equity offering in September.\nWe also repaid $250 million in senior notes that matured in August.\nIn October, we raised $1.75 billion of short-term 2- and 3-year fixed and floating rate notes at an approximate weighted average interest rate of 1.48%.\nWe used $750 million of those proceeds to refinance our 2022 short-term prepayable bonds and successfully reduced our interest costs by $12 million annually on the refinancing.\nOur approximate total liquidity after the debt capital markets proceeds was $5.2 billion at the end of October.\nOn November 1, we closed on the acquisition of ALG and paid cash of $2.7 billion.\nAfter the acquisition and as of today, our total liquidity position remains strong at approximately $2.6 billion, with $1.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and $1.3 billion available under the revolver.\nFinally, I'd like to make a few additional comments regarding our 2021 outlook.\nConsistent with our communication in the second quarter, we continue to expect adjusted SG&A to be in the approximate range of $240 million, excluding any bad debt expense or ALG integration costs.\nWe're still refining the ALG integration cost estimate but expected to be in the range of $5 million to $10 million for the full year of 2021 with $2 million of that amount already included in the third quarter adjusted SG&A.\nIt's important to note that these costs are nonrecurring and our plan does not include an extensive or costly integration of systems and processes.\nWe continue to expect capital expenditures for 2021 to be approximately $110 million exclusive of any impact from ALG.\nWe mentioned on our last call that we are pulling forward selected renovation projects to take advantage of the timing of lower displacement during the fourth quarter and therefore, our capital expenditures could actualize slightly higher if our materials and labor needs are secured before the end of the year.\nTurning to net rooms growth.\nWe are reaffirming our expectation of rooms growth to be greater than 6% for the full year, exclusive of any impact from ALG.\nThere is some degree of uncertainty related to supply chain issues, which could push certain openings into the first quarter of 2022.\nHowever, greater than 6% remains our best estimate at this time and we're pleased to be delivering another very strong year of net rooms growth.\nAs we turn to 2022, we look forward to sharing more on the progress of our ALG integration efforts, and we'll be providing more detailed disclosures on the ALG business on our next earnings call.\nWe're proud of the accomplishments we achieved to advance our long-term strategy and are excited about the value creation ALG brings to Hyatt and are even better positioned today to drive asset light growth than ever before.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:This is Devan Bhavsar, and joining us today from Kennedy-Wilson are Bill McMorrow, Chairman and CEO; Mary Ricks, President; Matt Windisch, Executive Vice President; and Justin Enbody, Chief Financial Officer.\nPlease see the Investor Relations website for more information.\nI'm very pleased with our strong third quarter results, which saw EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA increased over 165% compared to Q3 of 2020 and the record results we have posted for the first nine months of the year.\nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $741 million thus far in 2021, compared to $261 million for the first nine months of 2020.\nWe've made tremendous progress this year on our two key initiatives, growing our in-place annual NOI and growing our fee-bearing capital.\nWe had a very active quarter, completing $1.8 billion of investment transactions, bringing our year-to-date total to $4.4 billion.\nOur assets under management has grown by 17% in 2021 to a record $20.5 billion, from $17.6 billion at the end of 2020.\nWe have a strong pipeline of new transactions that we expect to close by the end of the year, which would further increase our AUM and result in a record year of capital deployment for KW.\nI'd like to start by providing some perspective on what we are seeing in our markets, as real estate fundamentals continue to improve in the quarter.\nGlobal transaction volumes remain healthy, with Q3 volumes in the U.S. increasing 150% from last year's levels, according to Real Capital Analytics.\nInstitutional demand for real estate remains high, with trillions of dollars of capital globally that continue to search for sound risk-adjusted returns.\n2021 operating metrics continue to improve for us.\nIn our U.S. market, we saw continued impressive apartment rent growth, with rents increasing at one of the fastest rates in recent memory across all our regions.\nInvestor demand for high-quality rental housing remained very strong and has resulted in cap rate compression and further increases to the value of our real estate portfolio.\nOur Mountain West apartment portfolio, which is our largest region, with almost 11,000 units, outperformed once again, driven by very attractive migration trends and relative affordability.\nWe also saw significant improvements in our Pacific Northwest and California portfolio, as pandemic-related moratoriums began to burn off, and we expect meaningful rent growth in all of these areas over the next 15 months.\nIn Europe, we saw outstanding performance in our U.K. and Dublin properties.\nOn July 19, the U.K. removed all COVID restrictions.\nAnd in Dublin, essentially all travel reopened on July 26, and we saw a gradual return to office that we expect will accelerate over the next six months and have a positive impact on our portfolio.\nStrong leasing demand in our Dublin multifamily portfolio resulted in occupancy growing by over 400 basis points in Q3 to 96.6 occupancy.\nThe key acquisitions in the quarter were three wholly owned with multifamily assets totaling 879 units that we acquired for a total of $399 million.\nTwo of these assets are located in suburban Seattle, and the third asset is located in suburban Denver.\nWe look forward to implementing our value-add programs at these communities, which has consistently shown our ability to drive outsized returns.\nOur multifamily portfolio globally grew to a record 33,400 units at quarter end, including almost 5,000 units under development, which we expect to complete at yields well above current market cap rates.\nWe're on track to increase our global unit count to 35,000 by year-end.\nMary will speak later on the impressive growth of our European logistics portfolio.\nOur Q3 transactions grew estimated annual NOI to $413 million, an increase of $19 million in the year, and we increased our fee-bearing capital to $4.8 billion, representing a 23% growth year to date.\nI'm also pleased to announce that yesterday, our board of directors authorized a 9% increase to our quarterly dividend, which now annualizes to $0.96 per share.\nLooking ahead, I believe the key drivers of our business will be -- are well positioned with our multifamily portfolio, the reopening of our European markets, the growth of our investment management platform, and the completion of our development projects.\nBefore we discuss these initiatives in more detail, I'd like to pass the call over to our CFO, Justin Enbody, to highlight our Q3 financial results.\nIn Q3, we had GAAP earnings per share of $0.47 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $0.18 in Q3 of last year.\nAdjusted net income in the quarter grew to $112 million, compared to $27 million last year.\nAnd adjusted EBITDA grew to $203 million in the quarter, compared to $76 million in 2020.\nFor the year, we've had GAAP earnings per share of $1.96 per share, adjusted net income of $424 million, and as Bill mentioned, adjusted EBITDA of $741 million, representing record results for the first nine months of the year.\nIn our co-investment portfolio, which includes our unconsolidated funds and joint ventures, we continue to see appreciating asset values, driven by strong NOI growth and further cap rate compression.\nThis strong performance led to $79 million in gains and $46 million of accrued performance fees in the quarter.\nFor the quarter, including promotes, total adjusted fees were $56 million, up from $8 million in Q3 of last year.\nTurning to our balance sheet, in August, we issued $600 million of unsecured bonds maturing in 2030.\nThe proceeds were used to fully pay off our line of credit, as well as the remaining $296 million of our KWE bonds due in 2022, which was completed in October.\nWe have significantly improved our maturity schedule, with no unsecured debt maturities until 2025 and nothing outstanding on our $500 million revolving credit facility.\nOur debt has a pro forma average interest rate of 3.6% and a weighted average maturity of 6.5 years, which has improved by 2.5 years since the beginning of the year.\nDuring the quarter, we bought back $25 million of stock at an average price of $21.55.\nSince the beginning of 2018, we've now returned $750 million, or approximately $5.40 per share, to shareholders in the form of dividends or share repurchases, which includes repurchasing 15.7, million shares or approximately 10%, of our outstanding share count.\nWe still have $213 million on our $500 million buyback authorization remaining, a portion of which was utilized in October.\nOur global multifamily portfolio continues to outperform, due to our market selection and our hands on asset management style.\nOur assets are experiencing improving market conditions, lower delinquencies and increasing rents.\nPositive migration trends and affordability continue to create outsized demand, in particular for our Mountain West portfolio, which saw same-property revenues grow by 11% and NOI grew by 15%.\nWe think there remains strong upside in our Mountain West portfolio, where average rents are $1,366 per month, and as people continue to seek a higher quality of life and migrate out of higher rent, higher tax states.\nWe are also starting to see improving trends from our Pacific Northwest and our California assets.\nOffices began to reopen, which has been a positive for renter demand.\nRent concessions in the U.S. were down 63% in Q3 compared to Q3 of 2020, and we saw leasing spreads average a record 27% on new leases across our U.S. portfolio.\nWe also continue to work with our tenants and take advantage of the rent relief measures that are available.\nThe combination of these factors resulted in robust same-store revenue growth across our U.S. market rate multifamily portfolio of 8% and NOI growth of 12% versus Q3 of 2020.\nThis represents our best quarter of NOI growth in the last five years.\nSequentially, from Q2 of this year, revenues grew by an impressive 6% and NOI by 8%.\nIn-place rents in our U.S. portfolio are now 6% above pre-pandemic levels.\nAnd with an average loss to lease of 15%, we believe our portfolio is set up for strong growth in 2022 and beyond.\nSimilarly, at our Dublin apartment portfolio, we continue to see strong demand, as people begin returning to the city.\nThis led to Clancy Quay being stabilized in Q2.\nAnd currently, Capital Dock is 77% leased and on track to be stabilized in Q4.\nOverall occupancy is now returning to pre-pandemic levels in Dublin.\nIn addition to the mega-cap tech companies that have been large employers in Dublin for many years, other high-growth tech companies are looking to expand their presence in Dublin, such as Stripe, TikTok, ServiceNow, and First Data.\nWe continue to believe in the long-term prospects of the Irish apartment market, driven by a young and growing population.\nAdditionally, there are a large number of multinational companies with their European headquarters in Dublin, with a workforce that is more likely to rent than buy.\nTurning to our office portfolio, as tenants begin to return to the workplace, we are seeing improvements in the operational environment, including a growing number of firm requirements, requests for tours, and deals being executed.\nQuality in both design and construction and staff wellness continues to be an important factor as tenants are drawn toward amenity-rich buildings with ESG credentials.\nThematically, we continue to focus on office tenants in high-growth and essential business sectors, including life sciences, media, and technology.\nWhen you include our suburban apartment and growing logistics assets, we believe this thematic approach positions our overall portfolio well for future cycles.\nA great recent example is at one of our largest office assets, 111 Buckingham Palace Road in London, where by October, we transacted on approximately 100,000 square feet of lease transactions, including 20,000 square feet under offer, which in total represents 45% of the building.\nThese transactions will improve the occupancy significantly, from 80% to 100% in Q4, deliver 26% growth above in-place rents and 40% of the income at pre-COVID top rents in excess of GBP70 per square foot, compared to 15% in Q3 of 2020.\nMajor tech firms represented 80% of the new leases, illustrating that top tenants are active in the market and willing to make decisions for the right space.\n71% of our office NOI is from our European portfolio, which saw Q3 same-property revenue grow by 4% and NOI grow by 5%.\nThese results were driven by strong rent collections, lower bad debt, and the burn-off of free rent in the quarter.\nWith an even larger focus on employee retention, large corporate tenants are taking advantage of the benefits of modern, low-rise suburban offices, such as affordability, shorter commute times, and outdoor amenities.\nWe continue to see this play out in our own portfolio, with approximately 90% of the NOI from low and midrise properties.\nWe completed 585,000 square feet of leasing in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to 1.5 million square feet, with a WALT of 7.6 years.\nOur leasing pipeline remains strong, with 152,000 square feet of leasing completed thus far in Q4 and another 600,000 square feet in legals that we're actively working on closing out, giving us good momentum heading into next year.\nTurning to our investment management platform, we continued to see strong growth in the quarter, with our fee-bearing capital growing to $4.8 billion.\nThis has now increased over 160% since the beginning of 2018.\nOur fast-growing global credit platform continued to lead the charge in Q3.\nIn July, we announced a new GBP500 million commitment focused on European loans, bringing total global commitments to $3 billion.\nIn Q3, we completed $440 million of loan investments, including our first loans in Europe on a few large industrial portfolios.\nOur debt platform grew by 24% to $1.4 billion in loans outstanding, with $140 million in future unfunded commitments.\nWe've been able to attract institutional-quality borrowers with high-quality assets to our debt platform, with an average loan size of $70 million and weighted average maturity of four years.\nWe continue to see a strong macroeconomic environment in the European logistics sector.\nOccupational demand has driven vacancy to an all-time low in the U.K. of 3.4%, and yields continued to compress across Europe, due to accelerating rent growth.\nOur thesis from the start when we launched this platform was that last-mile logistic properties in close proximity to transit centers would have strong demand, as they allow for companies to get their products to the end customer in an efficient manner.\nCOVID has accelerated the thesis, as online sales penetration continues to grow, with online sales making up 28% of total retail sales in the U.K.\nOur industrial portfolio has grown rapidly, and including assets under offer, our portfolio has a gross value of approximately $1.1 billion today across 59 assets, with KW's share at approximately 20%.\nWe look forward to further growing both our debt platform and our logistics platform in the fourth quarter and continued expansion of our investment management business, which has, in total, $2.1 billion in future commitments from our various strategic partners.\nAnother important area of growth for KW will be the completion of our development and lease-up projects, where we continued to make progress throughout the pandemic.\nOur developments, totaling $2.7 billion at cost, are being delivered with strong sustainability credentials, with environmental improvements and tenant wellness at the center of our focus.\nOnce these assets are completed and stabilized, we expect an incremental $105 million of estimated annual NOI to KW, which represents an initial yield on cost of approximately 6%.\nWe are nearing completion of two office properties in the heart of Dublin, Hannover Quay and Kildaire Street, which total 134,000 square feet that are expected to complete in Q4 and Q1, respectively.\nWe remain on track to complete the majority of our construction projects in 2023 and 2024, on time and on budget.\nLast month, we announced a new project that we are extremely excited about in a public-private partnership with Cal State Channel Islands.\nWe are going to develop 589 residential units as part of a master-planned community in Camarillo, California.\nThe project will have 310 wholly owned market-rate units, 170 affordable units built through our vintage housing joint venture, and 109 for-sale townhomes sold by Comstock Homes.\nThis development sits adjacent to a 386-unit wholly owned community, which we acquired in 2016.\nA project of this nature was a natural fit for KW, given our broad multifamily expertise in developing both market-rate and affordable units.\nWe are aiming to complete construction in 2024 and look forward to breaking ground in Camarillo later this month.\nWith that, I'd like to pass it back to Bill.\nAs you can see that we have a combination of ways to further drive earnings and cash flow growth at Kennedy-Wilson.\nAs I mentioned on the last call, we have a clear path to grow our stabilized NOI at the rate of 10% to 15% a year over the next three years, driven by strong organic NOI growth, new acquisitions, and the completion of our construction.\nWe also plan to grow our fee-bearing capital and resulting fees by 15% to 20% per year over the next three years.\nThe combination of these factors should lead to significant growth in both our net asset value per share and our assets under management.\nAs we look ahead to 2022, I'm very optimistic in our ability to continue expanding our business for a number of reasons.\nFirst, business conditions have rebounded as economies reopen, and we have a very healthy transaction and financing market, perhaps the strongest we've seen in the last decade.\nSecond, over the last 18 months, we either grew or establish new investment platforms with well capitalized, extremely liquid, global strategic partners who have a keen desire to expand their relationship with Kennedy-Wilson.\nWe can now creatively allocate capital across the entire capital structure and in a wide range of asset classes.\nFinally, our global investment team remains intact, and our global communication has never been better.\nI'm very pleased with the progress our team has made not only in Q3, but over the course of 2021.\nI'm also reminded of the importance of long-term relationships, both internally and externally to KW.\nAlthough I'm biased, we have an exceptional global team that has been working together for decades and our internal communication, as I mentioned, is the best it's ever been.\nThis fact, combined with very high-quality properties in the right product category, located in diversified and growing markets, has set up KW for excellent long-term growth.\nAnd with that, Daven, I'd like to open it up to any questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We apologize for this error.\nWe will review how we closed 2020 and discuss 2021 financial guidance.\nI'm pleased to report, we finished the year with a very strong quarter.\nWe delivered double-digit growth in all key financial metrics, and once again reported results above our financial targets.\nThis is all the more remarkable since last year's fourth quarter was so strong.\nAs you know, [indecipherable] this difficult year and as we navigated through the pandemic, we tried to be as transparent as possible and provide you visibility to our expected financial performance.\nIn such highly unusual circumstances, the default reaction would normally be to draw guidance and watch from the sidelines.\nBut as you know, we tried our best to share with you what we saw.\nSo we did the same at the end of the third quarter when we decided to provide 2021 outlook as soon as we had some visibility, which was a full quarter earlier than usual.\nToday, this outlook has become clearer and we've decided to update and raise the guidance.\nLet's start by reviewing our fourth quarter results.\nThe revenue for the fourth quarter came in at $3,298 million, which was $108 million above the high end of our guidance range.\nA little over 70% of this beat came from strong organic performance, less than 30% from favorable foreign exchange.\nRevenue growth was 13.9% on a reported basis and 12.2% at constant currency.\nFourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $735 million grew 14.5% reflecting our revenue growth and productivity measures.\nThe $25 million beat above the high end of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger organic revenue performance.\nFourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.11 grew 21.3%.\nThe beat here entirely reflects the adjusted EBITDA drop through.\nOur strong fourth quarter financial results were driven by numerous operating achievements during 2020.\nAnd a little bit more color on those achievements, starting with technology.\nDemand for our technology offerings remain strong in 2020.\n60 new clients decided to deploy OCE last year, bringing our total number of OCE client wins to 140 since launch.\nAs you know at the beginning of 2020, a top 15 global pharma client begun deployment of OCE in the US.\nThis client has now decided to begin global OCE deployment for their medical teams mainly their almost 2,000 medical science liaisons worldwide.\nThe same client is also expanding its use of IQVIA technologies through our HCP Engagement Management platform.\nWe launched this platform during 2020.\nHCP Engagement Management works in conjunction with OCE to ensure global commercial activities are executed in compliance with all global regulations.\nIn addition to HCP Engagement Management, you would have seen that during 2020 we also launched OCE Optimizer.\nOCE Optimizer is a real-time map-based territory and sales rep alignment solution, which helps our clients plan their sales rep activity and improve their marketing plans.\nSwitching to our Real World business.\nOur Real World business has been relatively well insulated from the impact of the virus, and it has strong growth for the year.\nThe business is advanced in the use of secondary data, remote monitoring and virtual research approaches, which helped the team pivot quickly to working in the new remote world at the onset of the pandemic.\nOur rich clinical data assets are key to our real world differentiation.\nThe team has continued to invest in these rich clinical data assets and these assets now include over 1 billion active non-identified patients globally.\nAnd the team is busy integrating these rich clinical data into research.\nIn 2020, we launched CARE, our COVID Active Research Experience registry to help communities and public health authorities better understand the impact of COVID-19 on the population.\nWe are leveraging this platform along with our vast experience of registries and analytics, to partner with the FDA, to support a better understanding of how people are affected by exposure to COVID.\nThis work will help identify which symptoms individuals experienced, the length and severity of symptoms, and were there any medications or supplements they are taking affect the severity of those symptoms.\nIt's a perfect application of our real world capability.\nSimilarly, we have become the partner of choice around the world to receive various governments and healthcare authorities with large scale diagnostic testing and monitoring of COVID patients.\nThese new series of offerings which leverages our connected capabilities, contributed incrementally to the strong sequential growth in our TAS segment.\nAs you know the R&DS team responded quickly in 2020 to support our clients with the development of vaccines and therapies for COVID-19.\nWe've been involved in more than 300 clinical trials and studies for the virus, including four of the five vaccine trials that made it through Phase III and were funded by the US Government in Operation Warp Speed.\nTo help speed recruitment, we leveraged our direct-to-patient solutions, which include the use of patient registries and IQVIA sponsored advertisements.\nTo-date, we recruited over 100,000 patients to COVID trials.\nThe pandemic has accelerated the need for remote and risk-based monitoring in clinical research, which in turn has accelerated the adoption of our Virtual Trials technology.\nIn total, we've won over 60 new studies using our Virtual Trials solutions across 10 therapeutic areas, including awards with five top 10 pharma clients.\nThe technology suite combined eConsent, telemedicine, eCOA and digital communication, and its platform on health cloud, the Salesforce platform that is purpose-built for healthcare and life sciences.\nThis technology has been deployed to speed vaccine development, and was an important factor in helping the team secure the two Phase III full-service COVID trials that we are working on.\nThe environment for R&D and outsourcing remains very healthy.\nBiotech funding remains strong, with the National Venture Capital Association reporting a record number of deals for the year.\nThe pipeline of late-stage molecules continues to expand, and is at an all-time high.\nIt is these healthy environment combined with our differentiated capabilities that has resulted in strong new business awards for the R&DS team.\nOur contracted backlog, including pass-throughs grew 18.5% year-over-year to $22.6 billion at December 31, 2020.\nAs a result, our next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $5.9 billion, up 13.5% year-over-year.\nWe continue to build on our strong momentum in the fourth quarter, with the team delivering a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.41, including pass-throughs and 1.42 excluding pass-throughs.\nWe exited the year with an LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio of 1.53 including pass-throughs and 1.44 excluding pass-throughs.\nWe expect continued strong activity going forward as our pipeline of R&DS opportunities is growing double-digits in both volume and dollars across a very wide range of therapy.\nAs Ari mentioned, this was a strong quarter to close the year.\nLet's start by reviewing revenue.\nFourth quarter revenue of $3,298 million grew 13.9% on a reported basis and 12.2% at constant currency.\nRevenue for the full year was $11,359 million, which was up 2.4% reported and 2.3% at constant currency.\nTechnology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the fourth quarter of $1,425 million increased 17.4% reported and 15.1% at constant currency.\nThe sequential bump in growth this quarter versus the 9.2% growth in the third quarter was due to the COVID related work that Ari mentioned.\nFull year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $4,858 million, up 8.3% reported and 8.1% at constant currency.\nR&D Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $1,684 million was up 14.5% at actual FX rates and 13.2% at constant currency.\nPass-throughs were a tailwind of 220 basis points to fourth quarter R&DS revenue growth due entirely to COVID work.\nBut you should note that R&DS delivered double-digit organic growth on both the services and a fixed FX basis.\nAgain, strong performance, especially considering the tough comparison to the fourth quarter of 2019, when organic service revenue also grew at a double digit rate.\nFor the full year, R&D Solutions revenue was $5,760 million essentially flat on both the reported and constant currency basis.\nExcluding the impact of pass-throughs, R&D Solutions' full year reported revenue grew 2.2%.\nCSMS revenue of $189 million were down 10% reported and 11.9% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter.\nFor the full year, CSMS revenue of $741 million was down 9% at actual FX rates and 9.2% at constant currency.\nDemand for field reps continues to be soft in the current environment.\nAs a result, business development activity has slowed but the businesses performed modestly better than we expected as the clients have largely retained existing field reps.\nNow moving down to P&L, adjusted EBITDA was $735 million for the fourth quarter, which was growth of 14.5%.\nFor the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $2,384 million.\nFourth quarter GAAP net income was $119 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.61.\nFor the full year GAAP net income was $279 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.43.\nAdjusted net income was $411 million for the fourth quarter and $1,252 million for the full year.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share grew 21.3% in the fourth quarter to $2.11.\nFull year adjusted diluted earnings per share was $6.42.\nNow as Ari highlighted, R&DS new business activity remains strong, backlog grew 18.5% year-over-year to close 2020 at $22.6 billion.\nWe expect $5.9 billion of this backlog to convert to revenue over the next 12 months, which represent a year-over-year increase of 13.5%.\nAnd this provides the basis for our 2021 guidance, which I'll be discussing shortly.\nNow let's go to the balance sheet.\nAt December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.8 billion and debt was $12.5 billion.\nSo, our net debt was $10.7 billion.\nOur net leverage ratio at December 31 improved to 4.5 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA and that compares to a peak of 4.8 times at the end of the second quarter and 4.7 times at the end of the third quarter.\nAnd you'll recall that we've committed to deleveraging between 3.5 times and 4 times net leverage as we exit 2022 and you can expect that we'll make good progress toward this target in 2021 due to our double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth and improved free cash flow conversion.\nThe cash flow continues to be a bright spot, cash flow from operations was $750 million in the fourth quarter, up 29% year-over-year.\nCapex was $176 million, resulting in free cash flow of $574 million.\nFor the full year free cash flow was $1.34 billion, up 61% year-over-year.\nWe resumed share repurchase activity during the fourth quarter, repurchasing $102 million of our shares.\nFull year share repurchases were $423 million.\nWe ended the year at 194.8 million diluted shares outstanding, and currently have $918 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our program.\nAs a result of our strong free cash flow performance actions we took at the onset of the pandemic to access capital markets and capital allocation decisions during the year, we now have $3.3 billion of dry powder on our balance sheet between the undrawn revolver of $1.5 billion and the cash balance of $1.8 billion.\nWe will continue to be judicious in how we use it for liquidity, consistent with our goal of reducing net leverage.\nLet's turn to guidance now.\nWe're raising our full year guidance by $250 million for revenue at the low end of the range and by $300 million at the high end of the range.\nThe new revenue guidance is $12,550 million to $12,900 million, a little under half of that increase is driven by a stronger outlook for the business and the remainder is from favorable FX new events versus the guidance we provided on our third quarter call.\nI note that the revised guidance includes about 200 basis points of FX tailwind versus the prior year.\nWe're also raising our full-year profit guidance.\nWe've increased our adjusted EBITDA by $35 million at the low end of the range and by $40 million at the high end of the range, resulting in full-year guidance of $2,760 million to $2,840 million.\nThe change in FX versus our prior guidance actually had a slightly negative impact on profit due to the unusual mix of currency fluctuations versus the historic norm.\nSo the adjusted EBITDA increase that you see in our guidance is more than entirely the result of the stronger organic revenue outlook.\nWe're raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.12 at the low end of the range and by $0.13 at the high end of the range to $7.77 to $8.08.\nThis represents year-over-year growth of 21% to 25.9%.\nAnd let me go little deeper to provide you with a color to help you with your models.\nFirst, when you're modeling quarterly revenue, keep in mind that the second quarter will be easiest comparison and the fourth quarter will be the toughest comparison.\nAnd within our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance we've assumed interest expense of approximately $415 million, operational depreciation and amortization of slightly over $400 million, other below the line expense items such as minority interest of approximately $50 million and a continuation of share repurchase activity.\nOur guidance also assumes that the effective tax rate will remain largely in line with 2020.\nOur full-year 2021 guidance assumes that current foreign exchange rate remain in effect for the balance of the year.\nNow, before turning to first quarter guidance, let me give you a look at the segment growth rates for 2021.\nWe currently expect Tech & Analytics Solutions reported revenue growth to be between 9% to 12%; R&D Solutions reported revenue growth to be between 14% and 17% which includes a 100 basis point headwind from pass-throughs; and CSMS reported revenue growth is expected to be down about 2% weaker earlier in the year and recovering later in the year.\nNow, as in the past, we're also providing guidance for the coming quarter and this assumes that FX rates remain constant through the end of the quarter.\nOn that basis, first quarter revenue is expected to be between $3,150 million and $3,200 million representing reported growth of 14.4% to 16.2%.\nAll three segments should deliver similar constant currency growth rates to what we saw in the fourth quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $660 million and $675 million representing reported growth at 17.4% to 20.1%.\nAnd finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $1.81 and $1.87 up 20.7% to 24.7%.\nSo to summarize, we delivered strong fourth quarter results with double-digit growth in all key financial metrics, and that's on top of a strong fourth quarter in 2019.\nWe posted mid-teens revenue growth for both our TAS and R&DS segments.\nR&DS backlog improved to $22.6 billion, up 18.5% year-over-year.\nWe posted strong free cash flow for the fourth quarter and the full year of $574 million for the quarter and $1.34 billion for the year.\nWe closed 2020 with net leverage of 4.5 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA in a very healthy liquidity position, including an undrawn revolver and $1.8 billion of cash.\nAnd as we look to 2021, we see double-digit revenue growth, margin expansion, adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of over 20%, continued robust R&DS bookings activity and a further reduction in our net leverage ratio.\nAnd with that, let me hand it back over to our operator for the Q&A session.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Before we begin, I'd like to review the Safe Harbor statements.\nDuring the call today, we may also discuss non-GAAP financial measures.\nAdditionally, the content of this conference call may contain time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of this earnings call.\nWe do not undertake and specifically disclaim any obligation to update or revise this information.\nI will now turn the conference over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Lambiase.\nI'd like to start by saying that all the employees at Chimera are healthy and working remotely from home.\nWe implemented our contingency work plan in early March, and have not experienced any significant technology issues.\nWe all hope view and your family stay safe and healthy as well.\nIn the month of March, the COVID-19 pandemic created an environment of fear and extreme uncertainty resulting in near catastrophic conditions for the fixed income markets.\nMany investors felt that the government mandated lockdowns would likely bring an economic recession and they sold their credit investments while reinvesting into safer risk-off assets such as T-Bills, U.S. Treasury notes and cash.\nCredit-focused bond funds and ETFs saw record outflows forcing fund managers to sell their holdings into thin markets creating heightened volatility and market dislocations.\nAll sectors of the fixed income market, apart from U.S. treasuries, experienced sharp downward price movements.\nSo investors who use leverage as part of their strategies we're also forced to sell assets as they attempted to meet margin calls from their repo lenders.\nMarket conditions witnessed in March of 2020 were very similar to that experienced in the the 2008 crisis.\nYet, price movements were swift and occurred over a much shorter timeframe.\nThe Federal Reserve was quick to respond and on March 15, a Sunday night, they announced many initiatives to combat the worsening economic conditions.\nThe Federal funds rate was cut to 0%, new purchase plans for treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities were implemented and funding programs like the TELS and commercial paper facility were revived from the 2008 Federal Reserve playbook.\nThe Fed's actions were largely helpful bringing order to many areas of fixed income market including agency mortgage-backed securities.\nLiquidity programs for residential credit securities were not offered by the Federal Reserve and they continue to trade in a challenged fashion in the secondary markets.\nLike the Fed, Congress also did its part by passing the CARES Act with the intent to help individuals most directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe U.S. economy is vastly different today than where it was prior to the COVID-19 crisis.\nThe abrupt shutdown in the U.S. economy has swiftly created some of the worst economic problems since the Great Depression.\nIn these past six weeks, 30 million people have applied for unemployment benefits, a sharp contrast to the 3.5% unemployment rate that we had in February.\nMany U.S. homeowners have decided to take advantage of newly created mortgage forbearance programs.\nIn the near term, the government initiatives, coupled with mortgage forbearance, will soften the immediate blow to the U.S. economy.\nBut these may have lasting negative impact on the housing and mortgage market, should they persist for an extended period.\nOver the past several years, Chimera has taken a number of balance sheet initiatives that helped it in this difficult period to protect our book value to meet all the margin calls from our repo lenders and to pay our dividends.\nOur agency mortgage-backed securities portfolio has always served dual purposes, primarily as a source of spread income, and secondarily as a source of liquidity rather than selling our higher yielding legacy assets.\nThis quarter, we sold our agency pass-through securities to pay down debt and further deleverage our overall portfolio.\nWe ended the first quarter at 2.2 times recourse leverage, down 35% from year-end.\nOver the past decade, we've purchased or acquired approximately a $14 billion portfolio of legacy non-agency securities and season-low loan balance mortgages.\nThis portfolio is funded through securitization as well as repo leverage, but it has not been immune to downward price movements.\nWe've worked diligently to protect this portfolio, which has historically been a consistent driver of earnings for our company and makes Chimera's portfolio differentiated in the mortgage REIT industry.\nWe remain hopeful that at some point in the future, the pricing of these assets reverts to it's fundamental value, rather than the illiquid pricing we're currently experiencing.\nA restarting of the economy should be a good first step in the process, which we believe could lead to an improvement in credit spreads and a recapturing of our lost book value experienced in the quarter.\nIn the last few months, we've been busy executing transactions on the liability side of our balance sheet.\nIn March, Chimera executed two mortgage securitizations, totaling $883 million.\nWe've arranged over $800 million of longer-term refocus over these for our credit assets and we executed $374 million of convertible debt, which further diversifies our liability and capital structure.\nWhile pricing is never ideal in a crisis, we are heartened to be able to access the capital markets.\nLooking forward, it's hard to have a clear view on how the U.S. economy is going to perform as it starts back up.\nWe are in uncharted waters with regard to the high unemployment and severe changes in social habits.\nWe would love to believe that we'll be back to a V-shape recovery, but it's most likely going to take longer and be difficult to get back to where we were in February.\nThe mortgage and housing market outlook will also be challenging in the very near term.\nMortgage forbearance stays at a high degree of uncertainty to mortgage credit and we will be cautious until we have more clarity on the forbearance duration and the totals in our portfolio.\nGiven all these complexities, earnings for the next few quarters will be difficult to predict until the economic conditions clarify.\nWe remain focused on maintaining liquidity, extending our financing terms, and keeping our credit portfolio intact.\nWe are navigating through a very turbulent period but we are very hopeful that the U.S. economy will recover and the mortgage market will return to more normal footing when the economy restarts and people get back to work.\nThe first quarter of 2020 was an extremely volatile period in the U.S. fixed income market.\nThe 10-year treasury note began the year at 1.92% and fell 125 basis points to end the first quarter with a yield of 0.67%.\nThe Federal Reserve cut its overnight lending rate by 150 basis points over a two-week period as part of its response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe large drop in interest rates, sharp increase in rate volatility and investor flight to quality had a large imbalance of funds across most fixed income products.\nInvestors that utilized leverage were forced to sell their securities at low prices to meet margin calls on existing repo transactions.\nChimera was not immune.\nIn the first quarter, we utilized the combination of cash balances, unpledged [Phonetic] securities and outright sales of our agency assets as part of our overall liquidity management strategy.\nChimera has successfully met all margin calls to date.\nChimera's swift [Phonetic] funding strategy is multifaceted.\nThe primary objective has been and continues to be utilizing securitization to create long term funding for our credit assets.\nAt the end of the first quarter, we had nearly $8.5 billion of securitized debt outstanding.\nSecondarily, we use repo financing on our retained assets, legacy non-agency securities, and loans.\nWe typically use longer repo maturity dates when financing these assets, which enables more effective counterparty and portfolio management.\nAnd post quarter end, we added two new long term credit financing facilities totaling $800 million.\nThese facilities contain attractive features including a significant reduction of daily mark-to-market risk on our credit assets.\nWe successfully continued our loan securitization strategy this quarter and in March, we priced two deals with season reperforming loans from our warehouse.\nCIM 2020-R1 has $391 million underlying loans with a weighted average coupon of 5% and a weighted average loan age of 158 months.\nThe average loan size in the R1 securitization was $123,000 and had an average FICO score of 613.\nWe sold $312 million senior securities with a 2.35% cost of debt.\nChimera retained a March 2023 calendar call option on the R1 securitization.\nIn addition, we securitized CIM 2020-R2, which had a $492 million underlying loans with a weighted average coupon of 3.79% and a weighted average loan age of 161 months.\nThe average loan size in the R2 deal was $219,000 and had an average FICO of 690.\nWe sold $352 million senior securities with a 2.55% cost of debt.\nIn response to the significant drop in interest rates, increased price volatility and repo margin calls, this quarter, we sold our entire portfolio of $5.7 billion residential agency pass-throughs.\nThese pass-throughs were the most liquid and lowest yielding assets in our portfolio and have always been part of our strategy to meet our liquidity needs.\nWe also terminated all our agency hedge positions comprised of U.S. Treasury note futures and $4.1 billion notional balance on interest rate swaps.\nThe agency CMBS portfolio, which has taken us many years to accumulate, was retained.\nAs of the quarter end, this portfolio totaled $2.5 billion.\nWe continue to like the spread income generated by this portfolio and the superior convexity profile of Ginnie Mae project loans relative to residential agency pass-throughs.\nThese securities finance well in the repo markets and have some more rates and haircuts as traditional agency pass-throughs.\nThe unique [Indecipherable] explicit prepayment lockout and penalties are valuable security trades as interest rates fall.\nAfter quarter end, spreads on agency CMBS began to tighten when the Fed began purchasing these assets as part of their quantitative easing program.\nPortfolio activity this quarter has significantly reduced the company's risk exposure as measured by recourse leverage.\nWe ended the quarter at 2.2 times recourse leverage down from 3.4 times at year-end and 3.8 times at the end of the third quarter of 2019.\nThis represents a 35% reduction of recourse leverage over the last three months and 42% over the past six months.\nIt is important to note, due to current market conditions, our high-yield credit assets, which is the largest component of our portfolio, have been marked down in book value -- have been marked down in value, which has contributed to Chimera's lower book value this quarter.\nOur ability to retain this portfolio enables the opportunity for security value increases over time as economy restarts and the country works its way through the current pandemic.\nAs we move forward to the current economic crisis, we remain cautiously optimistic.\nWe will continue to space out the repo maturities and seek longer tenure for our credit repo.\nAnd as we get more visibility into the housing and mortgage economics resulting from the crisis, we will seek to deploy cash into new investment opportunities as we have for the past decade.\nI'll review Chimera's financial highlights for the first quarter.\nGAAP book value at the end of the first quarter was $12.45 per share.\nOur GAAP net loss for the first quarter was $389 million or $2.08 per share.\nOn a core basis, net income for the first quarter was $106 million or $0.57 per share.\nEconomic net interest income for the first quarter was $151 million.\nFor the first quarter, the yield on average interest earning assets was 5.3%.\nOur average cost of funds was 3% and our net interest spread was 2.3%.\nTotal leverage for the first quarter was 4.7 to 1, while recourse leverage ended the quarter at 2.2 to 1.\nExpenses for the first quarter, excluding servicing fees and transaction expenses were $18.6 million, consistent with last quarter.\nGiven the current market environment, we wanted to provide additional information about liquidity.\nWe currently have approximately $650 million in cash and unencumbered assets.\nThis is after we paid both our preferred and common stock dividends totaling $111 million.\nAlso, in April, we closed a public convertible bond offering that raised $374 million.\nWe believe it's important to have ample liquidity in this market and we're happy that the capital markets were open for us to achieve this goal.\nWe will continue to monitor our liquidity and assess opportunities to increase liquidity and balance, supporting our current portfolio and finding new opportunities in the market.\nSummary: ",

which is why we're committed to serving our guests, our team members and our communities.\nOne of the ways we serve our communities is by helping fight hunger, this fiscal year, through our foundation, Darden provided $2.5 million to help our partners at Feeding America add refrigerated trucks for 15 food banks to support mobile pantry programs and distribution in communities facing high rates of food insecurity.\nWe are uniquely positioned to help and by leveraging our scale and relationships with partners like Penske Truck Leasing and Lineage Logistics, we're proud to do our part to help get food into the hands of people who need it.\nFinally, earlier today, we announced that effective May 30th, Rick will succeed me as Chief Executive Officer and will join Darden's Board of Directors.\nThis is the right time for this transition and I look forward to continuing to serve as Darden's Chairman.\nOur company is in a clear position of strength and this is also the right time for me and my family, I'm excited for Rick, who has been a tremendous partner over the last seven years and is one of the best strategic thinkers I've worked alongside.\nOur brands have tremendous opportunity ahead of them and Rick is the perfect person to lead Darden into the next chapter.\nIt is an honor to be appointed Darden's next Chief Executive Officer and I'm grateful to Gene and the Board for their confidence in me.\nIt is humbling to lead 170,000 outstanding team members, who nourish and delight everyone we serve.\nI was incredibly fortunate to work with each of Darden's CEOs.\nSo, I have a strong appreciation for the legacy of leadership I'm inheriting.\nBy upholding our commitments to operational excellence and maximizing the power of the Darden platform, we will continue to execute our strategy to drive growth and shareholder value.\nTurning to the quarter.\nOur restaurants continue to execute at a high level.\nOur focus on simplifying operations to drive execution remains our top priority, which is why we once again paused any new initiatives during the quarter in order to eliminate distractions and allow our operators to focus on running great shifts.\nThis pause also ensures they can zero-in on people and product as we navigate through the current staffing and supply chain challenges.\nFrom a people perspective, we feel good about the progress we've made on the staffing front.\nAcross our brands manager staffing levels are above historical norms and team member staffing levels continue to improve.\nOur new hiring system has made it easier to source talent, giving our management teams more time to focus on successfully onboarding and training new team members.\nWe also continue to invest in our team members further strengthening our industry leading employment proposition.\nEarlier this year, we committed to increasing the minimum hourly earnings for our restaurant team members to $12, which includes income earned through gratuities by January 2023.\nHowever, given the strength of our performance, we are accelerating that timing to January 2022.\nThis primarily impacts entry level roles, such as hosts, busters [Phonetic] and dishwashers.\nAnd with this change, we expect our restaurant team members will earn on average approximately $20 per hour.\nOur people are the key to our performance.\nWe work hard to be the employer of choice in our industry and we're proud that our retention rates for managers and team members are both in the top quartile.\nAnd we will continue to invest in them to retain and attract the best talent in the industry.\nOn the product side, our supply chain team continues to do a great job making sure our restaurants have the products they need to serve our guests.\nOur inventory levels are strong and the team's ability to meet the needs of the business can be seen in the fact that we shipped more cases in the last two quarters than at any time during Darden's history.\nThe ability to maintain supply continuity for our restaurants minimizes distractions and allows our operators to focus on executing at the highest level, whether our guests or in our dining rooms or enjoying the convenience of to-go.\nDuring the quarter to-go sales continued to benefit from the strength of our digital platform.\nThis platform not only makes it easier for our teams to execute, it makes it more convenient for our guests to visit, order, pay and pick up.\nOff-premise sales accounted for 28% of total sales at Olive Garden and 15% of total sales at LongHorn Steakhouse.\nDigital transactions accounted for 60% of all off-premise sales during this quarter and 11% of Darden's total sales.\nFinally, we successfully opened 12 new restaurants during the quarter, including a flagship Yard House in Time Square with minimal staffing challenges.\nThe time to build a new restaurant is longer today than it has been historically and we are also beginning to see longer lead times for kitchen equipment and technology hardware.\nRegardless, we remain on track to open approximately 35 to 40 new restaurants this fiscal year.\nI also want to recognize our team members in our restaurants and our support center for your tireless efforts in creating exceptional experiences for our guests.\nI wish you all a safe and happy holiday season.\nTotal sales for the second quarter were $2.3 billion, 37% higher than last year, driven by 34.4% same restaurant sales growth and the addition of 34 net new restaurants.\nAverage weekly sales grew by more than 7% compared to pre-COVID.\nDiluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.48.\nTotal EBITDA was $335 million, resulting in EBITDA margin of 14.7%.\nThe significant business model improvements we made over the past year and half combined with strong sales resulted in margin growth of 270 basis points compared to pre-COVID.\nWe expect this to be the highest quarterly EBITDA margin growth this fiscal year as this quarter has the most opportunity given its low seasonality.\nWe continue to return significant cash to shareholders paying $143 million in dividends and repurchasing $266 million in shares, totaling over $400 million of cash returned to investors in the quarter.\nAnd while we're happy with our performance, cost pressures continue to exceed our expectations on both commodities and labor with total inflations of 6% this quarter.\nOur teams continue to demonstrate agility in managing through this environment.\nThis quarter we implemented several mitigating actions to preserve the strength of our business model, while balancing the impact of our guests and team members.\nOne of these actions was taking additional pricing.\nFor the second quarter, total pricing was 2% and we expect back half pricing to approach 4%, resulting in total pricing of just under 3% for the full fiscal year.\nWe continue to execute our strategy of pricing significantly below our overall inflation to strengthen our value leadership position by leveraging our scale.\nThis level of pricing covers most of what we consider to be the structural and long lasting impacts of the current inflationary environment and absorbing what we consider to be more short-term fluctuations, while providing future flexibility should there be a need.\nFor the rest of the fiscal year, we expect commodity and labor inflation to peak in our third quarter and then start to slow down as we enter the fourth quarter and lap commodities inflation of 4.3% in the fourth quarter of last year.\nNow turning to our P&L and segment performance for the second quarter.\nWe're comparing against pre-COVID results in the second quarter of 2020 which we believe are more comparable to normal business operations and with how we've been framing our margin expansion opportunity.\nFor the second quarter, food and beverage expenses were 220 basis points higher, driven by elevated commodity inflation of 9%, as well as investments in food quality, portion size and pricing significantly below inflation.\nRestaurant labor was 90 basis points favorable, driven by sales leverage and efficiencies gained from operational simplifications and was partially offset by elevated wage pressures.\nHourly wage inflation during the quarter was almost 9%.\nRestaurant expenses were 130 basis points lower due to sales leverage, which more than offset higher utilities costs.\nMarketing spend was $44 million lower, resulting in 230 basis points of favorability.\nAs a result, restaurant level EBITDA margin for Darden was 18.8%, 230 basis points better than pre-COVID levels.\nG&A expense was 40 basis points lower, driven by savings from the corporate restructuring in fiscal 2021, a decrease in mark-to-market expense and sales leverage.\nTurning to our segment performance.\nSecond quarter sales at Olive Garden increased 5% versus pre-COVID, strong performance, especially as we were wrapping against nine weeks of never-ending possible.\nThis sales growth combined with the business model improvements at Olive Garden helped drive a segment profit margin increase of 320 basis points even while offsetting elevated inflation.\nLongHorn continued its strong sales growth with an increase of 22% versus pre-COVID.\nHowever, inflationary pressures including double digits for commodities were at their highest level in the second quarter, resulting in reduction of segment profit margin by 80 basis points.\nSales at our Fine Dining segment increased 22% versus pre-COVID as this segment continues to see a strong rebound in performance.\nSegment profit margin grew by 140 basis points, driven by strong sales leverage and operational efficiencies, which more than offset double-digit commodities inflation.\nOur other segment grew sales by 7% versus pre-COVID and segment profit margin by 250 basis points.\nThis segment continues to perform well and we're pleased to see the business model transformation persist.\nFinally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2022, we updated our outlook for the full year to reflect our performance year-to-date and our expected performance for the remainder of the year.\nWe now expect total sales of $9.55 billion to $9.7 billion, representing growth of 9% to 11% from pre-COVID levels, same restaurant sales growth of 29% to 31% and 35 to 40 new restaurants.\nCapital spending of approximately $425 million, total inflation of approximately 5.5% with commodities inflation between 7% and 8%, total restaurant labor inflation between 6% and 6.5% which includes hourly wage inflation approaching 9%.\nEBITDA of $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion and annual effective tax rate of approximately 14% and approximately 130 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year.\nAll resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.35 and $7.60.\nThis outlook implies EBITDA margin growth versus pre-COVID similar to our previous outlook of 200 to 250 basis points with flow-through from pricing and higher sales helping offset elevated inflation.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Any of these risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially from our projections.\nAdditional information about factors that may cause our actual results to differ from projections is contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and in other company SEC filings.\nOn the call today, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.\nWe're off to a very solid start to 2021, as we expected, signaling our accelerating recovery from the pandemic.\nOur year-over-year rate of revenue decline in the first quarter improved meaningfully on a sequential basis, and we posted substantial improvements in adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted earnings per share compared to the first quarter of 2020.\nImportantly, we told you we would deliver on this a year ago, and we delivered as promised.\nOnce again, saying what we're going to do and then doing what we say.\nOur payments segment led the way for Deluxe, showing solid performance and continuing to deliver for our customers.\nWe have also seen improvements in our data-driven marketing, part of our Cloud Solutions business, which reinforces our optimism about around the rest of the year.\nWe generated [Indecipherable] despite continued COVID-related pressures and the impact of severe weather conditions in many parts of the U.S. in February.\nThere are some highlights from the quarter.\nRevenue was $441 million with a rate of decline on a year-over-year basis of 9%, a meaningful sequential improvement over the fourth quarter decline of nearly 13%.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin improved nearly 340 basis points year-over-year to 20.5%.\nAdjusted earnings per share improved nearly 17%.\nFree cash flow improved 47% year-over-year to $18 million.\nWe've improved liquidity in each of the last four quarters, and our net debt is now at the lowest level in nearly three years, which is a testament to the team's financial acumen and our responsible and prudent fiscal stewardship through the crisis.\nIn terms of sales, the first quarter was the strongest we've ever had in terms of annual contract value, or ACV.\nWe closed more than 1,600 deals, including the single largest win in Deluxe history with financial services leader, PNC, as well as the significant deal with TD Bank.\nWe closed 20 deals with ACV over $1 million each.\nAnd the top six deals had a combined ACV of over $50 million.\nSince we started our One Deluxe sales approach over six quarters ago and including a recent win which was signed in April, we have closed nine of the 13 largest deals of the last decade and two of the largest in company's history.\nOf course, we still must implement all of these wins, but our continued sales success adds to our already strong confidence in our future.\nAcross the company, we remained laser focused on our One Deluxe go-to-market strategy, accelerating our historic transformation through 2020 and into 2021 in the midst of a global pandemic.\nOur success and our now proven strategy put us in the position to announce the largest acquisition in the company's 106-year history, First American Payment Systems, which is expected to close later in this current quarter.\nBy acquiring First American, we're confirming our strategy to transform into a payments and trusted business technology company.\nThe transaction will expand our payments business by adding merchant services to our product offering and will double the size of the Payments segment to approximately $600 million with 20% plus adjusted EBITDA margins and strong growth rates.\nImportantly, after the transaction closes, Payments will now rival our check business on a revenue basis.\nAs you will recall and as I've communicated on several occasions, we have five prerequisites to reengaging on M&A.\nOur Q4 earnings call and again at the First American payment transaction call on April 22, I confirmed we had met all 5.\nAs a reminder, those prerequisites were: first, a scalable, modern technology platform; second, a sales organization capable of selling the entire portfolio; third, a product function capable of adding features and new solutions; fourth, a world-class team; and fifth, to strengthen our balance sheet.\nWe refer to all of these actions as One Deluxe, another example of saying what we will do and doing what we say.\nHaving fulfilled these prerequisites, we're ready to expand our business through a major strategic, logical and responsible acquisition.\nFirst American will be a great fit.\nWith that, let me now turn to sales.\nWe continue to make significant progress in becoming a sales-driven revenue growth company as we now signed the two largest deals in company's history in less than six months with PNC and Truist as we continue to unify our go-to-market sales approach to drive growth.\nWe continue with new business at an accelerated rate, and we're successfully cross-selling our products and services.\nLet's talk about the PNC deal for a moment.\nHere, we further expanded our existing relationship with a new multiyear partnership with the eighth largest commercial bank in the U.S., leveraging services from our core Deluxe data-driven marketing solution, complemented by promotional and multiple other Deluxe products, including our proprietary artificial data tools, strategic sourcing framework and delivery optimization algorithm, we will help PNC find and bring on new customers with improved speed to market, better value, increased efficiency and continuous innovation.\nThis is an important example of the power of expanding an existing relationship to include other existing Deluxe services.\nThe company's old operating silos would never have even identified the opportunity, much less combined multiple existing products to create a compelling solution for PNC.\nThis is more evident, proving our One Deluxe strategy really works.\nSome of our key wins for the quarter include: in Payments, we have extended our relationship with BBVA with a significant number of Deluxe mobile capture solution licenses to support its end consumer and small business customers.\nIn Cloud, aside from PNC, which will also benefit our Promotional Solutions segment, key wins include another top 50 financial institution, where we will deliver full end-to-end campaign management services for its branch transformation initiatives.\nWe also signed the top mortgage originator in the U.S., where we will offer prescreen and mail services to support their customer acquisition and recapture programs.\nIn Promotional Solutions and beyond the PNC transaction, Deluxe has expanded its relationship with LPL Financial.\nLPL will use the Deluxe brand center platform to efficiently rebrand newly acquired strategic broker-dealers with all pertinent marketing and operational materials while supporting regulatory compliance.\nIn checks, we successfully extended and expanded our contractual check relationships across several top-tier financial institutions.\nIn addition, we recently closed on a significant deal with TD Bank, the seventh largest bank in North America.\nOur recently enhanced check products and importantly, the strength of our balance sheet, enable us to continue to win market share and protect our outstanding cash flow.\nOf course, it will take time to onboard these wins, but our One Deluxe strategy is clearly working, and we're on pace to significantly exceed last year's record sales performance.\nMoving on to some segment highlights.\nPayments had a solid quarter, growing beyond the major wins in Q1 last year, and the impact of the [Indecipherable], we continue to work on our implementation backlog and expect acceleration as COVID-related implementation customer delays fade away over the coming months.\nOur treasury management business led the way this quarter.\nAs a reminder, services here include automation and intelligence, lockbox processing, remote.\nOur digital payments business, which includes the Deluxe payment exchange and medical payment exchange, while relatively small, more than doubled year over year, and we remain very optimistic about this business.\nThis success highlights our ability to add new features and build new products successfully.\nDuring the quarter, we are pleased to have conducted a soft launch of our HR management solution.\nSmall- and medium-sized businesses and integrated HR and payroll platform with a modern user experience, another example of our new product building capability.\nWe also expanded the Deluxe Payment Exchange network, which builds upon our digital payment products to now also include digital payments directly into lockboxes.\nOur [Indecipherable] has been implemented for medical claims payments, and will be expanded from there.\nWe are very optimistic on the potential growth prospects for both of these new offerings.\nIn Cloud Solutions, we've made important progress on adding a number of new clients.\nAs we discussed before, our 2021 cloud revenue performance will be impacted by the exits and divestitures we made in 2020.\nExcluding these impacts, the cloud rate of decline was about 10% or just over half of the reported rate, and sequentially before the business grew 5%.\nAll of this provides us confidence in the trajectory of this business.\nKeith will discuss this in more detail.\nWe are particularly optimistic about our data-driven marketing prospects as the economy recovers.\nAs expected, we can see that lift off beginning in our first quarter.\nWe have good visibility now into the rest of the year as we partner with our financial institution customers, planning multiple large-scale marketing campaigns, adding to our confidence for 2021 and beyond.\nOur website services also showed resiliency when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by stronger client retention as favorable exchange rates.\nWe did see encouraging signs for recovery in our corporation services as we previously announced.\nTurning now to our Promotional Solutions segment.\nThe business was affected by continued COVID-related lockdowns, particularly in the Northeast and West Coast, along with severe winter weather in February.\nDespite these impacts, the rate of decline improved for the fourth quarter of 2020 and we are very optimistic about this segment's prospects as the recovery unfolds.\nImportantly, adjusted EBITDA margin improved over 600 basis points year over year, which Keith will also touch on in a moment.\nOur business essentials line where we deliver custom forms and other products that businesses consume in their routine operations performed well during the quarter and is a leading indicator of the nation's overall economic rebound.\nWe expect to see a recovery in branded merchandise as events and in-person activities return as COVID wanes.\nFinally, our highly profitable cash generating checks business continue to be impacted by secular trends combined with the dual impact of the pandemic and severe weather.\nImportantly, we expect the accelerated COVID recovery, plus our market share gains to significantly reduce the rate of decline over the course of the year.\nEarly evidence of this recovery can be seen in the sequential improvement and revenue decline rates between Q4 2020 and Q1 2021.\nOur strategy in checks remains focused on capturing new share, while holding margin percentage flat and making smart investments, giving a strong cash flow to invest in payments and cloud.\nAnd the strategy is working, helping us win some of the largest deals in the company's history, expand into Canada and land multiple significant competitive takeaways.\nIn summary, our recovery is accelerating and our margin percentage is expanding.\nWe improved liquidity for the fourth consecutive quarter, and now net debt is at the lowest level in almost three years.\nAll four businesses are experiencing positive momentum to start the year.\nOur transformation into a sales-driven payments and trusted business technology company is yielding results and will accelerate with the addition of First American.\nOur One Deluxe strategy is clearly working, and our execution is strong.\nThis really is a new Deluxe, a payments and trusted business technology company.\nNow, we'll turn over to Keith, who will provide you more details on our financial performance.\nAs Barry mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter results.\nWhile we felt the continuing effects of COVID as well as the impact from severe weather conditions in February, we delivered improvements in sequential quarterly trends.\nThis performance was in line with our guidance and highlights the accelerating recovery we expected as we move through the rest of the year.\nLet's go through the enterprise level highlights for the quarter before moving on to the segments.\nWe posted total revenue of $441.3 million.\nWhile this is a decline of 9.3% as compared to the same period last year, importantly, it was a 360 basis point improvement in the rate of decline experienced in the prior quarter.\nWe reported GAAP net income of $24.3 million in the quarter.\nYear-over-year comparability is not meaningful given the asset impairment charges taken during the first quarter of 2020 related to the anticipated effects of COVID.\nOur measures of adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA exclude these noncash charges, along with restructuring, integration and other costs.\nThese adjustments are detailed in the reconciliations provided in our release.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 8.6% to $90.5 million and adjusted EBITDA margin improved nearly 340 basis points year-over-year to 20.5%.\nThese improvements were largely driven by reductions in SG&A, and we have aligned expenses to our post-COVID operating model and continue progress against internal value realization initiatives.\nNow turning to our segment details.\nConsistent with our expectations shared on the fourth quarter call, Payments grew Q1 revenue 3.2% year-over-year to $79.5 million.\nPayments also grew nearly 2% sequentially from the fourth quarter.\nThe quarterly performance was led by our treasury management business, which grew 4% year-over-year.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 1.7% in the quarter and adjusted EBITDA margin was 23%, down 40 basis points as product mix impacted gross profit rates versus the prior year.\nWe continue to expect double-digit revenue growth for the full year as we continue to work on implementing the backlog of new clients we signed in 2020 and in Q1 of 2021.\nWe continue to invest to drive growth and bring on all of our wins.\nAnd as such, we are assuming adjusted EBITDA margins will remain in the low 20% range through the year.\nOf course, the payments numbers will change significantly with the exciting addition of First American Payment Systems later in the year.\nI will provide details on that in a moment.\nCloud Solutions revenue results point to the recovery, but the business is performing better than the reported results imply.\nBusiness exits and divestitures taken in 2020 [Indecipherable] the reported results.\nTo provide you with better clarity, in addition to providing our GAAP results, we will also share cloud revenue performance, excluding these business exits and divestitures.\nOn a GAAP basis, revenue declined 18.2% year-over-year to $62.2 million in the quarter, but increased 5% sequentially from Q4.\n8% of the year-over-year decline was due to the impact of exits and divestitures and revenue benefited from additions in the data-driven marketing business.\nAs expected, Q1 data-driven marketing solutions revenue recovered sequentially versus Q4 as the pandemic-related financial industry slowdown and marketing spend recovery began.\nBeyond the record-setting PNC deal, we've also signed several new data marketing clients during the quarter that will benefit us in future periods.\nWeb and hosted solutions remained stable compared to Q4, driven by stronger client retention and favorable exchange rates.\nYear-over-year, we saw declines in this business due to the macro environment and our decision to exit certain nonstrategic product lines last year.\nIn Q1, cloud's adjusted EBITDA margin improved over 800 basis points versus prior year, driven by expense alignment to post-COVID operating model targets and improved mix related to our prior year business exits.\nWe expect cloud margins to remain healthy in the low to mid-20% range.\nPromotional Solutions first quarter 2021 revenue was $124.5 million.\nWhile down 12.8% year-over-year, the sequential rate of decline improved 380 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 14.2%, up 640 basis points due to year-over-year reductions in SG&A expenses.\nWe are anticipating improved adjusted EBITDA margins throughout 2021 in the low to mid-teens as a result of value realization initiatives and cost actions taken in 2020, including meaningful improvements in our distributor relationships.\nChecks first quarter revenue declined 8.1% from last year to $175.1 million due to anticipated secular trends compounded by the impact of the pandemic.\nThe rate of decline did improve 180 basis points sequentially from Q4 despite severe weather impacts, clearly signaling to COVID recovery.\nFirst quarter adjusted EBITDA margin levels continue to be strong at 47.7%.\nBased on high renewal rates and new businesses won in 2020 and in the first quarter of 2021, we anticipate secular check declines to return to mid-single-digit rates or better, consistent with the recoveries from previous economic slowdowns.\nNow turning to our balance sheet and cash flow.\nWe ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $427.7 million, including $125.4 million of cash.\nDuring the quarter, the amount drawn under the credit facility was unchanged from the year-end and remained at $840 million.\nResulting net debt decreased for the fourth consecutive quarter, ending the quarter at $714.6 million, the lowest level in nearly three years.\nWe think this result in the middle of an unprecedented pandemic highlights the financial acumen and discipline of this management team.\nFree cash flow, defined as cash provided by operating activities plus capital expenditures, was $17.9 million for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $5.7 million or 46.7% improvement compared to last year.\nThe increase was primarily due to improved working capital efficiency.\nOur Board approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share on all outstanding shares.\nThe dividend will be payable on June 7, 2021, to all shareholders of record on May 24, 2021.\nWe did not repurchase common stock in the first quarter.\nAs a reminder, our capital allocation priorities are to first responsibly invest in growth while paying our dividend; and second, to pay down debt.\nWe will evaluate future repurchases on an opportunistic basis.\nNow turning to guidance.\nAs I mentioned on the fourth quarter of 2020 call, we are well positioned for a recovery to further accelerate in the second quarter, enabling us to exit the year of sales-driven mid-single-digit revenue growth company without the benefit of acquisitions.\nI will remind you this achievement will be historic as the company has not reported sales-driven growth in the mid-single digits in more than a decade.\nThis really is a new Deluxe.\nAs a result and on a stand-alone basis, without the impact of First American, we are reiterating our guidance for full year 2021 revenue growth of 0% to 2% and full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin of 20% to 21%.\nWe continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $90 million as we continue with important transformation work, innovation investments and building future scale across our product categories.\nWe also continue to expect a tax rate of approximately 25%.\nWe will update our full year guidance, including First American during our second quarter 2021 earnings call in early August.\nJust to summarize, I'm pleased with the first quarter results and believe that the company is in a position of strength as we continue the strong momentum we've been demonstrating, and we look forward to delivering on our 2021 expectations.\nNow back to Barry.\nOur first quarter results clearly demonstrate our continued momentum and the power of our One Deluxe strategy.\nThe logical and responsible acquisition of First American is entirely consistent with our long-standing strategy and will serve to accelerate our growth, transforming Deluxe into a payments and trusted business technology company.\nWe sat in the past 2.5 years preparing Deluxe to reenter the M&A market by improving our technology, reorganizing our sales structure and strategy, expanding our product set, building out our management team and strengthening our balance sheet.\nAs I said before, I'm incredibly proud that our team delivered these prerequisites on an expedited time line in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic.\nWe say what we're going to do, and we do what we say, consistently.\nWe really are a new Deluxe.\nOperator, we're now ready to take questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:For today's call, Jeff will begin by covering a summary of our third quarter.\nRoop will then discuss our detailed third quarter results, including a cash and balance sheet summary and fourth quarter guidance.\nJeff will wrap up with an outlook by market sector, an update on our strategic initiatives and a discussion on our midterm financial model before we conclude the call with Q&A.\nWe hope you are all staying safe and healthy during these unprecedented times.\nIn Q3, we delivered revenue of $526 million, which was up 7% sequentially from Q2, supported by strong demand in our defense, semi-cap and telco sectors and improved manufacturing productivity.\nWith improving operational efficiency, non-GAAP gross margins rebounded 170 basis points to 8.7% for the quarter.\nImproved profits and focused expense management resulted in non-GAAP earnings of $0.32 per share, which includes $1.3 million or $0.04 per share of COVID-related costs.\nWe believe COVID costs are a part of the new operating normal.\nAnd while we believe they will decline to some degree from current levels, they will likely not completely go away.\nAfter a challenging couple of quarters, I'm pleased to report that our manufacturing and engineering services operations have essentially returned to pre-COVID productivity levels, which has supported our improved results for Q3.\nThis has not been without an incredible amount of work from our COVID task force and our entire employee population to maintain stringent protocols to ensure we keep our workplace safe and healthy, which remains a top priority.\nOur cash conversion cycle for the quarter improved to 81 days from 84 days in Q2.\nAs I've mentioned previously, our go-to-market team continues to deliver exciting opportunities aligned to our complex and focused services and solutions that utilize the full breadth of the One Benchmark capabilities.\nAnd we had another strong quarter of bookings in Q3, where we awarded business that should represent over $200 million of future engineering and manufacturing revenue.\nIn the medical sector, we were awarded a new program for a lab-free rapid COVID-19 testing device from DnaNudge that has begun production in our Netherlands facility.\nWe are excited to partner with DnaNudge to provide DFX support and high reliability manufacturing for what has turned out to be a very swift product ramp.\nWe also had design and manufacturing process wins with two other companies for a pulmonary treatment device and an optical diagnostic product for renal applications.\nIn the defense vertical, we were awarded new programs for secure communication radio modules that incorporate our design solutions and manufacturing services for electronics that will be deployed in military aircraft.\nIn industrials, we were awarded the full system box build for a LiDAR application, and we were awarded manufacturing for a new generation of oscilloscopes.\nIn computing, we were awarded a new prototype for a hyperscale computing customer and a new outsourcing award from an existing customer supporting network control and monitoring electronics.\nOur new business pipeline continues to be strong across our targeted sectors and subsectors, and we remain very encouraged about the prospect for continued wins, where the outsourcing environment for both engineering and manufacturing projects remains favorable.\nI hope everyone and their families continue to stay safe and healthy.\nTotal Benchmark revenue was $526 million in Q3, a 7% increase on a sequential basis.\nMedical revenues for the third quarter were flat sequentially as expected from moderating demand for products involved in COVID-19 therapies, such as ventilators, x-rays and ultrasound devices.\nNew product demand is shifting more toward diagnostic devices, such as DnaNudge's diagnostic box, which we were awarded in Q3.\nSemi-cap revenues were up 14% in the third quarter and up 45% year-over-year from continued strong demand across our semi-cap customers.\nA&D revenues for the third quarter increased 18% sequentially due to strong defense demand in surveillance, connectivity, encryption and digital subsystems and from new program wins.\nConversely, commercial aerospace demand, which was 30% of 2019 revenues, remain muted and declined on certain platforms during the quarter.\nIndustrial revenues for the third quarter were flat sequentially from continued softness for products in the oil and gas industry, which was approximately 20% of our 2019 revenue.\nIn addition, demand remains muted for customers that support commercial building infrastructure and transportation markets.\nOverall, the higher value markets represented 81% of our third quarter revenue.\nIn the traditional markets, computing revenues were flat sequentially from stable demand in high-performance computing and data center storage products.\nTelco was up 16% from Q2 with improved demand in commercial satellite and network infrastructure products.\nOur traditional markets represented 19% of third quarter revenues.\nOur top 10 customers represented 42% of sales in the third quarter.\nOur GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $0.16.\nOur GAAP results included restructuring and other onetime costs totaling $7.2 million.\n$6.3 million of these costs are related to the impairment of assets and severance and other items related to the decision to exit a certain line of business in our A&D sector related to turbine machining.\nThe remaining $900,000 of restructuring and other onetime costs are due to various restructuring activities around our sites.\n$1.6 million insurance recovery related to our Q4 2019 ransomware event.\nTo date, we have recovered $6.6 million.\nTurning to slide eight.\nFor Q3, our non-GAAP gross margin was 8.7%, a 170 basis point sequential increase.\nDuring the quarter, gross margin was positively impacted by higher revenues, which enabled improved leverage across our cost structure, increased productivity across our sites and lower sequential COVID-19-related costs.\nWe estimate that we incurred approximately $1.3 million or approximately $0.04 per share of COVID costs in the quarter versus $3.4 million in Q2.\nOur SG&A was $29.7 million, an increase of $1.2 million sequentially and a decrease of $1.2 million year-over-year.\nWe expect that our SG&A costs will be relatively flat sequentially between Q3 and Q4.\nOperating margin was 3%, an increase from 1.2% in Q2 due to the higher revenue and increased gross margin.\nIn Q3, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 18.6%, which was lower than expected as a result of the insurance recovery reported in Q3 and the distribution of profits around the globe.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share was $0.32 for the quarter.\nNon-GAAP ROIC was 5.8%.\nOur non-GAAP earnings per share improved sequentially based on our improved operational performance, lower net interest expense and lower tax rate.\nOur cash balance was $335 million at September 30, with $161 million available in the U.S.\nWe continue to have a strong capital structure, and our liquidity position provides flexibility to manage our business to support our future strategy.\nWe generated $6 million in cash flow from operations and used $6 million for capital expenditures.\nOur accounts receivable balance was $306 million, an increase of $4 million from the prior quarter.\nContract assets were $161 million at September 30 and $154 million at June 30.\nPayables were down $22 million quarter-over-quarter.\nInventory at September 30 was $353 million, down $11 million sequentially.\nTurning to slide 10 to review our cash conversion cycle.\nOur cash conversion cycle days were 81.\nAccounts receivable days improved three days.\nInventory days improved six days, and customer deposits improved by one day to help support an overall sequential improvement of three days.\nTurning to slide 11 for our capital allocation update.\nIn Q3, we continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend of approximately $5.8 million.\nWe expect to continue the recurring quarterly cash dividend.\nThere were no share repurchases in Q3.\nWe will consider restarting share repurchases opportunistically in Q4.\nTurning to slide 12 for a review of our fourth quarter 2020 guidance.\nWe expect revenue to range from $500 million to $540 million.\nWe expect that our gross margins will be 9% to 9.1% for Q4, and SG&A will range between $29 million to $30 million.\nThis range contemplates the SG&A cost reductions that Jeff will review further in his following comments, the continued reduced travel offset by the reestablishment of certain employee salaries that have been temporarily reduced.\nImplied in our guidance is a 3.3% to 3.5% operating margin range for modeling purposes.\nThe guidance provided does exclude the impact of amortization of intangible assets and estimated restructuring and other costs.\nWe expect to incur restructuring and other nonrecurring costs in Q4 of approximately $2.8 to $3.2 million.\nOur non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.32 to $0.36 or a midpoint of $0.34.\nWe estimate that we will generate approximately $45 million to $50 million cash flow from operations for fiscal year 2020.\ncapex for the year will be approximately $32 million to $38 million as we prioritize investments to support our new customers and expand our production capacity for future growth.\nOther expenses net is expected to be $2.7 million, which is primarily interest expense related to our outstanding debt.\nWe expect that for Q4, our non-GAAP effective tax rate will be between 18% to 20% because of the distribution of income around our global network.\nThe expected weighted average shares for Q4 are 36.5 million.\nThis guidance takes into consideration all known constraints for the quarter and assumes no further significant interruptions to our supply base, operations or customers.\nGuidance also assumes no material changes to end market conditions due to COVID-19.\nFollowing Roop's comments on our guidance for the fourth quarter, I wanted to provide additional color on our view of demand by sector, shown on slide 14.\nOverall, for the fourth quarter, we expect increased revenues from stronger demand and new programs in defense, industrials and telco to offset anticipated declines in medical as we pivot manufacturing from COVID-19-related therapeutic equipment to diagnostic, trauma and elective surgical devices.\nThe resulting Q4 revenue should be in line with Q3 levels.\nWe do not expect a seasonal uptrend in Q4 this year as customers are more cautious on increasing their demand signals given the economic and geopolitical environment.\nNow turning to the medical sector.\nDuring the first half of this year, we saw demand reductions in our core medical products in the cardiac, renal and orthopedic markets associated with trauma and elective surgeries as many of our existing customers and new customers reallocated their manufacturing and sales capacity in the fight against COVID.\nAs reported, one of the existing key cardiac customers, ZOLL Medical, enlisted Benchmark to support a rapid ramp of manufacturing capability to support ventilator production.\nIn the fourth quarter, we see declining demand for COVID-19 therapy devices, but the corresponding demand recovery for our non-COVID products isn't expected to start until first half of next year.\nThis anticipated recovery, along with new medical programs, gives us confidence that next year will be another growth year for the medical sector.\nIn semi-cap, after a stronger-than-expected increase in Q3, demand remained stable for semiconductor capital equipment in Q4.\nWe remain well positioned in this sector with our advanced precision machining and electronics manufacturing and further demand outlook.\nThis sector is expected to remain strong as the semiconductor capital equipment index is predicting another growth year in 2021.\nMoving to the A&D sector outlook.\nOur aerospace and defense sector is comprised of approximately 70% defense-related products and 30% commercial aerospace offerings based on 2019 revenue levels.\nDefense demand across the portfolio remained strong in Q4 as we support many funded programs across the United States Armed Forces.\nWe are anticipating that our commercial aircraft programs, which have declined significantly in first half '20, have a limited demand recovery in Q4 and in fiscal year 2021.\nAs Roop mentioned earlier, we have not seen an uptick in orders in industrials for oil and gas and the building and transportation infrastructure markets, where many large projects continue to be delayed.\nDespite soft demand, we do expect an overall increase in industrials in Q4 for new programs and an increased number of global engineering services projects.\nOverall, we see stable demand across our computing and telco customer base.\nHigh-performance computing projects are in flight as expected in the second half but are being offset to some degree with the persistent weakness in higher-value enterprise applications as the remote work trend continues.\nIn telco, network infrastructure product demand across a number of our customers remain strong from the continued need for greater bandwidth for data services.\nAfter a nice rebound in Q3, demand from our commercial satellite customers remained stable in Q4.\nAs Roop shared in our guidance, with this revenue and sector mix forecast, we remain on track to achieve at least 9% gross margins in Q4.\nWe continue to make steady progress on our key strategic initiatives that we laid out for 2020.\nMy staff and I review progress regularly, and we share updates with our extended teams to ensure all of Benchmark is focused on a common set of goals.\nFirst, customer focus is a top priority at Benchmark.\nWe are working as an organization using customer feedback to find ways to optimize our engagement model and make it easier to do business with our organization.\nThis attention, coupled with operational performance, are the cornerstones for customer satisfaction, which I'm happy to report remains at a high level.\nWith many of our growth and strategic accounts, we are building deliberate long-term technology road maps and business relationships to help inform how we can invest in and be more valuable to our customers in the future.\nThis customer-centric approach is an important foundation in growing our business.\nIn our sector strategies, we have a keen focus on selecting the vertical submarkets most aligned to our value proposition.\nOur objective within these markets is to expand and scale with strategic customers by selecting the full breadth of services and capabilities.\nThis includes focused investment in technology innovations that differentiate Benchmark against other competitors and even against prospective customers' internal manufacturing to increase our win rates.\nThis thesis is playing out well across each of our higher-value sectors.\nIn fact, over the last year, we have seen improvements in engineering services tied to EMS deals and vice versa.\nNext, we continue to drive enterprise efficiencies.\nWe are continuing work on our global footprint optimization, where we are winding down manufacturing in some locations and ramping up new production in other locations.\nThe goal is to gain efficiencies with fewer rooftops by selecting locations with operational synergies and align with customer preference.\nTo this end, in the third quarter, we made the decision to exit a line of business in our A&D sector related to turbine machining.\nThis is the right decision when we look at strategic alignment of the impacted facility and the prolonged downturn in commercial aerospace demand driven by the pandemic.\nThese decisions are never easy, but we're focused on our long-term strategy.\nIn addition, we have a rigorous focus on controlling our costs and expense management through improved processes, G&A centralization activities and intense focus on project and investment prioritization.\nWe are reshaping our SG&A landscape.\nFor next year, we are targeting SG&A at or below $130 million even with the end to temporary salary cuts and corporate furloughs, higher travel expenses and higher variable compensation.\nThe hard work we have invested in our HR, IT, finance and other shared services to enable centralization are yielding lower costs next year.\nUnfortunately, this does require restructuring activities, which, as Roop has mentioned, will occur this quarter.\nFinally, I want to close with our initiative on engaging talent and shifting our culture.\nAs I've said, Benchmark has a great cultural foundation that starts with a committed workforce who wants to deliver for our customers.\nOur investments in this initiative will include focus on better self-service tools, increased empowerment and critical skills development to ensure the talent the organization needs in future leaders can be found within our own diverse team.\nThis includes the ongoing commitment to advancing diversity and inclusion efforts at all levels in the company, which we are enhancing as part of our ongoing ESG focus.\nFor technology companies like Benchmark, competitiveness requires innovation, fresh ideas and creative thinking, all areas fueled by diversity.\nThe attentive work on these strategic priorities formed the foundation for setting our midterm target model through the year 2022.\nThe company had a great start at pivoting the higher-value markets before my arrival, and we are now at our target mix between traditional and higher-value splits.\nThe right markets and customer selection remains key to our strategy.\nSetting COVID and the resulting macroeconomic uncertainty aside, we believe that we can grow revenue at a 5% compound annual growth rate over the next two years by growing our current accounts and ramping new programs with our targeted new customers.\nWhile we're overcoming some pretty significant revenue decline headwinds in our aerospace and oil and gas markets and other demand softness in our installed base due to the pandemic recession, our growth expectations speak to the strength in our recent bookings and outsourcing wins.\nAs the economy picks up later in 2021 and through 2022, we expect our growth can accelerate further with this new win momentum and recovery in our customer installed base.\nWith our current mix of business, the success of ongoing operational excellence initiatives and our current global footprint, we are targeting gross margins in the range of 9.3% to 9.7%.\nOn the SG&A expense line, I'm committed to effective overhead management and have taken the necessary actions to drive an efficient organization that is rightsized to support our customers and employees effectively.\nAs the company expands and needs greater investments and capabilities, we will keep expenses aligned to our future revenue growth.\nThe resulting non-GAAP operating margin target range will be between 3.4% to 3.8%.\nWith this model, we feel comfortable that we can grow earnings faster than revenue.\nAs operating margins improve, we see resulting improvement in ROIC.\nI am confident and remain excited about our team's ability to capitalize on the growth opportunities in our diverse end markets, where our deal pipeline in win rate is increasing, and we remain focused on executing our ongoing initiatives to increase incremental value for our customers, employees and shareholders.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These statements are based on management's expectations, plans and estimates of our prospects.\nToday's statements may be time-sensitive and accurate only as of today's date, Thursday, July 23, 2020.\nWe assume no obligation to update our statements or the other information we provide.\nAlso on the call today are Jojo Yap, our Chief Investment Officer; Peter Schultz, Executive Vice President; Chris Schneider, Senior Vice President of Operations; and Bob Walter, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets and Asset Management.\nI hope that you and yours are maintaining your health as we all work through these challenging times.\nBefore we discuss the quarter, we would like to express our gratitude and bid farewell to an important member of the First Industrial family.\nAs we previously disclosed, Bruce Duncan has retired from our Board.\nAs many of you know, Bruce has taken on a new challenge as CEO of another REIT.\nBruce joined First Industrial as our CEO in 2009 during a difficult period and provided tremendous leadership to help stabilize and transform our business model and portfolio.\nWe wish Bruce well in his new role.\nAs you may also have seen, seasoned FR Director, Matt Dominski, has taken over as Chairperson.\nMatt has been a highly productive member of our Board since 2010.\nWe are thrilled to have Matt as our new Chair and look forward to his continued counsel and leadership.\nMoving now to the quarter.\nWe produced strong results demonstrated in several different areas, including collections, leasing, investment and capital markets.\nOur regional teams have done a fantastic job in the second quarter on collections.\nAs of yesterday, we have collected 98% of 2Q monthly rental billings and so far, we've collected 97% of July billings, which is ahead of the pace we experienced in the second quarter.\nIf we include collections from government-related tenants that regularly pay at the end of the month, our collection rate for July would also be 98%.\nAbout 65% of the outstanding monthly rental billings in the second quarter were in jurisdictions that have moratoriums on the landlord's right to evict, which we believe, is a contributing factor toward the open receivables for this group.\nTo be clear, in our calculation of this collections percentage metric, the numerator reflects cash collections and we do not give ourselves credit under our methodology for the application of security deposit.\nIn addition, the denominator reflects the total monthly rental billings and is not reduced for any reserves for bad debt expense or rent deferrals.\nIncluding surrendered security deposits and bad debt reserves recognized in the second quarter, our outstanding accounts receivable related to our monthly rental billings in 2Q is only $550,000.\nRent relief requests have tapered off to a minimum.\nDuring the COVID-19 crisis to-date, we have established rent deferment agreements with 14 tenants totaling $750,000 or about 18 basis points of annualized billings.\nThe average term for these deferrals is 1.3 months.\nIt appears the government stimulus has helped a number of our customers and business leaders in general are more optimistic about their prospects.\nThe industrial business continues to perform well as commerce continues to flow through logistics facility.\nAs you've seen, economic activity has improved since March and April and our customers and prospects are moving ahead with new space requirements albeit with caution, in some cases.\nIn its second quarter preliminary flash report, CBRE reported 19 million square feet of net absorption versus 56 million square feet of completion.\nThese figures should not be a surprise given the economic slowdown attributable to COVID and the resulting drop in Q2 leasing activity.\nHowever, we are optimistic about our long term prospects given the acceleration of e-commerce adoption and the potential for additional safety stock, generating incremental demand for logistics space.\nThis view is supported by CBRE's recent forecast that annual net industrial absorption will total more than 333 million square feet by 2022.\nIf they are right, net absorption for the sector will exceed the high watermark, post a great financial crisis of 324 million square feet in 2016 and the all-time mark of 329 million square feet in 2000.\nDespite completions exceeding net absorption nationally in the quarter, our portfolio occupancy increased to 97.7% at quarter-end.\nWe also achieved a big leasing win at our Nottingham Ridge Logistics Center in the I-95 North submarket in Baltimore.\nWe leased 100% of the 585,000 square foot Building A to a leading e-commerce provider on a long term basis, which commenced in late June.\nConsidering we purchased this asset in the first quarter, we leased this property significantly ahead of the 12-month lease-up budgeted in our guidance.\nWith just 54,000 square feet remaining to lease, we are now 93% occupied at this 751,000 square foot two-building project.\nLooking more closely at our portfolio performance.\nAs of July 22nd, we have signed 83% of our 2020 lease expirations at a cash rental rate increase of 8.6%.\nFor the full year, we expect our cash rental rate change on new and renewal leasing to be approximately 10%.\nThe investment market has begun to awaken after a fairly quiet period in which we saw the bid-ask spread widen a bit.\nMost offerings had been shelved as participants saw more clarity on the direction of the economy and asset values.\nThe federal government stimulus actions certainly helped to quell some of those concerns and based on what we are seeing and hearing, pricing has returned to pre-COVID levels and in some cases is higher.\nWe were able to make a few acquisitions during the quarter in some high barrier markets.\nWe acquired a 39,000 square-footer in Fremont in Northern California and added an adjacent building comprised of 46,000 square feet.\nThe aggregate purchase price was $17.8 million with a weighted average initial yield of approximately 4.6%.\nWe also added a 9.7-acre covered land investment in the Inland Empire for $3.5 million.\nThe site has a 3% in-place yield for the next several years, generating some cash for us as we entitled the site.\nThe site will accommodate a 155,000 square foot development.\nThus far in the third quarter, we have closed on a 6.6-acre site in Seattle for $6.1 million that can accommodate a 129,000 square foot building.\nWe are also excited to launch a new build-to-suit development at our First Nandina II site in the Inland Empire.\nThe building will be 221,000 square feet and it's leased on a long term basis to a manufacturer of material handling systems.\nTotal investment is $22.4 million and the initial cash yield will be approximately 6.2%.\nWe are proceeding with all of our developments in process, which totaled 1 million square feet and a total investment of $94.7 million at June 30th.\nIn addition to our on-balance sheet developments, construction on the 643,000 square foot spec building in our Phoenix joint venture at PV303 is progressing well.\nOur portion of the investment is $21 million and our targeted yield is 7%.\nOur on-balance sheet land holdings will accommodate approximately 13 million square feet of future developments, the vast majority of which is entitled and ready to go.\nWe continue to move ahead on infrastructure work at several sites so that we are prepared to launch when we think economic conditions in the specific submarkets justify new starts.\nIn the second quarter, we sold three buildings totaling 211,000 square feet for $14.6 million.\nThese were comprised of a building in Detroit, one in Chicago and our last asset in Indianapolis.\nYear-to-date, we sold 437,000 square feet for a total of $41.1 million.\nAs a reminder, in the third quarter, we expect to close on the $55 million sale in Phoenix, in which the tenant exercised its purchase option in 2019.\nMoving to our recent capital markets activity.\nOn July 7th, we entered into a private placement agreement to issue $300 million in total of 10 and 12 year notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.81%.\nOn July 15th, we closed on an extension of our term loan that was scheduled to mature in January of 2021.\nThese two executions provide us additional capital for new investment and lengthen our maturity schedule.\nSo all in all, a successful and very busy quarter with great execution by our team.\nI will begin with our earnings per share and FFO for the second quarter.\nDiluted earnings per share was $0.28 versus $0.31 one year-ago and NAREIT funds from operations were $0.46 per fully diluted share compared to $0.43 per share in 2Q 2019.\nSecond quarter 2020 FFO includes approximately $500,000 of cash bad debt expense related to tenant accounts receivable and $400,000 of non-cash bad debt expense related to the write-off of certain deferred rent receivables.\nPier 1 has paid July rents and we are assuming they pay August rent, which in total represents a $500,000 pick up from our prior guidance.\nOccupancy was strong at 97.7%, up 60 basis points from the prior quarter and up 40 basis points from a year-ago.\nAs for leasing volume during the quarter, we commenced approximately 2.9 million square feet of leases, 600,000 were new, 1.6 million were renewals and 700,000 were for developments and acquisitions with lease-up.\nTenant retention by square footage was 88.7%.\nSame-store NOI growth on a cash basis, excluding termination fees, was 6.3% helped by increase in rental rates on new and renewal leasing, a decrease in free rent and rental rate bumps embedded in our leases.\nThis was partially offset by increase in bad debt expense and slightly lower average occupancy.\nCash rental rates were up 11% overall with renewals up 8.9% and new leasing 16.7%.\nAnd on a straight-line basis, overall rental rates were up 32.4% with renewals increasing 30.6% and new leasing up 37.5%.\nAs Peter mentioned, we executed on two capital market transactions in the third quarter that extend and ladder our maturities at attractive rates.\nFirst, we entered into an agreement to issue $300 million of fixed rate senior unsecured notes in a private placement offering.\nThe notes are comprised of two tranches, $100 million with a 10-year term at a rate of 2.74% and $200 million with a 12-year term at a rate of 2.84%.\nWe expect to close on the offering on or about September 17th of this year.\nOn an interim basis, we will use these funds to pay down our line of credit, which will give us more liquidity to fund new investment and a secured debt maturity in 2021.\nWe also refinanced our $200 million unsecured term loan, previously scheduled to mature at the end of January 2021.\nThe new loan has an initial maturity date of July 2021, which we can push to July 2023 via two one-year extensions exercisable at our option.\nThe loan features interest-only payments and bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 150 basis points.\nIn conjunction with the new term loan, we entered into new interest rate swap agreements that convert the loan to a fixed interest rate of 2.49%, beginning in February 2021.\nIn 2021, we will realize about a penny per share of savings due to this refinancing.\nAfter these two executions, one of our remaining 2021 maturities is the aforementioned $63 million of secure debt in the fourth quarter.\nWe can pay that off using our line, which will have additional capacity created by the proceeds from our private placement offering.\nThe other is our line of credit, which matures in October of 2021, but we can push that out another year through a one-year extension exercisable at our option.\nOur leverage is also in good shape with our net debt plus preferred stock to EBITDA at 5.2 times at January -- at June 30th.\nOur guidance range for NAREIT FFO and FFO before one-time items is now $1.76 to $1.84 per share with a midpoint of $1.80.\nThis is an increase of $0.02 per share compared to the midpoint of our guidance on our first quarter call.\nThe increase is primarily due to the early lease up of the 585,000 square foot building at the Nottingham Ridge Logistics Center as well as two months of additional rental income from Pier 1.\nThis is slightly offset by additional interest expense based on our assumption that we use the funds from our private placement offering to pay down our line of credit in the near term.\nOur assumption for the average -- for the range of average quarter-end occupancy remains 96% to 97% and our cash bad debt expense assumption remains $900,000 for each of the third and fourth quarters.\nPlease note that guidance does not include any potential write-offs of deferred rent receivables related to tenants that are having financial difficulties.\nOther key assumptions for guidance are as follows, same-store NOI growth on a cash basis before termination fees of 3.25% to 4.25%, an increase of 25 basis points at the midpoint and a tightening of the range.\nOur G&A guidance range remains at $31 million to $32 million and guidance also includes the anticipated 2020 costs related to our completed and under construction developments at June 30th, plus the third quarter start of First Nandina II.\nIn total, for the full year 2020, we expect to capitalize about $0.04 per share of interest related to our developments.\nThe impact of any future gain related to the final settlement of one insurance claim from a damaged property.\nAnd guidance also excludes the potential issuance of equity.\nOur company is built for the long term and we are well positioned to drive cash flow growth for shareholders by serving logistics needs of a range of essential and emerging businesses, while capitalizing on the secular drivers of e-commerce.\nWith that, we will now move to the question-and-answer portion of our call.\nSummary: ",
    "output": "compname reports second quarter ffo per share of $0.46.\nq2 ffo per share $0.46.\nq2 earnings per share $0.28.\n2020 ffo guidance increased $0.02 at midpoint to $1.80 per share/unit primarily reflecting portfolio performance.\n"

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Growth continues to be a theme for AMG as evidenced by our outstanding second-quarter results, which were driven by the consistent execution of our strategy and enhanced by our focus on new investments.\nEconomic earnings per share of $4.03 grew 47% year over year and represented the strongest second quarter in our history, primarily driven by EBITDA growth of 40% and ongoing share repurchase activity.\nYear to date, our affiliates excellent absolute and relative investment performance has resulted in higher asset levels, enhanced organic growth, and meaningful performance fees.\nWe began the quarter by announcing our new investment in OCP Asia, increasing our exposure to the region and its fast-growing private credit markets, and we ended the quarter with the announcement of our newest partnership in Parnassus, the largest independent ESG-dedicated fund manager in the industry.\nTogether with our recent investment in Boston Common, a long-term leader in impact investing, we expect that these new affiliates will contribute over 90 million in EBITDA in 2022 and contribute meaningfully to our organic growth over time.\nAnd we are only halfway through 2021.\nWith the addition of Parnassus, our run-rate EBITDA is now over 1 billion, increasing our opportunity to invest in new affiliates and areas of secular growth and in resources to enhance the growth of our existing affiliates, including strategic growth capital and distribution.\nAs evidenced by our seven new partnerships, which we've established over the last two years, our model is resonating with the highest quality independent investment firms in the industry.\nLooking ahead, we see an even greater opportunity to execute on our new investment opportunity set, given the favorable transaction environment, AMG's strong competitive position, and the increasing demand for our partnership solutions.\nAs I highlighted in prior quarters, throughout the pandemic, a number of client demand trends have remained intact, including the ongoing demand for illiquid alternatives, while other trends have accelerated, such as the appetite for responsible and impact investing, all against the backdrop of an improving environment for active management.\nOur strategy is focused on investing in areas of secular growth and our new investments in 2021 reflect this focus as we've increased our exposure to fast-growing segments such as Asia, private markets and ESG.\nWith the addition of Parnassus, Boston Common, and Inclusive Capital Partners, AMG's affiliates will now manage more than 80 billion in dedicated ESG strategies, and more than 600 billion in strategies that integrate ESG into their investment process, and they are positioned to capitalize on future growth as investors around the world continue to turn to active managers for responsible and impact investing.\nA pioneer in sustainable investing, Parnassus has a 37-year track record of investing based on principles and performance, achieving attractive risk-adjusted returns by building portfolios that also have a positive societal impact.\nWe have known Ben Allen, Todd Alston, and their partners for nearly a decade.\nAnd when it came time for Parnassus to choose a permanent partner and complete the first generational transition in the firm's long-term succession plan, they chose AMG.\nWe believe that AMG's partnership approach is the best solution in the market today for independent firms.\nAs it preserves the alignment between clients and partners across multiple generations while maintaining unique entrepreneurial cultures of partner-owned firms.\nAnd this will be especially important to Parnassus given its leading market position and responsible and impact investing.\nSuccession planning has been and continues to be a core component of AMG's partnership approach as generational succession and demographically driven transition is inevitable for partner-owned firms.\nSelecting an experienced supportive partner is critical to the long-term success of these independent firms.\nAMG's expertise and collaborating with affiliates to develop and execute management transition plans and align incentives across generations of affiliate partners remains a significant differentiating factor as firms select AMG as their institutional partner.\nToday, having worked with affiliates on these matters for nearly three decades, AMG is able to provide customized solutions for new partnerships based on our foundational principles of independence, alignment, and support.\nOver the past two years, we have significantly enhanced our strategic focus and our resources dedicated to originating, structuring, and executing on new investments.\nFor the first time since 2016, the majority of our cash flow will be deployed in new affiliate, investments already announced with additional high-quality prospects in our transaction pipeline.\nAs I said before, growth was certainly a theme for the second quarter.\nIn addition to new investments, the strategic actions we have taken to invest in our affiliates and in distribution resources on behalf of our affiliates are also key contributors to that growth.\nDuring the quarter, we completed the evolution of our U.S. wealth platform, AMG Funds, to an affiliate-only model, consistent with our institutional distribution strategy.\nWe have received shareholder approval for all funds transitioning from external sub-advisors, resulting in an incremental 4 billion in assets now being managed by our affiliates.\nAs part of these changes, we are offering a more differentiated product lineup at lower fees and providing clients access to excellent affiliate strategies, including in attractive areas such as ESG equities and fixed income, Asian equities, and international equities.\nThis is an important evolution of our strategy as all of AMG's operations and resources across our institutional wealth platforms globally are now fully aligned with our affiliates, which positions us to deliver meaningful additional organic growth over time.\nAnd this is just one example of shareholder value creation through investments in our affiliates growth.\nSeveral years ago, we ceded the AMG Pantheon's fund with $10 million, given the opportunity we saw to provide U.S. wealth investors access to private equity portfolios.\nAnd last week, the fund reached a significant milestone, crossing the $0.5 billion mark in AUM.\nThe fund's performance is outstanding and its organic growth is accelerating as U.S. wealth investors are seeing the benefits of allocating to private equity in their portfolios.\nThis is a great example of how AMG's central capabilities can drive new growth areas for our affiliates.\nIn addition, we have been actively investing in affiliates through lift-outs, including global sustainable equities and fixed-income teams at Artemis and more recently at Pantheon, where we assisted in lifting out our real estate team for its global infrastructure and real assets platform.\nFinally, the strength and momentum that we described in our business at the start of the year has only just begun to manifest in our results.\nAs we look forward to the second half of 2021 and the full-year 2022, we see tremendous opportunity to further build on this momentum through the continued execution of our strategy to drive top-line EBITDA growth, which, together with share repurchases, will further compound our earnings per share and create meaningful shareholder value over time.\nOur second-quarter results demonstrate the differentiated growth drivers inherent in AMG's business model.\nand our ability to create shareholder value now and into the future.\nOur affiliates delivered strong investment performance.\nWe generated net inflows excluding Quant strategies.\nWe put significant capital to work both in new partnerships and investments in affiliates, and we repurchased stock in the quarter, evidencing our ability to compound growth through each of our cor earnings drivers.\nFor the quarter, adjusted EBITDA of 227 million grew 40% year over year, driven by strong affiliate investment performance in markets and the impact of our growth investments.\nEconomic earnings per share of $4.03 grew 47% year over year.\nFurther benefiting from share repurchase activity.\nNet client cash inflows, excluding certain quantitative strategies, worth 3 billion in the quarter, driven by private markets, specialty fixed income, U.S. equities, ESG strategies, and the strategic evolution of our U.S. wealth platform, AMG Funds.\nOutflows from certain quant strategies totaled 11 billion and had a de minimis impact on our earnings.\nOur organic growth profile continues to improve as clients seek active management solutions in the face of a more volatile market environment, and we continue to add new affiliates in areas of secular growth, including ESG, Asia, and private markets.\nTurning to performance by asset class and excluding certain quantitative strategies.\nIn alternatives, our illiquid strategies posted another strong quarter, with 3.7 billion in net inflows, led by strong fundraising at Pantheon, EIG, and Bearing.\nPerformance in this category remained strong, with more than 90% of assets outperforming benchmarks in the most recent and prior vintages.\nPrivate markets businesses like OCP Asia, continue to be a focus area for us from a new investment perspective and represent a significant source of management fee earnings stability and performance fee potential over the long term.\nWithin liquid alternatives, net inflows were 1.4 billion, supported by continued client appetite for alternative sources of risk and return in the low-yield environment.\nIncluding at affiliates such as Garda and Capula.\nWe continue to see significant performance fee generation in this category, reflecting our excellent performance across our concentrated long-only equity and specialty fixed income strategies.\nMoving to global equities.\nWe reported net outflows of 6.3 billion, driven by idiosyncratic, lower fee institutional reallocation activity.\nThese mandates accounted for approximately two-thirds of the outflows in this category.\nLong-term global equity performance continues to be strong, particularly in strategies that are meaningful contributors to our EBITDA.\nMomentum in our U.S. equity strategies continues with inflows of 2.9 billion, driven by strong client demand, particularly for our value-focused strategies managed by leading firms such as River Road and Yactman and our small-cap strategies.\nOur performance continues to be strong in this category and with our recent investments in Jackson Square, Boston Common, and Parnassus.\nGoing forward, we have a balanced mix of high-performing growth and value strategies.\nOur multi-asset and fixed-income category generated inflows of nearly $1 billion, primarily driven by ongoing demand for muni-bond strategies and wealth-management solutions, particularly at GW&K and Baker Street this quarter.\nFor the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA of 227 million grew 40% year over year, driven by strong affiliate performance in markets and additional earnings power from our recent new affiliate investments.\nOur adjusted EBITDA included 16 million of performance fees, and as I mentioned previously, reflects excellent affiliate investment performance, particularly in our liquid alternatives category.\nEconomic earnings per share of $4.03 grew 47% year over year, further benefiting from ongoing share repurchase activity.\nOur recently announced partnership with Parnassus is expected to close early in the fourth quarter and will therefore have a partial-year impact on our financial results in 2021.\nNet of onetime transaction costs, we expect Parnassus to contribute approximately $15 million to our fourth-quarter EBITDA results.\nOn a full-year 2022 basis, we expect Parnassus to contribute approximately 70 million of EBITDA and $1.30 of economic earnings per share.\nNow moving to specific modeling items for the third quarter.\nWe expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of 215 to 220 million based on current AUM levels, which reflect a flat market blend through yesterday and seasonally lower performance fees of up to 5 million.\nOur share of interest expense was $27 million for the second quarter, and we expect interest expense to be 28 million in the third quarter, reflecting our recent hybrid bond offering.\nControlling interest depreciation was 2 million in the second quarter, and we expect the third quarter to be at a similar level.\nOur share of reported amortization and impairments was 36 million for the second quarter, and we expect it to be similar in the third quarter.\nOur effective GAAP and cash tax rates were 36 and 18%, respectively, for the second quarter and we expect GAAP and cash tax rates to be 25 and 18%, respectively, for the third quarter.\nIntangible-related deferred taxes were 31 million this quarter and we expect this to decline to a more normalized level of 12 million in the third quarter.\nBoth our GAAP tax rate and intangible-related deferred taxes were elevated this quarter as a result of recently enacted U.K. tax rate changes and did not impact economic net income or economic earnings per share.\nOther economic items were negative 4 million.\nIn the third quarter, for modeling purposes, we expect other economic items, excluding any mark-to-market impact on GPNC to be 1 million.\nOur adjusted weighted average share count for the second quarter was 42.5 million, and we expect our share count to be approximately 42.1 million for the third quarter.\nFinally, turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation.\nOur balance sheet remains a source of strength as we invest for growth and consistently return capital to shareholders.\nEarlier this month, we further enhanced the balance sheet by issuing a 40-year $200 million hybrid bond at an asset management industry low coupon of 4.2%.\nWe continue to prioritize extending duration, enhancing flexibility, and maintaining significant capacity to allocate capital to fuel our growth strategy.\nWe also remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders.\nIn the second quarter, we repurchased $80 million of shares, bringing us to $290 million year to date, and we remain on track for $500 million of repurchases for the full year, subject to market conditions and the timing of new affiliate investments.\nOver the last 24 months, we've returned nearly $1 billion of excess capital to shareholders, having repurchased nearly 20% of our shares outstanding, while simultaneously partnering with seven new affiliates, and investing in our existing affiliates and centralized capabilities.\nAs Jay highlighted in his remarks, our strong results this quarter demonstrate AMG's differentiated growth drivers and highlight the strength of our business model and the efficacy of our strategy.\nThe momentum in our business continues to accelerate, and we are putting our capital and resources to work to compound growth over time.\nOur recent new investments in affiliates add significant and growing earnings power to our business and together with our strong capital position and demonstrated ability to return capital to shareholders, we are well-positioned to deliver shareholder value over time.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:This is Kasey Jenkins, Vice President of McCormick Investor Relations.\n[Operator Instructions] We'll begin with remarks from Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman, President and CEO and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nDuring our remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nThese include information in constant currency, as well as adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted income tax rate, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted leverage ratio that exclude the impact of special charges, transaction and integration expenses related to the acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, and for 2019, the net non-recurring benefit associated with the U.S. Tax Act.\nAs a reminder, we completed a 2-for-1 stock split at the end of our fiscal 2020.\nIt is important to note, these statements include expectations and assumptions, which will be shared related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Lawrence.\nStarting on Slide 4, our fourth quarter results completed a year of strong financial performance.\nWe delivered strong results in 2020 despite great disruption proving the strength of our business model, the value of our product, our capabilities as a company, as well as the successful execution of our strategy.\nI am incredibly proud of the way McCormick has performed in this unprecedented operating environment.\nWe drove outstanding underlying operating performance while protecting our employees in recognizing their exceptional performance, making important investments in our supply chain and brand building to fuel future growth and supporting our communities through relief efforts.\nWe're also excited about the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, two fantastic businesses that will continue to support differentiated growth and performance, positioning McCormick for success in 2021 and beyond.\nAs seen on Slide 5, we have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels.\nThe breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers and product offerings it's a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive consistency in our performance during volatile time, as evidenced by our fourth quarter and fiscal year results.\nThe sustained shift at consumer behavior to cooking and eating more at home or at-home consumption drove substantial increases in our Consumer segment demand, as well as increases with our packaged food company customers in our Flavor Solutions segment.\nOn the other hand, we experienced declines in demand from our restaurant and other foodservice customers in the away from home products in our portfolio.\nThe impact of this shift to more at-home consumption has varied by region due to differing levels of away from home consumption in each, as well as the pace of each regions' COVID-19 recovery.\nTaken together, these impacts continue to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our offering.\nHeading into 2021, I'm confident our operating momentum will continue.\nIn our 2021 outlook, our continued underlying business momentum and the Cholula and FONA acquisitions are expected to drive robust sales, adjusted operating income, and earnings growth and fund our investments in business transformation.\nTurning to Slide 6, starting with the fourth quarter results, which were in line with the guidance we provided for sales, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted earnings per share on our last earnings call on our top line versus the year ago period, we grew total sales 5%, including a 1% favorable impact from currency.\nIn constant currency, we grew total sales 4%, with both segments contributing to the increase.\nAdjusted operating income declined 4%, as growth from higher sales and CCI-led cost savings were more than offset by higher planned brand marketing investments, COVID-19-related costs, and higher employee benefit expenses.\nOur fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.79 compared to $0.81 in the prior year, driven primarily by lower adjusted operating income for the partial offset from lower interest expense.\nTurning to our fourth quarter segment business performance, starting on Slide 7 in our Consumer segment, we grew fourth quarter sales by 6%, or constant currency 5% driven by consumers cooking and eating more at home.\nOur Americas constant currency sales growth was 6% in the fourth quarter.\nOur total McCormick U.S.-branded portfolio, as indicated in our IRI consumption data, grew 14% which reflects the strength of our categories as consumers continue to cook more at home.\nSimilar to previous quarters, our sales increase was lower than the U.S. IRI consumption growth, which is attributable to service level pressures and an increased level of pricing in scanner data.\nAs mentioned in our earnings call at the end of September, we expected service level pressures in the fourth quarter due to the sustained increase in demand.\nTo protect our top selling holiday items, we had to suspend or curtail production on some secondary product, which importantly drove our strong holiday execution, and consistent with previous quarters, scanner data includes higher pricing growth due to the channel shift with grocery outpacing mass merchandisers and closed stores, as well as some impact from lower promotional activity.\nFocusing on the U.S. branded portfolio in spices and seasonings and other key categories, excluding dry recipe mixes, we grew fourth quarter consumption at double-digit rate and again, increased our household penetration and repeat buy rates.\nOur fourth quarter dry recipe mix consumption was impacted by supply constraint this has double-digit growth for the year, as with spices and seasonings and the other key categories.\nIn the fourth quarter, we continue to gain share in categories less impacted by supply constraints, including hot sauces, stocks and broth, barbecue sauce, wet marinate, and Asian products.\nThe majority of our categories, continue to outpace the total store and center of store growth rates favorably impacting not only the McCormick brand, but smaller brands as well, such as Stubb's, Lawry's, Simply Asia and Thai Kitchen.\nAnd in e-commerce, we had triple-digit pure-play growth with McCormick branded consumption outpacing all major categories.\nWhile we do not expect consumption to continue at the highly elevated level of our fourth quarter, we do expect continued and long-lasting growth from the increase in consumers cooking more at home the most recent IRI scanner sales data for the five-weeks ending January 17th show total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio consumption is still growing at approximately 11.5% with continued strength in spices and seasonings.\nConsumers are continuing to come to our brand, have a good experience and buy our products again.\nIn the fourth quarter, we increased our brand marketing investments in all regions, as planned, with the Americas messaging and promotional activities focused on a holiday proving to be successful.\nWith our high level of effective brand marketing investments and our initiatives to deepen our digital engagement with consumers we're capitalizing on the opportunity to build long-term brand equity, capture trial and increased usage by existing consumers.\nAnd with the manufacturing capacity we've recently added, we're well-positioned moving into 2021, and we'll continue to drive growth with strong brand marketing, category management initiatives and new product innovations.\nNow turning to EMEA, our constant currency sales rose 10% in the fourth quarter with broad-based growth across the region.\nOur largest markets continue to drive double-digit total branded consumption growth with market share gains across the region at several categories.\nSpices and seasonings consumption was strong in all markets and our Vahine brand in France again had strong consumption growth and outpaced the homemade desserts category.\nAand in U.K., Frank's RedHot drove the hot sauce category growth and gained share with over 50% consumption growth.\nIn EMEA, our household penetration and rate of repeat buyers increased significantly across our major brands and markets during the fourth quarter and the full year compared to last year.\nImportantly, for the full year, we gained total EMEA region's market share in spices and seasonings and dry recipe mixes.\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, our constant currency sales declined 10% driven by softness in branded foodservice products, which are included in our Consumer segment in this region.\nThe foodservice industry is continuing to recover, but at a gradual pace.\nGrowth in China was also impacted by a shift to a later Chinese New Year in 2021, which in turn impacted shipments at the end of our year.\nExcluding those impacts, consumer consumption in the region was strong, particularly at Gourmet Garden and Frank's RedHot in Australia.\nTurning to Slide 8, our sales performance in Flavor Solutions return to growth in the fourth quarter with a constant currency sales increase of 3% and all three regions contributed to the sales growth.\nIn both our Americas and EMEA regions, we experienced increased demand from our consumer packaged food customers or at-home customer base with the strength in the base business, as well as momentum with new products.\nAlso in both regions, we experienced demand declines in our away from home customer base for branded foodservice and restaurant customers.\nThe net impact of this demand volatility, along with pricing actions to cover cost increases drove EMEA's fourth quarter constant currency sales growth of 5% and then the Americas, which is more skewed to branded foodservice growth of 2%.\nIn the Asia-Pacific region our constant currency sales grew 7% driven by Australia and China's growth with quick service restaurant for QSR customers, but we continue to see momentum at limited time offers and the core business partially driven by the customers' promotional activities.\nMoving from our fourth quarter results, I'm pleased to share our full fiscal year accomplishments.\nIt's not only highlight what we've achieved during 2020, but fuel our confidence to drive another year of strong operating performance in 2021.\nNow starting with our 2020 financial results as seen on Slide 9, we grow 5% constant currency sales growth with 10% growth in our Consumer segment led by consumers cooking and eating more at home.\nPartially offsetting this growth was a 2% constant currency sales decline in the Flavor Solutions segment as COVID-19 restrictions in most markets, as well as consumer reluctance to dine out, reduced demand from restaurant and other foodservice customer.\nWe achieved $113 million of annual cost savings driven by our CCI program, our fuel for growth and there continues to be a long runway in 2021 and beyond to deliver additional cost savings.\n2020 was the ninth consecutive year with record cash flow from operations ending the year at over $1 billion, a 10% increase from last year.\nWe're making great progress with our working capital improvements.\nAt year-end, our Board of Directors announced a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend marking our 35th consecutive year of dividend increases.\nWe have paid dividends every year since 1925 and are proud to be a dividend aristocrat.\nNow I would like to comment on some of our 2020 achievements beyond our financial performance.\nE-commerce growth accelerated significantly in 2020, which we were well prepared for from our past investments and investments we activated early in the year.\nOur 2020 growth of 136% was outstanding, with triple-digit growth in all categories, including pure-play, click and collect and our own direct-to-consumer properties.\nWe expect the consumer shift increased online shopping to continue and we are well-positioned for the opportunities still ahead.\nWe continue to build long-term brand equity through our brand marketing investments, increasing at 7% in fiscal 2020.\nMost recently, with a double-digit increase in the fourth quarter across all regions, which will continue to drive strong growth momentum into 2021.\nWe designed targeted media and messaging focused on cooking at home and connecting with consumers digitally more than ever in 2020.\nOur digital leadership was again recognized, as we were ranked as the number 1 food brand with the highest designation of genius by Gartner L2 research in their Digital IQ U.S. ranking.\nThis is the seventh year in a row, we were ranked in the top five food and beverage brands.\nWe continue to be recognized for our efforts for doing what's right for people, communities and the planet.\nDuring 2020, we were recognized for the fourth consecutive year, as a DiversityInc Top 50 company.\nAnd earlier this week, Corporate Knights ranked McCormick in their 2021 Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations Index, as a number 1 in the food products industry for the 5th consecutive year, as well as the number 1 U.S. company overall and globally number 6 overall.\nFinally, during the year, we continue to invest to expand our global infrastructure.\nIn the Americas, we broke ground on a new state-of-the-art Northeast Distribution Center in Maryland, which will optimize our distribution network.\nIn our EMEA region, we began construction on the new Flavor Solutions' manufacturing facility in the U.K. to support the region's strong and growing customer base.\nIn China, we are investing in flavor capabilities to further drive Flavor solutions' growth.\nThese investments will create both capacity and capability, which will further drive our growth momentum.\nTurning to 2021, Mike will go over our guidance in a few moments.\nBut I'd like to comment on our recent acquisition announcements and provide highlights related to our growth momentum and 2021 plan.\nStarting on Slide 11, in addition to the accomplishments I just mentioned, we have reinforced our global flavor leadership and accelerated our condiment and flavors growth platforms with the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA.\nCholula, an iconic brand and a high growth category is a leading Mexican hot sauce and highly complements our existing hot sauce portfolio, broadening our flavor offerings to consumers and food service operators.\nFONA, a leading North American manufacturer of flavors increases the scale of our global flavors platform, with the addition of its highly complementary portfolio to our Flavor Solutions segment, expanding our breadth and accelerating our portfolio migration, more value-added and technically insulated products.\nWe're excited about the 2021 growth contributions we expect from Cholula and FONA, which closed at the end of November and December respectively.\nFor both acquisitions, our transition and integration activities are progressing according to our plans and the alignment of our organizations is under way to deliver on opportunities quickly and to aggressively drive growth.\nWe have a proven playbook and unmatched expertise to effectively and efficiently unlock Cholula's significant growth potential.\nIn our Consumer segment we will leverage our operational expertise and infrastructure to elevate Cholula's brand presence, increase the availability of its products and extended its product offerings into new flavors, formats and eating occasions to drive trial and household penetration.\nBuilding our enthusiasm is an outstanding momentum Cholula carried into 2021 continuing to outpace category growth with strong consumption.\nIn our Flavor solutions segment with our broad presence across all foodservice channels we'll be focusing on strengthening Cholula's go-to-market model.\nThere are opportunities to expand Cholula's distribution and its existing foodservice channel, as well as increase new restaurant penetration, which we are uniquely positioned to realize and drive growth.\nMcCormick's reach across customers combined with our culinary foundation and deep insights on menu trends expands the recipe inspiration and Flavor Solutions that we offered to operators.\nTurning to FONA, which in addition to accelerating our portfolio migration will be the cornerstone for accelerating our Americas flavor platform.\nBy expanding our breadth and depth in developing flavors, while also combining our infrastructures to provide greater scale and increase our manufacturing capacity and technical bench strength, we are providing our customers with a more comprehensive product offerings, bolstering our competitive position and creating more opportunities for growth.\nWith the addition of FONA, we're advancing our health and wellness portfolio.\nWe're expanding our research and development capabilities and technology platform, with additional proprietary and cancellation methods including expertise in flavoring health and performance nutrition product across a variety of applications.\nOur clean and natural platform is meaningfully enhanced with the addition of FONA's predominantly natural portfolio as well as their expertise, particularly in citrus fruit flavors.\nCombination of our technology platforms and capabilities will provide a long runway for growth, enabling us to remain at the forefront of flavor development and expand our ability to create better for you, the consumer preferred flavor solutions across a diverse range of applications for our customers.\nOur complementary customer base is a global and mid-tier customers provide growth opportunities for our collective portfolios.\nBonus customer-centric culture is very similar to ours and with the combined power of our organizations we're well positioned to reach a broader customer base, deepening existing customer relationships by cross-selling and establish inroads with new customers while driving innovation.\nCustomer response to the acquisition has been favorable, as they recognized our combined power increases our customer value proposition.\nWe're confident we'll deliver on our acquisition plans.\nThis confidence is bolstered by our proven track record of successfully integrating and increasing the performance of our businesses, such as our acquisition of Frank's and French's.\nAcquisitions are a key part of our long-term growth strategy in both Cholula and FONA will add to our strong history of creating value through acquisitions.\nNow, I'd like to briefly comment on the conditions we're seeing in our markets, their potential impact and our 2021 organic growth plans starting on Slide 14.\nGlobal demand for flavor remains a foundation for our sales growth.\nWe're capitalizing on the growing consumer interest in healthy flavorful cooking, trusted brands as well as digital engagement and purpose-minded practices.\nThese long-term trends have only accelerated during the pandemic.\nOur alignment with these consumer trends combined with the breadth and reach of our portfolio sustainably positions us for continued growth.\nThese underlying trends, current market conditions and our robust 2021 plan position us well to successfully execute on our growth strategies in both segments.\nStarting with our Consumer segment.\nAround the world, we continue to experience sustained elevated consumer demand, which is real incremental consumption and reflects the trends of consumers cooking more at home.\nAcross our APZ region, consumer demand continues to be strong.\nIn China, consumer consumption remains strong and we continue to see recovery in foodservice within China is in our consumer segment, as well as optimism about the Chinese New Year holiday, which was significantly disrupted last year by the COVID-19-related lockdown and then, Australia, either with restaurant restrictions eased and away from home demand increasing at-home consumption has remained elevated.\nIn EMEA, many of our largest markets have recently implemented more restrictive COVID-19 measures, further fueling at-home consumption and we're seeing sustained levels of demand, and of course, we'd see the same in the Americas.\nConsumers cooking more from scratch and adding flavor to their new locations is a key long-term trend, which has accelerated during the pandemic.\nOur proprietary consumer survey data supported by external research indicates consumers are enjoying the cooking experience and feel meals prepared at home are safer, healthier, better tasting and cost less.\nAnd while there has been great advances in vaccine development and distribution there is a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the pace of vaccination in the upcoming months.\nWe believe, the consumer behavior and sentiment driving an increased and sustained preference for cooking at home will continue globally and will persist beyond the pandemic, further driving consumer demand for our products, fueled by robust marketing, differentiated new product and our strong category management initiatives.\nOur categories across the globe experienced the sustained elevated level of demand for most of 2020 because of this shift preference, which coupled with added employee safety measures that initially reduced manufacturing capacity, depleted finished goods inventory levels, both for us and our customers and challenged our operation.\nThe real pressure has been on our U.S. manufacturing operations where the latter part of 2020, we added significant capacity.\nWe ended the calendar year with considerable incremental capacity through the expansion of our workforce, scaling up partnerships with third-party manufacturers and other measures in line with our previously shared plan.\nIn December, our Americas' consumer production output was approximately 40% higher than last year.\nCurrently, service levels are improving and restoration plans have begun on most of the secondary items, which were suspended in order to meet the significant demand for our top selling products.\nWe've now resumed shipping approximately two-thirds of the products, which had been suspended with the balance to be added over the next several weeks, and we expect shelf conditions to improve considerably over the next few weeks.\nWe're continuing to work through a stabilization period and inventory replenishment will progress through the first half of the year.\nWe're confident, we're well positioned for success in 2021, and have implemented efficient long-term solutions and strengthened our supply chain resiliency longer-term to support continued growth.\nAlso in the U.S. in 2020, we began our initiative to reinvent the in-store experience our spices and seasonings consumer by introducing new merchandising elements to improve navigation and drive inspiration.\nOur rollout will continue in 2021, and with increased cooking at home expected to continue, this initiative is even more exciting to drive both category and McCormick branded growth.\nTurning to global brand marketing, we continue to increase our investments across our entire portfolio, which have proven effective and achieved high ROI.\nWe will continue to connect with consumers online, turning real-time insights into action by targeting messaging, focused on providing information and inspiration.\nFor instance, with tips, tricks, new recipes and products to keep their meals exciting and cooking easy.\nWe expect our brand marketing investments combined with our valuable brand equities and strong digital consumer engagement will continue to drive growth with existing consumers and the millions of consumers gained in 2020.\nNew products are also integral to our sales growth, in 2020, 7% of our total McCormick sales were from products launched in the last three years.\nIn our Consumer segment, new product innovation differentiates our brands and strengthens our relevance with consumers.\nOur 2020 launches provides significant momentum going forward with exceptional trial.\nOverall, the sell-in of our new product launches and big bet innovation from our Flavor Solutions' customers slowed in 2020 due to the focus on keeping core items on retail shelves.\nMoving into 2021, we're excited about the strong pipeline both we and our Flavor Solutions' customers are carrying into the year.\nIn our Flavor Solutions segment we have a diverse customer base, we have seen various stages of recovery.\nFrom a food at home perspective our Flavor Solutions' growth varies by packaged food customer, but overall, as we mentioned last quarter, we've returned to pre-COVID growth rates.\nWe're carrying our growth momentum of packaged food customers into '21 driven by strength in their core iconic product, as well as new product and bigger-best innovation in 2021.\nOur away from home portion of this segment, our restaurant and other foodservice customers are still impacted by government imposed COVID-19 restrictions in most markets.\nSome areas, our restaurant customers including quick service restaurants have been faced with an increase in restrictions due to case resurgences.\nAlthough, the impact has not been as significant as at the beginning of the crisis even many customers have adapted their operating models for delivery carried out.\nThe recovery of our branded foodservice customers continues to be slow and is also impacted by COVID-19 resurgences.\nOverall, there is significant disruption experienced in 2020, recovery has begun and we're expecting it to continue in 2021.\nAs QSR customers are oriented less to dine-in their recovery will be at a faster pace than the rest of the restaurant and foodservice industry.\nWe have positive fundamentals in place to navigate through this period and are excited about the recovery momentum.\nWe were advantaged by a differentiated customer engagements in Flavor Solutions, and plan on driving further wins for both us and our customers in fiscal 2021.\nWith our customer intimacy approach we will continue to drive new product wins, collaborate on opportunities and solutions, manage through recovery plans, and importantly further strengthen our customer partnerships.\nAdditionally, the execution of our strategy to migrate our portfolio to more technically insulated and value-added categories will continue in 2021.\nWith top line opportunities gained from our investments to expand our flavor scale our momentum in flavor categories, as well as opportunities from our FONA acquisition, we expect to realize further results from this strategy.\nIn summary, we continue to capture the momentum we have gained in our Consumer segment as positive fundamentals in place to navigate through the Flavor Solutions' recovery and are excited about our Cholula and FONA acquisition, all of which bolster our confidence for continued growth in 2021.\nWe expect sales growth to vary by region and quarter in 2021 given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of COVID-19 recovery, but importantly, we expect we will drive overall organic sales growth in both of our segments.\nOur fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever.\nOur achievements in 2020, our effective strategies, our robust operating momentum reinforce our confidence in delivering another strong year of growth and performance in 2021.\nFollowing an extraordinary year in 2020, our 2021 outlook reflects both our strong underlying base business performance and acquisitions driving significant sales growth, as well as strong operating income growth even considering extraordinary COVID-19 costs and our business transformation investments, which highlights our focus on profit realization.\nOur top-tier long-term growth objectives remain unchanged and we're positioned for continued success.\nImportantly, McCormick employees around the world drive our momentum and success.\nNow, Mike will share additional remarks on our 2020 financial results and 2021 guidance.\nI will now provide some additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and full-year results, as well as detail on our 2021 outlook.\nStarting on Slide 19, during the fourth quarter sales rose 4% in constant currency.\nSales growth was driven by higher volume and mix in our Consumer segment with volume and mix in our Flavor Solutions segment comparable to last year.\nPricing, to partially offset cost inflation also contributed favorably to both segments.\nThe Consumer segment sales grew 5% in constant currency, led by the Americas and EMEA regions.\nA sustained shift to at-home consumption and cooking more at home, as well as consumers adding flavor at home to their restaurant carryout and delivery meals continues to drive increased demand for our consumer products, resulting in higher volume and mix in these regions.\nOn Slide 20, Consumer segment sales in the Americas increased 6% in constant currency versus the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by higher volume and product mix across many brands including Simply Asia, Thai Kitchen, Frank's RedHot, French's, Lawry's, Zatarain's, Gourmet Garden and Stubb's, to name a few.\nPartially offsetting these increases were volume declines in McCormick's branded spices and seasonings and recipe mixes, as well as private label products due to capacity constraints.\nIn EMEA, constant currency consumer sales grew 10% from a year ago with strong growth in all countries across the region.\nThe most significant volume and mix growth drivers were our Schwartz and Ducros branded spices and seasonings, our Vahine homemade dessert products and our Kamis branded products in Poland.\nConsumer sales in the Asia-Pacific region declined 10% in constant currency driven by lower branded foodservice sales and a shift to a later Chinese New Year as Lawrence mentioned.\nTurning to our Flavor Solutions segment in Slide 23, we grew fourth quarter constant currency sales 3% with growth in all three regions.\nIn the Americas, Flavor Solutions' constant currency sales grew 2% driven by pricing to cover cost increases offset partially by lower volume and product mix.\nVolume and product mix declined due to a reduction in demand from branded foodservice and other restaurant customers.\nPartially offsetting this decline was higher demand for packaged food companies with particular strength in snack seasoning.\nIn EMEA, constant currency sales increased 5% attributable to pricing to cover cost increases, as well as higher volume and product mix.\nVolume and product mix increased driven by sales growth with packaged food companies, with strength in snack seasonings partially offset by lower sales to branded foodservice and other restaurant customers.\nIn the Asia-Pacific region Flavor solutions' sales rose 7% in constant currency, driven by higher sales to QSRs in China and Australia, partially due to our customers' limited time offers and promotional activities.\nAs seen on Slide 27, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction cost related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions and special charges declined 4% in the fourth quarter versus the year-ago period with minimal impact from currency.\nAdjusted operating income declined in the Consumer segment by 2% to $221 million or in constant currency, 3%.\nIn the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income declined 9% to $70 million or 8% in constant currency.\nGrowth from higher sales and CCI-led cost savings were more than offset in both segments by several drivers.\nIn the Consumer segment, an 18% increase in brand marketing from the fourth quarter of last year unfavorably impacted adjusted operating income growth and in the Flavor Solutions segment, unfavorable product mix due to the decline in branded foodservice sales contributed to it's adjusted operating income decline.\nBoth segments were also unfavorably impacted by COVID-19-related costs and higher employee benefit expenses, including incentive compensation.\nAs seen on Slide 28, gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was comparable to the year-ago period, as we have planned.\nAdjusted operating margin declined 180 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of last year driven by the net impact of the factors I've mentioned a moment ago, as well as higher distribution and transportation costs.\nFor the fiscal year, gross margin expanded 100 basis points driven by CCI-led cost savings and favorable product mix resulting from the sales shift between segments, which more than offset COVID-19-related costs.\nAdjusted operating income increased 5% in constant currency and adjusted operating margin was comparable to last year.\nThe Consumer segment grew adjusted operating income 16% at constant currency primarily, due to higher sales and CCI-led cost savings, partially offset by 7% increase in brand marketing, higher incentive compensation expense and COVID-19-related costs.\nIn constant currency, the Flavor Solutions segment's adjusted operating income declined 20% driven by lower sales, unfavorable product mix and manufacturing costs, COVID-19-related costs and higher incentive compensation expense with a partial offset from CCI-led cost savings.\nTurning to income taxes on Slide 29, our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 22.9% compared to 24.7% in the year-ago period was favorably impacted by discrete items.\nFor the full year our adjusted tax rate was 19.9% as compared to 19.5% in 2019.\nIncome from unconsolidated operations declined 9% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the full year was comparable to 2019.\nAt the bottom line, as shown on Slide 31, fourth quarter 2020 adjusted earnings per share was $0.79, as compared to $0.81 for the year-ago period.\nThe decline was primarily, driven by our lower adjusted operating income partially offset by the lower interest expense and a lower adjusted income tax rate.\nFor the year, our 5% constant currency increase in adjusted operating income combined with a lower interest expense drove a 6% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $2.83 for fiscal 2020, including the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates versus last year.\nOn Slide 32, we summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet.\nOur cash flow from operations ended the year at a record-high of more than $1 billion, a 10% increase compared to $947 million in 2019, primarily driven by higher net income.\nWe finished the fiscal year with our cash conversion cycle, down 9% versus our 2019 fiscal year-end, as we continue to execute against programs to achieve working capital reductions.\nWe returned $330 million of this cash to our shareholders through dividends, and we are very pleased that we fully paid off the term loans related to the acquisition of the Frank's RedHot and French's brands.\nFollowing the acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, we have a pre-synergy pro forma net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.9 times, and we expect to delever to approximately three times by the end of fiscal 2022.\nBased on our demonstrated track record of debt paydown and or anticipate a strong cash flow generation we are confident that we will deliver on our plan.\nOur capital expenditures were $225 million in 2020 and included growth investments and optimization projects across the globe, including our ERP business transformation investment and beginning the supply chain global infrastructure investments that Lawrence mentioned earlier.\nIn 2021, we expect our capital expenditures to be higher than 2020, as we continue to spend on the initiatives we have in progress, as well as support our investment to fuel future growth.\nWe expect 2021 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives and our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt.\nNow, I would like to discuss our 2021 financial outlook on Slides 33 and 34, with a brief update on our ERP replacement program first.\nStarting with our ERP replacement program, we remain committed to this business transformation initiative and have recently completed our rephasing of the program.\nWe're now projecting the total cost of our ERP investment to range between $350 million and $400 million from 2019 through the anticipated completion of our global rollout in fiscal 2023, with an estimated split of 50% capital spending and 50% of operating expenses.\nAs such, the total operating expense impact for the program to be incurred from 2019 through 2023 is estimated to be between $175 million and $200 million, slightly lower than our previous estimate.\nIn fiscal 2021, we are projecting our total operating expense to be approximately $50 million, which is an incremental $30 million with our fiscal 2020.\nAnd at this time, we are not anticipating any significant rollouts in 2021.\nBy the end of 2021, we will have spent approximately $90 million of the total program operating expense.\nWe are excited to continue moving forward with this investment to enable us to further transform our ways of working and realize the benefits of a scalable growth platform.\nMoving to our 2021 outlook with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio, our robust operating momentum and effective growth strategies, we are well-positioned for another year of differentiated growth and performance.\nIn our 2021 outlook, we are projecting top line and earnings growth from our strong base business and acquisition contribution with earnings growth partially offset by the incremental COVID-19 cost and the ERP investment, as well as a higher projected effective tax rate.\nWe also expect that there will be an estimated 2 percentage point favorable impact of currency rates on sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share.\nAt the top line, we expect to grow the constant currency sales 5% to 7% including the incremental impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisition, which is projected to be in the range of 3.5% to 4%.\nWe anticipate our organic growth will be primarily, led by higher volume and product mix, driven by our category management, brand marketing, new product and customer engagement growth plans.\nAs Lawrence mentioned earlier, we expect sales growth to vary by region and quarter in 2021, given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of the COVID-19 recovery, but importantly, we expect we will drive our overall organic sales growth in both of our segments.\nOur 2021 adjusted gross profit margin is projected to be comparable to 25 basis points higher than 2020, which reflects margin accretion from the Cholula and FONA acquisitions, as well as unfavorable sales mix between segments and COVID-19 costs.\nWe have to make COVID-19 cost to be approximately $60 million in 2021, as compared to $50 million in 2020 and weighted to the first half of the year.\nFiscal 2021's COVID-19 costs are largely driven by third-party manufacturing costs, and of course, could vary based on demand fluctuations.\nOur adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions, which is projected to be 10% to 12% constant currency growth, partially offset by a 1% reduction from increased COVID-19 cost and a 3% reduction from the estimated incremental ERP investment.\nThis results in a total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of 6% to 8% in constant currency.\nThis projection includes low-single digit inflationary pressure and our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $110 million.\nIt also includes an estimated low-single digit increase in brand marketing investments, which will be heavier in the first half of the year.\nOur 2021 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 23% based upon our estimated mix of earning by geographies, as well as factoring in a low -- level of discrete impacts.\nThis outlook versus our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind for our 2021 adjusted earnings-per-share growth of approximately 4%.\nOur 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong base business and acquisition performance growth of 9% to 11% in constant currency, partially offset by the impact I just mentioned related to COVID-19 cost, our incremental ERP investment and the tax headwind.\nThis resulted an increase of 3% to 5% or 1% to 3% in constant currency.\nOur guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2021 is $2.91 to $2.96 compared to $2.83 of adjusted earnings per share in 2020.\nBased on the expected timing of some expense items, such as COVID-19 cost and brand marketing investments, as well as a low tax rate in the first quarter of last year, we expect our earnings growth to be weighted to the second half of the year.\nWe have a strong start to the year and recognize we are lapping a very strong second quarter of 2020.\nIn summary, we are projecting strong underlying base business performance and growth from acquisitions in our 2021 outlook, with earnings growth partially offset by incremental COVID-19 cost and the ERP investment, as well as our higher projected effective tax rate.\nNow that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I would like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 35.\nWe delivered strong results in 2020 despite great disruption, proving the strength of our business model, the value of our products and our capabilities as a company, as well as the successful execution of our strategies.\nWe have a strong foundation.\nWe're confident in the sustainability of at-home consumption and with the investments we've made to strengthen our supply chain resiliency, we are even better positioned to capitalize on accelerating consumer trends.\nWe are excited about the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, which reinforced our global flavor leadership and accelerate our condiments flavors growth platform.\nWe are confident these investments further position us for continued success.\nOur fundamentals, momentum and growth outlook are stronger than ever, our 2021 outlook reflects another year differentiated growth and performance while also making investments for the future.\nWe are confident, we will emerge stronger from these uncertain times.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I will start by going through some of the highlights of the quarter, and Jack will go through the second quarter results and guidance for the third quarter.\nI will then share some concluding thoughts before we start our Q&A session.\nBut before we proceed, Jack will now cover the safe harbor language.\nThese statements are based on management's current expectations or beliefs.\nHalfway through 2021, I am increasingly optimistic about the strength of the global recovery.\nAs vaccine rollouts gain momentum and lockdown restrictions ease, we're seeing dramatic increases in hiring optimism.\nThe pace of the recovery is strong, with the hiring intent picking up much faster than after the previous economic downturn.\nAnd although the recent infection increases are concerning, we do not believe they will materially impact the positive recovery trajectory.\nI spent a considerable amount of time during the second quarter in Europe with our market leaders, teams and clients.\nThis included time with our French team at Viva Tech, one of the world's largest technology conferences in Paris, which I will talk about later as part of our innovation update.\nAnd together with other global leaders, I also spent time with President Macron and his government at the Choose France event.\nI believe that the future for France looks bright as the government continues on its path to make France more competitive, and our business is very well positioned to benefit as their economy grows.\nIt is clear from my discussions with clients that demand is coming back very strongly for our services across all of our brands.\nThis is evidenced in temporary and permanent placement activity as well as demand for workforce solutions.\nCompanies increasingly need our help in finding and reskilling talent to enable them to leverage the fast-improving economic recovery and accelerate the digital transformation to emerge stronger post-pandemic.\nTurning to our financial results.\nIn the second quarter, revenue was $5.3 billion, up 31% year-over-year in constant currency.\nWe grew revenue significantly in our key markets, and this resulted in better-than-expected financial performance.\nOur operating profit for the quarter was $170 million, Operating profit was up significantly as we anniversary the depth of the pandemic's financial impact.\nOperating profit margin was 3.2%.\nAnd after excluding special charges in the prior year, operating profit margin increased 260 basis points.\nEarnings per diluted share was $2.02.\nOur most recent talent shortage survey of 42,000 employers in 43 countries found that 69% of employers globally, a 15-year high, are reporting difficulties hiring skilled workers across many industries.\nAlthough vaccinations are more widespread, workers are still dealing with issues created by the pandemic, such as healthcare and child care concerns.\nUnemployment benefits and related programs are also having a lingering effect on worker supply.\nWe expect the pandemic-related talent shortages to ease over the coming quarters.\nBut over the medium- to- long-term, the impact of digitization and other structured labor market changes are here to stay.\nThis means hiring of skilled talent and supporting people to reskill and upskill for growth roles will be a driver of demand into the foreseeable future.\nIt is a workers market right now.\nAnd as a result, we're also beginning to see employers respond to what workers want: wage increases in places, more flexibility, skills development and a clear commitment to ESG, especially clarity around an organization, social and climate impact.\nRevenues in the second quarter came in at the high end of our constant currency guidance range.\nGross profit margin came in well above our guidance range.\nOperating profit was $170 million, representing a significant increase from the prior year period, which was heavily impacted by the pandemic.\nOperating profit margin was 3.2%, which was 80 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance.\nBreaking our revenue trend down into a bit more detail, after adjusting for the positive impact of currency of about 10%, our constant currency revenue increased 31%.\nAs the impact of net dispositions and slightly more billing days was very minor, the organic days-adjusted revenue increase was also 31%.\nComparing to pre-pandemic revenues, our second quarter revenues were below 2019 levels by 4% on an organic days-adjusted constant currency basis, representing a 1.5% improvement from the first quarter trend on the same basis.\nTurning to earnings per share bridge on Slide 4.\nEarnings per share was $2.02, which significantly exceeded our guidance range.\nMarking from our guidance midpoint, our results included improved operational performance of $0.55, slightly higher than expected foreign currency exchange rates, which had a positive impact of $0.03, and slightly better than expected effective tax rate that added $0.02, and favorable other expenses which added $0.02.\nLooking at our gross profit margin in detail.\nOur gross margin came in at 16.3%.\nStaffing margin contributed 60 basis point increase, which included 20 basis points related to direct cost accrual adjustments in France, representing a 40 basis points underlying improvement in staffing margin.\nPermanent recruitment contributed 50 basis point GP margin improvement as hiring activity was strong across our largest markets.\nOur Experis Managed Services business in Europe contributed 10 basis point margin improvement.\nThese increases were partially offset by other business mix factors, primarily involving a lower mix of Right Management career transition business.\nNext, let's review our gross profit by business line.\nDuring the quarter, the Manpower brand comprised 64% of gross profit.\nOur Experis Professional business comprised 21% and Talent Solutions comprised 15%.\nDuring the quarter, our Manpower brand reported an organic constant currency gross profit year-over-year growth of 51%.\nOur Manpower business experienced the biggest decline a year ago, and as a result, experienced the biggest increase this period in the recovery.\nCompared to pre-pandemic levels, this represented a decrease of 4% from the second quarter of 2019 on an organic constant currency basis.\nGross profit in our Experis brand increased 23% year-over-year during the quarter on an organic constant currency basis.\nThis represented a decrease of 1% from the second quarter of 2019 on an organic constant currency basis.\nTalent Solutions includes our global market-leading RPO, MSP and Right Management offerings.\nOrganic gross profit increased 27% in constant currency year-over-year.\nThis represented an increase of 12% from the second quarter of 2019 on an organic constant currency basis.\nOur RPO business posted double-digit GP growth during the quarter on significant growth and hiring activity.\nOur MSP business, which has performed well for several quarters, continued to experience double-digit growth in gross profit in the quarter.\nOur Right Management business continues to see a runoff in outplacement activity as the recovery strengthens and experienced a reduction in gross profit of about 9% year-over-year.\nOur SG&A expense in the quarter was $690 million and represented a 10% increase on a reported basis from the prior year.\nExcluding goodwill and other impairment charges in the prior year, SG&A was 17% higher on a constant currency basis.\nThis compares to an increase in gross profit of 40% in constant currency and reflects balanced investment, allowing for strong gross profit flow-through during the quarter.\nOperational costs increased by $96 million and net dispositions represented $1 million reduction.\nCurrency changes reflected an increase of $42 million.\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue represented 13.1% in the second quarter, representing ongoing improvement in our efficiency as revenue recovers.\nThe Americas segment comprised 20% of consolidated revenue.\nRevenue in the quarter was $1 billion, an increase of 23% in constant currency.\nOUP was $56 million.\nExcluding impairment costs in the prior year, OUP increased 116% in constant currency and OUP margin increased 230 basis points to 5.4%.\nThe U.S. is the largest country in the Americas segment, comprising 60% of segment revenues.\nRevenue in the U.S. was $629 million, representing 22% increase compared to the prior year.\nAdjusting for franchise acquisition in days, this represented a 21% increase.\nExcluding impairment charges in the prior year, OUP for our U.S. business increased 149% year-over-year to $38 million in the quarter.\nOUP margin was 6%.\nWithin the U.S., the Manpower brand comprised 35% of gross profit during the quarter.\nRevenue for the Manpower brand in the U.S. increased 36% during the quarter.\nWhile the U.S. Manpower business continues to recover, we have noted softness in candidate supply during the second quarter and expect this to continue during the summer months.\nThe Experis brand in the U.S. comprised 32% of gross profit in the quarter.\nWithin Experis in the U.S., IT skills comprise approximately 80% of revenues.\nExperis U.S. revenues grew 5% during the quarter.\nWe are encouraged by the current trends in our U.S. Experis business and anticipate continued improvement into the third quarter.\nTalent Solutions in the U.S. contributed 33% of gross profit and experienced revenue growth of 14% in the quarter.\nThis was driven by RPO, which experienced dramatic revenue growth as hiring programs continued to strengthen.\nMSP business continued to perform well and experienced double-digit revenue growth in the quarter.\nIn the third quarter, we expect ongoing underlying improvement in revenue growth for the U.S. in the range of 11% to 15% year-over-year.\nComparing estimated third quarter revenues to precrisis levels in constant currency, this represented a 2% decline compared to 2019 levels in the third quarter using the midpoint of our guidance.\nOur Mexico operation experienced revenue growth of 6% in constant currency in the quarter.\nOn April 23, the Mexican government passed labor legislation that will prohibit certain types of temporary staffing not considered specialized services beginning on July 23.\nAs such, companies operating in Mexico will be prohibited from using temporary staffing for functions that are already deemed to be in-house core competencies of their workforce.\nWe have been working with our clients as the market absorbs this legislation and anticipate that we will have a reduction in revenues in our Mexico business beginning in the third quarter as clients navigate through the legislation and shift their workforce strategies accordingly.\nAlthough this will result in revenue reductions over the next few quarters, we believe the mix shift toward more specialized staffing will improve the margin profile of our Mexican business.\nWe also believe there may be additional revenue opportunities over time as clients adjust their workforce strategies.\nAlthough it is difficult to forecast based on how quickly the legislation is being enacted, we are currently estimating a revenue decrease for the Mexican business in the third quarter in the range of minus 28% to minus 32% in constant currency.\nMexico represented 2.8% of our 2020 revenues.\nRevenue in Canada increased 22% in days-adjusted constant currency during the quarter.\nRevenue in the other countries within Americas increased 40% in constant currency.\nThis was driven by significant constant currency revenue growth in Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Chile.\nSouthern Europe revenue comprised 46% of consolidated revenue in the quarter.\nRevenue in Southern Europe came in at $2.4 billion, growing 51% in constant currency.\nThis reflects ongoing improvement driven by France and Italy.\nOUP equaled $115 million and OUP margin was 4.8%.\nFrance revenue comprised 56% of the Southern Europe segment in the quarter and increased 67% in days-adjusted constant currency.\nCompared to the same period in 2019, France revenues were down 12%.\nAlthough restrictions had an impact on the rate of revenue improvement during the quarter, the French business continued to perform well in a challenging environment, and we expect ongoing improvement now that the majority of the restrictions have been lifted.\nOUP was $66 million in the quarter and OUP margin was 4.9%.\nAs previously referenced, direct cost accrual adjustments, representing approximately $10 million, benefited France's results.\nAs we begin the third quarter, we are estimating a year-over-year constant currency increase in revenues for France in the range of 12% to 16%.\nComparing estimated third quarter revenues to precrisis levels in constant currency, this represents a 5% decline compared to 2019 levels in the third quarter using the midpoint of our guidance.\nRevenue in Italy equaled $469 million in the quarter, reflecting an increase of 57% in days-adjusted constant currency.\nThrough the second quarter, revenues in Italy continued to exceed 2019 levels.\nOUP equaled $32 million and OUP margin was 6.8%.\nWe estimate that Italy will continue to perform very well in the third quarter with year-over-year constant currency revenue growth in the range of 20% to 24%.\nRevenue in Spain increased 12% in days-adjusted constant currency from the prior year, and revenue in Switzerland increased 33% in days-adjusted constant currency.\nOur Northern Europe segment comprised 22% of consolidated revenue in the quarter.\nRevenue increased 23% in constant currency to $1.2 billion, driven by all major markets.\nOUP represented $18 million and OUP margin was 1.5%.\nOur largest market in the Northern Europe segment is the U.K., which represented 37% of segment revenues in the quarter.\nDuring the quarter, U.K. revenues grew 30% in days-adjusted constant currency, which included significant new business.\nThe U.K. continued to perform above 2019 levels in the second quarter.\nWe expect continued strong growth in the 34% to 38% constant currency range year-over-year in the third quarter.\nIn Germany, revenues increased 9% in days-adjusted constant currency in the second quarter.\nAlthough Germany continues to be a difficult market for our industry, we expect to see ongoing revenue improvement in Germany in the third quarter.\nIn the Nordics, revenues grew 17% in days-adjusted constant currency.\nRevenue in the Netherlands increased 9% in days-adjusted constant currency.\nBelgium experienced days-adjusted revenue growth of 24% in constant currency during the quarter.\nRevenue in other markets in Northern Europe grew 41% in constant currency in the quarter.\nThis was driven by strong revenue growth in Poland, Russia and Ireland.\nThe Asia Pacific Middle East segment comprises 12% of total company revenue.\nIn the quarter, revenue grew 6% in constant currency to $620 million.\nOUP was $22 million and OUP margin was 3.6%.\nRevenue in Japan grew 10% in days-adjusted constant currency, which represents an improvement from the 6% growth rate in the first quarter.\nOur Japan business continues to lead the market in revenue growth, and we expect ongoing mid- to high single-digit revenue growth in the third quarter.\nRevenues in Australia were down 11% in days-adjusted constant currency.\nRevenue in other markets in Asia Pacific Middle East grew 9% in constant currency.\nI'll now turn to cash flow and balance sheet.\nDuring the first six months of the year, free cash flow equaled $171 million compared to $577 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting significant accounts receivable declines in the prior year period.\nAt quarter-end, days sales outstanding decreased year-over-year by almost two days to 56 days.\nCapital expenditures represented $12 million during the quarter.\nDuring the second quarter, we purchased 432,000 shares of stock for $50 million.\nOur year-to-date purchases stand at 1.5 million shares of stock for $150 million.\nAs of June 30, we have 1.9 million shares remaining for repurchase under the 6 million share program approved in August of 2019.\nOur balance sheet was strong at quarter-end with cash of $1.46 billion and total debt of $1.09 billion, resulting in a net cash position of $368 million.\nOur debt ratios at quarter-end reflect total gross debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA of 1.79 and total debt to total capitalization at 31%.\nOur debt and credit facilities did not change in the quarter.\nIn addition, our revolving credit facility for $600 million remained unused.\nNext, I'll review our outlook for the third quarter of 2021.\nOur guidance continues to assume no material additional lockdowns or business restrictions impacting our clients in any of our largest markets beyond those that exist today.\nOn that basis, we are forecasting earnings per share for the third quarter to be in the range of $1.86 to $1.94, which includes a favorable impact from foreign currency of $0.04 per share.\nOur constant currency revenue guidance growth range is between 12% and 16%.\nThe midpoint of our constant currency guidance is 14%.\nA minor decrease in billing days in the third quarter and the slight impact of net dispositions impact the growth rate slightly, resulting in an outlook for organic days adjusted revenue growth of 15% at the midpoint.\nAdding the context of comparisons to precrisis activity levels, this would represent a third quarter organic constant currency range of 1% to 3% compared to 2019 revenues.\nWe expect our operating profit margin during the third quarter to be up 50 basis points at the midpoint compared to the prior year.\nThis reflects another quarter of continued strong sequential underlying improvement.\nWe estimate the effective tax rate in the third quarter will be 33%.\nBased on our improved earnings mix, we are now estimating the full year effective tax rate will approximate 33%, a 1% improvement from our previous estimate of 34% provided last quarter.\nAs usual, our guidance does not incorporate restructuring charges or additional share repurchases, and we estimate our weighted average shares will be 55.2 million.\nWe continued to invest in technology and are making great progress on our acceleration plans to diversify, digitize and innovate.\nWe've been recognized again for our award-winning RPO business within our Talent Solutions brand, scoring highly for our strong tech ecosystem, our consulting capabilities, data-driven solutions and business intelligence.\nThis is the 11th year we have been named a global leader in RPO in the Everest Group PEAK Matrix Assessment.\nWe've also just been named MSP leader for the eighth consecutive year by Everest, recognizing us at the top in market impact.\nThey also recognized our global leadership and tech as well as our workforce strategies, data-driven approach and scope of solutions, including Right Management and our consulting capabilities.\nI congratulate our Talent Solutions colleagues for our leadership in the RPO and MSP space, which is an important component of our diversification strategy to grow higher-margin value business.\nWe continue to rapidly execute our technology and web transformation.\nOur power suite tech stack is helping us to grow our competitive advantage as we shift to cloud platforms, improving our customer experience while streamlining our candidate management.\nOur approach ensures we're always current, able to plug in with the best tech and the capability to scale while turning our data into a key asset.\nWe continue to move at speed.\n19 market deployments have been completed and another 16 are in flight.\nWe look forward to providing a further update on this at year-end.\nWe're also making great progress in innovation.\nIn June, we joined the biggest names in tech at the World Famous Viva Technology Conference in Paris.\nAs the conference is only HR partners since its launch five years ago, this is a great opportunity for us to showcase our newest innovation and work with more than 30 HR start-ups on how we're using AI, machine learning and data-driven predictive performance tools, together with our human expertise to upskill people at speed and scale and match people to jobs with better accuracy and speed than either humans or machines could do on their own, building a better, brighter future of work across bold, disruptive ideas and collaboration across business, government and education.\nThis is how we will create sustainable skills, resilient communities and greater prosperity for all.\nI'd now like to open the call for Q&A.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:On the call today, we have Dun & Bradstreet's CEO, Anthony Jabbour; and CFO, Bryan Hipsher.\nOur actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a number of risks and uncertainties.\nToday's remarks will also include references to non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe second quarter was another quarter of solid progress as revenues grew 24.4% and EBITDA grew 12.6%.\nOrganic revenue growth accelerated to 2.8%, fueled by low double-digit growth in international and low single-digit growth in North America.\nThe sequential improvement in organic growth was driven by new logo wins, increased cross-sell, continued strong retention, and the lessening of previously communicated headwinds.\nWe also saw strong sales in the building pipeline for our new solutions, both domestically and internationally, as businesses look to leverage more of our solutions to support their post-pandemic operating models.\nWe expect to see a continued ramp in the third and fourth quarters as we execute against our near-term growth strategy and have continued to strengthen the business for the long term with new talent, data assets, partnerships, and solutions that continue to bolster our offerings and provide our clients differentiated insights that help them grow revenues, lower operating costs, and improve the risk and compliance profile.\nBefore we jump to our normal business and operations update, I wanted to touch on a few announcements we made in the quarter.\nAs Dun & Bradstreet's chief product officer, Ginny comes to us from TransUnion and has over 20 years of experience driving innovation and leading product organizations.\nShe manages the overall product strategy for our global portfolio and is focused on driving rapid innovation and developing solutions at scale that enable our clients' success.\nMike is our chief technology officer and brings more than 25 years of experience and deep technological insight to Dun & Bradstreet.\nMike joined us from Fiserv and brings with him a proven track record of modernizing and scaling existing platforms for companies such as AOL, Microsoft, and First Data.\nWe also established a new location in Jacksonville, Florida, which will serve as our global headquarters.\nWe look to leverage this strategic location to help us to continue to innovate and grow, as well as benefit from substantial state and local financial incentives that made this move an easy one.\nAnd finally, before I move on to the business update, I wanted to share a very special milestone here at Dun & Bradstreet.\nOn July 20, we celebrated our 180th year anniversary, which is a testament to the long-standing value D&B has and continues to provide to businesses throughout the world.\nNow, let's move on to our business update.\nOn our first-quarter call, we discussed our key priorities for 2021, which are to continue to grow our share of wallet with our strategic customers; to approach and monetize the SMB space in new and innovative ways; to launch new products domestically to localize new and existing products globally; and lastly, to integrate the Bisnode acquisition.\nThroughout the second quarter, our team has made great strides toward executing on these priorities.\nWe're pleased with the ongoing success we're having with our strategic clients, which included renewal rates at near 100% and the addition of some exciting new logos.\nIn North America, we signed a multiyear deal with Ceridian, a global human capital management software company for Analytics Studio and various sales and marketing products, including the new Rev.\nUp ABX and digital targeting solutions.\nCeridian was looking to support their growth strategies and, in particular, the ability to connect and activate the offline view of customers and prospects through digital insights.\nThey're also focused on strategic global expansion and leveraging our world-based file to better understand addressable markets by region to support growth in target markets.\nLeveraging the investments we've made in nontraditional data and our sales and marketing solutions, we signed additional business with one of the largest online retailers who will be using our data and analytics to support their efforts in growing a new business line that needed help targeting specific retailers in high foot traffic areas such as airports and sports stadiums.\nDeloitte Touche Tohmatsu also entered into a multiyear agreement with us to assist with their client engagement, customer relationship management, and overall master data program.\nTheir global data management team was tasked with creating a global master data warehouse that could be used across all markets and will be the central hub for global applications, as well as local markets.\nThe team selected our D&B Direct+ API to be the central point for company information, hierarchies, and connections, including our full Family Tree.\nAlong with the master data use case, they're also using our insights to inform their investment to drive a more diverse workforce pipeline and, in particular, underrepresented minorities to the public accounting profession.\nWe will deliver a microsite with downloadable learning modules and coupled with a multichannel marketing campaign.\nWe're proud to support Deloitte in ensuring the success of this fantastic program.\nWe also signed a deal with Vintro, an online networking platform, who will be using our comprehensive B2B data, as well as our insights and AI-driven platforms to enable their clients to accelerate global opportunity and innovation.\nIn addition to the direct sale, we're also partnering with Vintro on a new platform to enhance the supply chain ecosystem through enhanced access to SMBs.\nTurning to our international segment.\nWe're making strong progress on the Global 500 account program we rolled out in the first quarter, demonstrated by several wins in the second quarter.\nOne of these was a significant expansion of our long-standing relationship with Barclays through a multiyear enterprisewide agreement supporting their global master client data and insight strategy.\nBarclays will be using D&B's comprehensive global data cloud for a multitude of use cases.\nGlobally consistent and identifiable by the DUNS number, our data will enable a broader and deeper view of every customer and prospect from intent data to financial and regulatory information.\nBarclays was looking for an end-to-end global solution, and we stood alone in our ability to deliver such an outcome.\nIn D&B Europe, our newly acquired Bisnode region, we signed several deals with Global 500 companies as our strategy to become the provider of choice in Central Europe has begun to bear fruit.\nBayer, a life science company with more than 150-year history and core competencies in the areas of healthcare and agriculture, signed a three-year global contract for D&B data by multiple delivery platforms.\nThis deal will support Bayer in organizing and managing their third-party records across various software platforms.\nDeutsche Bank signed a new contract to use our local German database to support their sales efforts.\nAfter various data and usability comparisons, they chose D&B over their previous provider, a large international competitor.\nWe continue to build and grow relationships with Global 500 companies.\nAt the end of the second quarter, nearly three-quarters of the Global 500 companies are clients of ours, a significant increase from year-end 2019 that was closer to two-thirds.\nWhile we continue to deepen relationships with our strategic clients, we're also seeing positive trends in the small and midsized markets.\nAs it relates to our second priority, addressing the SMB market in new and innovative ways, we started with the build-out of our D&B product and data marketplaces.\nThe D&B product marketplace was created to provide a curated set of our solutions, as well as partner solutions designed for small business.\nIt now has 20 partners, the newest of which are Brex and LendingTree along with other major brands such as Microsoft, Comcast Business, AT&T Business, Mastercard, and Symantec.\nThe D&B Data Marketplace where users can now buy a broader range of prematched, independent data sets from alternative data providers, now includes data sets such as commercial real estate, job postings, shipping, healthcare, and U.S. agricultural data.\nWe currently have 36 partner data sets as of the end of the second quarter, up from 22 at the end of the first quarter.\nNow turning to our e-commerce strategy.\nWe continue to see more and more attention in our digital assets.\nIn the second quarter, we saw dnb.com site visits continue to grow with over 46 million visits in Q2, an 84% increase over prior Q2.\nWhile the vast majority of customers are coming for CreditSignal and monitoring services, we're also beginning to see increased demand for our sales and marketing solutions.\nOverall, we hit more than $2 million in e-commerce sales in Q2, up 73% from prior-year quarter, and are forecasting sales to double again by the end of the third quarter.\nThis, combined with our D&B Marketplaces, are expected to drive nearly $10 million in incremental annual recurring revenues by year-end, and we look forward to updating you in the coming quarters on our progress.\nOur third priority is launching new products and use cases.\nLast quarter, we announced D&B Rev.\nUp ABX, a solution that simplifies and automates marketing and sales workflows for our clients.\nSince its launch, we closed six deals with ACV of nearly $2 million and with a strong and growing pipeline as awareness spreads and further enhancements are added to the platform.\nWe're excited to now take the Rev.\nUp capabilities to the SMB marketplace with the launch of D&B Rev.\nUp Now brings enterprise digital marketing technology, once only available to large-size businesses, to SMBs so that they can find and engage their best customers without having the cost and complexity of an in-house analytics department.\nWe're also bolstering our sales and marketing solutions through our alliance with Zeta Global.\nWe are bringing together trusted consumer and private business data into a single, highly secured data cloud that contains profiles on over 220 million individuals in the United States.\nThe Data Cloud combines Zeta's business-to-consumer data, including individuals' intent, behavioral, transactional, and location-based signals with Dun & Bradstreet's business-to-business data, including employer data such as companies, titles, and emails, to power a new market sector we refer to as business-to-person or B2P, which will enable businesses to unlock the buying power of decision-makers through this uniquely combined data set offering, a true 360-degree view of an individual and the ability to reach them through both business and consumer-based activation channels.\nAnd last but not least, I'm excited to announce the launch of D&B ESG Intelligence, which delivers a standardized score and analytics built from the Dun & Bradstreet Data Cloud and established sustainability standards.\nOur ESG rankings cover 12 ESG themes and 32 topic-specific categories to help our clients best understand specific risks and opportunities.\nWe believe this is another great example of how we can leverage the power of our Data Cloud and the DUNS number to create consistent and comprehensive rankings for businesses of all sizes throughout the globe.\nThis deep coverage and breakdown of specific ESG topic rankings helps compliance and procurement teams track and report on specific ESG factors that increase growth and reduce risk.\nSimilar to how PAYDEX established the de facto commercial credit score, we see the opportunity to set a standardized commercial ESG score that will help underwriters procurement organizations, investors, and many other areas quickly analyze and action new customers, vendors, suppliers, investments, and partners in an accurate and efficient manner.\nIn our international segment, we continue to focus on rolling out localized solutions across our owned and partner markets.\nIn the second quarter, we delivered 14 product launches across Europe, Greater China, and the Worldwide Network partner markets.\nincluding important new solutions, D&B Finance Analytics, D&B Risk Analytics, and Data Blocks.\nWe also expanded distribution of D&B Onboard and Direct+ across the slew of worldwide network partners.\nIn D&B Europe, we continue to see good traction from existing D&B products, like D&B Credit, Direct+ and D&B Onboard, while also introducing new products, including D&B Finance Analytics and Risk Analytics in the Nordic markets, Optimizer in the Nordics and Southeast Europe, and Data Blocks in Central Europe.\nThese solutions will enable us to execute our strategy of migrating customers off legacy offerings onto modern digital platforms, as well as attract new customers.\nThese solutions, along with the many we have discussed over the past few quarters, are allowing us to create a significant amount of new product revenue.\nFor North America and international combined, the New Product Vitality Index, or the percentage of revenues from new products, was 6% in Q2.\nFor context, we began measuring this stat in Q1 of 2019, and it's up already from 0.2% in Q2 of 2019.\nWe will continue to drive more and more new solutions into our markets around the world and look forward to updating you on our progress through the coming quarters.\nI'm pleased to report that integration is going as planned with top-line performance in line and synergy realization coming in slightly ahead of expectations.\nWe've executed more than $25 million in annualized savings from actions taken through Q2.\nSavings are being driven by the consolidation of functions across our global team, as well as executing a broad real estate strategy, including vacating, reducing the footprint of 14 office locations.\nOn the Bisnode operations side, we implemented a new global data framework across D&B Europe markets to ensure consistent monitoring and enhancement of database breadth and quality.\nWe have already made key data improvements, including the failure scores in Nordic markets in Germany, growing the database of nonregistered companies in Central Europe, and increasing financial statement data in Switzerland.\nThese initiatives are intended to improve retention, to enhance customer satisfaction, as well as demand for data from our global customers.\nOverall, I'm pleased with our continued transformation, and I'm excited about the progress we continue to make, laying the foundation for accelerated sustainable growth throughout the remainder of 2021 and into 2022.\nToday, I will discuss our second-quarter 2021 results and our outlook for the remainder of the year.\nOn a GAAP basis, second-quarter revenues were $521 million, an increase of 24% or 23% on a constant-currency basis compared to the prior-year quarter.\nThis includes the net impact of the lower purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment of $2 million.\nNet loss for the second quarter on a GAAP basis was $52 million or a diluted loss per share of $0.12, compared to a net loss of $208 million for the prior-year quarter.\nThe improvement was primarily driven by higher prior-year expenses related to the retirement of debt as part of the initial public offering, lower interest expense, improvements in operating income driven by lower equity-based compensation related to stock options granted in the prior-year quarter, and the net impact of Bisnode acquisition.\nThis was partially offset by higher tax provision recognized in the current year, largely driven by changes in the state apportionment and the enactment of the U.K. tax rate increase.\nTurning to Slide 2, I'll now discuss our adjusted results for the second quarter.\nSecond-quarter adjusted revenues for the total company were $521 million, an increase of 24.4% or 23.2% on a constant-currency basis.\nThis year-over-year increase included 19.9 percentage points from the Bisnode acquisition and 0.5 point from the impact of lower deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments.\nRevenues on an organic constant-currency basis were up 2.8%, driven by double-digit growth in our international segment, as well as single-digit growth in North America.\nSecond-quarter adjusted EBITDA for the total company was $198 million, an increase of $22 million or 13%.\nExcluding the net impact of the Bisnode acquisition, EBITDA increased slightly due to revenue growth partially offset by increased data and data-processing costs, higher commissions, and higher public company costs.\nSecond-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 38.1%.\nExcluding the net impact of Bisnode, EBITDA margin was 40.8%.\nSecond-quarter adjusted net income was $108 million or adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.25, an increase from $81 million in the second quarter of 2020.\nTurning now to Slide 3, I will now discuss the results for our two segments, North America and international.\nIn North America, revenues for the second quarter were $357 million, an increase of approximately 1% from the prior year.\nExcluding the positive impact of foreign exchange and the negative impact of the Bisnode acquisition, North America organic revenue increased $3.2 million or 1%.\nIn finance and risk, we continue to see strength in our risk solutions and solid growth in our finance solutions attributable to new business and higher customer spend.\nThe growth in these solutions was partially offset by $1 million of revenue elimination from the Bisnode transaction.\nFor sales and marketing, revenue was $158 million, a decrease of $3.1 million or 2%.\nWhile data sales had another solid quarter, the overall growth in sales and marketing was offset by $4 million from the Data.com legacy partnership wind-down.\nNorth America second-quarter adjusted EBITDA was $167 million, a decrease of $3 million or 2% primarily due to higher data processing costs and higher commissions, partially offset by revenue growth and ongoing cost management.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin for North America was 46.9%.\nTurning now to Slide 4.\nIn our international segment, second-quarter revenues increased 147% to $164 million or 137% on a constant-currency basis, primarily driven by the net impact from the acquisition of Bisnode and strong growth in both finance and risk and sales and marketing solutions.\nExcluding the net impact of Bisnode, international revenues increased approximately 13%.\nFinance and risk revenues were $104 million, an increase of 92% or an increase of 85% on a constant-currency basis, primarily due to the Bisnode acquisition.\nExcluding the net impact of Bisnode, revenue grew 10% with growth across all markets, including higher revenue from Worldwide Network alliances due to higher cross-border data fees and royalties and higher revenues from our U.K. market attributable to growth in our finance solutions.\nSales and marketing revenues were $60 million, an increase of 383% or an increase of 366% on a constant-currency basis, primarily attributable to the Bisnode acquisition.\nExcluding the impact of Bisnode, revenue grew 22% due to higher revenues from API offerings across our U.K. and Greater China markets and increased revenues from our Worldwide Network partners product royalties.\nSecond-quarter international adjusted EBITDA of $43 million increased $23 million or 113% versus second quarter of 2020, primarily due to the net impact of the Bisnode acquisition, as well as revenue growth across our international businesses, partially offset by higher data costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin was 26% or 28.9% excluding Bisnode.\nTurning to Slide 5, I'll now walk through our capital structure.\nAt the end of June 30, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $178 million, which, when combined with the full capacity of our $850 million revolving line of credit due 2025, represents total liquidity of approximately $1 billion.\nAs of June 30, 2021, total debt principal was $3,667 million, and our leverage ratio was 4.7 on a gross basis and 4.4 on a net basis.\nThe credit facility senior secured net leverage ratio was 3.6.\nTurning now to Slide 6, I'll now walk through our outlook for full-year 2021.\nAdjusted revenues are expected to remain in the range of $2,145 million to $2,175 million, an increase of approximately 23.25% compared to full-year 2020 adjusted revenues of $1,739 million.\nRevenues on an organic constant-currency basis, and excluding the net impact of lower deferred revenues, are expected to increase between 3% to 4.5%.\nAdjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $840 million to $855 million, an increase of 18% to 20%.\nAnd adjusted earnings per share is expected to be at the high end of the range of $1.02 to $1.06.\nAdditional modeling details underlying our outlook are as follows.\nWe expect interest expense to be $200 million to $210 million; depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $90 million excluding incremental depreciation and amortization expense resulting from purchase accounting; adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 24%; weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 430 million; and finally, for capex, we are increasing our guidance from approximately $160 million to approximately $237 million to account for the $77 million purchase of our new global headquarters building in Jacksonville.\nOverall, we continue to see the year shaping up, as previously discussed, with organic revenue growth continuing to accelerate throughout the year, with Q3 expected to be a bit below the midpoint of our range and Q4 to be at the high end of the range.\nAnd finally, as previously discussed, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter to be below the low end of the guidance growth range with a similar growth rate as Q2 due to timing of certain expenses related to data acquisition and sales and marketing initiatives.\nWe expect the fourth quarter to be above the high end of the guidance growth range.\nOverall, we are pleased with our performance through the first half of 2021 and look forward to continuing the strong momentum we are building in both our North America and international segments.\nOperator, will you please open up the line for Q&A?\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:This information is available on our Investor Relations website, investors.\nWe direct you to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.\nDuring the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G, including funds from operations, or FFO; core FFO, same-center net operating income, and adjusted EBITDA.\nAs such, it is important to note that management's comments include time-sensitive information that may only be accurate as of today's date, May 6, 2021.\n[Operator Instructions] On the call today will be Steven Tanger, our Executive Chair; Stephen Yalof, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Williams, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nWe are encouraged by a greater macro outlook over the past 90 days as vaccination rollout continues and an improving retail environment, as evidenced by the Consumer Confidence Index in late April, reaching its highest level since the onset of the pandemic.\nThe improvement we are starting to see in some of our operating metrics reflects the excellent value proposition that our open-air centers provide for both retailers and shoppers.\nWe are confident that, by continuing to make progress executing on our strategy, we'll position the company to return to sustained growth over time.\nWe're pleased to share that traffic to our domestic open-air centers in the first quarter nearly returned to 2019 levels and exceeded 2019 levels in April.\nWe continued to make progress on our core priorities for the business: leasing, operating and marketing our outlet centers.\nWe are focused on rebuilding our occupancy, driving leasing, and curating our merchandise mix to maximize shopper frequency and dwell time, and to bring new customers to Tanger Centers.\nConsolidated portfolio occupancy was 91.7% at the end of the quarter, up only 20 basis points from the end of 2020.\nThis reflects the anticipated 61,000 square feet of space recaptured during the quarter related to bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings.\nBlended average rental rates decreased 2.8% on a straight-line basis and 8.5% on a cash basis for all renewals and retenanted leases that commenced during the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2021.\nHowever, this reflects a 300 basis-point improvement on a cash basis, a 390 basis-point improvement on a straight-line basis compared to our reported Q4 2020 spreads.\nWe believe we will continue to see improvement longer-term as positive traffic and sales trends will support driving better rents.\nHowever, in the near term, we anticipate that we will continue to see pressure on retenanting spreads this year as we fill recaptured space that was at rental rates above the portfolio average.\nCollections of contractual fixed rents billed in the first quarter of 2021 were approximately 95%.\nThrough April 30, 2021, we collected 96% of the deferred 2020 rents due to be repaid in the first quarter and had collected 83% of all deferred 2020 rents, leaving a balance of only $3.7 million.\nGiven this run rate, we're comfortable with our outlook for future collections.\nMeaningful rebound in traffic that we discussed last quarter has been sustained.\nFor the first quarter, domestic traffic returned to 97% of the 2019 level even as February traffic was impacted by severe winter weather, and we were still operating at 20% fewer hours.\nWe believe a comparison to 2019 is more relevant as we started to feel the impacts of the pandemic during March of last year.\nOur strong and sustained traffic levels clearly reflects the attraction of our open-air shopping centers, their dominant market locations, and the value proposition that we offer to both our retailer partners and shoppers.\nNote that in Canada, where we have two unconsolidated JV properties, stores had been closed under government mandate through mid-February and are again closed under mandate.\nThe trailing 12 months, 280 leases commenced, totaling over 1.4 million square feet.\nRenewals executed or in process as of March 31 represented 52% of the space scheduled to expire during the year compared to 63% at the same time last year.\nThe slower-than-usual pace reflects our decision to strategically delay some of our renewal leasing activity as the overall economic and retail environments improve.\nWe continue to expand relationships with our traditional tenants, and we are seeing a measured pace of new leasing activity, with particular interest coming from the higher-end brands.\nDeveloping new business with local and regional brands is one of our leasing priorities.\nThis initiative provides compelling opportunities to add new and interesting concepts to our centers and, with it, more variety for our shoppers.\nAdditionally, we continue to expand our tenant mix beyond apparel and footwear, growing such categories of food and beverage, interactive and experiential, home d?\ncor and design, housewares, sporting goods, and gourmet grocers.\nAs a result, we are reimagining design elements for our centers.\nIn Grand Rapids, Michigan, for example, we have created outdoor seating in a gathering space in connection with the new microbrew restaurant located in a formerly underutilized part of our center.\nIn our Hilton Head Center, iconic gourmet grocer, Nantucket Meat & Fish, is currently under construction for Memorial Day Grand opening.\nOur partnership with Fillogic, the logistics-as-a-service platform in Deer Park, has provided for 5,000 square feet of a micro distribution hub aimed at providing lower cost and efficient distribution solutions for our retailers and shoppers.\nWe continue to deliver strong pop-up leasing activity, which serves several important functions: introducing new brands to the outlet channel that may convert to long-term permanent tenants, creating retail vibrancy in an otherwise dark store; providing variety to the center and more choice for our shoppers, delivering immediate NOI contributions; and, in certain cases, allowing us to maintain occupancy on a temporary basis as we defer long-term leases for market improvement.\nThis tenancy represented approximately 8.6% of our consolidated portfolio total GLA as of March 31, 2021.\nThough elevated from previous levels, this is a proven approach that has historically benefited our centers.\nSince joining Tanger one year ago, our top priority has been evolving our operational discipline by empowering our field leadership team to drive local leasing, business development and operational efficiencies at the center level.\nThese efforts have proven effective and are reflected in our better-than-planned short-term leasing, paid media and operating expense contributions.\nRevenues derived from non-rental transactions, such as paid media and sponsorships.\nalso provided a significant contribution to the Other Revenues line in the first quarter of 2021, driving a 14% increase year-over-year.\nWe have decentralized shopping center operations, with each center's management team now participating in revenue generation and empowered with decision-making authority regarding operating expenses.\nAt the same time, we are centralizing certain procurement activities to benefit from the scale of our organization.\nOne thing the COVID environment reinforced is the importance of meeting the customer where they are and creating a more personalized experience.\nOur marketing and digital transformation teams have continued to expand our virtual shopper offering, curbside pickup with fluid interactive capabilities, and live stream shopping, and offer digital pre-shopping on the Tanger app and website.\nOur digital initiatives are aimed at creating a highly personalized relationship for users and further building our loyalty base by providing more relevant offers and content to our individual shoppers.\nOur operating strategy evolves, our commitment to environmental, social and governance efforts remains unchanged.\nIn 2021, we have launched a comprehensive materiality assessment conducted by a third party to ensure that we are addressing the ESG issues most important to our stakeholders and that these issues are integrated into our core values.\nOur Board and executive leadership team are engaged on ESG issues impacting the organization, and we are investing time and resources to grow our diversity, equity and inclusion program.\nWe believe that education is essential to embedding DE&I throughout our culture and are launching unconscious bias training for our senior leadership team, which will be rolled out throughout the organization.\nWe are also investing in our communities in new ways, including through our newly implemented small business owner outreach initiative.\nThrough this program, we're offering opportunities for new and existing businesses in our communities to set up shop in Tanger Centers supported by our proprietary suite of services to help them incubate and grow.\nIn 2021, we will continue our efforts to streamline ESG reporting so that the data is more accessible to stakeholders and easier to navigate.\nTo improve our transparency and reporting on our ESG efforts, we will begin to implement the recommendations of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures during 2021 with a focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, energy performance, biodiversity, water and usage and waste management.\nThese projects have impact on the global environment, broader Tanger's environmental efforts beyond our immediate footprint, and provide additional opportunities to engage with our employees, retailers and shoppers.\nOur team remains focused on a return to sustained growth.\nWe have strengthened our balance sheet and are exploring selective growth opportunities.\nWe are restarting our marketing efforts for our planned Nashville development and, as restrictions are lifted, prospective tenants are making site business.\nProgress we are making across each of our strategic priorities gives us confidence that we will create long-term value for our shareholders.\nFirst quarter results showed continued positive momentum but reflect the ongoing impact of the pandemic, recent bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings.\nFirst quarter core FFO available to common shareholders was $0.40 per share compared to $0.50 per share in the first quarter of 2020.\nCore FFO for the first quarter of 2021 excludes general and administrative expense of $2.4 million, or $0.02 per share for compensation costs related to a voluntary retirement plan and other executive severance costs.\nSame-center NOI for the consolidated portfolio decreased 8% for the quarter.\nThis reflects the rent modifications and store closings from recent bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings, partially offset by the reversal of approximately $1.6 million in reserves related to rents previously deferred or under negotiation.\nCollections of contractual fixed rents billed in the first quarter of 2021 were approximately 95%.\nWe also continue to collect rent bill for prior periods, including amounts related to 2020 that we allowed our tenants to defer to 2021.\nAs of March 31, 2021, remaining rental revenue reserves for 2020 rents deferred or under negotiation totaled $2.6 million.\nSince implementing our ATM program, in March we opportunistically raised capital to reduce debt and strengthen our balance sheet.\nDuring the first quarter, we issued 6.9 million common shares that generated $128.7 million in net proceeds at a weighted average price of $19.02 per share.\nWe used the proceeds to reduce $25 million of borrowings under our $350 million unsecured term loan on March 11, 2021; and, on April 30, completed the partial early redemption of $150 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.875% senior notes due December 2023 for $163 million in cash.\nSubsequent to the redemption, $100 million remains outstanding.\nWe have no significant debt maturities until December 2023.\nAs previously disclosed, we expect to take a charge in the second quarter of 2021 currently estimated to be approximately $14.1 million, or $0.14 per share, including an approximately $13 million make-whole premium to be paid for the early redemption of the notes and $1.1 million in unamortized debt discount and loan costs.\nThe charge will impact our second quarter net income and FFO but will have no impact on core FFO.\nWe expect the 2021 net dilutive impact per share to be approximately $0.12 for net income, $0.18 for FFO, and $0.04 for core FFO.\nThis reduction in debt improves our leverage ratio and enhances our balance sheet flexibility.\nWe have always prioritized maintaining a strong financial position.\nWe will continue our disciplined and prudent approach to capital allocation.\nIn addition to dividend distributions sufficient to maintain REIT status, our priority uses of capital include investing in our portfolio to grow NOI, reducing leverage to pre-COVID levels over time, and evaluating selective growth opportunities over the longer term.\nOur outlook for 2021 remains unchanged.\nWhile we are encouraged by the pace of our progress, we continue to anticipate pressure from current vacancies, additional potential store closures and rent modifications.\nAs mentioned on our fourth quarter earnings call, we expect store closures during 2021 related to bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings to total approximately 200,000 square feet during 2021, including the 61,000 square feet we recaptured during the first quarter.\nMost of the recapture should occur during the first half of the year.\nAdditionally, our guidance assumes there are no further domestic government-mandated shutdowns and assumed lease termination fees decrease by $9 million to $10 million, or $0.09 to $0.10 per share from the elevated level we recognized in 2020.\nBased on our current outlook, we continue to expect core FFO per share for 2021 to be between $1.47 and $1.57.\nWe are maintaining this guidance despite the $0.04 dilutive impact previously discussed.\nFor additional details on our key assumptions, please see our release issued last night.\nOperator, can we take our first question?\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:For a further discussion of the risks related to our business, please see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC.\nReconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.\nWe further strengthened connections with customers with $156 million of new bookings with record results in both a zero to 1 megawatt and greater than a megawatt category and ended the year with $500 million in new bookings, a 15% increase over the prior year.\nWe also continue to enhance our global platform with the completion of organic development projects in multiple metros despite the continued challenges presented by the pandemic and the global supply chain in addition to strategic investments, establishing Digital Realty as the leading pan-African provider.\nFinancially, we had a solid quarter with full year results above the high end of the guidance range that we provided this time last year.\nAnd finally, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet by raising equity capital through the establishment of Digital Core REIT in a highly successful IPO on the Singapore Stock Exchange and the related sale of a 90% interest in 10 fully utilized core data centers.\nAs a perpetual capital partner, Digital Realty and Digital Core REIT can continue to work together while providing our customers with a seamless experience.\nOur formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework.\nAnd we made further progress on each front during the fourth quarter.\nFirst, we continue to globalize our business with record global bookings and strength across all regions and all product types, including quarterly highs in both our sub-1 megawatt and greater than 1 megawatt categories.\nWe also announced two significant global initiatives.\nFirst, in December, we announced the successful listing of Digital Core REIT as a stand-alone publicly traded company on the Singapore Stock Exchange.\nand Canada, valued at $1.4 billion at a 4.25% cap rate.\nWe generated net proceeds of over $950 million from the transaction, and we retained a 35% equity interest in the publicly traded REIT.\nThe offering was very well received, and Digital Core REIT has traded up approximately 30% since the IPO, enhancing the gain on our remaining ownership stake.\nIn addition to providing investors a stable cash flow stream from a portfolio of high-quality core data centers, Digital Core REIT offers key strategic benefits to Digital Realty.\nFirst, Digital Core REIT is a perpetual capital partner.\nIt has a long-term investment horizon and a global mandate to invest in stabilized income-producing data centers.\nSecond, Digital Core REIT has been carefully crafted to provide a seamless customer experience.\nDigital Core REIT is sponsored by and externally managed by Digital Realty.\nWe will continue to manage the properties providing the same level of operational excellence, and we will earn fees for asset and property management, as well as acquisitions, dispositions and development.\nFrom a customer perspective, nothing changes when we contribute an asset to Digital Core REIT.\nThird, Digital Core REIT is an ideal partner vehicle for Digital Realty.\nWe expect to contribute additional stabilized core assets to Digital Core REIT in the future, and we may also co-invest alongside Digital Core REIT on future investment activity.\nFinally, our interests are aligned.\nAs mentioned, Digital Realty will continue to own a 10% direct ownership stake in each of the assets in addition to 35% in the publicly traded vehicle.\nDigital Core REIT is led by two longtime Digital Realty team members, John Stewart, who most of you know well, along with an Dan Tith.\nWe are excited about their opportunity to create value for Digital Core REIT unitholders, including Digital Realty.\nOur second global initiative, which we announced just after quarter end, is the definitive agreement to acquire roughly a 55% stake in Teraco, Africa's leading carrier-neutral colocation provider.\nThis acquisition immediately establishes Digital Realty as the leading colocation and interconnection provider on the high-growth African continent and builds upon our earlier investments in Africa with iColo, in both Kenya and Mozambique and in Medallion in Nigeria.\nTeraco complements these investments, as well as our highly connected facilities in the Mediterranean by hosting the key strategic landing endpoints for subsea cables circling Africa.\nFrom Marseille and Athens in the North; Mombasa and Maputo along the east; Durban and Cape Town in the South; and Lagos along the Western Coast, PlatformDIGITAL is supporting the growth of our customers, as well as the broader digital transformation of the entire African continent.\nTeraco has seven state-of-the-art data centers across three key metros in South Africa and serves over 600 customers, including more than 275 connectivity providers, over 25 cloud and content platforms and approximately 300 enterprises.\nTeraco facilitates approximately 22,000 interconnections between customers and hosts seven cloud on-ramps and provides direct access to seven subsea cables.\nTeraco has historically generated healthy double-digit growth in revenue and EBITDA.\nIn addition, more than half of Teraco's in-service portfolio was developed within the past two years.\nThe current development pipeline will expand the existing asset base by over 25%.\nAnd Teraco owns land adjacent to its highly connected campuses in Johannesburg and Cape Town that will support another doubling of the in-place capacity, representing significant embedded growth potential and providing considerable runway to support our customers' growth.\nLeading global cloud and content platforms have recently begun making significant investments in Africa, given the existing capacity within the in-service portfolio, the incremental capacity currently under construction and the strategic landholdings to support future expansion.\nTeraco is uniquely positioned to support the expected growth of digital infrastructure in Africa over the next several years.\nLet's discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3.\nDuring the fourth quarter, Digital Realty earned Nareit's Leader in the Light Award for the fifth consecutive year, complementing the company's five-star GRESB rating and top ranking within the technology and science sector.\nDigital Realty was also named one of America's Most Responsible Companies by Newsweek and was the No.\n1 ranked data center company.\nWe continue to advance our sustainable financing strategy, recasting and upsizing our credit facility with improved terms while incorporating a sustainability-linked pricing component with pricing subject to adjustment based on annual performance against certain green targets.\nWe are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment, while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors and our employees, along with the broader society and advancing our goal of delivering sustainable growth for all these stakeholders.\nLet's turn to our investment activity on Page 4.\nWe continue to invest in the expansion of our global platform.\nIn addition to the Teraco transaction, we've grown our presence along the Eastern Coast of Africa with iColo and supplemented our acquisition of Medallion data centers in Nigeria with two land purchases in Lagos for future development.\nOver the next decade, we expect to see huge opportunity for global businesses to tap into Africa's rapidly growing internet economy, and Digital Realty is uniquely positioned to enable this growth.\nWe also continue to invest in the organic growth of our platform.\nWe spent $580 million on growth capex in the fourth quarter, our largest quarterly growth capex investment to date.\nWe currently have 44 projects underway, totaling more than 250 megawatts of IT capacity in 27 metros around the world.\nThis capacity was 46% presold as of year-end.\nGeographically, we continue to invest most heavily in EMEA with 27 projects underway, totaling more than 140 megawatts across 16 metros.\nIn Asia Pacific, we delivered several development projects during the fourth quarter, including facilities in Singapore and Hong Kong.\nIn January, we opened Digital Seoul 1, our first data center in South Korea and the first carrier-neutral facility in the country.\nThis facility will serve as a connectivity gateway for latency-sensitive customer workloads, but can be connected to hyperscale applications hosted in our second facility in Korea, totaling over 60 megawatts of capacity currently under construction just outside the city center.\nThe two facilities will be tied together with fiber to create a connected campus and will complement each other by providing solutions for the full customer spectrum, from small performance sensitive co-location customers to huge hyperscale deployments.\nIn North America, our development pipeline is diversified by product mix, as well as geographically with projects underway in seven different markets.\nWe continue to see strong hyperscale demand in Hillsboro, while we are expanding in Downtown Atlanta to bring on additional colocation capacity at one of the most highly connected destinations in the Southeastern United States.\nWe are bringing capacity online in both these markets, among others, given the robust demand backdrop and our tightening inventory position.\nLet's turn to the macro environment on Page 5.\nWe're fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers.\nOur leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on platformDIGITAL.\nOur customers continue to solve some of the most complex IT infrastructure connectivity and data integration challenges.\nWe are witnessing a growing trend of multinational companies across all segments, deploying and connecting large, private data infrastructure footprints on PlatformDIGITAL across multiple regions and metros globally.\nIndustry research firm Gartner recently updated their global IT spending forecast for 2022, projecting a 5.1% increase to $4.5 trillion, driven by companies investing in digital data growth strategies.\nAdditionally, Gartner believes that by 2024, 75% of organizations will have deployed multiple data hubs to drive mission-critical data analytics sharing and governance in support of digital data growth strategies.\nThese forecasts are consistent with our view of where the puck is headed.\nOur market intelligence tool, the Data Gravity Index, forecasts similar growth in the intensity of data creation and its gravitational pull on global IT infrastructure.\nIn addition, our industry manifesto, enabling connected data communities serves as the global playbook for industry collaboration to tackle data gravity challenges head on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity for all companies.\nDigital Realty was recently named company of the year by Frost & Sullivan for North American data center best practices.\nThis award reflects our continued focus on operational excellence, underpinned by continuous innovation and execution of the PlatformDIGITAL road map.\nWe are honored by the strong validation of the differentiated value proposition we are creating for customers and partners.\nGiven the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business, and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store.\nLet's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7.\nAs Bill noted, we delivered record bookings of $156 million with an $11 million contribution from interconnection during the fourth quarter.\nVolume was elevated across both of our primary reporting categories in the quarter with a healthy mix between enterprise and hyperscale business.\nFor the full year, we booked $0.5 billion of new business with roughly a 60-40 split between greater than 1 megawatt and less than 1 megawatt plus interconnection.\nThe EMEA region had a particularly strong quarter accounting for approximately 60% of total bookings led by Frankfurt with standout performance across product types.\nThe fourth quarter was also notable for the strength of cross-selling between regions.\nNearly 30% of our sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection bookings were exported from one region to another, a strong indication of the value customers derive from our global platform.\nNot surprisingly, the Americas was our biggest exporter with most deals landing in EMEA, followed by APAC.\nBoth EMEA and APAC had strong export quarters as well, with over 15% of their sub-1-megawatt plus interconnection bookings landing out of region.\nThe weighted average lease term was nearly 10 years primarily driven by hyperscale pre-leasing in EMEA.\nWe landed over 130 new logos during the fourth quarter, our second best quarterly result and just shy of last quarter's record 140 for our full year total of 480 new logos.\nWe are encouraged by the consistent organic growth of our customer base, and we view these results as strong validation of platform digital and our global strategy.\nIn terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, Graphcore, a British semiconductor company that develops accelerators and systems for AI and machine learning, selected PlatformDIGITAL to address their density, security and scale requirements.\nThe initial deployment will land in Amsterdam to be followed by a global rollout, and we are also collaborating on solution engineering and joint go-to-market activities.\nA leading high-frequency trading shop is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL to extend their high-performance computing platform across two continents and expand trading into two new international metros, while approving cloud access and business continuity state side.\nA Global 2000 U.S. energy provider is expanding with Digital Realty, consolidating their own on-premise facilities and using PlatformDIGITAL to scale their business across multiple metros.\nA leading aerospace manufacturing and services company is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL, leveraging dense interconnection to support data exchange across four new markets.\nA Global 2000 insurance brokerage is consolidating their data center footprint and has adopted PlatformDIGITAL to remove data gravity barriers and interconnect with clouds across multiple metros.\nAn IVY League university is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL to exit their own on-premise facility and enhance their access to the healthcare provider community for data exchange.\nAnd finally, a major APAC food services organization selected PlatformDIGITAL to improve cloud connectivity and leverage the local centers of data exchange in Japan.\nTurning to our backlog on Page 9.\nThe current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced rose from $330 million to $378 million as our fourth -- record fourth quarter signings more than offset commencements.\nThe lag between signings and commencements was unusually high at nearly 14 months, primarily driven by long-term leases on recent development starts in EMEA as customers accelerated efforts to secure a long-term runway for growth against a backdrop of steadily dwindling inventory.\nMoving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 10.\nWe signed $151 million of renewal leases during the fourth quarter in addition to the record new leases signed.\nThe weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the fourth quarter was nearly four years.\nRenewal rates rolled down 4%, driven by a handful of large deals in North America as negative releasing spreads on greater than 1 megawatt renewals more than offset the positive releasing spreads on the sub-1 megawatt renewals.\nIn terms of operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy ticked down 60 basis points, almost entirely due to development deliveries placed in service during the quarter.\nSame capital cash NOI growth was negative 6.6% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by churn in North America, as well as higher property operating and net utilities expense.\nAs a reminder, the 2021 same-store pool did not include the Westin Building in Seattle, the Interxion platform in Rijk, Lamda Hellix in Greece or Altus IT in Croatia.\nEach of these businesses will be included in the same-store pool beginning in the first quarter of 2022, and each is expected to contribute to improving same-store growth going forward, partially offset by higher property taxes, as well as FX headwinds expected in 2022.\nTurning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 11.\nThe U.S. dollar strengthened during the fourth quarter relative to prior year exchange rates, and FX represented roughly a 130 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line.\nAs a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to the currency risk from an economic perspective.\nIn addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing.\nGiven our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed-rate debt, a 100 basis point move in base rates would have roughly a 50 basis point impact on our full year FFO per share.\nOur near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed with a well-diversified menu of public and private capital sources available to fund the growth of our business.\nIn terms of earnings growth, fourth quarter core FFO per share was up 4% year over year and up 1% sequentially, driven by solid operational execution, cost controls and a reduction in financing costs due to proactive balance sheet management over the past 12 months.\nFor the full year, core FFO per share was up 5% year over year and came in $0.03 above the high end of our initial guidance range, which did not contemplate the contribution of $1.4 billion of assets through Digital Core REIT in early December.\nAs a reminder, full year core FFO per share excludes the $20 million promote fee on the Prudential joint venture in the third quarter, as well as the $25 million PPA settlement in the first quarter.\nLooking ahead to 2022, we expect core FFO per share will be between $6.80 and $6.90, including the 1% dilution from Teraco, as well as 100 to 200 basis points of expected FX headwinds due to the strength of the dollar relative to 2021.\nWe expect to deliver revenue between $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion in 2022 and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.5 billion.\nGiven the tightened supply environment, we expect flat cash renewal rates in 2022, up from slightly negative in 2021.\nAnd we expect overall portfolio occupancy to remain within the current range despite the significant new capacity scheduled to come online during the year in addition to the embedded lease-up potential within the Teraco portfolio.\nWe are off to a great start on our financing plans for the year with a highly successful 750 million bond offering in early January of 10.5-year paper at 1.375% coupon.\nFinally, we expect to raise $500 million to $1 billion from capital recycling whether through contributions to Digital Core REIT, noncore asset sales to third parties or a combination of both.\nIn terms of the quarterly dividend, the distribution policy is ultimately a board-level decision.\nGiven the continued growth in our cash flows and taxable income, we would expect to see continued growth in the per share dividend, just as we have had each and every year since our IPO in 2004.\nLast, but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 12.\nAs of year-end, our reported leverage ratio stood at 6.1 times, while fixed charge coverage was 5.4 times.\nPro forma for settlement of the $1 billion September forward equity offering, leverage drops to 5.7 times, while fixed charge coverage also improved to 5.7 times.\nWe continue to execute on our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related costs and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long-lived assets.\nAs Bill previously mentioned, we recast our credit facility during the fourth quarter, upsizing from $2.35 billion to $3 billion, extending the maturity by three years and tightening pricing by 5 basis points.\nWe also incorporated a sustainability-linked pricing component subject to adjustment based on annual performance targets, further demonstrating our commitment to sustainable business practices.\nSubsequent to quarter end, we raised approximately $850 million from the 10.5-year euro bonds at 1.375%, and we used a portion of the proceeds to redeem all $450 million of our outstanding 4.75% U.S. dollar bonds due 2025.\nThis successful execution against our financing strategy reflects the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public, as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth.\nAs you can see from the chart on Page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is over six years and our weighted average coupon is just over 2%.\nA little over three-quarters of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform while also acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 94% of our debt is fixed rate, guarding against a rising rate environment, and 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling.\nFinally, as you can see from the left side of Page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years.\nOur balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy.\nOperator, would you please begin the Q&A session?\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:In addition, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures including core funds from operations or core FFO, adjusted funds from operations or AFFO and net debt to recurring EBITDA.\nI'm very pleased to report that we achieved record investment volume of approximately $1.1 billion for the first 9 months of 2021 with continued momentum heading into the 4th quarter of this year.\nWhile replicating these investment volume is the testament to the efforts of our talented team, I am most pleased with the exceptional quality of the investments that we've made in a challenging environment.\nWhile our investment activities further strengthen our best-in-class retail portfolio we have also fortified our robust balance sheet with $1.5 billion of capital markets transactions year-to-date positioning our company for dynamic growth in the quarters ahead.\nNotably, we completed our inaugural preferred equity offering during the 3rd quarter, raising $175 million at a 4.25% coupon.\nThis represents the lowest non-PSA REIT preferred equity coupon in history and provides a new source of perpetual capital for our rapidly growing company.\nDuring the 3rd quarter, we invested approximately $343 million in 83 high quality retail net lease properties across our 3 external growth platforms, 80 of these properties were sourced through our acquisition platform representing acquisition volume of over $340 million.\nThe 80 properties acquired during the 3rd quarter are leased to 49 tenants operating in 20 distinct retail sectors including best in class operators and off-price retail, convenience stores, tire and auto service, home improvement, auto parts, grocery, and general merchandise.\nThe acquired properties at a weighted average cap rate of 6.2% and a weighted average lease term of 10.7 years.\nAs mentioned, through the first 9 months of the year, we've invested a record $1.1 billion in 226 retail net lease properties spanning 40 states across the country and 26 retail sectors.\nWhile raising the lower end of our acquisition guidance for the year to $1.3 billion our thoughtful and disciplined approach is evidenced by the nearly one-third of annualized base rents acquired year-to-date derived from ground lease assets and roughly 70% of annualized base rents acquired derived from leading investment grade retailers.\nDuring this past quarter, we executed on several unique transactions, including our 3rd Amazon Fresh store in Illinois.\nWe're excited about the opportunity to add yet another Amazon Fresh store to the portfolio located in a prominent Chicago suburb with median household incomes of 110,000 and a daytime population of roughly 225,000 within a 5-mile radius.\nOur acquisition team also continues to uncover compelling ground lease opportunities.\nDuring the quarter, we completed the acquisition of a 9-property portfolio of Thorntons Convenience Stores for approximately $21 million.\nThe stores which are paying an average annual rent of only $120,000 per year and had a weighted average lease term of close to 20 years are all well located in the Nashville and Chicago MSAs.\nShortly after executing a letter of intent to purchase this portfolio, BP announced they're taking full ownership of Thorntons convenience store chain after 2.5 years as part of a joint venture established in 2019.\nThis transaction makes BP, which is an A minus rated company by S&P, one of the leading convenience store operators in the Midwest with more than 200 stores across 6 states.\nOther notable ground lease acquisitions during the quarter, including are Walmart and Sam's Club in Lansing, Michigan, two Lowe's Stores located in Wallingford, Connecticut and Abington, Massachusetts, and a CVS in Springfield, Massachusetts.\nWe have acquired 73 ground leases year-to-date for total investment spend of nearly $350 million representing nearly 31% of acquisition spent for the entire year.\nThis includes 28 ground leases during the 3rd quarter representing investment volume of over $108 million.\nAs of September 30, our ground lease exposure reached a record of nearly 14% of annualized base rents.\nThe ground lease portfolio now derives roughly 87% from investment grade tenants and has a weighted average lease term of 12.1 years, with an average rent of less than 10 dollars per square foot.\nThis portfolio continues to represent an extremely attractive risk-adjusted investment for our shareholders.\nOn recent earnings calls and discussions, there had been considerable dialog regarding our ground lease portfolio and its valuation.\nThis is a very compelling comparison when thinking about the value of our ground lease portfolio, which is a weighted average credit rating of BBB plus over 2 years of additional term in comparison to the Bloomberg BBB index and internal growth of nearly 1%.\nAs of September 30, our portfolio's total investment grade exposure was approximately 67% representing close to 100 basis point year-over-year increase.\nOn a 2-year stacked basis, our investment grade exposure has improved by roughly a 1,000 basis points.\nMoving on to our Development and Partner Capital Solutions program, we continue to uncover compelling opportunities with our retail partners.\nWe had 7 development in PCS projects either completed or under construction during the first 9 months of the year that represent total committed capital of approximately $40 million.\nI'm pleased to announce we commenced construction during the quarter on our 3rd development with Gerber Collision in New Port Richey, Florida.\nGerber will be subject to a new 15-year lease upon completion and we anticipate rent will commence in the second quarter of 2022.\nConstruction continued during the 3rd quarter on 2 development in PCS projects with anticipated cost of just over $5 million.\nThe projects consists of our first 7-Eleven development in Saginaw Michigan and a Gerber Collision in Pooler, Georgia.\nWe remain focused on leveraging our three external growth platforms and our differentiated asset management capabilities to expand our relationships with best-in-class retailers providing comprehensive solutions that facilitate the real estate strategies and growth plans.\nWhile we continue to strengthen our best-in-class retail portfolio through record investment activity, we remain active on the disposition front during the 3rd quarter.\nWe continue to reduce exposure to franchise restaurants and non-core tenants through the disposition of 3 properties for total gross proceeds of approximately $11.8 million with a weighted average cap rate of 6.3%.\nAs of September 30, we've disposed of 13 properties for gross proceeds of just over $48 million and are maintaining our disposition guidance of $50 million to $75 million for the year.\nBolstered by the recent addition of David Darling as our Vice President of Real Estate, the asset management team continues to diligently address upcoming lease maturities.\nTheir efforts have reduced our 2021 maturities to just 4 leases, representing 10 basis points of annualized base rents.\nDuring the 3rd quarter, we executed new leases, extensions or options in approximately 72,000 square feet of gross leasable area.\nThrough the first 9 months of the year, we executed new leases, extensions, or options on approximately 347,000 square feet of gross leasable space.\nOur 2022 lease maturities are de minimis with only 19 leases maturing representing less than 1% of annualized base rents expiring over the course of the next year.\nAs of September 30, our expanding retail portfolio consisted of 1338 properties across 47 states, including 162 ground leases and remains effectively fully occupied at 99.6%.\nFor those that have been following our company over the years, this reduction in Walgreens exposure is a true milestone given our historical exposure which once approached 40% of our portfolio.\nWe have made a concerted effort to approach to tailor our pharmacy exposure given the high per square foot rental rates of many vintage pharmacy leases and then virgin approaches of CVS and Walgreens to a quickly changing landscape.\nMany of you are familiar with Mike as he most recently served as Chairman of the US Real Estate, Gaming and Lodging Investment Banking Practice at Jefferies.\nOver the course of his career, Mike has raised in excess of $50 billion of capital through numerous transactions.\nHaving had the opportunity to work with Mike for many years, I am extremely excited to leverage his unique perspectives and experiences as our company continues to dynamically grow and evolve.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Peter to discuss our financial results for the quarter.\nCore funds from operations for the 3rd quarter was $0.92 per share, representing a 13% year-over-year increase.\nAdjusted funds from operations per share for the quarter increased 11.5% year-over-year to $0.89.\nAs a reminder, treasury stock is included within our diluted share count prior to settlement if and when ADC stock trades above the deal price of our outstanding forward equity offerings.\nThe aggregate dilutive impact related to these offerings was roughly half a penny in the 3rd quarter.\nAs mentioned on the last 2 calls, we expect to achieve high single-digit earnings growth for full year AFFO per share.\nBuilding upon our 6% AFFO per share growth in 2020, this implies 2 year stack growth in the mid teens.\nWe view this level per share growth is very compelling when combined with the strength of our portfolio and our fortress like balance sheet.\nThis consistent and reliable earnings growth continues to support a growing and well covered dividend.\nDuring the 3rd quarter, we declared monthly cash dividends of [Phonetic] $0.217 per common share for July, August and September.\nOn an annualized basis, the monthly dividends represent an 8.5% increase over the annualized dividend from the 3rd quarter of last year.\nWhile meaningfully increasing the common dividend over the past year, we maintained conservative payout ratios for the 3rd quarter of 71% of core FFO per share and 70% of AFFO per share respectively.\nSubsequent to quarter end, we again increased the monthly cash dividend by 4.6% to $0.227 per common share for October.\nThe monthly dividend reflects an annualized dividend amount of $2.72 per share or 9.8% increase over the annualized dividend amount of $2.48 per share from the 4th quarter of 2020.\nOn a 2-year stack basis, this reflects annualized dividend growth of more than 15%.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the 3rd quarter which were impacted by recent changes to the company's executive officers totaled $5.7 million.\nG&A expense was 6.5% of total revenue or 6% excluding the noncash amortization of above and below-market lease intangibles.\nWhile we continue to invest in people and systems to support our dynamic and growing business, we still anticipate that G&A as a percentage of total revenue will be roughly 7% for full year 2021.\nThis excludes the impact of lease intangible amortization on total revenues.\nAs mentioned last quarter, G&A expense for our acquisitions team fluctuates based on acquisition volume for the year and our current anticipation for G&A expense reflects acquisition volume within our new guidance range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion.\nTotal income tax expense for the 3rd quarter was approximately $390,000, which was slightly lower than our expectation.\nDue to a one-time refund.\nWe continue to anticipate total income tax expense for 2021 to be close to $2.5 million.\nMoving onto our capital markets activities for the quarter, as Joey mentioned, in September, we completed our inaugural preferred equity offering raising $175 million of gross proceeds at a record low coupon of 4.25.\nThis attractive offering demonstrates our ability to opportunistically access yet another source of capital to support the continued growth of our company.\nDuring the 3rd quarter, we entered into forward sale agreements in connection with our ATM program to sell an aggregate of approximately 367,000 shares of common stock for anticipated net proceeds of roughly $27 million.\nDuring the quarter, we also settled close to 886,000 shares under forward ATM sale agreements and received net proceeds of approximately $56 million.\nAt quarter end, we had approximately 3.4 million shares remaining to be settled under existing forward sale agreements which are anticipated to raise net proceeds of more than $226 million upon settlement.\nInclusive of the settlement of our outstanding forward equity, our fortified balance sheet stood at approximately 3.7 times net debt to recurring EBITDA.\nExcluding the impact of our unsettled forward equity, our net debt to recurring EBITDA was approximately 4.4 times.\nIf you include our recent preferred equity offering and net debt, this adds roughly half a turn of leverage to our net debt to recurring EBITDA metrics.\nAt September 30, total debt to enterprise value is just under 25%, while our fixed charge coverage increased to a record 5.1 times.\nWith full availability under our revolving credit facility and nearly $830 million in total liquidity, we have tremendous flexibility to execute on our growth plans.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We will review the third quarter 2021 financial results and provide an update on key business trends for Bio-Rad.\nWith me on the phone today are Norman Schwartz, our Chief Executive Officer; Ilan Daskal, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Andy Last, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Annette Tumolo, President of the Life Science Group; and Dara Wright, President of the Clinical Diagnostics Group.\nOur actual results may differ materially from these plans and expectations, and the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown.\nFinally, our remarks today will include references to non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share, which are our financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles.\nWith that, I now turn over the call to Ilan Daskal, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore I begin the detailed third quarter discussion, I would like to ask Andy Last, our Chief Operating Officer, to provide an update on Bio-Rad's operations in light of the current pandemic-related environment that we are experiencing globally.\nAnnette's efforts and leadership have contributed to significant growth for the Life Science Group and Bio-Rad, and the company has started a search for a successor, and we will provide an update in the coming months.\nNow I'd like to take a few minutes to review our current state of operations around the world.\nWe're now entering the seventh consecutive quarter of operating within the COVID pandemic, and so I shall make my comments brief as we have now established an operating cadence with embedded employee safety practices.\nOur end markets continued to show improvement during Q3, with demand pickup in both life science and diagnostic markets in all regions.\nThe supply chain constraints highlighted in our Q2 call, however, have persisted in particular, for supply and cost of plastic raw materials, electronic components and higher logistics costs.\nTo date, we have been able to balance supply and demand through careful management.\nHowever, we see this supply constraint trends continuing through year-end and into 2022, and thus increasing the challenge of adequately meeting customer demand.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 Delta variant, we recently pushed out our return to the workplace date for the U.S. into early November.\nDuring Q3, we introduced a mandatory vaccination requirement for all employees in the U.S. and are extremely pleased with the results of this decision.\nWe are believing -- we believe we are maintaining our commitment to a safe workplace for all our employees.\nAs we enter Q4, we expect COVID-related demand for our products to be sequentially lower.\nAnd overall, we believe the majority of our end markets are approaching close to normal operations, although we recognize that COVID will continue to create dynamic market challenges.\nNow I would like to review the results of the third quarter.\nNet sales for the third quarter of 2021 were $747 million, which is a 15.4% increase on a reported basis versus the $647.3 million in Q3 of 2020.\nOn a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 13.8%.\nThe third quarter sales include a $32 million settlement for back royalties from 10 times.\nExcluding the back royalties, the Q3 year-over-year currency-neutral revenue growth was 9%.\nOn a geographic basis, we experienced strong currency-neutral growth in the Americas and in Asia, while growth in Europe declined slightly due to a tough year-over-year compare of COVID-related sales.\nWe estimate that COVID-19-related sales were about $57 million in the quarter as we continue to benefit from spikes in demand in geographies where new outbreaks have occurred.\nSales of the Life Science Group in the third quarter of 2021 were $373.5 million compared to $324 million in Q3 of 2020, which is a 15.3% increase on a reported basis and a 13.9% increase on a currency-neutral basis.\nExcluding the $32 million settlement for back royalties, the underlying Life Science business grew 4.1% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q3 of 2020.\nThe year-over-year sales growth in the third quarter was driven mainly by increases in Droplet Digital PCR products and excluding COVID-related sales, our core qPCR business also experienced nice growth driven by strong uptake of our newer generation CFX Opus platform.\nProcess Media, which can fluctuate on a quarterly basis, saw strong year-over-year double-digit growth versus the same quarter last year.\nExcluding Process Media sales and the $32 million settlement for back royalties, the underlying Life Science business declined 2% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q3 of 2020 due to lower COVID-related sales.\nWhen also excluding COVID-related sales, Life Science year-over-year currency-neutral revenue growth was 21.8%.\nOverall, we have seen strong growth in the biopharma market for our Droplet Digital PCR platform.\nWe also continue to see steady adoption of ddPCR in wastewater solutions, supported by government funding toward public health labs.\nOn a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew across the Americas and Asia but declined in Europe.\nWhen excluding COVID-related sales, European region revenue posted a double-digit increase from the year-ago period.\nSales of the Clinical Diagnostics Group in the third quarter were $372.2 million compared to $322.2 million in Q3 of 2020, which is a 15.5% increase on a reported basis and a 13.7% increase on a currency-neutral basis.\nDuring the third quarter, the Diagnostics Group posted growth across all of its product lines.\nThe year-over-year growth was driven by a recovery of routine testing, which appears to be approaching normal levels, with the exception of blood typing, which is progressing at a slower pace.\nOn a geographic basis, the Diagnostics Group currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew double digits across all regions.\nThe reported gross margin for the third quarter of 2021 was 58.6% on a GAAP basis and compares to 56.7% in Q3 of 2020.\nThe Q3 2021 gross margin improvement was mainly driven by the settlement payments as well as our productivity and efficiency initiatives.\nAmortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.7 million as compared to $4.8 million in Q3 of 2020.\nSG&A expenses for Q3 of 2021 were $216.2 million or 28.9% of sales compared to $198.2 million or 30.6% in Q3 of 2020.\nIncreases in SG&A spend was mainly the result of employee-related expense.\nTotal amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.4 million versus $2.3 million in Q3 of 2020.\nResearch and development expense in Q3 was $64.5 million or 8.6% of sales compared to $59.5 million or 9.2% of sales in Q3 of 2020.\nQ3 operating income was $156.8 million or 21% of sales compared to $109.6 million or 16.9% of sales in Q3 of 2020.\nLooking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $4.869 billion of income to the reported results and is substantially related to holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG.\nAlso during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in a net expense of $3.2 million, primarily due to foreign exchange losses and compared to $5.5 million of expense last year.\nThe effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was 21.8% compared to 21.9% for the same period in 2020.\nThe tax rate for both periods were driven by the large unrealized gain in equity securities.\nReported net income for the third quarter was $3.928 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $129.96.\nThis is an increase from last year and is largely related to changes in valuation of the Sartorius holdings.\nMoving on to the non-GAAP results.\nLooking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margin as well as other income.\nLooking at the non-GAAP results for the third quarter, in sales, we have excluded $32 million related to 10 times legal settlement.\nIn cost of goods sold, we have excluded $4.7 million of amortization of purchased intangibles, $4.1 million in IP license costs associated with the debt royalty payment and a small restructuring cost.\nThese exclusions moved the gross margin for the third quarter of 2021 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 57.9% versus 57.5% in Q3 of 2020.\nNon-GAAP SG&A in the third quarter of 2021 was 29.6% versus 29.4% in Q3 of 2020.\nIn SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization of purchased intangibles of $2.4 million, legal-related expenses of $2.3 million and a small restructuring and acquisition-related benefit.\nNon-GAAP R&D expense in the third quarter of 2021 was 9% versus 9.2% in Q3 of 2020.\nIn R&D, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded a small restructuring cost.\nThe cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 21% on a GAAP basis to 19.4% on a non-GAAP basis.\nThis non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin of 18.8% in Q3 of 2020.\nWe have also excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius equity holdings of $4.869 billion and about a $2 million loss associated with venture investments.\nThe non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was 18% compared to 22.5% for the same period in 2020.\nThe low rate in 2021 was driven by the geographic mix of earnings.\nIn addition, the effective tax rate was lower as a result of an increase in compensation-related tax deductions.\nAnd finally, non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2021 was $112.2 million or $3.71 diluted earnings per share, and that compares to $90.3 million and $3 per share in Q3 of 2020.\nMoving on to the balance sheet.\nTotal cash and short-term investments at the end of Q3 were $1.343 billion compared to $1.167 billion at the end of Q2 of 2021.\nDuring the third quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our stock.\nFor the third quarter of 2021, net cash generated from operating activities was $230.4 million, which compares to $135.7 million in Q3 of 2020.\nThis increase mainly reflects higher operating profits.\nFollowing the end of the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Dropworks for approximately $125 million in cash.\nDropworks is developing a droplet-based digital PCR system that could provide a more cost-effective solution to streamline the digital PCR workflow for life science research and diagnostic applications.\nWe see Dropworks as accelerating Bio-Rad's entry into the lower-end segment of the digital PCR business and allow for expansion in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion qPCR segment, thereby significantly increasing the opportunity for our ddPCR platforms.\nThe adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2021 was 23.1% of sales.\nThe adjusted EBITDA in Q3 of 2020 was 22.9%.\nNet capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2021 were $34.6 million, and depreciation and amortization for the third quarter was $33.7 million.\nMoving on to the guidance.\nOverall, we expect a continued trend to a more normalized growth rate.\nHowever, we are seeing increased supply chain constraints that creates an elevated level of uncertainty around timing of customer deliveries.\nWe are now guiding full year 2021 non-GAAP currency-neutral revenue growth to be between 12% and 13% versus our prior guidance of 10% to 10.5%.\nThis updated outlook reflects a wider revenue range due to the supply challenges, which we are experiencing.\nFull year COVID-related sales are now expected in the range of $240 million and $245 million versus our prior guidance of $200 million to $210 million.\nFull year non-GAAP gross margin is now projected to be between 57.5% and 57.8% versus prior guidance of 57% and 57.5%.\nFull year non-GAAP operating margin is forecasted to be about 19.5% versus prior guidance of 19%.\nOur updated guidance assumes higher operating expenses in Q4 as we continue to anticipate a gradual return to more normal activity levels.\nOur updated annual non-GAAP effective tax rate is projected to be between 21% and 22%.\nThe lower rate versus our prior guidance is mainly due to an increase in compensation-related tax deductions.\nFull year adjusted EBITDA margin is now forecasted to be between 23.5% and 24% versus prior guidance of 23% and 23.5%.\nLastly, with the uncertainties surrounding COVID, we are now planning to hold our Investor Day in February due to our preference to host an in-person event.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:As Jonathan said, this is Todd Leombruno, chief financial officer speaking.\nI'd like to direct you to Slide No.\nReconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures are included in today's materials.\nAs usual, today, Tom is going to begin with highlights of the quarter and a few comments on the company's transformation.\nTwo comments before we begin today.\nFirst, as a reminder, regarding the pending Meggitt acquisition, we are still bound by the requirements of the U.K. Takeover Code in respect to discussing certain transaction details.\nAnd secondly, we are announcing a date and time change to our upcoming virtual investor day due to a scheduling conflict with another company's investor day.\nOur meeting will now be held on Tuesday, March 8 from 9 am to 12 pm Eastern.\nIt will be a virtual event.\nAnd among the topics that we'll cover will be the release of our new long-term financial targets.\nI want to start with the title of this slide, which is exceptional execution in a challenging environment.\nWhen you look at the performance of the company in aggregate, safety, sales growth, the margin expansion, EPS, it was an extremely strong quarter.\nThis is against arguably one of the most difficult operating environments that we've all faced in our careers when you add up the cumulative effect of inflation, supply chain challenges and the Omicron virus.\nLet's start with the first bullet.\nFocus on safety continues.\nIt is our No.\nWe're leveraging our high-performance teams, the combination of the natural work teams that we have in our plants and warehouses as well as the Star Point teams and Kaizen.\nAnd it's really this combination, this team structure plus Kaizen, that is driving an ownership culture within the company.\nSo ownership of safety, but also ownership of quality, cost, delivery and engagement.\nSales growth was 12% year over year.\nOrganic growth was 13%.\nIt was nice across all the external reporting segments as well as every region participating.\nTotal sales was a second quarter record as well as total segment operating margin.\nEBITDA margin was 18.2% as reported or 22.7% adjusted.\nIt was 180 basis points.\nIt's a big move versus prior year.\nRobust demand environment continues.\nWe had over 90% of our end markets in the growth phase, which we're very excited about.\nAnd this execution, what you're seeing, is really the cumulative effect of win strategy 2.0 and 3.0 driving this kind of performance.\nWhen you add the strategy changes on top of the portfolio, things we've done, adding those great acquisitions that we've done over the last number of years and the powerful secular trends that I'm going to talk about here momentarily, we see the future has much longer cycle and more resilient and faster growing.\nSo if you go to the next slide, Slide 4, I've touched on this before.\nThis kind of frames all of our thinking and our strategies for the company to around trying to achieve these three key drivers.\nLiving up to our purpose, that higher calling, that North Star that we're driving for, to be great generators and deployers of cash, to be a top quartile performer versus our proxy peers.\nIf you go to Slide 5, which is the little expression that a picture is worth a thousand words, this kind of sums up how the company has changed over the last number of years.\nWe've updated this slide for FY '22 numbers.\nAnd I'm going to just reframe this slide for you.\nOn the left-hand side is adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share and on the right-hand side is adjusted EBITDA margin.\nSo if you look on the left and you go to FY '16, so we worked real hard as a company for 100 years to get to $6.99 EPS.\nAnd then the last six years, we've grown it by 2.5x to a little over $18 in our current guide.\nIf you just look at the gain that we've had since the pandemic, FY '20 to FY '22 guide, it's almost another $6 just in those two years.\nIt happens to be and I don't think it's coincidental, that we launched win strategy 3.0 at the beginning of FY '20.\nAnd you can see what it's done to propel performance.\nIf you look on the right-hand side and we don't guide on EBITDA margin, but we put in our EBITDA margin year to date to 22.4%.\nIf you look at that from FY '16 to that, it's 770 basis points improvement, just remarkable improvement.\nReally the how behind these results, it's been our people, portfolio changes that we've done and has been, again, a cumulative effect of win strategy 2.0, 3.0.\nSo if you go to the next slide, give you a quick update on the Meggitt transaction.\nWe continue to make progress.\nThere's really four main work streams that we're working.\nThere's two, the economic and national security review that we're working on with the U.K. government.\nI would characterize those as constructive and positive and on track.\nAnd then the antitrust and FDI filings are proceeding as we had anticipated.\nWe're still anticipating a Q3 calendar 2022 close and we're really excited about this.\nThis is obviously a compelling combination.\nIt doubles the size of our aerospace business, highly complementary technologies.\nAnd we're at the beginning of a commercial aerospace recovery with great synergies as we put these two companies together.\nAgain, coming -- bringing this on with everything else we've been doing, a much longer cycle, less cyclical, faster growing company.\nAnd then on Slide 7, in addition to the strategic acquisitions that we've been making, we are uniquely positioned with our eight motion and control technologies to benefit from the four secular trends that you see on this page.\nNow I touched on aerospace and the recovery and momentum of Meggitt plus Parker.\nBut if you look at electrification, ESG, digitization, what you have here are long-term multiyear growth enablers and content growth for us is going to grow, both onboard as well as infrastructure.\nAnd we're excited that this is going to be a big part of what we'll talk about at investor day and we look forward to sharing more about these secular trends on March 8 with you.\nI'll ask everyone to move to Slide 9 and I'll start with our FY '22 Q2 results.\nAs Tom mentioned, this was just an outstanding quarter.\nJust another reminder that our operations leaders are really driving the company to significantly higher levels of performance.\nOur sales increased 12% versus the prior year.\nWe did hit a record level of $3.8 billion.\nTom mentioned this, but organic sales were very healthy at 13%.\nCurrency was about a one point drag on sales.\nThat's how we got to the 12% reported sales increase.\nDemand just remains robust.\nOur backlogs are healthy.\nGrowth remains very broad-based across all of our industrial businesses.\nIf you look into the aerospace business, commercial demand continues to trend positive.\nAnd we talked about this before, but the acquisitions of CLARCOR, LORD and Exotic continue to outperform our expectations.\nWhen you look at the segment operating margins, it's a Q2 record on an adjusted basis.\nWe did 21.6% segment operating margin.\nThat's 120 basis points improvement from prior year.\nAnd our teams are really managing through the well documented supply chain issues, the inflationary environment.\nI really just want to commend them on our team's swift actions to manage these costs and inflationary actions, still while achieving record sales in the quarter.\nTom mentioned this, but adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.7%.\nThat's up 180 basis points from last year.\nBoth our adjusted net income and our adjusted earnings per share has improved by 29% versus prior year.\nNet income is $582 million or 15.2% return on sales.\nAnd adjusted earnings per share was $4.46.\nThat's $1.01 increase versus the prior year of $3.45, just a really solid quarter.\nIf we jump to Slide 10.\nThis is just a bridge on adjusted earnings per share and I'll just detail some of the components that generated the $1.01 increase in EPS.\nAnd as you can see really, operating execution is the major driver in this increase.\nAdjusted segment operating income did increase by $132 million.\nThat's 19% greater than prior year.\nAnd that really accounts for 80% of the increase in our earnings per share this quarter.\nWe did have some other favorable items that was $0.19 favorable.\nThere were some currency gains that were favorable.\nWe did sell a few facilities that we restructured.\nThose closed in the quarter.\nAnd we do have reduced pension expense versus prior year.\nAll of that added up to $0.19.\nAnd then you could see the other items on the slide that all netted to $0.04 favorable.\nBut really, the story here is just a very strong operating quarter.\nIf we go to Slide 11, I'll make a few comments on our segment performance.\nTom mentioned those secular trends.\nWe are seeing growth from those trends across our segments.\nEvery single one of the segments has a record adjusted segment operating margin this quarter.\nWe did maintain a cost-price neutral position.\nWe're very proud of that.\nIncrementals were 32% versus prior year.\nAnd I just want to remind everybody, that is against a headwind of $65 million of discretionary savings that we had in the prior year.\nIf you exclude those discretionary savings, our incrementals were 48%.\nSo really fantastic performance across the board from our teams.\nIt really highlights the power of the win strategy and really demonstrates our ability to perform through this current climate.\nIf you look at orders, orders are plus 12 and really the demand continues to be robust across our businesses.\nJust a little color on Diversified Industrial North America, sales reached $1.8 billion.\nOrganic growth in that segment was 15% versus prior year.\nAnd listen, we're really pleased with the performance in this region.\nWe've talked a lot -- I've read -- I know everyone is familiar with the well documented supply chain issues.\nTom mentioned the Omicron spike.\nWe are not immune to that.\nBut we did keep operating margins at a very high level of 21.3% in this segment and we're proud of that.\nOrder rates continued to be very high at plus 17.\nOur backlog is strong.\nAnd Tom mentioned this, 91% of our markets are in growth mode.\nSo great things in the North American businesses.\nIndustrial international is a great story.\nSales are $1.4 billion.\nOrganic growth is up 14% in this segment.\nAnd I want to note that across all the regions within our International segment, organic growth was mid-teen positive in every region.\nSo really robust activity there.\nMaybe more impressive is the adjusted operating margins, 22.4%.\nThis is an increase of 210 basis points versus the prior year.\nAnd certainly, we have volume.\nWe've talked a lot about our growth in distribution internationally.\nWe are benefiting from some product mix.\nAnd really, the team is doing a great job controlling cost.\nAnd this has been a really long-term effort over a long period of time from that team.\nSo I'm really happy that they're able to put up these continued high level of margin performance.\nOrder rates there were plus 14%, ample backlog and really solid international performance.\nIf we look at aerospace systems, really continued signs of a rebound there.\nSale were $618 million.\nOrganic sales are positive at almost 6%.\nAnd we did see very strong demand in our commercial OEM and MRO markets.\nGreat margin performance here as well.\nOperating margins have increased 270 basis points that finished the quarter at 20.7%.\nAnd again, I just want to remind everyone that, that is still at pre-COVID volume levels.\nSo great margin performance from our aerospace team.\nAerospace orders on a 12-month rolling rate did decline 7%.\nBut one item I want to make clear for everybody is we did have a few large multiyear military orders in the prior period that really created a tough comp just in aerospace.\nIf we exclude those orders, aerospace orders would be plus mid-teens positive.\nSo we're seeing continued signs of steady improvement in aerospace.\nOur order dollars in aerospace in the quarter were at the highest level they've been in the last three quarters.\nSo great quarter out of aerospace.\nBut if you really look at the segments, it's really outstanding operating performance.\nWe've got positive growth, strong order dollars, robust backlogs, record margins and really just solid execution across the board.\nSo great segment performance.\nIf I take you to Slide 12 and talk about cash flow on a year-to-date basis, we did exceed $1 billion in cash flow from operations.\nThat is 13.3% of sales.\nFree cash flow is $900 million or almost 12% of sales.\nAnd conversion on a year-to-date basis is now 107%.\nWe still continue to diligently manage working capital across the company.\nWe really are just responding to these increased demand levels that we have.\nThe working capital change did improve in the quarter as we forecasted.\nIn the quarter, it was a 1.9% use of cash.\nVersus last year, it was a 4.1% source of cash.\nSo for the full year, I just want to reiterate, we continue to forecast mid-teens cash flow from operations and free cash flow for the full year will exceed 100%.\nIf we go to Slide 13 now, I just want to make a few comments on our capital deployment activity.\nI'm sure many people have seen this, but last week, our board approved a dividend declaration of $1.03 per share.\nThat is fully supportive of our long-standing 65-year record of increasing dividends paid.\nAnd I want to give an update on the Meggitt financing.\nWe continue to make progress on our financing plan.\nOur plan is flexible.\nI did mention on the last call that we secured a deal contingent forward hedge contract in the amount of GBP 6.4 billion.\nAccounting rules require us to mark those contracts to market.\nThat impact in the quarter was a non-cash charge of $149 million.\nWe booked that in the other expense line and we are treating that as an adjusted item.\nWe now have $2.5 billion of cash deposited in escrow to fund the Meggitt transaction.\nThat is listed on our balance sheet as restricted cash.\nAnd that was funded from a combination of commercial paper and some cash on hand.\nA result of that, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ended up being 2.7 times in the quarter.\nNet debt was 2.5 times.\nIf you account for the $2.5 billion of restricted cash, net debt-to-EBITDA would be 1.8.\nFull year adjusted earnings per share is raised by $0.75.\nWe did guide to $17.30 at the midpoint last quarter.\nWe have moved that to $18.05 and that is at the midpoint.\nWe've also narrowed the range.\nRange is now $0.25, up or down.\nAnd sales is also raised.\nWe're raising the midpoint to a range of 10% at the midpoint.\nWe've got a range of 9% to 11%.\nAnd the breakdown of that sales change at the midpoint is organic growth is 10 and a half percent.\nCurrency will be about one point unfavorable.\nAnd of course, there's no impact from acquisitions.\nAs Tom said, we don't expect Meggitt to close in our fiscal year.\nIf we look at the full year adjusted segment operating margin, we're also raising that 20 basis points from the prior guide.\nFull year now, we expect that to be 22.1% at the midpoint.\nThere is a 20 basis point range on either side of that.\nAnd corporate G&A and other is expected to be $656 million on an as reported basis, but $435 million on an adjusted basis.\nSo of course, there's a couple of adjusted items in there.\nThe acquisition-related intangible assets, that is a standard adjustment, the realignment expenses standard adjustment, the lowered cost to achieve standard adjustment.\nBut we are adjusting these transaction-related expenses for Meggitt.\nYear to date, we've got $71 million worth of transaction costs and of course, that $149 million non-cash mark-to-market loss that I just mentioned.\nWe're going to continue to adjust for the transaction-related expenses as they are incurred.\nIf you look at tax rate, tax rate is now going to be slightly lower than what we had forecasted just based on first half activity.\nWe expect that to be 22% now.\nAnd finally, guidance for the full year assumed sales, adjusted operating income and earnings per share all split, 48% first half, 52% in the second half.\nAnd just a little bit more color, Q3, FY '22 Q3 adjusted earnings per share guide, we have at $4.54.\nSo with that, Tom, I'll hand it back to you for closing comments and I'll ask everyone to go to Slide 15.\nWe've got a highly engaged team around the world living up to our purpose, which is enabling engineering breakthroughs that lead to a better tomorrow.\nYou've seen what 3.0 has done, as I referenced in that earnings per share chart, describing our current performance that's going to drive our future performance.\nIt's the early days of win strategy 3.0 and I would characterize it as having long legs, lots of potential ahead with win strategy 3.0.\nThe portfolio transformation continues.\nWe've acquired three great companies, are in the process of a fourth that will make us longer cycle and more resilient.\nAnd if you put that on top of the secular trends that I highlighted, we feel very, very positive about the future.\nSo it's been our portfolio changes.\nIt's been the strategy changes.\nBut it really starts with our people, 55,000 team members that are thinking and acting like an owner, so 55,000 owners that are driving this transformation.\nAnd then I'm going to hand it back to Todd for a quick comment just to set up the Q&A before we get started.\nJonathan, I just want to want to ask the participants of the call just as a reminder to ask one question, follow up if needed and then jump back into the queue just so we can try to get everyone on the call to to have a shot at answering a question.\nWe do appreciate your cooperation.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Investors are urged to carefully review various disclosures made by NHI and its periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the risk factors and other information disclosed in NHI's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020.\nsec.gov or on NHI's website at www.\nFirst and foremost, we are deeply grateful to all the front-line heroes that are tirelessly combating COVID-19 every day, despite the great risk to themselves and their families.\nAt NHI, we have long admired the senior housing and skilled nursing organizations and their staff that go to great lengths to keep our senior population safe and smiling.\nNever has this been truer than today.\nAs a tribute, we have published some of our favorite caregiver and resident photos on the cover of our supplemental.\nI hope you'll take a look.\nReputations are made during a crisis and I see operators making good decisions and taking action based on the principles they value, selflessly caring for their residents, nurturing a company culture that appreciates employees, and providing leadership and comfort to the employees and families of their residents.\nI believe that when history reflects back on our industry and its practices during this time, there will be operators that are hailed as heroes.\nThat said, the challenges posed to our operators and our business by this pandemic are very real and it is difficult to say with any degree of accuracy, when we will return to a more normal operating environment.\nOur operators have done an admirable job in limiting the spread of COVID-19.\nAs of May 5th, we had 192 active resident cases in 37 buildings.\nTo put that in some perspective, NHI has over 20,000 residents being cared for in all of our properties; so, less than 1%.\nAs our operators have implemented their protocols and taken appropriate actions to prevent or limit the spread of the virus, the result has been a significant downturn in inquiries, tours and move-ins.\nThis is having a negative impact on occupancy.\nKevin will give details on that later.\nOn the cost side of the equation, it should not surprise anyone that our operators are spending more, particularly for labor and PPE suppliers.\nThis is obviously pressuring our operators' margins and we are prepared to help them weather this storm, where and when necessary.\nIn April, NHI received 99.7% of its contractual rent, and so far in May, we have collected approximately 94%, which is in line with our expectations as we typically see a portion of collections through the 15th of the month depending on underlying lease terms.\nAs this pandemic unfolds, NHI is committed to transparency with the investment community.\nTo that end, we have enhanced occupancy disclosure on Bickford, Holiday and Senior Living Communities, which Kevin will touch on in more detail.\nWe were the first to detail the incident of COVID-19 in our communities and we will continue to provide weekly updates to our website as long as it is material.\nBut given that the scope and spread of COVID-19 is so uncertain, NHI has limited visibility to the financial impact it could cause.\nAnd as a result, we are withdrawing our previously issued 2020 guidance.\nRegarding the dividend, our Board is committed to our dividend policy and we will consider the August dividend in mid-June.\nBeginning with our net income per diluted common share for the quarter ending March 31, 2020 we achieved $1.37 per share in earnings, inclusive of the gain on sale, compared to $0.83 per share for the same period in 2019.\nTurning to our three FFO performance metrics for the first quarter, NAREIT FFO increased 3.1% to $1.35, normalized FFO increased 3.8% to $1.36 and adjusted FFO or AFFO increased 5.7% to $1.29.\nCash NOI is the metric we use to measure our performance.\nWe define cash NOI as GAAP revenue excluding straight-line rent, excluding escrow funds received from tenants, and excluding lease incentive and commitment fee amortizations.\nFor the quarter ending March 31, cash NOI increased 9.2% to $76.3 million compared to $69.8 million in the prior year.\nOur increase in first quarter 2020 cash NOI was reflective of our organic NOI growth from lease escalators and the effects from our post-Q1 2019 investments including the recent Timber Ridge joint venture investment, as well as the continued fulfillment of our commitments.\nA reconciliation of cash NOI can be found on Page 17 of our Q1 2020 SEC filed supplement.\nG&A expense for the 2020 first quarter increased 7.4% over the prior first quarter to $4.3 million.\nThe increase in G&A was spread across several areas, including the expansion of our asset management team, other payroll expense increases and expenses associated with a higher use of outside consultants.\nTurning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.55 billion in total debt, of which a little over 90% was unsecured.\nAt March 31, we had $142 million of capacity on our $550 million revolver.\nNHI also had $46 million in cash, resulting in a net debt of $1.5 billion or $67.6 million [Phonetic] higher than our net debt at December 31.\nThis increase was largely due to the Timber Ridge acquisition, which closed at the end of January.\nAt quarter end, we also had approximately $24.2 million in restricted 1031 account, not included in our cash equivalents, but recorded in other assets, which originated from the sale of eight Brookdale properties in January.\nOur debt capital metrics for the quarter ending March 31, were net debt to annualized EBITDA of 4.7 times, which is unchanged from the fourth quarter, weighted average debt maturity of 3.7 years and our fixed charge coverage ratio at 5.8 times compared to 5.7 times in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nFor the quarter ending March 31, our weighted average cost of debt was 3.3%.\nStock combined markets over the last month are not where we'd like them to be.\nHowever, during the first quarter, we filed a new automatic shelf registration and refreshed our ATM program, giving us $500 million in new ATM capacity.\nTogether, our investment-grade credit ratings, including a recently affirmed stable outlook from Fitch, our new shelf also includes an indenture, which positions us during [Phonetic] a novel public debt offering when market conditions improve.\nWhile currently very expensive, we do consider the public equity and debt markets is open to us and another source of liquidity.\nDavid brings 23 years of accounting experience to NHI with his recent CAO roles at MedEquities Realty Trust and Healthcare Reality Trust and through his experiences as Audit Senior Manager at Ernst & Young.\nWe have been updating active resident cases in our communities on a weekly basis, but I wanted to add a little more context.\nAs Eric mentioned, we had 37 buildings with one or more active resident cases, including 20 senior housing properties and 17 SNFs.\nWithin the 20 senior housing properties, 14 were need-driven properties and six were discretionary properties.\n37 properties span 13 unique operators in 18 different states.\nWe had a total of 192 active resident cases, which included 97 cases in our SNFs, 40 cases in the skilled nursing wings at our CCRCs and senior living campuses, and 55 cases at our senior housing properties.\nWe are in constant contact with our operating partners and are confident they are following their own infectious disease protocols and are acting in accordance with CDC guidelines, state health agency regulation and in some case, more so.\nOverall, we have been very pleased and grateful for the efforts of our operators to prevent or limit the spread of COVID-19 in their communities.\nThe relatively low incidence is not surprising to us and is really a testament to our operators, whose mission is to keep our senior population safe.\nRegarding the CARES Act, several of our operators -- of our senior housing operators have been approved for have received funds from the Paycheck Protection Program.\nAs it turns out, the triple net lease structure is beneficial when applying for these loans.\nOur SNF operators are also benefiting from the CARES Act.\nPayments from the Provider Relief Fund averaging approximately $150,000 per building, the 2% Medicare sequestration suspension and the 6.2% increase in the FMAP help improve near-term liquidity for the SNFs.\nTurning to collections, April collections were 99.7%, and so far in May, we have collected approximately 94%, which is in line with our expectations as we typically see a portion of collections through the 15th of the month depending on the underlying lease terms.\nAt this point, nobody is past due.\nWe speak frequently with our operators and are working to creatively find solutions that benefit them at this unprecedented time and that makes sense for our shareholders.\nWe do have credit enhancements in our leases with many of our senior housing operators, which total approximately $38.7 million in cash in addition to guarantees and we have excellent credit from our SNF operators.\nTurning to the performance of our different asset classes and larger operators, our needs-driven senior housing operators were early to act to this pandemic and have limited the spread of the virus so far.\nAs of our last weekly update, 14 assisted living and senior living campuses had active resident cases with most of the communities limited to less than five cases per community.\nBickford, which represents 17% of our annualized cash revenue, has seen a slight downtick in their move-out rates, but like much of the industry, their lead volume and tours were down more than 40%, which impacts the rate of new move-ins and occupancy.\nBickford's average occupancy on a same community basis was 87.3% in the first quarter and 86.6% for March.\nOccupancy further declined in April by 130 basis points to 85.3%.\nOur entrance fee communities have fared somewhat better as the resident turnover is much lower and the residents tend to be younger and healthier relative to other property types.\nBut they are not immune to the impact of COVID-19 and we have had four entrance fee communities with active resident cases as of our last weekly update, though like assisted living, the number of cases per community is limited.\nSenior living communities, which represents 16% of our revenue had first quarter average occupancy of 80.4%, which ticked up slightly to 80.6% in March, but dropped to 79% in April as multiple entrance fee sales have been delayed due to the pandemic.\nOur independent living communities have experienced a similar decline in leads, tours and move-ins as our assisted living operators.\nThe incidence of COVID-19 is relatively low in independent living and we had only two properties with active resident cases as of the last update.\nHoliday Retirement, which represents 11% of our annualized cash revenue, had an average occupancy of 87.3% in the first quarter and 86.7% in March.\nThe April average occupancy declined by 170 basis points to 85%.\nBickford, SLC and Holiday represent approximately 56% of our senior housing units.\nOn a combined basis, those three saw average occupancy decline by 150 basis points from March to April, which is a good proxy for the rest of the senior housing portfolio.\nThe skilled nursing portfolio, which represents 26% of our annualized cash revenue is anchored by two excellent credits in NHC and The Ensign Group.\nAs of our last weekly update, 17 of our 78 SNFs had active resident cases.\nWe have seen more instances of outbreaks in some of our SNFs, which is expected given the higher acuity patient population and the more frequent contact caregivers have with the patients and residents.\nGiven the short average length of stay for Medicare patients and the temporary stay on elective procedures, SNF occupancies have generally declined by more than what we are seeing in senior housing.\nHowever, there is more government financial support for the SNF industry.\nNHC, which accounts for 12% of annualized cash revenue, has received funds from the Provider Relief Fund.\nThe company also expects to gain liquidity through the Medicare Accelerated Payment Program, the Medicare sequestration suspension, the payroll tax deferral and supplemental Medicaid payments.\nOverall, we feel very comfortable with the credit in our SNF portfolio.\nThe pace of deals have stalled and everything indicates that this will continue for the next several months as true price discovery is near impossible to determine right now.\nOur focus for the more immediate future is to continue funding existing commitments and extreme asset management by creatively providing guidance and assistance to our operators, if needed.\nFor the longer term, we continue to have conversations with existing and new operators and expect that our pipeline will be ready to support significant external growth when some normalcy returns to the market.\nI do want to express my gratitude and admiration for all of our operators and the front-line heroes that accomplished truly amazing acts of courage and their residents and patients every day.\nWith that, I'll hand the call back over to Eric.\nLooking internally, you should know that NHI's management team and Board have deep experience managing during times of crisis.\nI believe our balance sheet and liquidity, together with strong lender and market relationships, puts us on firm footing.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:It would be a gross understatement to say that 2020 was a year like no other year.\nCOVID-19 brought an incredible amount of suffering, inconvenience and unfortunately death with it.\nIt's humbling that our company benefited from such a tragedy and at the same time it's a tribute to our employees working in the midst of the pandemic and dealing with our own issues caused by it that we were able to respond as well as we did to the increased needs of consumers as they cope with COVID and the resulting quarantine.\nBruce will go through the financial details in a moment, but the headlines for the year are that net sales increased 18.5% to $1.968 billion and adjusted EBITDA increased 19.4% to $361.2 million.\nThis remarkable increase slowed temporarily in the fourth quarter and I will discuss the factors lead me to use the word temporarily.\nAs Dave just discussed, we generated unprecedented financial results during fiscal 2020.\nDelivering company record net sales, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year.\nWe reported net sales of $1.968 billion in fiscal 2020, an increase of $307.5 million or 18.5% compared to the prior year.\nFiscal 2020 net sales included approximately $27.8 million in net sales from our acquisition of Crisco.\nCrisco closed on December 1, 2020, providing with a full month of net sales.\nWe generated adjusted EBITDA before COVID-19 expenses of $374.8 million in fiscal 2020, an increase of $72.3 million or 23.9%.\nDuring 2020 we incurred approximately $13.5 million in incremental COVID-19 costs at our manufacturing facilities, which primarily included temporary enhanced compensation for our manufacturing employees, compensation we continue to pay manufacturing employees while in quarantine and expenses related to other precautionary health and safety measures.\nInclusive of these costs, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $361.2 million, which is an increase of $58.7 million or 19.4% compared to last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA before COVID-19 expenses as a percentage of net sales was 19% in fiscal 2020.\nAdjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales after including approximately $13.5 million in COVID-19 costs incurred during the year was 18.4%.\nAdjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales was 18.2% in fiscal 2019.\nWe reported net sales of $510.2 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $40 million or 8.5%.\nFourth quarter 2020 net sales included approximately $27.8 million in net sales from our acquisition of Crisco.\nWe generated adjusted EBITDA before COVID-19 expenses of $77.6 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $8.1 million or 11.7%.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we incurred approximately $4.3 million in incremental COVID-19 expenses at our manufacturing facilities.\nAs a result we reported adjusted EBITDA of $73.3 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $3.8 million or 5.6%, from $69.5 million in the prior year period.\nWe reported $2.26 adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020, an increase of $0.62 per share or 37.8% compared to the prior year.\nWe reported $0.35 in adjusted diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, an increase of $0.07 per share or 25% compared to the prior year.\nFiscal 2020 net sales increased by $307.5 million, which included an increase in base business net sales of $244.5 million and an increase in net sales from acquisitions of $63 million.\nOf the $244.5 million increase in base business net sales, $209.8 million was attributable to increased base business volume.\nOf the $63 million of net sales from acquisitions, $33.7 million was attributable to an additional seven and one-half months of Clabber Girl net sales in fiscal 2020 and $27.8 million was attributable to one month of Crisco net sales.\nFiscal 2020 base business net sales also benefited from $35.8 million in net pricing, inclusive of our spring 2019 list price increase, our 2019 trade spend optimization program as well as the impact of COVID-19, which resulted in lower than average daily trade promotions during the height of the pandemic.\nKeep in mind that our pricing calculation also includes an element of favorable mix as we saw less spices in the foodservice channel, which tend to be priced at a lower margin.\nFX was a drag on net sales of a little bit more than $1 million for the year.\nWe estimate that the extra reporting week in fiscal 2020, which occurred in the third quarter contributed approximately $35 million to our net sales.\nLeading our brand performance was Green Giant, which reached approximately $639 million in net sales during fiscal 2020, marking an increase of $112.2 million or 21.3% for the year.\nGreen Giant outperformance was largely led by shelf-stable with Green Giant Le Sueur shelf-stable net sales up by approximately $64.8 million or 39.7% for the year.\nGreen Giant shelf-stable had COVID-19 enhanced sales that led to extraordinary performance that began in the second half of March and carried through to the end of the third quarter.\nAs we hit the fourth quarter, we began to manage sales closely through the implementation of certain customer allocations to ensure there we had sufficient product to last us until this summer's pack season.\nAs a result, Green Giant shelf-stable net sales were flat in the fourth quarter, despite elevated demand and double-digit consumption trends that persist today.\nNet sales of Green Giant frozen products were up double digits for the year, plus $47.4 million or 13.1%.\nAmong our other larger brands, Cream of Wheat had one of the best performances in fiscal 2020, with net sales up by approximately $12.9 million or 21.6% for the year.\nCream of Wheat continue to outperform in the fourth quarter with net sales up by $2.7 million or 16.1% compared to the prior year period.\nClabber Girl also had very strong performance as part of what we believe will be a lasting resurgence in baking.\nNet sales of Clabber Girl products were up by approximately $10.2 million or 18.9% during the comparable period of time that we owned it, following the mid May 2019 acquisition.\nWe have been very pleased with the performance of Clabber Girl business which generated approximately $97.5 million in net sales during our first full year of ownership compared to our expectations at the time of acquisition of approximately $75 million of net sales.\nNet sales of Clabber Girl were up by approximately $2.5 million or almost 10% in the fourth quarter compared to the year-ago period.\nNet sales of Ortega were also up double digits during fiscal 2020 with an increase of $17.9 million or 12.7% compared to the prior year.\nSupply chain constraints, driven by industry wide taco shell capacity constraints, limited the upside for the fourth quarter.\nAnd as a result while our net sales growth was impressive with a $2.5 million increase or 7.3% compared to the prior year period, we could have done much more had we add incremental product supply.\nVictoria was also one of the larger gainers in the portfolio, increasing net sales in fiscal 2020 by $11.3 million or 26.4% compared to the prior year.\nNet sales of Victoria reached nearly $55 million in 2020.\nWhile consumption remains strong throughout the year, net sales dropped approximately $0.6 million dollars or 4.7% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the timing shift of a large promotional event with one of our key club customers that moved from fourth quarter 2019 to the third quarter 2020.\nNet sales of Maple Grove Farms were up by approximately $6.1 million or 8.7%, impressive performance given that a substantial portion of Maple Grove Farms business is sold through the foodservice channel, which went dark for a significant portion of the year.\nFourth quarter performance showed nice improvement as well, with net sales up $2.1 million or 12.2%, driven by continued strong consumption trends and an improvement in the foodservice side of the business.\nOur spices & seasonings, including our legacy brands such as Ac'cent and Dash and the brands we acquired in 2016, such as Tones and Weber were up by $30.9 million or 9.2% for the year.\nNet sales of spices & seasonings reached $367.7 million in fiscal 2020.\nThe retail side of this business began to show strong momentum by June as more and more Americans began to fully embrace cooking and seasoning their meals at home, a trend which continues in 2021.\nThe foodservice side of the business continues to be down, but it's slowly improving.\nIn the fourth quarter net sales of our spices & seasonings increased by $2.1 million or 2.4%.\nDespite the outsized performance for the year, our spices & seasonings could have increased even more even with a drag from foodservice had we had incremental supply.\nAmong our other larger brands, New York Style had challenges both in foodservice and to a lesser degree in the retail deli.\nNet sales of New York Style were down $1.8 million, 4.5% for fiscal 2020 compared to the prior year.\nGross profit was $481.7 million for fiscal 2020, or 24.5% of net sales.\nExcluding the negative impact of approximately $5 million of acquisition divestiture-related expenses, the amortization of acquisition-related inventory fair value step-up and non-recurring event -- expenses included in the cost of goods sold, our gross profit would have been $486.7 million, or 24.7% of net sales.\nGross profit was $383.1 million for fiscal 2019 or 23.1% of net sales.\nExcluding the negative impact of approximately $22 million of acquisition divestiture-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related inventory fair value step-up and non-recurring expenses included in cost of goods sold our gross profit would have been $405.1 million, for 24.4% of net sales.\nOutside of COVID-19 related expenses, including those described previously at our factories and those from our co-packers, inflation remained somewhat benign throughout a significant portion of 2020.\nHowever, we did begin to see inflation starting late in the third quarter and accelerated into the fourth quarter particularly for freight costs, certain agricultural products and other ingredient costs and packaging.\nI will discuss inflation a little bit more in our 2021 outlook, but we expect to see inflationary pressures continue in the coming months and we are working to alleviate these pressures in our 2021 budget.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year were $186.2 million or 9.5% of net sales.\nThis compares favorably to the prior year as a percentage of net sales, which included $160.7 million in selling, general and administrative expenses or 9.7% of fiscal 2019 net sales.\nThe dollar increase in SG&A was composed of increases in selling expenses of $8.2 million, increases in consumer marketing investments of $7.7 million, increases of warehousing expenses of $2 million and increases in G&A of $10.7 million.\nIncreases in SG&A including increases in selling, brokerage, and incentive compensation that are tied to increased sales and profitability.\nThese increases were offset in part by a reduction in acquisition divestiture-related and non-recurring expenses of $3.1 million.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we generated $374.8 million in adjusted EBITDA before COVID-19 expenses and after the inclusion of $13.5 million in COVID-19 expenses, adjusted EBITDA of $361.2 million.\nThis compares to adjusted EBITDA of $302.5 million in 2019.\nWe generated $2.26 in adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020 compared to $1.64 per share in 2019.\nThe increase was primarily driven by volumes, including COVID-19 driven demand for our products as well as the acquisitions of Clabber Girl in mid May 2019 and Crisco in December 2020.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share were also positively driven by increased adjusted EBITDA margins despite the impact of COVID-19 costs due to the benefits of our increased sales as well as lower effective cost of borrowing.\nWe had another strong year for cash, with net cash provided by operating activities of $281.5 million, which more than supported our long-standing dividend policy and helped us reduce our net debt before taking into account debt incurred to finance the Crisco acquisition and our pro forma net leverage.\nAs a reminder, we began the year with net debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA of approximately 6.12 times, we reached nearly 4.75 times at the end of the third quarter and finished the year with pro forma net debt to adjusted EBITDA before COVID-19 expenses of approximately 5.21 times, which is our consolidated leverage ratio as calculated for purposes of our credit agreement.\nOur increase in net cash provided by operating activities allowed us to reduce net debt by approximately $135 million over the course of the year, excluding our acquisition of Crisco.\nOur 2021 outlook includes an expectation for elevated net sales of our products in the early month, driven by consumption that has remained over 10% higher than pre-pandemic levels on a blended basis across the B&G Foods portfolio for nearly every week of the last 11 months.\nWe don't expect to exceed our net sales for March, April or May 2020 when there is a surge in sales driven more by pantry loading than by consumption.\nOur current year is off to a tremendous start, as we have strong expectations for fiscal 2021, especially when compared to 2019.\nAs a result of the challenges faced while trying to forecast COVID-19, we are not able to provide a detailed financial forecast at this time.\nHowever, what I can say is that we expect to generate company record net sales of $2.05 billion to $2.1 billion in 2021 inclusive of the full benefit of a full year of the Crisco acquisition.\nWe do expect 2021 to bring us a different set of challenges than we faced in 2020 and these challenges will include a return of inflation across a number of key input costs, including certain agricultural products, packaging, and freight as mentioned earlier.\nAs in prior years, our expectation is that we will manage these costs through a combination of pricing, initiatives, and cost savings activities to preserve our margin profile and our cash flows.\nAs you can see in those numbers the great majority of our brands grew in fiscal 2020, some substantially because of the dramatic effects of COVID on consumer buying and dining patterns.\nE-commerce was a growing driver of those trends and we invested during the year to follow consumers as they bought more through various online means and we saw sales through those means of buying grow in return.\nAlthough there is no precise way to measure this, using IRI and other data sources, we believe that our online sales grew by roughly 150%, albeit from a relatively modest base.\nWe expect that trend to continue in 2021 and are investing further in building out our online presence and to marketing with various retailers on their site, so that we can be at the forefront of this new way of selling.\nOur business also benefited from the low concentration of sales in the foodservice channel versus retail.\nBefore COVID, roughly 13% of our net sales were to foodservice customers.\nIn 2020 that number decreased to 9% as foodservice sales softened and retail sales grew.\nWe are seeing modest recovery in the channel and expected to strengthen as the year progresses.\nBut in general, declines in brands such as Regina and softness in Wright's New York Style, and Maple Grove are the result of higher proportion of their sales to foodservice.\nSeveral other trends in our business in 2020 are encouraging as we move forward into 2021.\nHousehold penetration of B&G Foods brands grew by 900 basis points and the average sale of B&G products per purchase grew by 25%.\nAs we expand our digital capabilities, we're able to track the consumers involved in these trends and invest more specifically in reinforcing their purchases.\nOur consumption trends consistently showed double-digit increases that placed us at near or at the top of comparable food companies and those trends continue in 2021.\nWe increased our marketing spending by approximately 20% for the year last year and over 50% in the fourth quarter to reinforce those gains and speak to all consumers about our brands that are driving growth.\nDespite all the positives, the year's performance does not reflect the full potential of changes in consumer behavior.\nWe saw serious supply chain capacity issues in the second and third quarter and were unable to fully meet demand on brands that offered meal solutions such as Ortega and Bear Creek.\nSpices & seasonings sales were also affected by manufacturing capacity issues, packaging outages, and absenteeism due to COVID related quarantine.\nOur policy at our facilities has been to be very aggressive in terms of quarantine employees with pay who had any type of exposure.\nThat has paid valuable dividends in terms of employee safety, but often left the facilities short-handed and increased our costs.\nEarly on in the fourth quarter, we realized that due to crop conditions and co-packer capacity issues, the supply of Green Giant shelf-stable products would not meet the elevated demand we were seeing and place those products on allocation, resulting in relatively flat sales for the quarter.\nWe will not see meaningful relief in this area until the summer when the new crop arrives.\nSince we took that action we've seen competition take similar actions, not surprising since we were all affected by a relatively poor crop last fall.\nTurning to a closer look at the fourth quarter, it would be easy to say that the business returned to a more normal footing with base business sales up just 2.5%.\nFrankly, we don't see it that way.\nOne thing I have remarked on since returning is how closely consumption trends track the actual demand we see in the business.\nThat's more true now than it was six years ago.\nAs noted earlier, our consumption trends remain very strong.\nWhat we saw in the fourth quarter was a relatively soft November and December and in factory sales do we believe to retailer stocking up late in Q3 in anticipation of strong demand over the holiday season.\nThat demand did not materialize to the extent they anticipated and inventories had to be worked off.\nAt the back end of the quarter, there was a shift in timing of the typically soft sales week at year-end.\nIn 2019, that week fell in our financial January while in fiscal 2020 it fell at the end of December.\nThe effect is easy to illustrate January 2020, excuse me 2021 base business sales were up 35%.\nThe year-over-year difference, accounting for roughly 5% of fourth quarter net sales.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was handicapped by $4.3 million in COVID related expenses that were not compensated for by increased sales and an additional spend of $4.5 million in marketing.\nGiven that we remain very optimistic about 2021.\nOur sales continue to be strong, a reflection of the consumption trends and our service levels continue to improve as we add capacity in our workforce strengthens and returns.\nWhile we are still experiencing COVID related expenses, the rate of spending is trending downward and should not be near the $13.5 million cost, we saw in the last three quarters of 2020.\nOur growth through innovation was handicapped in 2020 as retailers canceled resets and focused on maintaining inventory of existing products.\nDespite that the limited launches, we managed to do in 2020 combined with incremental sales of 2019 new products accounted for roughly 2% of our net sales, or $45 million.\nThe successful items in that group will see further expansion of the distribution in fiscal 2021 and will be joined by new product introductions and a variety of brands with special focus on Green Giant frozen and Ortega products.\n2021 will also see a full year of ownership of the iconic Crisco brand, which we acquired on December 1 and which made significant accretive contributions to our fiscal 2020 results in just one month.\nWe are integrating the brand into our company as we speak and expect to have it fully integrated by the end of the summer.\nThe brand brings with it strong sales, reinforced by COVID trends and very attractive margins.\nThe acquisition profile fits our model perfectly in terms of purchase price, financing costs, tax advantages, EBITDA margin, and free cash flow from EBITDA.\nWe believe that there are good opportunities for the brand to grow in both new distribution and new products and we will be working to execute both in 2021.\nAs Bruce mentioned, this year is not without its challenges.\nWe are seeing significant cost pressure on a variety of fronts, including transportation packaging and commodities.\nOur operations group has done a good job of protecting us where possible, but there is still exposure that we must cover.\nWe plan to do that through a combination of pricing, rationalization of trade programs and an enhanced cost reduction program.\nWe've already taken some of those actions.\nPrice increases on the Underwood brand and Green Giant shelf-stable products went into effect last month, more are necessary and will follow.\nIn my opinion cost relief on some elements of costs such as commodities is uncertain.\nThere will be significant competition for what crops get planted this year and the outcome is in doubt until the harvest this fall.\nProgress in 2020 that's well worth noting includes a heightened recognition of the corporate responsibilities of B&G Foods.\nAs we approach the threshold of $2 billion in net sales.\nThe year saw the formation of a new Corporate Social Responsibility committee at the Board of Director level.\nIts mission to direct and oversee our efforts to meet our corporate social responsibilities to our employees, customers, communities and other stakeholders.\nDuring 2020, we also adopted and published on our website a new human rights policy and a new environmental health and safety policy.\nAnd most recently, we have established an employee directed diversity equity and inclusion counsel to help understand and meet the needs of our employees, while achieving appropriate workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout the company.\nWhile we have already had efforts in place on these fronts, the company has more completely formalized those efforts and is committed to increasing all of our efforts and investments.\nWhen we look at fiscal 2021 and try to estimate how we will perform.\nI have to admit that it's a major challenge.\nThe year has started off with very good momentum, but we will soon reach the sales weeks when consumers were loading their pantries in 2020 with everything and anything and we cannot expect to match those weeks.\nBut as 2020 stabilized in the third quarter and fourth quarter we saw more of the \"new normal\" trends that we think will continue and could support increased sales versus fiscal 2019.\nThere is no doubt that many people will continue to work from home for at least part of their work week.\nWe like to believe that consumers have discovered or rediscovered the satisfaction of cooking and baking at home.\nAnd the savings that they can reap from doing so.\nWe are investing to foster more baking at home, in particular, very appropriate since approximately 19% of our sales are in brands that are involved in baking.\nAnd we believe that we can retain many of the new customers who discovered our brands and will market in a traditional way and online to do so.\nAll of that leads us to estimate that we will have base business net sales that will exceed 2019 net sales by approximately 10%, with 11 months of Crisco net sales incremental to that.\nI wish I could call out fiscal 2021 with more precision in that, but we obviously are in very unchartered waters in many ways.\nWe continue to believe that our shareholders are best served by the operating model that we have had in place since we went public in 2004.\nStrived for modest organic growth in our base business of well-established brands, they are on a larger growth component via accretive acquisitions and return a meaningful proportion of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends.\nThis strategy has resulted in a net sales compound annual growth rate of 11% since our IPO in 2004 and an adjusted EBITDA CAGR of 11.9%.\nSince our IPO, B&G Foods has paid out $1.73 billion in dividends.\nWe believe that we have served our shareholders well by making those payments.\nOn average over the years, dividends have represented approximately 60% of free cash flow.\nIn 2020, that payout ratio was about 54%, lower than normal due to the remarkable surge in operating results.\nI'd like to conclude with the final shout out to our employees, all of whom have made this company successful in an extremely challenging year and in particular to the workers, who have been on the front line in our manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, and offices.\nOn a daily basis making sure we can supply the foods that consumers need.\nOther workers have made important contributions as well even while working from home, a less than ideal scenario in many cases.\nWithout all of their dedicated efforts, we could not have achieved the records that were set in fiscal 2020 or have begun 2021 with the prospect of another successful year.\nThis concludes our remarks.\nAnd now we would like to begin the Q&A portion of our call, operator?\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Sherwin-Williams remained focused in the third quarter on solving customer challenges, combating rising costs with pricing and investing for future growth in a difficult and highly fluid environment that is impacting the entire coatings industry.\nDemand remained generally robust, but raw material inflation remained persistently high and raw material availability failed to improve.\nWhile these conditions challenged our quarterly results, we continued to strengthen our customer relationships and take actions that strongly position us for the long term.\nWe're confident in the demand outlook and even more confident in our strategy, our people and our position in the market.\nLet me briefly summarize the quarterly numbers.\nStarting with the top line.\nThird quarter 2021 consolidated sales increased 0.5% to $5.15 billion.\nRaw material availability negatively impacted sales by an estimated high single-digit percentage, with about 75% of the impact in The Americas Group.\nThe remaining impact was largely in the Consumer Brands Group with an immaterial impact to Performance Coatings Group.\nConsolidated gross margin decreased 630 basis points to 41.6%, driven by lower sales volume, raw material cost inflation outpacing our price increases near term and supply chain inefficiencies.\nSG&A expense decreased 2.7% in dollars and decreased 90 basis points to 26.6% as a percent of sales.\nConsolidated profit before tax decreased $264.1 million or 30.2% to $611.5 million.\nThe third quarters of 2021 and 2020 included $70.3 million and $76.4 million of acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense, respectively.\nExcluding these items, consolidated profit before tax decreased 28.4% to $681.8 million.\nDiluted net income per share in the quarter decreased to $1.88 per share from $2.55 per share a year ago.\nThe third quarters of 2021 and 2020 both included acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense of $0.21 per share.\nExcluding these items, third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 24.3% to $2.09 per share from $2.76 per share.\nEBITDA was $834.2 million in the quarter or 16.2% of sales.\nNet operating cash grew to $2.1 billion, or 13.5% of sales in the first nine months of 2021.\nMoving on to our operating segments.\nDespite strong demand, sales in The Americas Group decreased 0.4% as volume and mid-single-digit selling price increases could not fully offset the decrease related to raw material availability.\nSegment margin decreased 3.8 percentage points to 21.3%, resulting primarily from lower sales volume and higher raw material costs, partially offset by selling price increases.\nSegment SG&A remained basically flat year-over-year in dollars and as a percent of sales, as we continued investing in strategic growth initiatives.\nSales in the Consumer Brands Group decreased 22.8% against a very strong comparison a year ago.\nThe decrease included approximately five percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture, lower volume and the negative impact from raw material availability, partially offset by selling price increases.\nAdjusted segment margin decreased 11.7 percentage points to 14.7% of sales, resulting primarily from lower sales volume, higher raw material and supply chain inefficiencies, partially offset by selling price increases and good sales and marketing cost control.\nSales in the Performance Coatings Group increased 17.4%, driven by volume, price increases and favorable currency exchange.\nAdjusted segment margin decreased 5.5 percentage points to 10.5% of sales as operating leverage from the higher volume, selling price increases and good cost control were more than offset by higher raw material costs, where inflation was the highest among the company's three operating segments.\nLet me begin by reiterating the themes we provided on our September 29 update call.\nFirst, the demand environment remains robust across our pro architectural and industrial end markets.\nMany external indicators and more importantly, our customers, remain highly positive.\nDemand is not the issue.\nSecond, we are ready to meet this demand.\nWe continue to invest in growth initiatives.\nWe have significant production capacity available today and we are bringing 50 million gallons of incremental architectural production capacity online over the next two quarters.\nOur capabilities are not the issue.\nThe issues that impacted our third quarter and have persisted in October continued to be industrywide raw material availability constraints and inflation.\nLet me be very clear on how we are responding.\nNobody has more assets and capabilities than Sherwin-Williams.\nWe're employing all of these to keep customers in paint and on the job better than our competitors.\nWe will continue to focus on customer solutions.\nWe are aggressively combating raw material inflation with significant pricing actions across each of our businesses.\nWe implemented multiple price increases in the quarter.\nWe will continue to do so as necessary.\nWe continue to work closely with our suppliers on solutions to improve availability sooner rather than later.\nAt the same time, we're exploring every avenue to better control our own destiny going forward, including our recent announcement to acquire Specialty Polymers, Inc. There's no shortage of confidence on our team, which is deep and experienced.\nWe fully expect we will emerge from these current challenges a stronger company with stronger customer relationships and with continued strong value creation for our shareholders.\nIn just a moment, I'll add some color to Jim's third quarter results summary.\nBut first, I'd like to make a comment on our results year-to-date.\nWhile events largely outside of our control, it forced us to adjust our expectations, we have still delivered a solid performance.\n2021 year-to-date consolidated sales were up 9.4% or $1.31 billion.\nDespite high teens raw material inflation, adjusted PBT increased 1.5% or $33.1 million and adjusted diluted net income per share increased 4.8% to $6.80 per share.\nAdjusted EBITDA is $2.73 billion or 18% of consolidated sales.\nEven in this unusual environment, we've continued to make investments that will drive our momentum over the long term.\nAnd we are confident we will see significant margin expansion as availability and inflation headwinds eventually subside.\nNow returning to segment performance in the third quarter.\nIn The Americas Group, raw material availability challenges were a significant drag on sales.\nThe good news is that underlying demand remains sound and reported backlogs are strong.\nWe expect growth rates will improve significantly, commensurate with improvement in the industry supply chain.\nSales growth in the third quarter was led by Protective & Marine, which was up by high single-digit percentage.\nWe're seeing good demand in this business from customers in oil and gas, flooring and seal fabrication markets.\nTAG's largest business, residential repaint, grew by a low single-digit percentage against a strong double-digit comparison.\nAs industry supply chain issues are resolved, we would expect this business to return to its prior growth levels, where we've delivered double-digit growth for the last five years.\nNew residential sales increased by a low single-digit percentage.\nNew housing permits and starts have been trending very well since last summer, and our customers are reporting solid order rates.\nWe're seeing a number of projects being pushed out as a variety of building materials beyond paint are in short supply.\nProperty management was up slightly in the quarter.\nImproving apartment turns, along with the return to travel, the workplace and school are tailwinds that should support higher growth when raw material availability improves.\nOur commercial business was down slightly in the quarter.\nSimilar to new residential, projects are taking longer to reach the painting phase due to short supply of multiple building materials.\nAnd finally, as expected, our DIY business was down double digits versus an extremely difficult comparison, which was exacerbated by the raw material availability issues.\nFrom a product perspective, interior paint sales performed better than exterior sales, with interior being the larger part of the mix.\nWe realized a mid-single-digit increase in price in the third quarter resulting from our February one and August one price increases and our mid-September surcharge.\nWe would expect the combination of these pricing actions to result in a high single-digit percentage price realization in the fourth quarter, putting our full year price realization for TAG in the mid-single-digit range.\nWe will continue to evaluate additional pricing actions as needed.\nWe've opened 50 net new stores year-to-date.\nAlong with these new stores, we continue to make investments in sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products, e-commerce and productivity-enhancing services.\nWe are not taking our foot off the gas on these growth initiatives.\nMoving on to our Consumer Brands Group.\nSales decreased by a double-digit percentage, driven by difficult comparisons to the prior year, consumers returning to the workplace, raw material availability issues and the divestiture of the Wattyl business.\nOverall, DIY demand continued to moderate to more normal levels compared to 2020.\nThis was partially offset by growth in the North American Pros Who Paint category, which was up strong double digits in the quarter and year-to-date.\nWhile sales are down in all regions, sales were less impacted in North America, our largest region, compared to Europe and Asia, where COVID restrictions were more impactful.\nPricing was positive in the quarter, though below the level of The Americas Group.\nAs you know, our global supply chain organization is managed within this segment.\nThis team continues to work with suppliers to navigate the industrywide raw material supply chain disruptions caused by Winter Storm Uri and Hurricane Ida.\nWe stand ready with ample capacity and are adding more to serve customers at a higher level as raw material availability improves.\nLast, let me comment on the third quarter trends in Performance Coatings Group.\nWe continue to see momentum as this is the fifth straight quarter of growth for this business.\nGroup sales increased by more than 17% in the quarter, including a currency translation tailwind of 2%.\nPrice was in the high single-digit range, and all regions and all divisions generated growth.\nRegionally, sales in the quarter grew fastest in Europe and Latin America, followed by North America and Asia.\nEvery division in the group grew, the majority by double digits, driven by robust underlying demand, new customer wins and share of wallet gains.\nI'll start with packaging, which generated strong double-digit growth against a high single-digit comparison last year.\nSales were up double digits in every region.\nDemand for food and beverage cans remains robust, and our non-BPA coatings continue to gain traction within existing and new customers.\nNext is General Industrial, the largest division of the group, which posted its third consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth.\nSales were up double digits in every region.\nSales were strong across most of our customer segments, led by heavy equipment, containers and general finishing.\nOur Coil Coatings business remains a consistent performer.\nSales grew by a double-digit percentage for the second consecutive quarter and were positive in all regions.\nThis team continues to do an excellent job at winning new accounts in all regions.\nConstruction and appliances led to growth.\nAutomotive refinish sales increased by a mid-single-digit percentage.\nMiles driven are nearing pre-pandemic levels.\nNew installations of our products and systems in North America remained strong.\nThe Industrial Wood division generated low single-digit growth.\nGrowth in North America, our largest region, was up strong double digits, but was offset by Asia Pacific where COVID-related shutdowns had a significant negative impact on sales.\nNew residential construction continues to drive robust demand for our products in kitchen cabinetry, flooring and furniture applications.\nBefore moving to our outlook, let me speak to capital allocation year-to-date.\nWe've returned a little over $2.5 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks.\nWe've invested $2.1 billion to purchase 8.075 million shares at an average price of $265.88.\nWe distributed $442.9 million in dividends, an increase of 20.4%.\nWe also invested $248 million in our business through capital expenditures, including approximately $36 million for our Building our Future project.\nWe ended the quarter with a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times.\nWe also announced the Sika and Specialty Polymer acquisitions, which are expected to close in early 2022, if not sooner.\nTurning to our outlook.\nWe expect robust demand to continue in North American pro architectural end markets.\nWe expect DIY demand to continue normalizing as consumers return to the workplace.\nWe expect industrial demand to remain strong.\nRaw material availability challenges will remain a headwind in the fourth quarter, but the situation is improving.\nWe believe we have weathered the worst of Hurricane Ida, and supply should continue to come back online.\nWe expect to be in a make-and-ship mode and do not anticipate building any inventory until the first quarter of 2022.\nOn the cost side of the equation, our raw material inflation expectations for the year moved up to the low 20% range from the high teens given additional pressure we've seen since our last guidance.\nWe do not see any meaningful improvement until well into 2022.\nAll businesses remain aggressive in implementing price increases as necessary to offset these costs.\nWe recognize that the timing of price realization will continue to put pressure on margins in the near term.\nAnd as we've said many times, we expect margin expansion over the long term and maintain our gross margin target in the 45% to 48% range.\nAgainst this backdrop, we anticipate fourth quarter 2021 consolidated net sales will be up by a mid- to high single-digit percentage compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.\nWe expect The Americas Group sales to be up by a mid- to high single-digit percentage, with pro sales at or above the high end of this range and DIY sales returning to a more historic level.\nWe expect Consumer Brands sales to be down by a mid-teens percentage, including a negative impact of approximately seven percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture, and we expect Performance Coatings sales to be up by a mid-teens percentage.\nEmbedded in our guidance is a similar impact to our architectural businesses as a percent to sales from raw material availability as we experienced in the third quarter.\nFor the full year 2021, we expect consolidated net sales to be up by a high single-digit percentage.\nWe expect The Americas Group to be up by a high single-digit percentage; Consumer Brands Group to be down by a mid-teens percentage, including a negative impact of approximately four percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture; and Performance Coatings Group to be up by a low 20s percentage.\nWe expect diluted net income per share for 2021 to be in the range of $7.16 to $7.36 per share compared to $7.36 per share earned in 2020.\nFull year 2021 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.85 per share and a loss on the Wattyl divestiture of $0.34 per share.\nOn an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2021 earnings per share of $8.35 to $8.55.\nLet me close with some additional data points that may be helpful for your modeling purposes.\nWe expect to see a slightly improved sequential gross margin in our fourth quarter as additional price increases are implemented in the quarter.\nWe expect to see contraction in our fourth quarter operating margin due to the contraction in gross margin, partially offset by leverage on SG&A due to the strong sales growth.\nWe will continue making investments across the enterprise that will enhance our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers.\nWe expect to have around 80 new store openings in the U.S. and Canada in 2021.\nWe'll also be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity improvements as well as systems and product innovation.\nWe also plan additional incremental investments in our digital platform in the home center channel.\nThese investments are all embedded in our full year guidance.\nWe expect foreign currency exchange to be a tailwind of approximately 2% in the fourth quarter.\nWe expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be slightly below 20%.\nWe expect full year depreciation to be approximately $270 million and amortization to be approximately $310 million.\nWe expect full year capex to be approximately $370 million, including about $70 million for our Building our Future project.\nThe interest expense guidance we provided last quarter remains unchanged at approximately $340 million.\nWe expect to increase the annual dividend per share by 23.5% per share for the full year.\nWe expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases.\nWe'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy.\nWe're on track to deliver solid full year results even with the considerable supply chain and inflationary headwinds we are experiencing.\nI remain extremely proud of our team and their focus on providing solutions to our customers.\nDemand remains strong, our customer relationships have strengthened and we continue to invest in our capabilities.\nWe expect to finish the year with significant momentum that will carry us forward in 2022.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We refer to certain of these risks in our SEC filings.\nParticipating in today's call with me will be Paul McDermott, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Riffee, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Karen Filter, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; Drew Hammond, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer; and Graham Montgomery, Vice President and Head of Research.\nWe delivered strong second quarter financial performance against the backdrop of the ongoing economic disruption, highlighting the resilience of our portfolio.\nAs the local economy gradually reopens, our primary focus continues to center around the health and safety of our residents, tenants, employees and their families.\nOver the past several months, WashREIT created and implemented a comprehensive reentry plan to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 at our properties.\nWe connected with our office tenants through personalized outreach to understand their needs and discuss our approach to make sure that they are comfortable with the protocols that we have implemented.\nWe are fortunate to have not experienced material bad debt to date in alongside reentry planning, we've been diligently working with tenants who have been financially impacted by the economic shutdown to discuss and finalize deferral arrangements.\nAs of today, we are pleased to report that we have substantially completed that effort.\nThere is no doubt that these are trying times.\nHowever, we have adjusted to the new demands of today's operating environment and have taken swift and deliberate action to protect and support our residents and tenants.\nI could not be more proud of the dedication shown by the WashREIT team during this challenging period.\nFurthermore, these times have highlighted the importance of social fairness, equity and justice.\nAnd our company has responded with a refocused commitment to improving diversity, inclusion and belonging within our company and our community and creating long-lasting positive change.\nAs we enter the second half of the year, we are increasingly confident in the resilience of our region and likewise, our portfolio.\nOur Washington metro focus provides economic stability compared to other major metropolitan areas.\nThis is true both historically and during the current downturn.\nAs the Washington metro area continues to experience fewer job losses since the pandemic hit than other large metro areas and the U.S. overall.\nWashington Metro employment declined 9% during the second quarter compared to over 11% for the U.S. overall.\nA recent analysis completed by Delta Associates determined that the Washington multifamily market is better positioned to weather a down cycle than nearly all of the nation's other large metropolitan areas.\nThis is due in large part to the presence of the federal government and the corresponding stability of the professional business services sector, which together comprised 46% of the D.C. metro economy compared to 25% for the 30 largest metro areas.\nFurthermore, our professional business services sector is more heavily weighted toward the professional, scientific and technical subsector, which has fared very well during this crisis and generated year-over-year job growth of 1.6% in June.\nThis sector is expected to bounce back much quicker than other sectors and continues to be the primary private job creation source in the region over the long term, according to Delta Associates.\nUnsurprisingly, the federal government sector has been the least negatively impacted by the pandemic thus far.\nMany federal agencies actually received funding a funding boost, which could lead to additional hiring, especially at critical agencies such as the FDA, NIH and FDA.\nGovernment contractors have seen $1.2 billion in contracts awarded year-to-date that are directly tied to the COVID-19 response, according to JLL.\nEmployment trends for the regional information sector reflect limited disruption and major tech industry investments, including Amazon's HQ2 campus construction and Virginia Tech yard campus.\nThe Washington metro area led the country in Q2 leasing activity, driven by 1.6 million square feet of positive net absorption in Northern Virginia.\nDespite the stay-at-home orders, office leasing activity in Northern Virginia declined only 12% in the second quarter compared to the five-year trailing quarterly average, according to CBRE.\nOver half of the leasing activity in Northern Virginia was driven by government contracting services.\nGovernment contractor awards are up 4% year-over-year due to the government's response to COVID-19.\nCheck and government contracting for 60% of our office leasing volume in Northern Virginia last year.\nAnd looking forward, we expect demand from these sectors to continue to grow.\nUnsurprisingly, Washington D.C. office leasing activity has slowed more than it did in Northern Virginia due to lower momentum leading into this downturn.\nHowever, the impact of local job losses for office using sectors in D.C. has been limited.\nWith no office using sector losing more than 5% of the total workforce during the second quarter, according to BLS data.\nAdditionally, the number of tours increased substantially in July.\nWe expect our D.C. office portfolio to act defensively against this backdrop.\nMaryland, Virginia and D.C. each took a phased approach to reentry beginning at the end of May.\nD.C. and Maryland are currently in Phase two with limited reopenings of shops and restaurants, and Virginia is in Phase 3, which has allowed all retail and public services to resume with social distancing measures in place.\nWith the implementation of Phase two reentry protocols, we are seeing increased activity across all of our asset classes.\nMultifamily touring and application volumes have increased threefold from early April for both our same-store and non-same-store assets and same-store applications are trending above prior year levels.\nFollowing the closure of our leasing office, we took advantage of our virtual touring capabilities and continued leasing in April and May.\nAnd once social distancing requirements were eased locally, we began offering self-guided tours in June.\nJust recently, we have opened our multifamily amenities in common areas and started offering in-person tours with additional safety precautions.\nLease-up of Trove continues to progress and is expected to reach stabilized occupancy in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nWhile the economic shutdown has impacted the original expected pace of leases, we averaged approximately 16 leases per month during the second quarter and expect to reach breakeven levels of occupancy by year-end, followed by steady quarterly NOI growth thereafter.\nOur total lease rate growth for the quarter was a positive 40 basis points, which, combined with our sequential decline in ending occupancy of less than 80 basis points to our stabilized properties demonstrates the resilience of our value-oriented multifamily portfolio.\nLease rates for our non-same-store portfolio, which includes strong performance from our Class B suburban communities, grew over 2% during the quarter on a blended basis, comprised of 2.6% of renewal lease rate growth and 1% of new lease rate growth.\nOur suburban garden-style apartments offer larger unit sizes, open-air hallways and less density compared to mid or high-rise buildings, allowing us to participate in the increasing demand for these qualities over the near-term in the wake of the pandemic.\nOver the long term, the expansion of our multifamily portfolio to growing suburban markets in the D.C. metro suburbs positions us to capture an increasing share of regional household formation and job growth.\nWe began to experience an uptick in utilization at all of our office properties toward the end of the quarter, although, most notably at our Northern Virginia office assets, as Northern Virginia is now in Phase three of reopening.\nIn preparation for the repopulation of our properties, we prepared a detailed property reentry plan that emphasizes employee and tenant health and well-being as top priorities.\nWe have reached out to our tenants to discuss the plans and protocols that we have put in place.\nThe feedback regarding our collaborative approach has been very positive, and in many cases, we strengthened our relationships with our tenants.\nWe've upgraded our office buildings to ventilation filters, which is the standard for superior commercial office buildings, installed directional safety practice signage, contactless opening technology and proactive shield around front office desk in addition to a variety of other measures taken to facilitate safe reentry.\nWe have also established enhanced cleaning protocols that include more frequent cleaning and the use of electrostatic cleaning sheets and have developed elevator and common area safety protocols designed to mitigate the risk of virus transmission.\nOur tenant experience app, NU, which began rolling out in January, has kept us connected with many of our tenants despite working remotely.\nThe Concierge program has continued to provide a wide range of on-demand services and partner with local vendors and farmers to provide grocery and other essential deliveries.\nWe could not have picked a more critical time to roll out this technology to assist our tenants both professionally and personally during this challenging time.\nOur Space+ program has allowed us to meet changing tenant needs more efficiently with flexible lease terms.\nOur spaces offer tenants quick move-ins all in pricing, flexibility for short and long-term planning as well as privacy and independence, not just for brand building, but now more importantly than ever for control over the health of the tenant's office.\nAll of our Space+ tenants have control over their own private space, which is becoming increasingly important in this COVID-19 environment.\nIn an environment where many tenants are moving slower on larger and longer requirements, flexibility is key, and Space+ is playing a crucial role in meeting tenant needs.\nWe entered 2020, expecting to see sequential quarterly growth, driven by renovation-led value creation and commercial lease commencements.\nWhile the pandemic has disrupted the timing of that growth, our key growth drivers remain intact.\nIn multifamily, we have positioned our portfolio to retain the growth drivers but we may capture that value for our shareholders as normal activities and opportunities return.\nWe've allocated capital to Class B properties in submarkets with wider than average gaps between Class A and Class B rents and limited competitive supply, which sets us up for a quick recovery and preserve the value-add rent growth from renovations for the future.\nThrough our 2019 strategic allocation, we increased our renovation pipeline to over 3,000 units, which represents five years of growth at compelling return on costs.\nWhile most of our portfolio does not directly compete with new supply, deliveries in Northern Virginia, where 80% of our multifamily portfolio is located, are expected to decrease by 24% over the next 12 months.\nFurthermore, the pandemic will likely cause delays in projected construction starts in the second half of 2020, which will reduce the number of deliveries in 2022 and into 2023.\nAnd overall, there is an acute housing shortage in the Washington metro region and our in-house research affirms our confidence that growth opportunities are still ahead of us.\nWe also have a tremendous opportunity for growth, having substantially made the capital outlay for Trove with Phase two delivering in a couple of months.\nWhile the disruption certainly changed the initial pace of lease up, we expect to reach a breakeven occupancy level in the fourth quarter and thereafter achieve quarterly sequential NOI growth through stabilization in 2021 and into 2022.\nWe in the office portfolio, our embedded growth is comprised of future commencements for high-quality space and value-oriented pricing and move-in ready space with flexible lease terms.\nWe expect signed leases to continue to occupy, and we expect to benefit from higher occupancy in the fourth quarter and throughout 2021.\nMany of our speculative leasing opportunities, for which we had excellent momentum before the pandemic hit, are located in our best assets, including Watergate 600, Arlington Tower and Silverline center as well as our Space+ program, which is positioned well to meet demand in these early, cautious transition months.\nWhile physical touring did pause, it is now resuming, although decision-making remains slower than normal wire entry is being more pure by prospective tenants.\nWe believe those leasing opportunities are a matter of when, not if, they will commence.\nI'll start off by discussing our cash collection performance before reviewing our second quarter results and outlook for the remainder of 2020.\nOur multifamily collections continue to be very strong, which is a testament to the resilience of our submarkets and industry mix and lower average rent-to-income ratio of 26%.\nWe collected over 99% of cash rents during the second quarter and over 99% of contractual rents.\nAnd our rent collections through the first three weeks of July have been strong also.\nWhile we are offering deferred payment programs to residents who've been financially impacted by the pandemic to date, deferrals have been relatively low, representing less than 0.4% of total monthly rental income on average.\nOur monthly multifamily collection performance continues to track above national averages.\nWe collected 99% of cash rents in June compared to 96% per NMHC.\nWe attribute our outperformance in part to high exposure to industries that have outperformed during this crisis and lower relative exposure to underperforming industries.\nThe impact of COVID-19 on the Washington metro market has been contained primarily to three sectors, representing approximately 75% of Washington metro job losses.\nWhile the impact has been more broadly spread across a wider range of sectors in the U.S. overall.\nAs those same three sectors represented less than 60% of total losses nationally through June.\nThus, the U.S. overall is experiencing job losses that are spread across more industries than our region.\nThe Washington metro market's relative strength reflects the stability in business revenue provided by technology and federal contracting.\nWe track the industries our residents are employed in, and our exposure is most heavily weighted to the most resilient economic sectors and likewise, less weighted to the industries that have been most impacted, which has resulted in very high collection rates and stable cash flows.\nWe collected 97% of cash rents during the second quarter and over 99% of contractual rents, which excludes rent that has been deferred.\nAs of July 22, our collections for July are in line with the same period in June.\nSimilar to our multifamily resident industry minutes, our office tenants are relatively weighted to the stronger economic sectors than the U.S. overall, which has helped us experience limited bad debt thus far.\nWe have agreed to defer $1.2 million of rent for office tenants, and we expect to collect over 85% of that deferred rent by year-end 2021 with the balance thereafter.\nWe believe our efforts to substantially derisk our portfolio by selling all single-tenant office assets and 75% of our prior retail exposure, including all of the power centers, and reallocating that capital to our multifamily portfolio is certainly proving its value in these economic times.\nRetail now comprises just 6% of NOI and while retail tenants have struggled the most, we collected 72% of retail rents in the second quarter.\nExcluding deferred rent, our collection rate was approximately 90% during the second quarter and 91% during the first three weeks of July.\nYear-to-date, we've only incurred approximately $770,000 of bad debt expense related to retail tenants and $638,000 of that was related to covet 2019.\nWe will continue to monitor their strength and ability as the economy progresses.\nWe've agreed to defer approximately $1 million of rent for retail tenants, and we expect to collect over 50% of that rent by year-end 2021.\nThis assumes that our region continues to gradually reopen through year-end.\nTo date, we've not incurred material bad debts related to COVID-19.\nOverall, we have only deferred a small portion of rent and the expected cash NOI impact is less than $0.01 per share through year-end 2021.\nWhile we have possibly experienced the most disruptive part of the pandemic, uncertainty regarding its duration and future impact remains.\nWe currently believe the second quarter represented the most challenging quarter.\nHowever, future and ongoing economic disruption could result in bad debt greater than what we've incurred to date.\nWe will continue to monitor future developments and proactively address them as they occur.\nTurning to the balance sheet.\nWe have a strong liquidity position with approximately $530 million of available liquidity as of June 30, and no significant capital commitments for the balance of the year and no remaining maturities in 2020.\nAs of June 30, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 6.1 times, at the lower end of our targeted range.\nWe prepaid our $250 million 4.95% bonds in early April, and we can go to the capital markets to further term out debt when it makes sense to do so.\nWe expect to remain well within our bank and bond covenants and have access to our mostly undrawn line of credit if needed.\nBased on our current projections, we have reduced 2020 assumed capital expenditures for the year by approximately $40 million compared to our initial 2020 guidance.\nIncluded in this amount is almost $30 million of lower assumed capital expenditures and $11 million in less development spending as we no longer expect to break ground on the Riverside development this year.\nOur capital expenditure reductions include nonessential building improvements, tenant improvements and leasing costs, perspective of leasing as well as lower multifamily renovation capex.\nI our future multifamily renovation pipeline remains intact, although we are suspending the program until after the market disruptions subside.\nWe plan to allocate the renovation capital at a later date when the market allows for rent increases to deliver the appropriate ROI.\nAs we navigate through the second half of the year, we will continue to explore opportunities to further reduce nonessential capex spending to further bolster our liquidity.\nLooking forward, we feel confident in our ability to execute on our short-term goals of providing payment flexibility to residents and tenants in need while retaining the operational flexibility necessary to execute our long-term goals.\nAs Paul mentioned, we posted a solid second quarter despite the challenging operating environment.\nI will discuss those results before addressing our future outlook.\nWe reported core FFO of $0.39 per diluted share.\nOverall, same-store NOI declined 4.5% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 3.5% on a cash basis, due to the same-store office NOI decline of 4.8% on a GAAP basis and 3.7% on a cash basis as well as bad debt expenses related to COVID-19 of approximately $720,000.\nThe same-store office NOI decline was driven by expected decline in parking income as well as an increase in bad debt expenses related to COVID-19.\nExcluding the decline in parking income and the increase in bad debt expenses compared to our prior 2020 expectations, same-store office NOI would have increased slightly on a year-over-year basis.\nOur multifamily same-store NOI increased by 0.7% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 0.8% year-over-year on a cash basis.\nThe company achieved 40 basis points of blended year-over-year lease rate growth, driven by strong performance from our suburban assets in our non same-store portfolio.\nSame-store new lease rates declined by just under 4%, while renewal rates increased by over 1.4%, reflecting blended lease rate decline of approximately 40 basis points.\nNon-same-store lease rates grew over 2% during the quarter on a blended basis, comprised of 2.6% of renewal lease rate growth and 1% of new lease rate growth.\nOur same-store multifamily portfolio is currently approximately 94% occupied, and our total day bag portfolio is over 94% occupied, a 97% leased.\nSame-store NOI decreased in our residual retail centers, which we report as other, by 24.6% on a GAAP basis and 22.1% on a cash basis, driven primarily by higher credit losses, which included amounts to do from tenants impacted by COVID-19, been likely not collectible.\nAnd lower recoveries compared to the prior year period.\nThe combined write-off impact of COVID-19 in the quarter was approximately $560,000, which included straight-line rents and lease intangibles, and the cash impact was approximately $335,000.\nTurning to leasing activity for the quarter, while velocity and touring was hit by the economic shutdown, we signed approximately 20,000 square feet of new office leases and 15,000 square feet of office renewals in the second quarter.\nWe achieved rental rate increases of 0.8% on a cash basis and negative 2.3% on a cash basis, both for new leases and 19.4% on a GAAP basis and 1.9% on a cash basis for renewals.\nThe impact of operational cost savings initiatives reduced operating costs by approximately $848,000 during the second quarter, net of tenant recoveries and expense related to preparing our built office buildings for reentry.\nSecond quarter operational cost savings primarily included reduced utility consumption, lower R&M, security expenses and lower tenant event and amenity expenses relative to our original forecast.\nNow I'd like to discuss our financial outlook.\nWe are now four months into the pandemic.\nAnd while we are not in a position to predict the ongoing magnitude of the pandemic or durability of the recovery, we believe that we are able to forecast subject to certain caveats, the impact of COVID-19 for the balance of 2020 on our NOI and interest expense, exclusive of future bad debt.\nToday, I will describe the impacts that we're experiencing on various financial performance metrics.\nOur expectations are based on the assumption that the gradual reopening will continue uninterrupted through year-end.\nMultifamily occupancy dipped to 94% in June and has remained stable through July.\nWith the easing of confinement measures and increased staffing in our leasing offices, we've seen touring and application volumes increase substantially.\nTotal application volumes have increased by 3 times from early April lows, and same-store applications have trended over 30% above prior year levels since the end of May.\nWe expect the continual increase in leasing volume to drive a gradual increase in occupancy to 95% by year-end.\nWe did not increase rents on 12-plus month renewals and for the second quarter, which impacted our NOI growth as we normally would be achieving significant rent increases during the strong second quarter leasing season, especially since we had such strong lease rate growth in March.\nAs a result, we experienced an increase in renewal retention to 60%.\nWhile this higher renewal retention has helped us to maintain occupancy and preserve our seasonal rent roll during these uncertain times, it did not fully offset the impact of occupancy from lower new leasing volumes.\nLower new and renewal lease rate growth as well as lower move in and other fee income were partially offset by operating expense savings initiatives during the second quarter.\nThe majority of the expected full year impact of operating expense savings related to COVID-19 was recognized in the second quarter.\nExcluding the impact of bad debt, we expect the impact of COVID-19 on our multifamily NOI to translate to a reduction of approximately $0.03 per share relative to our initial core FFO guidance for 2020.\nOverall, we had previously expected significant multifamily growth in 2020, and that growth is likely now going to be deferred until 2021 and thereafter.\nAs Paul said, we have a five-year pipeline of value-add renovations once conditions improve and it is appropriate to resume such growth.\nAnd we still expect future NOI growth from TRO, which I will cover next.\nTrove is on pace to deliver Phase II in the fourth quarter.\nOur lease-up had just begun when social distancing measures drew on-site touring to a haul.\nHowever, we've been successfully converting virtual tours into signed leases.\nWhile virtual touring is having continued success, we expect lease-up to take longer than we have originally guided and will likely to incur a loss of between $600,000 to $700,000 in 2020.\nWhich translates to a negative impact on core FFO relative to our initial guidance of approximately $0.01 per share.\nAs Paul also said, we expect to reach breakeven occupancy near this year-end and to reach stabilization in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nTherefore, the TRO should not only provide substantial growth in 2021 and but also further year-over-year growth in 2022.\nNow moving on to commercial.\nTenant improvement build-outs for near-term lease commencements are expected to continue uninterrupted.\nWe have over 55,000 square feet, representing approximately 150 basis points of future increased occupancy of signed leases that have not yet written commenced.\nAlthough physical tours had stopped they resume toward the end of the quarter and a substantial increase through July to just below pre COVID-19.\nOverall decision-making has been slower as the pace of Phase III entry has, in many cases, allowed prospective tenants more time.\nAdditionally, we are in lease extension negotiations with a handful of tenants who were previously expected to vacate.\nOur previous revenue expectations for 2020 included speculative office lease commencements that have been impacted by the current economic disruption and are now likely to be substantially executed in 2021.\nThe lease is not signed as of today.\nThe majority of this leasing was expected to occur during the third and fourth quarters at high-quality spaces across Watergate 600, Silverline Center, Arlington Tower and Space+.\nThe leasing momentum has been the strongest.\nWe expect the impact of lower speculative leasing to be only partially offset by higher revenue from lease renewals and extensions.\nAnd we have minimal commercial lease expirations for the remainder of 2020, limiting the downside risk of our internal leasing estimates.\nOffice lease expirations represent approximately 4% of our office revenues and less than 2% of our overall revenue.\nAnd as many tenants are opting to delay long-term decisions, short-term lease extensions and renewal activity could trend higher as the year progresses.\nParking revenue is down as people are not driving to their offices.\nOur current projection of set parking revenue will decline by over $1.3 million over the remainder of the year.\nHowever, that estimate could change if the shutdown is more protracted than we've assumed.\nLikewise, once the economy returns, we can experience an increase in parking income from higher utilization as tenant transportation preferences shift away from public transportation.\nWe are already seeing signs of increased transient parking at many of our properties.\nCurrently, we are assuming that we may achieve additional operating cost savings of approximately $750,000 for the balance of the year, assuming a gradual increase in office utilization over the remainder of the year.\nThis amount is net of expenses associated with preparing our bill for reentry and the cost savings that we expect to pass along to our tenants.\nExcluding future bad debt, we expect the impact of COVID-19 in our office and other NOI to translate to a negative impact of approximately $0.08 per share relative to our initial core FFO guidance for 2020.\nMost of that impact will occur during the second half of the year as we previously expected a ramp-up in that time frame that we now expect to occur throughout 2021.\nOffsetting a part of the negative impact of COVID-19 on our business is a reduction in our expectations for interest expense by $0.04 per share relative to our initial core FFO 2020 guidance, excluding any future refinancings to further term out debt.\nOn a combined basis, we expect the impact of COVID-19 on NOI and interest expense to translate to a negative impact of approximately $0.08 per share relative to our initial guidance for 2020.\nWe are not updating other guidance assumptions at this time.\nThe majority of the impact will occur during the second half of the year as we previously expected a ramp-up in that time frame that we now have expected to incur throughout 2021.\nOverall, we're actually slightly ahead of our original budget for the first six months of 2020, despite going through a historically challenging four-month period.\nAs we just explained, much of the growth we had planned for the second half of 2020 appears to be deferred, but we believe still intact for the future.\nIn closing, while we are operating in a challenging environment, we are confident in our ability to effectively manage through this period of uncertainty while preserving the embedded growth of our assets.\nOur value-oriented portfolio has demonstrated resilience as we absorb the near-term impact, which is further underscored by our strong rent collection performance and the proven stability of the Washington metro economy.\nFurthermore, our sustained multifamily lease rate growth and stabilizing occupancy trends highlight the value of our research-driven capital allocation strategy, which has led us to invest in well-located residential units that will be in the path of growth once the economy resumes.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Before beginning, let's take a moment to -- review, excuse me, our cautionary reminders.\nSuch factors can include weather conditions, changes in regulatory policy, competitive pressures and various other risks that are detailed in the Company's SEC reports and filings.\nI'd like to talk a little bit about the 2021 forecast that we've given and kind of update where we are at the half.\nSo, I think at the -- in the March forecast outlook, we gave the top six items as a outlook, and then in 2020 -- in May, we added that net income would grow at a faster rate than revenue.\nSo, what I'd like to do is kind of show where we said we would be and where we wound up for the first half.\nSo, with regards to revenue, we said that we would be in low double-digit increase, and at the half now, we're looking at a 25% increase in our revenue.\nWe said gross profit margins, we are forecasting to be similar to recent years, and at the half, we're right at the same 39%.\nOperating expenses, some increases driven by our growth initiatives, and as a percent of sales, up -- for net as a percent of sales, we're down 1%.\nInterest expense, we felt we'd be similar to 2020, but in fact our interest is down by 30%.\nOur tax rate, we expect for the year to end up at the mid 20%s range, we're actually up 31% versus 23%, but we are still thinking we will wind up as we have some tax benefits that we'll see coming for us in fourth quarter.\nDebt to EBITDA ratio, we were saying we're targeting 2 to 2.5 times as we were preparing building inventories for the season.\nWe are at that 2.5 times level, but in the second half, we expect to move that down and, short [Phonetic] of acquisition, we'd probably expect to maybe even be below that 2 number.\nAnd then, on net income, growing at a faster rate, yeah, actually we're 86% versus 25%.\nFor those of you that focus on EBITDA, we're now saying that our EBITDA for the year will wind up growing at a faster rate than revenue as well, and for the half, we've got a 29% increase.\nSo at this point, things are rolling along well.\nWe still have our tailwinds.\nWe're looking pretty strong and cotton right now as we hit our -- both our insecticide.\nBidrin is doing doing very well.\nWe've got plant bugs that are out there and active.\nSo, we expect a very good year with Bidrin.\nIn addition, particularly with West Texas hitting, we expect our defoliant Folex will do also very well.\nCorn soil insecticides look well going into '22, so that will have some sales in this quarter, and additionally, in the fourth quarter and first quarter next year.\nBut we are seeing our customers looking to secure product.\nI think as many as -- when customers telling us 300 different products that are on allocation in United States right now, we're in pretty good position with our six plants here in North America.\nSo, I think we're really in pretty good.\nWe do have some headwinds and inbound freight from Pacific coming across from Asia.\nFortunately, we are not very dependent on that, just maybe 10% to 12% we have come over.\nBut the cost per container has moved from about $3,500 a container, up to $20,000 a container.\nSo, it's a huge increase when [Phonetic] accounted that generally a freighter coming across has about $73 million of revenue that now has moved up to $420 million of revenue, so quite a big increase.\nAnd so far we've done reasonably well at putting through price increases, but we are working on this every month to put out to the team what cost changes we have with the understanding that we can try and recover as best we can.\nSo with that, David, I'll turn this over to you.\nWith regards to our public filing, we intend to file our Form 10-Q today.\nAnd as we have noted in previous calls, the Company is fortunate to participate in industries that are considered part of critical infrastructure in all countries in which we operate.\nAs a result, throughout 2020 and now during the first half of 2021, our customers and suppliers and our employees and operations have all continued more or less without disruption during the pandemic.\nWith regard to our sales performance for the second quarter of 2021, the Company's net sales increased by 29% to $135 million as compared to net sales of $105 million this time last year.\nWithin that overall improvement, our US sales increased by 44% to $84 million and our International sales increased by 10% to $51 million.\nInternational sales accounted for 38% of total net sales as compared to 44% of net sales this time last year.\nWith regard to gross profit performance, our US Crop business recorded improved absolute gross profit on increased sales, which were up about approximately 40%.\nOffsetting the strong sales growth performance, our factory performance was impacted by short-term challenges, including the delayed start up of a production cell in our LA facility and some mechanical integrity testing at our access plant.\nThese issues were substantially behind us.\nOverall, gross margin percentage to net sales remained strong at 43%.\nOur Non-Crop absolute gross margin increased by 39%, on sales that's [Phonetic] increased by 55% as compared to the same quarter of the prior year.\nWithin this change, we had improved sales of both our US Dibrom products and our pest strips.\nOn the other hand, while we have substantially higher Envance technology license income in the first half of 2021, we recorded lower license income during the second quarter.\nFurthermore, we experienced lower factory recovery in the second quarter of 2021 for the reasons already discussed.\nOverall, gross margin percentage remained strong at 46%.\nWith regard to our Q2 2021 International sales, we saw increased sales of 10% and a strong increase in gross margin, which were up 35%.\nMore than half of the improvement was driven by the newly acquired businesses, AgNova in Australia and Agrinos biologicals business, which both generate margins above our International average.\nOverall, gross margin improved to 31% as compared to 25% for the same period of the prior year.\nI thought I would come up for a moment on overall cost of goods, which remained flat at 61% of net sales.\nWe have seen some upward pressure on cost affecting certain products in our portfolio because of where the associated raw materials are sourced.\nWe are also seeing significant increases in inbound ocean freight, particularly from Asia.\nSo, our exposure there is not significant.\nWe have made selective price increases to offset this cost inflation.\nThis graph shows the impact of the factory performance on our overall gross margin.\nYou can see that in the second quarter of 2021, the factory cost is 3.3% of sales, whereas in Q2 of 2020, the performance was such that we only had a 0.6 net cost -- 0.6% net cost.\nDespite the factory performance, our margin percentage remained flat for both quarters.\nOperating expenses for the quarter increased by $9.5 million or 28% as compared to the same period of the prior year.\nDespite the increase, expenses, when compared to net sales, remained level at 32% of sales.\nThe increased cost included the addition of activities of two newly acquired businesses, which together accounted for approximately third of the increase.\nThis included taking a charge of $1 million in additional deferred consideration on the Australian business that we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nThat business has exceeded expectations in its first year, and consequently, the Company's liability associated with earn out agreement has increased.\nOur outbound freight costs are almost purely volume driven and were up 34%.\nAs I noted earlier, during the same period, net sales were up 29%.\nIn addition to volume, we had some mix of customer, destination and products, and some freight inflation.\nThe freight increase accounted for a quarter of the increase.\nOther increases included legal expenses and higher incentive compensation accruals linked to business performance.\nAs you can see from this slide, our operating income was 33% higher than the level reported for the same period of 2020.\nWe recorded lower interest expense in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to last year.\nThere are two factors.\nFirst, the rate on our loan is down as a result of the US policy to stimulate the economy.\nAnd second, we have lower borrowings due to debt repayment for 12 months of cash generation from our businesses, offset by some acquisition activity.\nFrom a tax perspective, our effective rate increased to 32% for the second quarter of 2021 as compared to 29% this time last year.\nThe main reason for the increase in the effective rate is the earn out expense on the Australian acquisition, which is not deductible for tax purposes.\nAll these factors came together in the bottom line.\nWe are reporting $5.1 million in net income as compared to $3.9 million last year, a quarter-over-quarter increase of 32%.\nFor the first six months of 2021, our sales were up 25% and gross margins, in absolute terms, were up 24%.\nAll of our main activities of US Crop, US Non-Crop and International have all contributed to this exciting performance.\nOperating expenses have increased, primarily as a result of the new businesses acquired in the final quarter of 2020, increased performance linked incentive compensation expenses, and costs associated with the volume changes, such as freight and warehouse costs.\nOverall, operating costs were up 21% as compared to net sales that increased 29%.\nAnd operating costs compared to sales improved to 34% in 2020 as compared to 35% last year.\nInterest expense has reduced by 30% as a result of cash generated over the last 12 months.\nTax expenses increased driven by financial performance.\nOverall, net increase -- net income increased by 86%.\nNow, I want to turn my attention to the balance sheet.\nAs you can see on this slide, during the second quarter of 2021, we increased cash generation from operations by 41% as compared to the same quarter of the prior year.\nFurther, you can see that working capital really didn't move very much as we got into the middle of the annual cycle.\nAnd this performance includes the expanded scope related to the businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nDuring the quarter, we continue to follow our strategy of buying attractive assets that fill white space in our portfolio.\nAccordingly, we paid a deposit of $10 million for a product acquisition, and took control of that asset at the start of the third quarter.\nAt the end of June 2020, our inventories were at $175 million as compared to $181 million this time last year.\nIf, for a moment, we exclude the impact of products and entities acquired since December of 2019, our base inventory has reduced by 11% from $177 million at that time to $158 million this year.\nSo we feel that we have controlled inventory well during this phase of the Company's annual cycle.\nOur current inventory target at the end of the financial year is $150 million.\nThat compares with $164 million at the end of 2020.\nThat target is obviously dependent on a few things, including a continued low impact from the pandemic, normal weather patterns and does not take acquisitions into account.\nWith regard to liquidity, under the terms of the credit facility agreement, the Company uses consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the agreement, to determine leverage.\nOur consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four quarters to June 30, 2021, was $59 million as compared to $52 million for the four quarters to June 30, 2020.\nAs a result, availability under the credit facility amounted to $57 million at June 30, 2021, and $49 million at the same time last year.\nAs you can see from the chart, we've been controlling debt well even as we work through the annual cycle and as we continue to invest in the business.\nAs I mentioned at the last call, our credit facility was scheduled to expire in June of 2022.\nAnd at the time of the call, we were already in discussions with our lead banker regarding a reset on the facility.\nWe needed to execute the new agreement at this time to ensure debt remained long-term.\nWe are pleased to report that we have executed that new credit agreement with a slightly larger capacity and greater improved -- generally improved covenants.\nAs a consequence, we are feeling positive about liquidity looking forward for the balance of the year -- of this year and beyond.\nFor the first half of 2021, we increased sales by 25%; gross margins by 24%; and operating expenses have reduced when compared to net sales; our interest expense is down; and net income has improved by 86%.\nFrom a balance sheet perspective, accounts receivable increased, driven by strong sales; inventories have been well controlled; working capital has been held flat during the quarter; and debt is lower than this time last year despite three acquisitions that were completed in the intervening 12 months; and finally, we have a new credit facility and availabilities improved.\nWith that, I will hand back to Eric.\nWhat I'd like to do now is go back to November of '20 at our third quarter conference call, we gave some three to five year forecast as far as where we expected to wind up in '23 and '25.\nAnd you may remember there were kind of three major tranches within our core business, we also have three, and the target with our existing products was going from a kind of $468 million to $507 million at '23 to $527 million in '25.\nSo, this kind of reflects just kind of a standard 2.5% increase on an annual basis with our existing products.\nThe second area was with regard to our new product pipeline.\nBy new product not -- this is not the acquisitions, these are products that we come together with our team and talk about the ability for us to differentiate our products by adding maybe two molecules, or even three molecules together to create kind of unique properties.\nAnd with that, we looked at growing that, adding about $37 million in three years and $109 million over the five year.\nAnd then, finally, acquisitions we've kind of basically looked at -- we've been averaging a little over $40 million a year, but I think what we are looking at was starting at the smaller level than that.\nBut overall, climbing that to about $100 million over a five-year period.\nSo again, at this point, no reason to differentiate with our initial forecast for our existing product line, but we are seeing a kind of a reset with our new products.\nSo, what we've done is we meet quarterly [Phonetic] and take a look at the projects.\nThere are projects that got canceled.\nThere are new projects that come on.\nAnd so with this, we're running about a year behind on our schedule.\nSo, looking at maybe somewhere in the '26 level, between '26 and '27, we'll be hitting target of $109 million.\nAnd then with regards to our acquisitions, again, we feel comfortable at this point that we can continue to make the target that we laid out in November of last year.\nWhen we go to our green solutions, we've got a fairly aggressive growth and I think you remember that this is about a 10% CAGAR expected globally.\nWe think we're in a much stronger position than most.\nAnd so, we have an additional -- an initial $22 million that we've got growing, by $48 million in a three-year period going to actually $118 million in growth by 2025.\nAnd so, for the first half of 2021, we're right at $17 million and expecting target to be somewhere in that $32 million to $35 million.\nSo, we're -- that's about a 50% increase from where we currently are.\nLooking at a 40% increase per annum to get to that $70 million and that $140 million, this -- we could have acquisitions that fall into that space, but certainly we've got acquisitions covered in the other into the core operations.\nSo, our team is -- feels good that this is the best forecast at this time.\nSo, why you might ask?\nWhen we pulled together our portfolio, we saw that we had 80 different biological solutions globally, which is a big number broken down into biofertilizers, microbials, biochemicals and biostimulants.\nBut since that time, we're now over 100 different solutions that we have in that space.\nAnd by this, we are not talking different geographical labels or different pack sizes, we're talking about unique differentiated products.\nThat's a big number.\nAnd within the biological space, has a very, very robust portfolio of products.\nJust a little color on this.\nWithin the US, just on the Agrinos products that we acquired, we're planning to do -- we are doing this year 14 different crop trials, and you'll see there is less than 14 crops there, but we've got kind of multiples on corn and a couple of the other products.\nIn addition, for our AMGUARD Non-Crop business, we've got nine turf trials.\nSo, when we talk about trials, that's not individual plots, those are the scope of a direction of a particular project.\nBut when you talk about actual plots, we're talking about 1,500 total test plots.\nAnd that's within our green solutions, this is just Agrinos in the US.\nWe had looked at achieving about $35 million of incremental sales by '23 and $130 million by 2025.\nOur team saying, OK, within the US, and this doesn't include international, on -- and limiting it to four crops, we're looking a little bit behind where we were, so we're kind of running a year behind this.\nAnd so let me kind of move on to kind of explanation for why that is.\nSo, there are kind of three main areas that we look to as far as this hitting its stride and it, of course, was the equipment itself needs to perform and we feel like all aspects of it, whether it's the tracking of the cartridges with refilling, the actual applications, the ability to put prescriptions in, all of those -- all of that looks well beta tested and we think we've accomplished that.\nThe second area is building that toolbox of products that our SaS customers might have, those are soil-applied solutions, they've got ability to use multiple products.\nAnd if you look at this last year, we really had our kind of core products available, which are generally linked to either kind of nematode or insect control.\nIn addition then we have a micronutrient and zinc.\nAnd so for this year, we did have several people that applied multiple and did a multiple -- three different products and did very well.\nBut a lot of growers looked at it and said, OK, let's wait on that investment until we get to the '22 season when you add more.\nSo, we haven't given you good visibility of what the future look like for our toolbox.\nBut what we're excited about in '22, and so for the first time, we'll have -- we'll be able to include both soybeans and cotton to solutions being applied by our growers.\nAnd so, up until now, it's corn growers just applied corn, but they -- corn growers generally grow soybeans as well.\nAnd in the Southern market, the corn growers in addition to soybeans also many of them are cotton.\nSo, this is a greater utilization of -- and really kind of -- for the design of what SIMPAS is about.\nAnd then as you see in '23, our portfolio grows even more.\nSo that when we get into that '23 season, we're talking about 42 different products in that platform.\nAnd this will continue to grow over time.\nAnd as we talk with growers and distribution and retailers, we'll see kind of what they really want.\nIn addition, though, we have and -- up there on the board, we have third-party products from a number of different companies that really would like us to get their products registered and improved into the SIMPAS system.\nSo highlights that we've seen here from our last year's experience here, what we're seeing generally is that our SIMPAS users are twice the size of our SmartBox users.\nGenerally, our SmartBox users kind of average treating about half of their field and it goes at full rate, but they -- if they're doing -- they got 1,000 acres and they do 500 acres of corn, they're going to apply 500 with insecticide and nematicide, but the soybeans, the other 500, aren't getting touch.\nBut what we are seeing though is that if the farmers' farms are twice the size and as such just with the three products we have, they're purchasing three -- I'm sorry, four times the amount as far as revenue.\nSo, that's what we really envision that this would be a big upswing from what we've seen in SmartBox with utilization of multiple solutions.\nAnd then finally, we've done the math and at current corn prices, all we're looking at in order to pay for a SIMPAS system over over a five-year period is just 0.5 bushel per acre increase.\nSo, it's not a major investment when you look at it that way.\nAnd I think we expect with SIMPAS solutions to be more than double-digit increases in their yield.\nAnd then, so for this '22 year, what we've done and again even with the Delta strain that we're seeing going, there have been a number of operations that we've been able to place and still expect to do where we can do field demos and actually bring in people from all over to -- and even bring in people from Brazil as well, bringing people in to see the system work and its performance.\nAnd in addition, they are being able to demonstrate the return on investment.\nAnd lastly, what we've got is our -- for our team, sales wise, we have outfitted them with, what I call, soup to nuts A-to-Z on SIMPAS.\nBasically, giving them the ability to see and be able to explain that to everybody in the chain, whether it's a third party, whether it's a distributor, how they make money, whether or not it's a retailer trying to figure out how he writes his prescription, how he gets agronomists information in there, how he shows return on investment with the growers.\nSo, what we've done is we've created this IPAD that basically covers five major areas.\nSo, there is the SIMPAS Solutions, the Cartridges, what really the SIMPAS' experience is all about, and Logistics.\nAnd so from each one of those topics, it breaks out into additional tabs.\nSo, basically there are, as I call this, A-to-Z, essentially [Phonetic] 32 different tabs for which our sales team can do and download this for our retailers.\nSo if you take a look at one of these -- we're talking about a SIMPAS Solutions.\nWhen you pull that up, then you can type -- you can hop on into any one of the products that we're currently offering.\nIn addition, then you can hit the Coming Soon, and you can see the table that I provided just before this.\nAnd then similarly, if you go to the Business Builder, a retailer can kind of get a lot of questions answered around the scope of what's the prescription like, what's the business model and can provide him with much better comfort that what he's promoting in SIMPAS is a win-win for everybody.\nSo, that's where we are with our update, and we'll continue to provide this as we go through.\nAnd I'm keep pushing the team to continue to sharpen their pencil and provide continual updates as to where we're going to be.\nSo, before we switched to questions, I have a couple -- we had a couple of questions that were brought up in this last quarter that I wanted to address here in front of everybody.\nSo, one question was about our acquisitions and what kind of return are we getting on those?\nThat we've talked about, we make acquisitions in the 5 to 6 times EBITDA, which for the industry is generally 10 to 12 times EBITDA, and we play in that space where we look for what we think are going to be nice wins for us, and we pass on those where we think it's little too expensive.\nBut you've seen by our over 50 products and five manufacturing sites and three closed delivery systems and eight businesses that we are successful and operate in that space.\nSo what we did is, we said OK, we just took a look at this '14 to '20, which is kind of the down cycle that occurred from '13 to today, and we looked at what the actual cash that we paid for these, we've got a mix set of businesses and product lines.\nAnd when we looked at the kind of incremental benefit, we took the '21 current projection, which looks pretty solid and we calculate out that incremental EBITDA and it comes out in that 5 to 6 times range and kind of return on capital employed at 10%.\nAnd if we were to take these incremental businesses and the sign addition -- current overheads that are with our existing business, if we put that proportionately on to these businesses, it kind of moves that number to in between 7 and 8 times.\nSo, a second question has to do within our working capital.\nHow do we make the determinations?\nHow do we measure?\nWhat metrics do we use?\nAnd it kind of goes into three different areas.\nSo, with the external acquisitions, we've got a very robust model that we use that takes a product with sales, cost of goods, OpEx assigned to it, any interest assigned to it, as far as the working capital, and we actually do build to an earnings per share over each of the 10 years.\nOnce we do that and then we measure kind of an internal rate of return, a payback period on the acquisition, I already mentioned the 10-year P&L, and that's the basis for how we measure making our acquisitions.\nWith return to internal investments, such as what I mentioned in the new product pipeline or SIMPAS or the green solutions, we do look at a similar concept as to what we do with acquisitions.\nWe've build out what it looks like maturity generally that's in the five to seven year period.\nLooking out kind of -- we've build out again over a period until we hit maturity, and measure what the short-term, mid-term and long-term returns are going to be.\nAnd that's how we prioritize our basic internal growth initiatives.\nAnd then, lastly, we have decisions to make about how to regionally deploy our working capital.\nAnd with regards to our existing business and, I would say, the more mature businesses have a better return on capital.\nWhen we look at our domestic business or even our Mexico business we've had for 20-some years, those tend to have higher return rates.\nBut when we go into newer territories and try to establish a beachhead and grow particularly as you get into Central and South America, the credit terms tend to be longer.\nAlthough we're trying to offset that with longer payment terms to our suppliers, generally, we have to make strategic decisions there.\nAnd let's take Brazil, for instance, we have not -- we had not participated much in Brazil, and years passed, in 2019, we acquired a business and we're building that business today, and that does not reap the same standards or the same levels of return.\nBut overall, we look at what's in the best interest of the firm on all of these for what's the short-term return, mid-term and long-term return.\nSo with that, I think, Brock, we'll open up to any questions audience might have.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We'll begin with a brief strategic overview from Randy, Mike will review the Title business, Chris will review F&G, and Tony will finish with a review of the financial highlights.\nThere is significant uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of this pandemic.\nBecause such statements are based on expectations as to future financial and operating results and are not statements of fact, actual results may differ materially from those projected.\nIt will also be available through phone replay beginning at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time today through November 12.\nIt is our goal to ensure the health and safety of our employees while maintaining the continuity and efficiency of our operations as we strive to meet our customers needs day in and day out.\nWe were able to accomplish these goals and achieve superior results in the third quarter while approximately 60% of our workforce continue to work remotely.\nFor the third quarter, we generated record adjusted pre-tax title earnings of $528 million compared with $407 million in the year ago quarter and a 21.2% adjusted pre-tax title margin compared with an 18.6% in the third quarter of 2019, and our best since the third quarter of 2003.\nWhile our financial results were robust, we also made strong gains advancing our technology initiatives, which are focused on improving the security, transparency and overall closing experience for FNF's customers.\nMike will go into this in more detail, but we believe that our unmatched national footprint and strong local market relationships provide FNF with a significant competitive advantage that we can further leverage with technology.\nTurning to our acquisition of FGL Holdings, F&G continues to execute on its growth strategy, producing excellent sales results in the quarter while maintaining pricing discipline.\nF&G's recent entrance into the bank and broker-dealer channel has surpassed expectations, and we continue to see strong momentum into the fourth quarter.\nFurthermore, F&G's investment portfolio continues to perform well in the current environment.\nChris and his team also had success during the third quarter, streamlining F&G's operations as they entered into an agreement to sell F&G Reinsurance to a Aspida Holdings, a subsidiary of Ares Management Corporation.\nThe rationale for this divestiture was largely tied to the tax advantage of this third-party offshore reinsurance platform, which was no longer available upon FNF's acquisition of F&G.\nIn connection with the transaction, F&G also entered into a mutually beneficial annuity flow reinsurance partnership.\nThe sale of F&G Reinsurance represents a terrific outcome for F&G, its clients, employees and FNF shareholders.\nThe transaction is expected to close prior to year-end.\nChris will go into more detail on F&G's third quarter results shortly.\nLooking forward, we continue to be committed to creating meaningful long-term value for our shareholders through our capital allocation strategy.\nMost recently, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per share, which reflects a fourth quarter dividend increase of 9%.\nIn conjunction with this announcement, we announced our plans for targeting $500 million in share repurchases based on market conditions over the course of the next 12 months.\nAs Randy mentioned, the third quarter was a record quarter for adjusted pre-tax title earnings and produced our best quarterly adjusted pre-tax title margin since the third quarter of 2003, as we benefited from the delayed spring selling season and sustained momentum in refinance.\nFor the third quarter, we generated adjusted pre-tax title earnings of $528 million, a 30% increase over the third quarter of 2019.\nOur adjusted pre-tax title margin was 21.2%, a 260 basis point increase over the prior year quarter.\nWe had a 40% increase in direct orders closed, driven by an 87% increase in daily refinance orders closed and 8% increase in daily purchase orders closed offset by a 16% decrease in total commercial orders closed.\nTotal commercial revenue was $216 million compared with the year ago quarter of $301 million due to the 16% decrease in closed orders and a 14% decline in total commercial fee per file.\nFor the third quarter, total orders opened averaged 13,200 per day, with July at 13,300; August at 13,500; and September at 13,000.\nFor October, total orders opened were over 11,800 per day as we continue to see a strong recovery in purchase activity and continued strength in the refinance market.\nDaily purchase orders opened were up 12% in the quarter versus the prior year.\nFor October, daily purchase orders opened were up 15% versus the prior year.\nRefinance orders opened increased by 83% on a daily basis versus the third quarter of 2019.\nFor October, daily refinance orders opened were up 71% versus the prior year.\nLastly, total commercial orders opened increased by 4% over the third quarter of 2019.\nWe continue to see steady improvement in commercial open orders per day during the quarter, with the third quarter up 32% sequentially from the second quarter.\nFor October, total commercial orders opened per day were up 1% over October 2019.\nOur third quarter was also marked by notable achievements as we continue to invest in our digital technology initiatives as Randy noted.\nWe have been investing in technology and innovation designed to further enhance our existing systems and improve our customers' experience working with FNF.\nOne example is our StartSafe initiative, which reached a significant milestone during the third quarter.\nWe passed 800,000 digital opening packages delivered to buyers and sellers of residential purchase and refinance transactions and are encouraged that 60% of all packages were completed.\nThis high completion rate is evidence that consumers are ready to adopt a new real estate experience and a new way of interacting with title companies.\nGiven the widespread pandemic and our current virtual environment, now is the time to accelerate this adoption.\nOur focus will continue to be centered on utilizing technology to drive efficiencies across the title life cycle, which will not only better meet the needs of real estate agents and lenders, but also improve their productivity while reducing fraud and improving security.\nLooking forward, we expect the fourth quarter to moderate seasonally from what was an unusually strong third quarter.\nWhile it remains difficult to forecast the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, we will continue to aggressively manage our expense structure orders while investing in technology to further reduce costs and increase market share.\nOur growth momentum continues here at F&G coming off the second quarter where we had record sales of fixed indexed annuities.\nWe again had strong sales in the third quarter while maintaining our pricing discipline.\nTotal retail sales of $1.1 billion in the third quarter were up 34% from the prior year, and core fixed index annuity or FIA sales were $815 million, up 38% from prior year.\nWe continue to see meaningful runway ahead of us as we continue to take market share in our primary independent agent channel, and we're gaining traction in new channels.\nIn late June, we successfully launched our expansion into the financial institutions channel with one of the largest independent broker dealers in the country, and our efforts are already bearing fruit.\nIn the third quarter, we generated $189 million in new annuity sales in this channel, and we believe we're just now scratching the surface of opportunities in the bank and broker dealer channels.\nWith solid sales results, we grew average assets under management, or AAUM, to $27 billion, driven by approximately $400 million of net new business flows in the period.\nRegarding spread results, total product net investment spread was 261 basis points in the third quarter, and FIA net investment spread was 347 basis points.\nOur spread results are above historical trends and demonstrate our continued pricing discipline to achieve targeted spread.\nThe solid spread result translated to adjusted net earnings of $74 million for the quarter.\nMost importantly, our investment portfolio continues to perform very well.\nAs of September 30, the portfolio's net unrealized gain position grew to $1.2 billion, increasing by approximately $600 million in the quarter.\nCredit quality within the portfolio also remained strong.\nFor the nine-month period ended September 30, we have taken credit-related impairments, which we view as true economic losses of only $17 million or six basis points of the total portfolio.\nThis is well below our product pricing assumption and demonstrates the portfolio is performing as expected.\nWe also remain confident in our capital position.\nWe came into the pandemic with a strong balance sheet, allowing us to effectively weather economic impacts while continuing to grow the business.\nYear-to-date credit impairments have resulted in a modest 5-point decrease in our RBC ratio.\nAdditionally, rating downgrades have resulted in a manageable 14-point decline year-to-date and we would expect this ratings migration to reverse as markets recover over the long term.\nEven with the anticipated cumulative effect of credit migrations and potential rating downgrades, we expect to end the year with a strong RBC ratio at or above our 400% target.\nSo in summary, our sales engine is firing on all cylinders.\nWe continue to consistently generate and manage stable net investment spread and earnings, and we're confident in our investment portfolio and capital position.\nWe generated $3 billion in total revenue in the third quarter.\nWith the Title segment producing approximately $2.5 billion, F&G producing $442 million and the Corporate segment generating $50 million.\nThird quarter net earnings were $378 million, which include net recognized gains of $73 million versus net recognized gains of $4 million in the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to mark-to-market accounting treatment of equity and preferred stock securities, whether these securities were disposed of in the quarter or continue to be held in our investment portfolio.\nExcluding net recognized gains, our total revenue was $2.9 billion as compared with $2.2 billion in the third quarter of 2019.\nAdjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $435 million or $1.48 per diluted share.\nThe Title segment contributed $391 million, F&G contributed $74 million, and the Corporate and Other segment had an adjusted net loss of $30 million.\nExcluding net recognized losses of $3 million, our Title segment generated $2.5 billion in total revenue for the third quarter compared with $2.2 billion in the third quarter of 2019.\nDirect premiums increased by 11% versus the third quarter of 2019.\nAgency revenue grew by 19%, and escrow title related and other fees increased by 14% versus the prior year.\nPersonnel costs increased by 7% and other operating expenses decreased by 2%.\nAll in, the Title business generated a 21.2% adjusted pre-tax title margin, a 260 basis point increase versus the third quarter of 2019.\nInterest income in the Title and Corporate segments of $31 million declined $26 million as compared with the prior year quarter due to the reduction of short-term interest rates on our corporate cash balances in our 1031 exchange business.\nIn September, we closed an issuance of $600 million of 2.45% senior notes due March 15, 2031.\nThe net proceeds have been used to repay all outstanding indebtedness under the one-year term loan agreement that we signed in April, which allowed us to secure the additional financing needed to close the acquisition of F&G.\nF&F debt outstanding was $2.7 billion on September 30 for a debt-to-total capital ratio of 27.1%.\nOur title claims paid of $50 million were $27 million lower than our provision of $77 million for the quarter.\nThe carried title reserve for claim losses is currently $55 million or 3.7% above the external actuary central estimate.\nWe continue to provide for title claims at 4.5% of total title premiums.\nFinally, our title investment portfolio totaled $5.3 billion at September 30.\nIncluded in the $5.3 billion are fixed maturity and preferred securities of $2.5 billion with an average duration of three years and an average rating of A2.\nEquity securities of $600 million, short-term and other investments of $300 million and cash of $1.9 billion.\nWe ended the quarter with just under $1 billion in cash and short-term liquid investments at the holding company level.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:This is Debbie Young, director of investor relations for SCI.\nWith that out of the way, let me pass it on now to our chairman and CEO, Tom Ryan.\nWe hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy.\nThen I'll offer some commentary on our 2021 outlook, with the understanding that there remains substantial uncertainty surrounding these effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could change guidance significantly.\nHowever, before I begin, I would like to say a few words about this past year.\n2020 has certainly been one of the most uncertain and challenging periods that any of us can remember.\nAs I reflect back on the last 10 months, I can say with certainty that our results are a testament to our team's incredible hard work and to the resilience of our underlying business.\nI'm extremely proud of our entire SCI team for going above and beyond the call of duty in 2020.\nIn this difficult period, we stayed relentlessly focused on what we do best, helping our client families gain closure and healing through the process of grieving, remembrance and celebration.\nThe health, safety, and well-being of our SCI family was a top priority.\nAnd not only were we able to avoid any layoffs, mandatory furloughs or reductions in pay as a result of the impact of COVID-19, we were able to recognize the incredible efforts of our frontline associates with hero bonuses and provide special bonuses for every associate that does not participate in our annual incentive plan.\nIn 2020, our services were needed more than ever, and I am proud that we were able to perform significantly increased number of services without any disruptions to our business, which highlights the power of our scale.\nOne thing that became clear throughout 2020 is that our fundamental business has not changed.\nWe did not see a wholesale shift in the consumer preferences, and our cremation remains stable.\nAlthough we were greatly restricted in our ability to have large gatherings in 2020, we heard loud and clear from our consumers that they still have a desire to memorialize and to celebrate the lives of their loved ones.\nVirtual arrangements, live streaming of services, outdoor services, drive-through visitations, radio transmitted graveside services, and many more unique memorialization and celebration of life ideas are now a normal part of what we do.\nThe success and acceleration of these enhanced service offerings have highlighted the importance of innovation in our industry.\nWe will continue to invest in technologies that enhance how we interact with consumers digitally, providing a better customer experience -- contact to the arrangement conference and beyond while also enhancing efficiencies in our operations.\nAs the year unfolded, actions we took in response to in-person meetings limitations yielded noncustomer-facing efficiencies.\nWe more effectively utilize our labor force using the virtual training, our customer relationship management system and other technology tools instead of incurring travel-related costs.\nWe also drove down our lead cost per sale by accelerating the growth of digital leads and making significant improvements to our direct mill program to drive record growth.\nAll of the many learnings from this year will make us a better company going forward.\nAs a result, we're positioned to enter the post pandemic world as a more agile and efficient company.\nNow let's shift and provide you with some color about the core.\nexperienced in late November and December.\nJust to give you a little color on the cadence of the quarter, our same-store funeral volumes were up 7% in October, then grew to 13% in November and an unprecedented 31% in December, which is the highest monthly growth rate we experienced all year.\nAnd as a result of this surge late in the quarter, we finished the fourth quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.13 compared to $0.60 in the prior year, well above the range we provided to you in October.\nBoth funeral and cemetery segments had margin improvement of over 600 basis points, driven by double-digit top line percentage growth applied against a more efficient cost structure.\nWe also benefited from a lower share count and a lower tax rate.\nLet's now take a look at funeral operations in the quarter.\nTotal comparable funeral revenues grew approximately $49 million or 10% during the quarter.\nBoth core and nonfuneral home channels performed very well and were slightly offset by lower general agency revenues caused by a decline in insurance funded preneed funeral sales production.\nCore revenues grew $53 million, driven by a 17% increase in the number of cases, partially offset by a 3.4% decline in the funeral sales average.\nThe predominant reason for the increase in services performed was due to the direct impact of COVID-19, and, to a lesser extent, to an increase in non-COVID related deaths such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, drug overdose and suicide, perhaps a consequence of a lack of access to healthcare during 2020.\nWords cannot convey the level of our appreciation and respect I have for our frontline team.\nThe tremendous care you provided record numbers of our client families during such a stressful time can only be described as heroic.\nThe decline in the funeral sales average of 3.4% was due to the local jurisdictions reimposing restrictions on gatherings, given the surge in deaths of November and December.\nThis resulted in a decline in a number of cases with the service.\nThe cremation mix shift was a moderate 120 basis points and had a minimal impact on the quarter-over-quarter funeral average decline.\nPreneed funeral sales production for the quarter was down 1.6% versus the prior year, which is just a significant improvement of our results posted in earlier quarters this year.\nWhile we saw record growth in production from our digital and direct mail leads, we continued to be hampered by a decline in preplanning seminars due to local restrictions and consumer reluctance on in-person gatherings in restaurants.\nFrom a profit perspective, funeral gross profit increase of $45 million, and the gross profit percentage increased 640 basis points to 27.5%, realizing a 92% incremental margin on our revenue growth.\nGrowth in our high incremental margin core business more than offset slight declines in our lower-margin revenue streams.\nWe also continue to benefit by the efficient management of labor hours with fewer and smaller services as well as the reductions in noncustomer-facing costs and certain marketing and promotional expenses.\nNow shifting to cemetery.\nComparable cemetery revenue increased $64 million or 18% in the fourth quarter.\nAtneed cemetery revenue accounted for $25 million of the growth, driven by more burials performed due to some effects of COVID-19.\nRecognized preneed revenues accounted for $35 million of growth, mainly due to higher preneed cemetery sales production during the quarter.\nPreneed cemetery sales production grew $40 million or 16% in the fourth quarter, driven by increased lead sources associated with the higher atneed services and burials performed.\nThe preponderance of the growth, $25 million or about 60%, was from a 12% increase in velocity with a number of contracts sold.\nThe remaining growth of about $15 million was primarily due to large sales activity.\nWe continue to see this more productive and efficient sales force with better utilization of our customer relationship management system and improved conversion rates from our direct mail and digital lead campaigns.\nConsumer reception to having a preplanning discussion remains very high.\nI want to take a moment to recognize the tremendous efforts of our sales team.\nFor the full year 2020, they wrote more than $1 billion in cemetery preneed sales production.\nThis is our new company record, so hats off to the entire sales organization.\nCemetery gross profits in the quarter grew by approximately $49 million, and the gross profit percentage increased 680 basis points to 39%.\nGrowth in revenues and strategic cost reductions combined to drive margins beyond normalized incremental levels.\nFor the full year 2020, we reported an adjusted earnings per share of $2.91, a 53% increase over 2019 in a one-of-a-kind year.\nObviously, the speed and efficacy of the vaccine rollout could have a significant impact on the spread of the virus, hospitalizations and, ultimately, on the number of deaths.\nThis, combined with the willingness of the consumer to transact on a preneed basis may have a material effect on our 2021 results.\nThere is no doubt that in 2020, we serviced deaths that were pulled forward from a future year.\nWhile we know that the timing of the pull forward is impossible to accurately predict, we have developed models are based on data from the IHME and the CBC, which incorporate historical trends and current COVID-related deaths by age group as well as by comorbidity factors in determining what future years are impacted by accelerated deaths and by how much.\nBased on all these assumptions, we also believe adjusted earnings per share in 2021 will likely range between $2.50 and $2.90 per share.\nWe have provided a wider than normal range based on the uncertainties surrounding the impact of COVID-19.\nLet's take a deeper dive into our assumptions for the 2021 earnings per share guidance.\nWe are modeling funeral volume to be down versus 2020, but mid single-digit percentage is higher than the 2019 levels due to the expected impact on funeral volumes in the first few months of 2021 associated with COVID-19.\nWe anticipate double-digit year-over-year percentage increases through March.\nThen while we expect the continued impact from COVID-19 deaths, we predict comparable volumes to trend lower for the rest of the year as compared to the very active final nine months of 2020.\nWe expect the funeral average to be down low single-digit percentages in January and February and begin to see favorable trends as we compare back to the early months of the COVID outbreak in 2020.\nWhile we anticipate growth year over year, we still believe we will struggle to get back to 2019 levels as we now believe that many people will continue to be reluctant to gather in large groups.\nWe expect preneed funeral sales production to begin to rebound in the back half of the year and for the full year to grow in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range.\nCemetery atneed revenues should see significant year-over-year growth in the first quarter, followed by a comparable decline in the last three quarters as we face a significant hurdle from the 2020 results.\nFor this year, we expect cemetery atneed revenue to be down versus 2020 but still show significant growth over 2019 pre-COVID levels.\nCemetery preneed sales production grew an unprecedented rate in the back half of 2020, and we believe that momentum will carry over into the first half of 2021.\nWe expect double-digit percentage growth for the first four months of the year before confronting challenging year-over-year comparisons beginning in May.\nFor the full year, we anticipate preneed cemetery sales production are to be down in the mid single-digit percentage range versus 2020 but still be delivering solid growth as compared to our 2019 levels.\nSo in closing, in spite of experiencing the most challenging environment, our team continued to deliver.\nWe rose to meet challenges never faced by our company before, and you have been an extraordinary example of commitment, professionalism and agility.\nIt's an honor to work with such great people.\nAs we look ahead, I'm extremely optimistic about our future.\nWhile we do not anticipate the impact from COVID to completely go away, it is our belief that we should see a more muted effect on our results for 2022.\nTherefore, we expect a decline in case volume and atneed cemetery revenues and, therefore, on the associated earnings and cash flow from the pull-forward effects of 2020 and 2021.\nHowever, this knowledge that we gained from this awful COVID experience is anticipated to produce a more competitive and profitable operating platform in the years to come.\nTherefore, we predict an impressive earnings-per-share growth for 2023 approaching $3 per share, resulting from a combination of enhanced market share and a leaner infrastructure, leveraging technology and a more efficient sales structure.\nAs the pull forward impact wanes and the baby boomers begin to enter their late 70s, we expect a further acceleration of earnings growth.\nWith our eyes on the longer term, we are now also continuing to invest in technology and new service offerings that allow us to remain relevant with our consumers, enhance digital clients experience and more efficiently and effectively serve our customers.\nAnd like I've done many times over the past few quarters, I'm going to start by providing you with an update on the strength of our financial position that has supported us through these very volatile times.\nI will then move on to address our cash flow results during the fourth quarter as well as the full year of 2020, followed by capital deployment activities for the year.\nAnd then I'll end by providing some details of our outlook for 2021.\nBut I think more importantly than any of that, before we begin, when we are reporting our 2019 earnings almost exactly a year ago today, I don't think any of us could have anticipated what we would be facing in 2020.\nDuring the year, our frontline associates helped our communities deal with this rapidly moving virus with unparalleled poise and dignity, particularly earlier on in the year when there was more speculation than there were facts available about coronavirus.\nBut even to this day, teams across our network are coming together and sacrificing their personal time, being away from home, all to support their colleagues and their broader communities as well who are managing in current COVID hotspots.\nNow I'll shift to the financial update.\nSo while we entered the pandemic, anchored by a strong financial position and a favorable debt profile, we continue to be very well positioned with a significant amount of liquidity of roughly $670 million at the end of the year, consisting approximately $230 million of cash on hand plus $440 million available on our long-term bank credit facility.\nOn the higher EBITDA resulting from the strong Q4 results we're talking about today, our leverage remains low at 3.19x at the end of the year.\nAnd as we look beyond the impacts of this pandemic, we still intend to manage leverage in a range of 3.5 to four times net debt to EBITDA.\nSo let's move to cash flow, which has been resilient for us throughout 2020.\nCash flow in the fourth quarter marked a much stronger-than-expected finish to the year, supported by the earnings outperformance that Tom just mentioned, associated with the surge of COVID-related deaths particularly in late November and in December.\nWe generated operating cash flow of $245 million during the quarter, representing an increase of $88 million or 56% over the prior year.\nThis increase is primarily related to the growth in cash earnings in the quarter as well as the decrease in cash interest payments of about $28 million, predominantly as a result of recent debt refinancing transactions.\nAlso remember, we continue to benefit from the deferral of our payroll tax payments as allowed under the CARES Act, which benefited the quarter by about $13 million and for the full year by about $41 million.\nThese positive inflows were partially offset by $25 million of higher cash tax payments on the higher earnings as well as a net use of preneed working capital, which we have seen all year on the growth in cemetery preneed property sales sold on an installment basis.\nAnd as we step back and look at the full year, we have generated over $800 million in operating cash flow, representing an increase of $170 million over the prior year.\nSo let's talk about how we deployed this free cash flow.\nDuring the quarter, we had a very robust capital program, deploying nearly $325 million of capital to reinvest in and grow our businesses as well as return value to our shareholders.\nSo regarding the breakdown, we invested $56 million in our businesses through maintenance and the cemetery development capital spend, which was about $2 million more than the prior year quarter but in line with our expectations.\nFull-year spend was approximately $185 million, which represents a 9% decline from the prior year as we curtailed or deferred certain expenditures during the very early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, which we expect to make up in 2021, as I'll address later in my remarks.\nDuring the quarter, we deployed about $35 million toward acquisitions, which was a nice pickup in activity at the end of the year.\nFor the full-year 2020, we deployed just over $100 million in both acquisitions and growth capex for construction of new funeral homes.\nThen finally, in the quarter, we returned nearly $225 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\nWith our strong liquidity and cash flow as a backdrop, along with our favorable leverage profile, we took the opportunity to deploy a very healthy amount of capital to share repurchases in 2020.\nIn the fourth quarter, we bought back about 2% of our outstanding shares, bringing the full year reduction in outstanding shares to about 6%.\nNow let's shift to our outlook for 2021 and in terms of cash flow and capital deployment.\nTom just gave you some color on the ever-evolving pandemic, making it challenging to forecast with great precision where our results will land in 2021.\nThere are a few items that I'd like to highlight when thinking about cash flow from ops in 2021.\nWe will incur three full quarters of what I would consider regular payroll taxes of about $40 million, which we're able to defer in 2020 as allowed under the CARES Act.\nAdditionally, we will also be required to pay half or about $20 million of our deferred payroll taxes in the third quarter of 2021, and the remainder will be due in 2022.\nThese two items then collectively create a $60 million impact to cash flow in 2021 when you compare it to 2020 associated with payroll taxes.\nFederal cash tax payments and state tax payments together are also anticipated to be about $25 million higher than 2020 at about $160 million in '21.\nThis increase is mostly related to the timing of cash tax payments associated with our stronger-than-expected Q4 2020 financial results that will be paid in early 2021.\nAnd from an effective tax rate standpoint, we continue to model in the range of 24% to 25% in '21.\nSo moving on to some thoughts about capital deployment as we move forward.\nOur expectation for maintenance and cemetery development capital spending in '21 is $235 million to $255 million, which is about $40 million higher than our pre-COVID level spend as we proceed with certain projects deferred from last year.\nIn addition to these recurring capital expenditures of $245 million at the midpoint, we also expect to deploy $50 million to $100 million toward acquisitions and roughly $50 million to $60 million in new funeral home construction opportunities, which, together, drive low to mid-teen aftertax internal rates of return, well in excess of our cost of capital.\nAnd so with those remarks in closing, 2020 was by far the most difficult backdrop we faced in a very long time.\nFortunately, we went into it with a superior balance sheet, and it stayed strong for the duration.\nDespite everything that has occurred, 2020 has been an extremely successful year for us, while managing through many unforeseen and unexpected challenges.\nSummary:

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Joining me virtually today, as we are all working from home, are Mary Hall, our CFO; Robert Traub, our General Counsel; and Shane Hostetter, our Head of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer.\nWe have slides for our conference call.\nYou can find them in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.\nA great deal has changed in the world with the COVID-19 pandemic since our last quarter's conference call.\nFor us, our top priority is to protect the health and safety of our employees and our customers, while ensuring our business continuity to meet our customers' needs.\nAll of our 34 plants around the world are operating and we are meeting our customers' needs.\nI am very proud of what the Quaker Houghton team has done to continuing servicing our customers as well as continuing with our integration, which has not missed a beat.\nIn our last conference call, we knew China was being impacted by COVID-19, which really started impacting us in February.\nBut in the second half of March, we began experiencing impacts everywhere around the world.\nAnd toward the end of March, many of our customers had significantly reduced production or shut down altogether, especially in the automotive sector.\nOverall, we estimate that COVID-19 impacted our sales by about 4% in the first quarter.\nWe were also impacted by Boeing temporary halting the 737 MAX production, which impacted sales by approximately 1%.\nThese were the two main drivers of our volume decline in our pro forma comparisons.\nWe have gone through a customer-by-customer analysis to see what our gains and losses and market share were at the customer and product levels.\nThis analysis continues to show that we took share in the marketplace as we estimate total organic volume growth due to net share gains was approximately 2% in the first quarter of this year versus the first quarter of last year.\nConcerning gross margins, you may recall from our comments in the past that the combined gross margins of Quaker Houghton were expected to be about 1% lower than stand-alone Quaker.\nIn the first quarter comparison, you can see this difference is only 0.5 percentage point.\nThis is indicative of our raw material savings from our integration starting to come through.\nWhile crude was also decreasing during this period, we do not see any material benefits from this as of yet, as our raw material costs were relatively stable.\nSo overall, the first quarter results were somewhat better than expected when considering the COVID-19 impact.\nOur first quarter pro forma adjusted EBITDA grew 10% versus last year due to our integration savings, the impact of the Norman Hay acquisition last quarter, and the additional cost control measures we put in place to combat the global effect of COVID-19 on our volumes.\nThis event has been similar in many ways to what we went through in late 2008.\nJust like then, we took fast action to save cost in numerous ways.\nEssentially, all discretionary expenses have been eliminated.\nWe stopped new hires, executive pay cuts were implemented, some positions were furloughed, and our planned capital expenditures have been cut by over 30%.\nAnd very importantly, we reviewed our integration's synergy plans in light of this situation and took additional actions as well as accelerated other synergies where possible.\nWe have now increased our guidance on synergy achievement.\nFor 2020, our new estimate is $53 million of cost synergies achieved versus our previous estimate of $35 million.\nAnd the total synergies that we estimate will be achieved by 2022 have been raised from $60 million to $75 million.\nOne question we have been asked about is if this pandemic has impacted our integration.\nAnd the answer is that it really hasn't negatively impacted our integration in any way, especially in the timing.\nI give our people a tremendous amount of credit for being able to do plant shutdowns, product manufacturing site transfers, and ERP implementations during these challenging work conditions that we're currently operating under.\nFor instance, we successfully implemented our [Indecipherable] at two sites recently and has done such all remotely due to the current working conditions.\nOur two years of planning are paying off and we're fortunate that we had this integration execution ongoing during this period of time to help us offset the volume impacts that we're experiencing.\nEven with these additional cost synergies, we have not done anything that will impact our business execution or strategic initiatives, including our ability to service our customers well, continue to grow above the market into the future, and further develop and execute on our strategic platform.\nLooking forward to the rest of the year, we expect the second quarter to be the most challenging quarter.\nMany of our customers has significantly reduced production or shut down.\nFor example, our April revenues were down in the order of 30%.\nWe do anticipate that in the second half of the year, we will begin to see a gradual sequential improvement in business through the rest of the year.\nHowever, we do not expect our business to return to the levels expected pre-COVID-19 by the end of the year.\nGiven how clouded the economic environment is to the COVID- 19, we will not be providing specific guidance at this time.\nHowever, in order to try to give some direction for the remainder of the year, I can say that we're currently see that the second quarter's adjusted EBITDA could be down by nearly half of the first quarter's adjusted EBITDA.\nFor the full year, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to be more than $200 million.\nAnd we do not expect to have any liquidity or bank covenant issues.\nOverall, our higher expected synergies, additional cost saving actions, the improvement in our gross margins, and the expected release in cash via working capital reductions are expected to continue to help us during this period of time when our volumes are down.\nAnd if we look forward to 2021 and 2022, I continue to be optimistic in our future, and I do expect us to achieve significant increases in our adjusted EBITDA, as we complete our integration cost synergies, continue to take share in the marketplace, and benefit from a projected gradual rebound in demand in our end markets over this period of time.\nI am so proud of how our team has performed in servicing our customers, meeting their needs, and successfully continuing on with our execution of our integration, which is so critical for us this year.\nPeople are everything in our business and by far our most valuable asset, and ensuring their safety and well-being is and will continue to be a priority for us.\nI'm very happy with our Quaker Houghton team and what we have and will be able to accomplish for our customers, both now and going forward.\nI will now hand it over to Mary so that she can review some of the key financials for you for the quarter.\nThese are available on our website.\nPlease also note that we updated the risk factors in yesterday's first quarter 10-Q to address COVID-19-related issues and these risk factors should be reviewed along with those in our 2019 Form 10-K.\nReconciliations are provided in the appendix of this investor deck.\nWe followed a similar review format for this deck as the one we used for our last couple of calls post Combination, where our comparison periods show actual and non-GAAP results as well as pro forma sales and pro forma adjusted EBITDA as if we've been combined with Houghton throughout the periods presented.\nSo please see Slides 6 and 7 and also the chart on Slide 8, while I review some highlights.\nWhen we had our Q4 earnings call in early March, we noted that we continued to face strong headwinds from global automotive and general industrial weakness that surfaced the latter half of 2019, as well as a stronger U.S. dollar.\nCOVID-19 at that point was generally considered a China issue.\nAs March unfolded, COVID-19 became a global pandemic as Mike noted, significantly exacerbating the auto and industrial weakness already seen.\nSo, while our actual sales are up significantly to $378.6 million in Q1, this is due to the inclusion of Houghton and Norman Hay.\nOn a pro forma basis, as if Houghton was also in Q1 of 2019, net sales were down 3%, which reflects negative impacts from lower volumes and foreign exchange, partially offset by additional sales from Norman Hay.\nDespite the challenges we faced in Q1, the Company generated good cash flow and adjusted EBITDA, which was up 10% on a pro forma basis and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.38 was well above consensus of $1.\nGross margin of 35.4% for Q1 was down from 35.9% Q1 of last year, which is in line with our expectations and communication.\nWe previously noted that somewhat lower gross margins in the legacy Houghton business due in part to the accounting treatment for Fluidcare, the chemical management business.\nIf Houghton was included in the prior year, we estimate that our prior year gross margin would have been approximately 1% lower.\nThis indicates improvement in the current quarter's gross margin, which largely reflects the procurement savings related to the combination that Mike mentioned.\nIn the table on Slide 8, you can see a reported operating loss of $12.4 million in the GAAP section but in non-GAAP operating income of $36 million in the middle section.\nThe main non-GAAP adjustments are combination and restructuring charges totaling about $10 million and a $38 million non-cash impairment charge in Q1 to reflect the writedown of our Houghton trademark indefinite-lived intangible assets to their estimated fair value.\nThese were recorded at fair value at close of the Combination on August 1, 2019 and tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2019.\nHowever, given the recent changes in business conditions as a result of COVID-19, we determined that these assets needed to be tested again and confirm their carrying value exceeded their current estimated fair value by approximately $38 million.\nAs we noted in our 10-Q, as business conditions evolve, we will continue to reevaluate all our long-lived assets as necessary.\nIn non-operating items, we reported a non-cash charge of $22.7 million for final settlement and termination of legacy Quaker's U.S. defined benefit pension plan, a process we previously disclosed.\nThe offset is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income/loss account in the equity section of the balance sheet.\nConcurrent with this termination, the Company paid approximately $1.8 million, subject to final adjustment.\nOur reported effective tax rate was a benefit of 31.1% in Q1 2020 versus an expense of 26.8% in Q1 of last year.\nAdjusting for all one-time charges and benefits, we estimate our ETR would have been 22% this Q1 and 24% in Q1 last year.\nWe currently expect our full-year ETR, excluding all one-time charges and benefits, to be between 22% and 24%.\nOur non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.38 is down from $1.41 in Q1 last year, due primarily to the additional shares issued in the Combination, partially offset by the inclusion of Houghton and Norman Hay.\nSequentially, non-GAAP earnings per share is up from $1.34 in Q4 of 2019, which included Houghton and Norman Hay and the additional shares.\nOn Slide 9, we show the trend in pro forma trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA, which reached $239 million as of Q1, up from $234 million at the end of 2019.\nThis increase reflects the strong adjusted EBITDA performance in Q1 of $60 million, up 10% from pro forma Q1 last year of $55 million due to the inclusion of Norman Hay and the benefits of cost savings realized in the quarter from the Combination.\nOn Slide 10, we provide an update on our leverage and liquidity.\nPlease note that we drew down most of the available liquidity on our revolving credit facility in March in an abundance of caution as COVID-19 went global and created significant uncertainty and volatility in all global markets.\nThis drop was leverage neutral as the additional cash in our balance sheet is a direct offset to our debt.\nIn fact, our reported net debt to adjusted EBITDA declined to 3.40 times from our year-end level of 3.47 times as a result of good cash flow and the cost savings mentioned earlier.\nOur bank covenant ratio also improved from about 2.94 at year-end to 2.76 at the end of this quarter per the definitions in our borrowing agreement.\nWe expect to continue to be in compliance with our bank covenants and we have strong liquidity to support these uncertain times.\nOur capital allocation decisions reflect these priorities, including an approximately 30% reduction in previously planned capex.\nAs you know, we have a very asset-light business model and we also expect a release of working capital at sales decline to generate good cash flow similar to the global crisis in 2008/2009.\nOur cost of debt continues to benefit from declining interest rates and was estimated at approximately 2.4% at March 31 versus about 3% at year-end.\nAs Mike mentioned, we're encouraged by the additional cost synergies realized to date and expected to be achieved overall.\nThe increase in expected realized synergies this year from $35 million to $53 million in addition to the cost reduction actions we have taken to address the global crisis and our history of generating good cash flow in downturn all give us confidence in our ability to weather this storm.\nSummary:

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Let's begin with the summary of the results on Page 3.\nWe expect Q2 to be challenging and in preparation, we reinforced our cost program earlier in Q1, so we were in some sense prepared for the battle.\nWe ended the quarter with a comprehensive set of actions to manage through the turbulent times and focused on what we can control, our operations, costs and importantly safety of our employees.\nFrom an operational point of view, we are not out of the woods yet, but a significant majority of our facilities are up and running moving into Q3 which is positive to operating leverage as compared to this quarter.\nTop line trends are very much in line with our expectations entering the quarter.\nRevenue declined 16% organically and bookings declined 21%.\nTrends have improved in the quarter and we saw a material sequential improvement in June.\nWe still carry a strong backlog across all segments and that increases our confidence for the second half.\nMargin performance for the quarter was acceptable considering the state of business activity in April and May.\nAfter profitability gains in Q1 on lower revenue, we targeted 25% to 30% decremental margin for the full year.\nThat puts us on track to exceed our initial full-year target.\nIn addition to the tight cost controls and variable costs, we took further structural cost actions in the quarter as part of our business realignment activities, which will benefit us in the second half.\nAlong with our cost actions, our proactive working capital management resulted in cash flow improvement in both absolute and conversion terms.\nWe generated $78 million more in free cash flow than the comparable quarter last year.\nAs a result of our first half performance and our solid order backlog, we are reinstating our annual adjusted earnings per share guidance to $5.00 to $5.25 per share.\nTo be clear, even with a strong backlog and positive recent trends, we still see demand uncertainty in our markets and are not back to business as usual, but our teams have proven their ability to manage costs and operations and we are prepared to operate and achieve results in a wide variety of scenarios that may be in store for the second half.\nLet's take a look at the segment performance on Slide 4.\nEngineered Products at a tough quarter particularly in the shortest cycle on capex-levered businesses like vehicle aftermarket, industrial automation and industrial winches.\nWaste hauling and aerospace & defense were more resilient shipping against their strong backlogs.\nLower volumes led to margin decline versus a very strong margin that this segment posted in the comparable quarter last year, and we have taken structural cost actions in this segment, which will support its margin in the second half along with reconvering volumes.\nFueling Solutions saw continued strong activity in North America driven by demand of EMV compliance solutions.\nWhereas, Europe and Asia declined due to COVID related production and supply chain interruptions as well as budget cuts and deferrals in response to the decline in oil prices.\nIncreased margin performance was commendable with 80 basis point increase on a better mix pricing and ongoing productivity actions.\nThe sales decline in Imaging & Identification was driven predominantly a steep decline in our digital textile printing business which we expected in the significant dislocation in global apparel and fashion markets due to the pandemic.\nMarking & coding -- marking & coding showed continued resilience on strong demand for consumables and fast-moving consumer goods solutions.\nThis is our highest gross margin segment.\nSo decremental margins are challenging and require heavy lifting on cost containment, where marking & coding business did a good job, achieving a flat margin year-over-year and we have taken proactive actions to manage the cost base in the digital printing business.\nAs a result of these actions and a pickup in textiles consumable volumes, we expect performance to improve in the second half.\nPumps & Process Solutions demonstrated the resilience we expected.\nIt's top line decline the least among our segments despite a challenging comparable from last year.\nStrong growth -- strong growth continued in biopharma and medical applications with colder products posting record growth in the quarter.\nThis was offset by a moderate decline in industrial applications and material slowing and energy markets.\nOur Plastics Processing business revenue declined in the quarter as a result of shipment timing, we expect to -- for it to do well in the second half of a strong backlog.\nAs you can see this segment continued to deliver a solid margin performance posting improving margin on declining revenue for the second quarter in a row, we expect this segment to deliver flat or improved absolute profit for the full year.\nRefrigeration & Food Equipment declined as food retailers continued to delay construction remodels due to peak utilization and the commercial food service market remains severely impacted by restaurant and school closures in the United States.\nOur heat exchanger business showed resilience particularly in non-HVAC applications.\nOn the margin side, negative absorption on lower volumes drove the margin decline.\nIn Q2, we took structural cost actions in this segment, which paired with ongoing productivity and automation initiatives yield in a materially improved margin performance in the month of June.\nWe expect these benefits to continue accruing in the second half and expect this segment to deliver year-over-year growth in absolute earnings and margin in the second half of this year.\nI'll pass it to Brad here.\nLet's go to Slide 5.\nOn the top is the revenue bridge.\nFX continued to be a meaningful headwind in Q2, reducing top line by 1% or $24 million.\nWe expect FX to be less of a headwind in the second half of the year.\nAcquisitions were effectively offset by dispositions in the quarter.\nThe revenue breakdown by geography reflects relatively more resilient trends in North America and Asia versus the more significant impacts across Europe and several emerging economies like India, Brazil and Mexico.\nThe US, our largest market declined 10% organically, with four segments posting organic declines, partially offset by growth in retail fueling.\nAll of Asia declined 14%.\nChina representing approximately half of our business in Asia, showed early signs of stabilization posting an 11% year-over-year decline in the second quarter, an improvement compared to a 36% decline in Q1.\nImaging & Identification and Engineered Products were up in China while Fueling Solutions declined due to the expiration of the underground equipment replacement mandate and also slower demand from the local national oil companies.\nEurope was down 19% on organic declines in all five segments.\nMoving to the bottom of the page.\nBookings were down 21% organically on declines across all five segments, but there are reasons for cautious optimism as we enter the second half.\nFirst, as presented in the box on the bottom, June bookings saw a significant improvement from the May trough, with all five segments posting double-digit month-over-month sequential growth.\nSecond, our backlog is up 8% compared to this time last year, driven by our longer cycle businesses and the previously mentioned intra-quarter improvement in our shorter cycle businesses.\nWe believe we are well positioned for the second half of the year.\nLet's move to the bridges on Slide 6.\nI'll refrain from going into too much detail on the chart, but the adverse top line trend drove EBIT declines, although our cost containment and productivity initiatives help offset overall margins to hold up at an acceptable decremental.\nIn the quarter, we delivered on the $50 million annual cost reduction program, which focuses on IT footprint and back office efficiency, and took additional restructuring charges that add to the expected benefits.\nWe also executed well in the quarter on additional cost takeout to offset the under-absorbed -- under-absorption of fixed cost previously estimated at $35 million to $40 million.\nSome of these recent initiatives will continue supporting margins in the second half and into 2021.\nGoing to the bottom chart.\nAdjusted earnings declined mainly due to lower segment earnings, partially offset by lower interest expense and lower taxes on lower earnings.\nThe effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits is approximately 21.5% for the quarter, unchanged from the first quarter.\nDiscrete tax benefits in the quarter were approximately $2 million, slightly lower than the prior year's second quarter.\nRightsizing and other costs were $17 million in the quarter or $13 million after-tax relating to several new permanent cost containment initiatives that we pulled forward into 2020.\nNow moving to Slide 7.\nWe are pleased with the cash generation in the first half of the year, with year-to-date free cash flow of $269 million, a $126 million or 90% increase over last year.\nOur teams have done a good job managing capital more effectively in this uncertain environment.\nWe have seen strong collections on accounts receivables.\nWe continue to operate with inventories of supportive of our backlog in order trends.\nQ2 also benefited from an approximately $40 million deferral of US tax payments into the second half of the year.\nCapital expenditures were $79 million for the first six months of the year, a $12 million decline versus the comparable period last year.\nMost of our in-flight growth and productivity capital projects were completed in the second quarter.\nSo we expect to see continued year-over-year capital expenditure declines in the second half.\nLastly now on Slide 8.\nDover's financial position remains strong.\nWe have been targeting a prudent capital structure and our leverage of 2.2 times EBITDA places us comfortably in the investment grade rating with a safety -- with a margin of safety.\nSecond, we are operating with approximately $1.6 billion of current liquidity, which consists of $650 million of cash and $1 billion of unused revolver capacity.\nWhen commercial paper markets were fractured at the outset of the pandemic in March, we drew $500 million on our revolver out of an abundance of caution.\nMarkets have since stabilized and we reestablished our commercial paper program and fully repaid the revolver.\nIn Q2, we also secured a new incremental $450 million revolver facility to further bolster our liquidity position.\nAs of June, we have no drawn funds on either revolver.\nOur prudent capital structure, access to liquidity and strong cash flow have allowed us to largely maintain our capital allocation posture.\nWe can -- we have deployed nearly a $250 million on accretive acquisitions so far this year and we continue to pursue attractive acquisitions.\nFinally, we are lifting our recent suspension on share repurchase and we will opportunistically buyback stock should the market conditions dictate.\nI'm on Page 9, which is an updated view of the demand outlook by business we introduced last quarter.\nHere we are trying to provide you with directional estimates of how we expect segments to perform in the second half relative to the second quarter in lieu of full year revenue guidance.\nI'll caveat that all of this is based on current reads of the markets and is subject to change as the situation remains fluid.\nFirst in Engineered Products, shorter cycle businesses such as vehicle service and industrial automation have shown improvement late in the quarter and the trends are improving globally.\nAdditionally aerospace and defense continues operating from a large backlog of defense program orders.\nWaste handling may see some headwinds driven by tightening of industry capex and municipal finances after several years of strong growth performance.\nBookings have slowed in late in Q2 as customers pause their capital spending to manage liquidity.\nWe are watching the dynamics closely, but we have started addressing the cost base in this business proactively.\nFueling Solutions is a tale of two cities, North America, approximately half the business remain resilient both on EMV conversion and also willingness of non-integrated retailers to continue investing in their asset base.\nIn Europe and Asia, integrated oil companies represent a larger share of the network and capital budget cuts resulting from oil price declines are having a more negative impact on investment in the retail network, plus recall we are facing a $50 million revenue headwind in China this year from the expiration of the underground equipment replacement mandate, despite some of the top line headwinds with robust margin accretion to date, we expect segment to hold its comparable full-year profit line despite a decreasing top line.\nImaging & Identification outlook is improving.\nOur service and maintenance interventions resumed in market and coding as travel restrictions were lifted, and we are seeing a resulting pickup demand for printers.\nOur integration activities with Systech acquisition are proceeding as planned.\nWe started seeing some green shoots on the digital textile printing side, but we are forecasting a difficult year as global textiles will take time to recover.\nIn Pumps & Process Solutions is expected to show improved trajectory from here.\nFirst, our plastics and polymer businesses will ship against it's significant backlog in the second half.\nBiopharma and medical is expected to continue its impressive growth.\nIndustrial pumps, a shorter cycle business is expected to start gradually recovering.\nA material portion of demand in our pumps and precision components business is levered to maintenance and repair and aftermarket.\nThe oil and gas mid and downstream markets served primarily by precision components business continues to slow as a result of deferral of capex and refurbishment spending in refining and pipelined operators.\nIn Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we believe the worst is behind us for this segment.\nBookings were relatively resilient for this segment and we have improved in June, resulting in a robust backlog that we are prepared to execute against.\nWe also saw growth is restarting the construction and remodel projects resulting in us being fully booked for refrigeration cases into Q4.\nAdditionally Belvac is scheduled to begin shipments against it's significant backlog, which will be accretive to segment margins.\nRecovery in volumes along with cost actions we've undertaken should result in positive margin and profit trend through the remainder of the year resulting in the segment posting a second half comparable profit increase.\nLet's go to Slide 10.\nAs a result of the fluidity of the COVID situation, we are cautious about guiding top line trajectory at this time, but everything points to sequential improvement from here across most markets.\nThe proactive cost management stance we took in Q1 and continued in Q2 has positioned us from a margin performance standpoint, and today we are improving our target for annual decrementals margin to 20% to 25%.\nWe continue work in the pipeline of restructuring actions, including those targeting benefits in 2021, and we are positioned well to deliver on our margin objectives.\nWe remain confident in the cash flow capacity of this portfolio and reiterating a conversion target above 100% of adjusted net earnings and a cash flow margin target of 10% to 12% compared to 8% to 12% target we had last year.\nI'll conclude with the following.\nWe have reinitiated earnings per share guidance as a result of our confidence in our ability to manage costs in an uncertain demand environment.\nWe have a good team, and they understand the playbook.\nHaving said that, make no mistake, we are on the front foot from here on driving revenue growth, both organically and inorganically.\nWe have strong operating companies and a strong balance sheet with which to support them.\nThis is not the time to hunker down and wait for the storm to pass, so we are equally focused on market share gains, new product development initiatives as we are on our main pillars of synergy extraction from our portfolio, all of which we continue to fund, despite the market challenges.\nInorganically we have available capital to deploy and I fully expect to be active in the second half.\nAnd with that let's go to Q&A.\nSummary: ",
    "output": "qtrly revenue of $1.5 billion, a decline of 17%.\nin 2020, dover expects to generate adjusted earnings per share in range of $5.00 to $5.25.\nlooking forward, demand outlook for remainder of year remains uncertain.\nremain positioned well for second half with a higher backlog compared to this time last year.\nas we expected, activity declined across a majority of markets we serve.\ndover -demand conditions in textile printing, foodservice, below-ground fueling, food retail and automotive aftermarket were particularly challenged.\n"

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:We are happy to be with you as we turned the calendar to 2021, and I sincerely hope that everyone is staying healthy and safe.\nJoining me on the call today are company's CIO, Greg Zimmerman; and company's CFO, Mark Peterson.\nFor the overview, clearly, 2020 was a year unlike any other we've experienced since the company was founded in 1997.\nEarly in the onset of the pandemic, we recognized the need to fortify the company's balance sheet to maintain sufficient liquidity for the long term.\nKey among early actions was to defer an anticipated gaming venue investment of approximately 1 billion, along with deferring other uncommitted investment spending of approximately 600 million.\nAdditionally, we accessed our unsecured credit facility as a precautionary measure and suspended our monthly dividend to common shareholders.\nWe determined that these actions were prudent due to the extremely challenging environment in which our tenants have been operating.\nAs we speak today, our liquidity remains in a strong position with cash on hand in excess of 500 million.\nThis large reserve of cash reflects the fact that we are to return to normalcy.\nHowever, as we announced in our quarterly disclosure on January 7, we generated positive cash flow in the fourth quarter and anticipate this trend to continue.\nThe recent paydown of our credit facility balance reflects this positive momentum and demonstrates our increased confidence.\nThroughout 2020, our team was focused on the many challenges brought on by the pandemic, including monitoring tenant performance, assisting in reopening plans and collaborating to develop plans that ensure long-term stability and success for both our tenants and EPR Properties.\nWe have seen the success of this strategy with our nontheater tenants, where approximately 94% are open and rent collections have improved materially.\nWhile our properties are still impacted by locally mandated closures and capacity restraints, performance and customer demand continued to improve, which we believe demonstrates our final thesis of people's desire for experiences.\nAs Greg will discuss in more detail, our theater tenants are still primarily challenged with limited film product, which should subside as we progress through 2021.\nHowever, early indications from around the world indicate that when product is available and flowing, there is robust consumer demand.\nOverall, we are pleased with both the progress and trajectory of our recovery as it is reflected in a continued increase in cash collections as we entered 2021.\nThroughout the year, we made continuous progress.\nAnd as I've stated before, I'm very proud of how our team has responded to the substantial challenges that they have faced.\nLooking ahead, as we look forward in 2021, we're encouraged by the accelerated rollout of vaccines.\nwill continue to be a phased process, yet we also believe that as a society, we are more than ready to return to a sense of normalcy.\nWe also continue to be encouraged by the resiliency displayed by many of our tenants and anticipate that theaters will follow a similar pattern when they open more widely and key titles are consistently released.\nAs the country begins the recovery process, we look forward to getting back on the path to growth.\nThis process requires continued improvement and stabilization of our cash collections, which will allow us to exit our existing debt covenant waivers.\nUpon achieving that goal, our focus will turn to reinstituting our common dividend and reinitiating our investment spending program.\nThe timing of achieving these milestones will be entirely dependent on a number of variables, including an effective vaccine deployment.\nHowever, as today's results indicate, our progress has measurably improved in the early months of 2021, and we are optimistic that our goals are achievable during the second half of 2021.\nAt the end of the first quarter, our total investments were approximately 6.5 billion with 356 properties in service and 94.2% occupied.\nDuring the quarter, our investment spending was 22.8 million and was entirely in our experiential portfolio, comprising build-to-suit development and redevelopment projects that were committed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFor the year, our investment spending was 85.1 million.\nOur experiential portfolio comprises 281 properties with 43 operators, is 93.8% occupied and accounts for 91% of our total investments or approximately 5.9 billion of the total 6.5 billion.\nWe have three properties under development.\nOur education portfolio comprises 75 properties with 12 operators, and at the end of the quarter was 100% occupied.\nAs the vaccine rollout accelerates, people are looking for safe and easily accessible ways to get out of their homes and come back together with friends.\nOur operators are working hard to offer entertainment experiences which create memories in safe environments.\nWe're seeing that as consumers become increasingly confident in safety measures and restrictions are reduced, they're returning to our properties.\nNow I'll update you on the operating status of our tenants, our deferral agreements and our rent payment time lines.\n60% of our theaters were open as of February 22nd.\nAs we have previously noted, Cineworld made the decision to close all of its U.S., U.K. and Ireland theaters because of the lack of tentpole films from Hollywood.\nToday, none of our 57 Regal theaters are open.\nTheaters continue to face significant headwinds from the lack of tentpole films and capacity and concessions restrictions implemented by state and local governments.\nThese challenges will slowly begin to abate during vaccination ramp up and with loosening restrictions throughout the country.\nBased on the current vaccine -- vaccination cadence, we believe major film releases and box office will begin to accelerate in the second half of 2021.\nThe 2021 film slate was strong before the pandemic.\nBecause a number of films scheduled for 2020 pushed to 2021, we believe the projected film slate will provide a strong content cadence for theaters to ramp up as vaccinations increase, normalcy returns and consumers feel more and more comfortable returning to the movies.\n2021 tentpoles currently scheduled for release beginning in May include Black Widow, the Fast & Furious 9, Top Gun: Maverick, Jungle Cruise, Death on the Nile, A Quiet Place Part II, Dune, No Time to Die, Ghostbusters: Afterlife and MI7.\nBox office strength will continue into 2022 with Jurassic World: Dominion pushing to mid-'22.\nAs demonstrated by consumer behavior in Asia and the Hollywood release schedule, we do not see evidence of structural changes in theater going habits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn Asia, the consumer bounced back quickly.\nChina's box office continues to perform solidly even in weeks without products.\nDuring the Lunar New Year holiday, Detective Chinatown three opened with the highest grossing opening day, $163 million and opening weekend, $398 million, in history outpacing Avengers: Endgame.\nOver the Lunar New Year holiday, Detective Chinatown three and Hi, Mom each grossed over $620 million.\nIn January, Demon Slayer became Japan's highest grossing movie ever.\nFurther, as provided by the continued recovery and resilience of our other experiential tenants, which I'll discuss in a moment, customers still want to engage in entertaining, affordable out-of-home experiences.\nOnce they know the operator is open and become comfortable with new protocols, we see that they are returning to experiential assets.\nWe are confident the same will hold true for theaters as vaccinations ramp up and normalcy returns.\nAs we have said throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the studio's decision to push the vast majority of tentpoles to theatrical release in 2020 and 2022 is the best evidence of their commitment to the exhibition economic model.\nThe economics are straightforward.\nTentpole films cost well over $100 million to produce so the studios need theatrical release to maximize revenue for major pictures.\nOf the projected top 30 box office films scheduled for release beginning in February 2020, only six films were moved to nontheatrical release and one other, Wonder Woman 1984, was released simultaneously to theaters and HBO Max.\nIn uniquely trying times, studios took the opportunity to test alternative delivery channels and for those with streaming services to add subscribers.\nEven when in parts of the country, people could not leave their homes and theaters were either completely shut down or open with capacity and concessions restrictions, these releases had limited success.\nAfter a couple of major tests with Wonder Woman 1984's simultaneous theatrical and HBO Max release and the release of Mulan, Trolls World Tour and Soul to premium video-on-demand or streaming video-on-demand, the studios withheld the vast majority of top films from digital-only distribution to preserve theatrical release in 2021.\nOn its recent earnings call, Disney reaffirmed it will release Black Widow theatrically, subject to opening cadence and consumer sentiment about going back to the movies, proving that all things being equal, Disney continues to see the enormous power of theatrical release for major motion pictures.\nLikewise, Paramount recently publicly confirmed that Top Gun: Maverick will be released theatrically in July, again, subject to vaccination rollout.\nIn summary, despite the unique challenges presented by COVID-19, Hollywood continues to recognize that consumers still prefer to see movies on the big screen and don't embrace PVOD as a viable value alternative.\nThe decision to push theatrical release dates for the vast majority of major films, even after a unique period of experimentation, demonstrates that theatrical exhibition remains the preferred medium for consumers and the best format to deliver returns to the studios for major releases.\nI also want to update you on our other major customer groups.\nApproximately 94% of our nontheater operators are open or for seasonal businesses are closed in the normal course.\nThese businesses continue operating with appropriate safety protocols to comply with state and local requirements.\nPerformance remains fluid, depending on the impact of COVID-19 in each locale.\nHowever, at a high level, our operators are resilient and performance has generally exceeded their expectations in the face of this lengthy pandemic.\nFurthermore, we are seeing the benefit of owning drive-to value-oriented destinations.\nI'll now provide a brief update on each of our property types.\nThe ski season is under way.\nAll of our ski resorts are open, and we're pleased with the results to date.\nAll of our Topgolf locations, all of our Andretti carting locations and all of our family entertainment centers are open.\nAll but one of our U.S. gyms are open.\nAbout 61% of our attractions had opened for normal operations prior to normal seasonal shutdowns.\nAs we have indicated in past calls, a few of our attractions missed all or part of the season due to governmental health and sanitation measures and the financial feasibility of operating with reduced occupancy in a truncated season.\nAll of our cultural operators are open.\nExcept for the Kartrite Resort & Indoor Waterpark, all of our experiential lodging assets are open.\nKartrite remains subject to New York state's phased reopening plans, and we are planning for a Kartrite reopening in summer 2021.\nResorts World Catskills is open.\nFinally, turning to our education portfolio, all of our early education centers are open.\nWe are seeing a steady increase in demand monthly as COVID restrictions ease and parents return to work.\nAll of our private schools remain open, utilizing a combination of in-person, online and hybrid instruction models.\nVarying state and local requirements continue to influence each school's instruction model.\nVolatility in reopening plans for public school systems has benefited private schools, and we believe parents continue to see the value of private school instruction.\nWe continued progress in executing our strategy to reduce our overall education portfolio.\nIn December, we sold six private schools and four early childhood education centers for net proceeds of $201 million.\nThese assets were sold at cash and GAAP cap rates based on base rents of 8.1% and 9%, respectively.\nNote that over the past two years, we also collected average annual percentage rents of 6.3 million from three of the private schools based on total tuition levels.\nHowever, these percentage rents were scheduled to expire over the next few years.\nOverall, the assets included in this sale were an excellent investment for us with an unlevered internal rate of return of 13% over the life of our ownership.\nAdditionally, we sold four experiential properties and two vacant land parcels for net proceeds of around 23 million.\nTotal disposition proceeds in the quarter were 224 million.\nDuring the quarter, we terminated all seven of our AMC transition leases and took back the properties.\nWe are executing our plans for each location.\nIn December, we completed the sale of one of the transition lease properties for an industrial use.\nWe are in various stages of active negotiation to sell another 5.\nWe anticipate these will result in various uses, including industrial, multifamily, office, retail and theater reuse.\nWe also took over management of two of our theaters.\nOne of the transition lease properties in Columbus, Ohio; and the former Goodrich Savoy in Champaign, Illinois.\nWe have retained a well-respected experienced theater management company to operate both locations on our behalf and both are open for business.\nI want to take a moment to update you on the status of our cash collections and deferral agreements.\nCash collections have continued to improve in conjunction with reopenings.\nTenants and borrowers paid 46% of pre-COVID contractual cash revenue for the fourth quarter versus 29% and 43% in the second and third quarters, respectively.\nAs Mark will go over, we expect first quarter cash collections to significantly exceed fourth-quarter collections.\nIn January, we collected 66%.\nAnd in February, collections are currently 64%.\nIn each case, of pre-COVID contractual cash revenue.\nDuring the quarter, due to the continuing impact from COVID-19, we reserved the outstanding principal loan balance of 6.1 million and the unfunded commitment of 12.9 million for one of our attractions operators.\nCustomers representing approximately 95% of our pre-COVID contractual cash revenue, which includes each of our top 20 customers, are either paying their pre-COVID contract rent or interest or have deferral agreement in place.\nIn those deferral agreements, we have granted approximately 5% of permanent rent and interest payment reductions.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that additional permanent rent or interest payment reductions or other term modifications will not occur in future periods in light of the continued adverse effect of the pandemic and financial condition of our customers, particularly with the ongoing uncertainty in the theater industry.\nAs we've discussed, our exhibition partners have faced and continue to face serious headwinds.\nIt goes without saying that the lack of product and reopening restrictions have weighed heavily on box office performance since early 2020 and continue to dramatically impact projected box office performance.\nOur goal has been to work diligently with all of our customers to structure appropriate deferral and repayment agreements to facilitate their ability to reopen efficiently and help ensure their long term health, while also protecting our position and rights as landlord.\nWe intended to help them through a period where they have significantly reduced or no cash flow, allowing them to ramp back up to stabilize cash flow.\nWe individually tailored each deal, considering the variables impacting each business and improved our position through various arrangements.\nThese agreements are generally structured with rent and mortgage payments commencing and ramping up through 2021 and in some cases, after 2021.\nRepayment of deferred amounts typically commences in 2021 and depending on the deferred amount to allow our customers some breathing room, the deferral repayment period generally extends beyond 2021.\nThe vast majority of our arrangements provide for repayment of all deferred rent.\nAs we have stated previously, in a few cases, we have provided rent concessions, but we've generally received equal or greater value through additional lease term, additional collateral or other benefits.\nIn most cases, our customers have paid and continue to pay third-party expenses, including ground rent, taxes and insurance.\nMark will provide additional color on the revenue recognition and cash collections implications for the first quarter of 2021.\nToday, I'll discuss our financial performance for the quarter and year, which continued to be impacted by the disruption caused by COVID-19, provide an update on our balance sheet and strong liquidity position and close with some estimated forward information.\nFFO as adjusted for the quarter was $0.18 per share versus $1.26 in the prior year, and AFFO for the quarter was $0.23 per share compared to $1.25 in the prior year.\nNote that the operating results for the prior year included the public charter school portfolio, which was sold during the fourth quarter of 2019 and are included in discontinued operations.\nTotal revenue from continuing operations for the quarter was 93.4 million versus 170.3 million in the prior year.\nThis decrease was due to the accounting for the various agreements with customers as a result of the COVID-19 impact similar to what we discussed last quarter.\nDuring the quarter, we wrote off 2.4 million in receivables related to putting two additional customers on a cash basis of accounting, bringing the total for the year for such write-offs to 65.1 million, including 38 million of straight-line rent.\nAdditionally, due primarily to the Kartrite Resort & Indoor Waterpark remaining closed due to COVID-19 restrictions, we had lower other income and lower other expense of 7.4 million and 8.7 million, respectively.\nPercentage rents for the quarter totaled 3 million versus 6.4 million in the prior year.\nThis decrease related primarily to the closure of properties due to COVID-19 restrictions.\nI would like to point out, as I did last quarter, that we are defining percentage rents here as amounts due above fixed rent and not payments in lieu of fixed rent based on a percentage of revenue.\nTherefore, AMC and other theater tenants that were in the fourth quarter making cash payments based on a percentage of their revenue against contractual rents are recognized as minimum rent.\nProperty operating expense of 16.4 million for the quarter was up slightly versus prior year, but was up about 2.5 million from the last quarter due to increased vacancy, including the terminated AMC leases that Greg described.\nTransaction costs were $0.8 million for the quarter compared to 5.8 million in the prior year.\nThe decrease is related primarily to lower costs incurred related to the transfer of early education properties to Crème de la Crème.\nInterest expense increased by 7.9 million from prior year to 42.8 million.\nThis increase was primarily due to the precautionary measure we took last March to draw 750 million on our 1 billion revolving credit facility, which provided us with additional liquidity during this uncertain time.\nDue to stronger collections and significant liquidity, including 224 million in net proceeds received from property dispositions in the fourth quarter, we reduced the outstanding balance by 160 million to 590 million at year-end.\nSubsequent to year-end, we used a portion of our cash on hand to further reduce this balance by 500 million, resulting in a current balance of 90 million on our revolver.\nAs I noted last quarter, we are also paying higher rates of interest on our bank credit facilities, as well as our private placement notes during the covenant relief period.\nThe next slide lays out fourth-quarter results reflecting the impact of the receivable write-offs I discussed earlier.\nThese write-offs totaled $0.03 per share for the quarter and $0.86 per share for the year.\nDuring the quarter, we had other items that were excluded from FFO as adjusted.\nGain on sale of real estate was 49.9 million and gain on insurance recovery, which is included in other income, was 0.8 million.\nWe recognized a total of 22.8 million in impairment charges because of shortening in our expected hold periods on four theaters as we expect to sell each of these properties.\nIn addition, we recognized net credit loss expense of 20.3 million that was due primarily to fully reserving the outstanding principal balance and unfunded commitment related to notes receivable from one borrower, as Greg discussed.\nWe also recognized severance expense of 2.9 million due to the retirement of an executive as previously announced.\nOur results for the full-year 2020 were clearly impacted by COVID-19 as FFO as adjusted per share was $1.43 versus $5.44 in the prior year, and AFFO per share was $1.89 versus $5.44 in the prior year.\nNote again that the prior period results included the public charter school portfolio that was sold during 2019 and those results, including 24.1 million in termination fees, are included in discontinued operations.\nAs discussed last quarter, we have classified our tenants and borrowers into categories based on how we accounted for them in the context of our annualized pre-COVID contractual cash revenue level of 624 million, which consists of cash rent, including tenant reimbursements and percentage rents and interest payments.\nThis annualized cash revenue excludes properties under -- properties operated under a TRS structure.\nThe changes of these classifications from last quarter were not very significant, but include a new category to reflect sold properties, most of which was previously classified under the first category titled, no payment deferral.\nThere was also a slight increase in the new vacancies category, primarily as a result of the terminated AMC leases.\nNow let's move to our balance sheet and capital markets activities.\nOur debt to gross assets was 40% on a book basis at December 31.\nAt year-end, we had total outstanding debt of 3.7 billion, of which 3.1 billion is fixed rate debt or debt that has been fixed through interest rate swaps with a blended coupon of approximately 4.6%.\nAdditionally, our weighted average debt maturity is approximately five years, and we have no scheduled debt maturities until 2022 when only our revolving credit facility matures.\nAs previously announced, due to the continued pressure on near-term quarterly results, as a result of the impact of COVID-19, during the quarter, we further amended our bank credit facilities and private placement notes to obtain an extension through the end of 2021, subject to certain conditions, of the waivers of the same four covenants temporarily suspended in June.\nThis amendment provides us additional time and flexibility to work with our customers during this period of uncertainty.\nNote that we can elect to get out of the covenant relief period early, subject to certain conditions, and there was no change in the interest rate schedules from that agreed to previously.\nWe believe we have sufficient liquidity to see us through the market disruption caused by COVID-19.\nWe had over 1 billion of cash on hand at year-end.\nCash flow from operations was positive for the fourth quarter at approximately 6 million.\nAnd we expect our operating cash flow to be substantially higher as we move into 2021.\nThis positive trajectory and our substantial liquidity gave us confidence in our decision, subsequent to year-end, to pay down our 1 billion line of credit to 90 million, while still maintaining about 500 million of cash on hand.\nIn addition, subsequent to year-end, we reduced the balance outstanding on our private placement notes by 23.8 million to 316.2 million as a result of certain property sales and in accordance with the recent amendment to those notes.\nThere was no prepayment penalty on this paydown.\nAs previously announced, due to the uncertainties created by the COVID-19 disruption, we are not providing forward earnings guidance.\nHowever, we would like to update you on the expected ranges of contractual cash revenue that we expect to recognize in our financial statements for the first quarter of 2021, as well as our expected collections for the same period.\nBecause there have been changes in the portfolio due to permanent rent reductions, acquisitions and dispositions, changes in the occupancy levels and other items, we are moving away from reporting against pre-COVID contractual cash revenue to current contractual cash revenue for purposes of our guidance and future reporting.\nThis slide shows a reconciliation of those amounts, which begins with pre-COVID contractual cash revenue, including percentage rents, for both the quarter and annualized of 156 million and 624 million, respectively, and then subtracts out pre-COVID percentage rents of 4 million and 15 million, respectively.\nFrom there, we make the additional adjustments to the portfolio I just described, to come to the current contractual cash revenue amount of 136 million for the first quarter and 545 million annualized.\nNote that both of these amounts are before the impact of any temporary abatements or deferrals.\nAccordingly, the expected range we expect to recognize in Q1 of '21 is 98 million to 105 million or 72 to 77% of such contractual cash revenue.\nAdditionally, the expected range we expect to collect in Q1 of 2021 is 87 million to 93 million or 64 to 68% of such contractual cash revenue.\nDifferences from the full amount of contractual cash revenue relate to deferrals granted and the associated accounting, as well as abatements.\nNo one is happier than EPR to put 2020 behind us, and we look forward like many consumers to begin again enjoying the experiences that our properties offer.\nSummary: ",
    "output": "qtrly affo per diluted common share $0.23.\nqtrly total revenue from continuing operations$93.4 million versus $170.3 million.\napproximately 94% of company's non-theatre and 60% of company's theatre locations were open for business as of february 23, 2021.\n"

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:A copy of these materials can be found in the Investors section at sysco.com.\nTo ensure that we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question and one follow-up.\nI hope that you and your families are staying safe and healthy.\nI will provide an update on our business transformation and I'll share some highlights of our preparation for the pending business environment recovery.\nAs we have discussed during prior calls, Sysco has taken swift and decisive action throughout the pandemic to help our customers succeed during a time of disruption.\nWe have carefully managed our associate productivity, inventory productivity, and business investments.\nTo that end, we initiated a bold business transformation to strategically transform our company for long-term success.\nI am pleased to confirm that our business transformation remains on track and we are confident that the strategic initiatives will enable profitable future growth and will differentiate Sysco from our competitors.\nThe COVID environment has placed substantial restrictions upon the customers we serve in the food-away-from-home sector and has disrupted our marketplace.\nIn light of those realities, we are pleased with the financial results that we delivered in the first half of fiscal 2021, and for the second quarter, we performed generally in line with our expectations adjusted for the environment.\nWhile our second quarter financial results were down compared to prior year, we delivered a profitable quarter despite 23% decline in our top line sales and funded investments to enable our transformation.\nOur customers experienced increasingly restrictive conditions on their operations during the second quarter, which were most notable in December when restaurant traffic and sales declined.\nAdditionally, our international segment has been hard hit due to tougher restrictions in the countries in which we operate.\nAt Sysco, we are not taking the restrictions on customers as a gravity issue.\nWe are doing more than ever before to help our customers navigate this challenging environment.\nI am pleased to report that during the second quarter Sysco gained overall market share versus the rest of the industry, reflecting the early progress of our transformation and the success we're having in winning new business, We continue to win meaningful business in the national account space and signed an incremental $200 million of net new business in the quarter, which totals more than $1.5 billion of net new contracted business since the start of the pandemic.\nAdditionally, throughout the second quarter, we began making investments in preparation for the business recovery that we believe will begin in calendar year 2021.\nThose investments will increase in the third fiscal quarter and Aaron will speak more to this in a moment.\nExamples of investments during the second quarter include investments in our customers, in our people, in our working capital, and in our technology.\nI'd like to highlight some examples of each of these purposeful choices.\nInvestments in our customers, including our new Restaurants Rising campaign, which makes it easier for restaurants to succeed and strengthen their business for the future.\nMost notably, we announced in November that we are eliminating minimum delivery requirements for regularly scheduled delivery days, which provides operators significant flexibility in managing their business and makes it easier to order what they need when they need it.\nIn addition, we are not eliminating delivery service days during the second wave of COVID, a practice we know select competition is currently doing.\nWe see the light at the end of the tunnel and as such, we are prioritizing customer service.\nA little incremental expense right now is a small price to pay for customer loyalty and partnership.\nOur sales consultants are leveraging the restaurants rising program to retain current customers and help Sysco attract and serve new ones.\nIn addition to the no order minimums commitment, Sysco's sales consultants are assisting their customers with setting up touchless menus, optimizing delivery and takeout operations, and helping with marketing programs to create awareness of our customers' operations, just to name a few of our value-added services.\nI'm proud to report that our Net Promoter Score increased by more than 1,000 basis points in the quarter due in large part to the connections with our customers generated by the Restaurants Rising program.\nThe NPS increase was our largest quarterly increase in our company's history.\nImportantly, as you can see on page seven in our slides, the incremental closure rate of Sysco's customers is 50% below the industry average.\nAnd lastly, we onboarded more new local customers in Q2 than in any single quarter in the last five years.\nIn addition to investing in our customers, we are making investments in our people.\nWe are intentionally retaining drivers despite the volume decline in December to ensure we have them available for our pending volume recovery.\nDrivers are in short supply across the country and while this investment will drive some incremental transportation expense in the short term, over the long term, it will help ensure that Sysco is able to maximize our share gains during the upcoming business recovery.\nAs you know, we made changes to our sales organization and sales compensation during the summer.\nOur associate retention has improved compared to historical retention rates and our improved retention will help with sales productivity metrics in the future.\nWe are beginning to make investments in working capital to position the right products in the right locations in preparation for the upcoming business recovery.\nSysco has the broadest inventory assortment in the industry.\nOur ability to ship product on time and in full during the upcoming period of volume recovery is a core element of what makes Sysco the strongest broadline distributor in the industry.\nWe have the financial strength and capacity to invest in products and in inventory, while other foodservice distributors may struggle with sufficient cash flow to make similar investments in the coming quarters.\nWe are also offering payment plans in partnership with our customers to ensure their continuity.\nLastly, we are making strategic investments in our technology to improve the customer experience.\nThis includes our Sysco Shop technology, our new pricing software and improvements we are making in our supply chain systems.\nSysco's ability to invest in our customers, our people, our inventory and our technology while delivering a profitable quarter during this pandemic is a testament to the strength of our balance sheet and our leadership team.\nI'd like to turn now to providing an update on our business transformation.\nFirst, as we have shared previously, we are focused on advancing our customer-facing digital tools to improve the customers' experience with Sysco and drive incremental sales.\nPriority number one is improving our mobile ordering platform Sysco Shop.\nNotably, we are now onboarding new customers in less than 24 hours, a step change improvement.\nThe number of customer orders placed through Sysco Shop continues to meaningfully increase throughout the quarter.\nAdditionally, our new pricing software is now live in our first test region.\nWe are learning a lot through this regional pilot and we remain on track to roll out the pricing system across the country.\nThe goal of this effort is to improve pricing transparency with our customers and drive incremental sales in gross profit growth by optimizing prices at the customer item level.\nAdditionally, by automating customer level pricing, we will free up time for our valued sales consultants to spend with customers on value-added activities, such as menu design, Sysco brand penetration, and other drivers of sales and margin.\nSecond, we are improving our go-to-market selling strategy by transforming our sales process.\nThrough our sales transformation, we have an improved more customer-centric organizational structure.\nOur sales transformation is progressing well and the team-based selling approach is gaining traction.\nWe have created and built new specialist selling positions.\nWe have implemented a sales quarterback position that helps guide the collective sales teams across a given geography.\nAs I mentioned on our last call, we have launched our first cuisine segment go-to-market selling strategy and we are seeing initial signs of success with that customer segment through incremental market share gains.\nWe will roll out this program to additional cuisine segments in calendar 2021.\nLastly, Sysco completed the regionalization of our field leadership structure at the start of our second quarter.\nI am pleased to report that our new regional presidents are in place and are finding quick wins to improve our business.\nThe average tenure of our market and regional leaders is over 20 years and these experienced and talented leaders are highly capable of driving top performance within Sysco.\nExamples of quick wins include optimizing our inventory assortment across multiple physical sites and optimizing the servicing of key customers by ensuring the most efficient physical location services each customer location.\nTo be a great company, you need to have a world-class leadership team.\nI am pleased that during the quarter, we made important progress in strengthening our leadership team.\nAaron Alt joined Sysco as our Chief Financial Officer.\nAaron is a proven finance leader with over 20 years of experience in foodservice and retail leadership positions.\nHe has a track record of transformation and value creation at large organizations in multiple industries.\nAdditionally, Tom Peck has joined Sysco as Chief Information and Digital Officer.\nTom has experience leading enterprise information technology strategy, services, operations risk, and cybersecurity for large global enterprises.\nIn his most recent role, he worked great global B2B distributor in the electronics industry, experience that is directly applicable to the transformational journey at Sysco.\nAdditionally, Tim Orting has officially started his position leading our International division.\nTim will be based in our London offices and will be responsible for driving profitable growth and operational excellence across our international geographies.\nWith Tim joining Sysco, I was able to reduce the number of my direct reports by four, which allows me to focus more of my time and energy on managing the strategy development and execution of the company.\nJoel Grade has begun his new role leading business development and is actively engaged in identifying new sources of growth for Sysco.\nI am pleased to say that the transition of Sysco's leadership team is now complete.\nWe have a strong management team that balances Sysco and foodservice industry expertise with best-in-class experience from other industries.\nOur new leaders join a talented and experienced Sysco leadership team.\nGreg Bertrand, the leader of our U.S. business has over 35 years of industry experience and 30 years specific with Sysco.\nGreg's expertise and steady hand in running our largest business during the COVID disruption has been invaluable.\nI appreciate his leadership and the strong impact he has on our results.\nGreat leadership teams work as a team on a common agenda.\nOur transformation strategy has galvanized this leadership team around a common purpose, and I am honored to work with them to set the standard for foodservice distribution for many years to come.\nI report to you today with strong confidence that a pending business recovery sits before us.\nAs vaccine administration mixed progress across the globe, the restrictions currently placed upon our customers will begin to ease.\nWe can see in our performance data that once those restrictions ease, consumers are ready and willing to eat away from home.\nAt Sysco, we are working to maximize our opportunity to recover faster than the industry.\nWe have an opportunity to gain market share, given our financial strength and our compelling business transformation.\nWe are prepared to do more than any other foodservice distributor in the industry to ensure the success of our customers.\nAnd our customer success will generate business growth for Sysco.\nOur industry-leading sales force has been inspired by the Restaurants Rising campaign to support our customers at levels higher than any point in our proud history.\nOur warehouse and delivery associates are the best in the business, working hard every day to ensure we ship to our customers what they want when they need it.\nI am proud of their dedication during this challenging operating time.\nAt Sysco, our customers are an inspiration to us and we will show them just as much determination and how we serve them.\nI am really excited to be at Sysco.\nBefore I joined Sysco, what I could see from the outside was a company with global scale, a strong competitive position and great profitability and liquidity for the industry.\nNow that I'm on the inside, I see all of that in addition to a driven leadership team relentlessly focused on being ready for the business recovery and then driving a customer and capability-led transformation.\nIn short, I see many opportunities in front of us to create shareholder value.\nI will start today with second quarter results for the enterprise and our business segments, followed by an update on cash flow.\nSecond quarter sales were $11.6 billion, a decrease of 23.1% from the prior year, but flat to the prior quarter.\nSales had been trending ahead of Q1 through October and November as restrictions eased, but new lockdown restrictions during December reversed the earlier progress, particularly in the International segment.\nThere are a couple of additional metrics.\nFor the quarter, local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations decreased 19.7% while total case volume within U.S. Broadline operations decreased 23.7%.\nWe do know that there is keen interest in the continued impact of COVID.\nThe answer varies by region.\nEurope went into lockdown in December and is expected to remain in varying degrees of lockdown for a significant portion of the second half.\nHowever, since the week after the holidays, we have been seeing signs of life from volume improvements in our U.S. FS business and SYGMA continues to grow.\nThis battle will be fought week by week, region by region for the next couple of quarters until the vaccination is widespread and the business recovery takes hold.\nThe only commitment we can make is that we will be ready and more competitive than ever.\nAs we move down the P&L, gross profit decreased 25.8% to $2.1 billion in the second quarter.\nMost of the decline in gross profit was driven by lower volumes due to COVID.\nHowever, we did see a modest gross margin dilution at the enterprise level of roughly 67 basis points as our rate came in at 18.2%.\nA couple of thoughts on that.\nFirst, we typically see a seasonal decline in gross margin sequentially from the first quarter through the second quarter as we did this year.\nSecond, our largest segment US Foodservice and its partner segment SYGMA, each had a flat gross margin rate versus the same pre-COVID, quarter which is frankly remarkable given these market dynamics.\nGiven the growth of our national accounts business at SYGMA, which is lower margin, we did see business mix shift, which accounted for the vast majority of the margin rate change.\nOur enterprise margin was also impacted by the International and other businesses as both showed gross margin decline in the quarter for reasons which are being addressed.\nOur expense profile changed over the course of our second quarter as adjusted operating expense decreased 15.3% to $1.9 billion.\nThis expense profile reflects a deleverage of our cost structure as sales remained down 23%.\nThese results arise from some purposeful choices.\nFirst, and on the positive side of the equation, we targeted and achieved increased productivity in key areas such as our warehouse network.\nWe also maintained our key transportation efficiency metrics despite significant swings in case volume.\nSecond, we continue to make excellent progress against our $350 million of cost savings initiatives in fiscal 2021.\nI can see the savings in the detailed income statement, and we continue to identify and pursue more opportunities.\nThird, but on the other side of the equation, we have made the purposeful choice to leverage our financial strength to prepare for the business recovery before it happens.\nAs previously announced, we changed our sales consultant compensation to include both the fixed and variable component to drive retention and focus on key operational metrics.\nWe can see that change working in our market wins.\nAdditionally, we brought back hundreds of associates in the second quarter in support of our business model.\nIn the third quarter, and indeed in the back half, we anticipate we will hire thousands of additional sales consultants, new business developers, culinary experts and operations associates in anticipation of the pending business recovery.\nWe plan to be ahead of the recovery curve, not catching up and we have the financial resources to do just that.\nFinally, as Kevin mentioned, we continue to make purposeful investments in our capability builds in support of our transformation, pricing, customer experience, sales, vendor management and personalization.\nWhile we expect significant returns on these efforts in future quarters, the investment dollars are offsetting part of our savings in the second quarter and will do so in the back half.\nWhen combined with the impact of slower openings in our International segment, we expect our third quarter results to be more challenging than originally anticipated.\nHowever, as volume returns and grows, whether due to market recovery or our purposeful investments, we expect to move up the sales curve more rapidly than others and expect over the next several quarters the impact of the cost savings efforts separated from the ongoing investments will be more visible.\nFinally, at the enterprise level, adjusted operating income decreased 63% to $234 million.\nFor the second quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate of 16.8% was favorably driven by the impact of stock option exercises.\nAdjusted earnings per share decreased 80% to $0.17 for the quarter.\nNow let's turn to our second quarter results by business segment, starting with the U.S. Foodservice operations.\nSales were $8 billion, which was a decrease of 23.9% versus the prior-year period.\nNotwithstanding the difficult environment, the business acquired a record number of new customers, as our sales teams hit the streets and we deployed digital tools.\nWe also saw growth in our national accounts customer base.\nWithin the business, Sysco brand sales for the second quarter decreased 165 basis points to 36.5% for total U.S. cases, driven by the customer and product mix shift.\nWith respect to local US cases, Sysco brand sales decreased 455 basis points to 42%, which was driven by product mix shift in the pre-packaged and takeaway ready products.\nGross profit decreased 24% to $1.6 billion for the quarter, while as I called out earlier, gross margin was flat for the quarter at 19.7% as the business very successfully managed through the puts and takes of the COVID environment and addressed headwinds such as aged inventory for customers like cruise lines and product mix shift out of higher margin categories like PP&E.\nThe segment's adjusted operating expenses decreased 18.9% to $1.1 billion and adjusted operating income decreased 33% to $472 million.\nMoving on to the SYGMA segment.\nSales increased 4% to $1.5 billion compared to the prior-year period, driven by the success of national and regional quick service restaurant servicing drive-through traffic.\nThis is the second consecutive quarter of sales growth in this segment.\nWe continue to see new business wins in the SYGMA segment and are pleased by the overall improvement.\nGross profit increased 4.1% to $129 million for the quarter and gross margin was flat to the prior-year.\nAdjusted operating expenses increased 4%, $118 million and adjusted operating income increased 5% to $11 million.\nMoving to the International segment, our European, Canadian and Latin American businesses have been substantially impacted by recent shutdowns, which are more aggressive than lockdowns in the U.S. The International Foodservice operation segment saw sales of $2 billion, a decrease of 32% while gross profit decreased 36.2% and gross margin decreased 128 basis points.\nThe gross margin decline was a result of adverse market mix, customer mix, product mix and aged inventory.\nFor the International segment, adjusted operating expenses decreased 16% and adjusted operating income decreased 175% for an operating loss of $55 million.\nOur Other segment, which includes our Guest Worldwide business, remains challenged as hospitality occupancy rates remain low compared to prior year levels.\nHowever, the business is in better shape than many of its competitors and has achieved a number of recent customer wins, including being named the preferred distributor for Renaissance Hotels, JW Marriott, and Westin Hotels via a new contract with Avendra in both the U.S. and Canada, and being given access to all Marriott properties in North America, Central America and the Caribbean.\nWhile still in turnaround mode in a difficult hospitality environment, the business improved its underlying profitability during the second quarter.\nCash flow from operations was $937 million for the first half of fiscal 2021.\nFree cash flow was $788 million year-to-date, which is in line with our previously noted guidance.\nNet capex for the first half of fiscal 2021 was $148 million, which was $235 million lower than last year as the company carefully assessed its capital investment choices in the face of COVID.\nSysco remains financially strong from a balance sheet perspective.\nAt quarter end, we had balance sheet cash of $5.8 billion, plus access to $2 billion of available borrowing capacity for a total of $7.8 billion.\nOur cash and available liquidity ensures us the stability and flexibility to make decisions that are in the best interest of the company.\nWe continue to monitor our operating environment carefully.\nAnd as we assess reopening timelines and investment needs consistent with the transformation, we will be updating our views of our levels of cash and capital structure opportunities in future calls.\nAlthough this is a tough operating environment for our customers, which will impact our results for the next quarter or two, Sysco remains resolutely focused on managing its businesses aggressively preparing for the business recovery and building customer-centric capabilities to accelerate long-term growth.\nWe believe our strategy and our transformational initiatives will drive future value for our associates, shareholders and customers.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:On the call today are Blake Krueger, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brendan Hoffman, our President; and Mike Stornant, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nReferences to underlying performance reflect the exclusion of the recently acquired Sweaty Betty brand.\nThese disclosures were reconciled in attached tables within the body of the release.\nI hope everyone on the call is safe and well.\nConsumer demand for our market-leading brands and product offerings continues to surge and exceeded our expectations in Q3.\nOur strategic focus on a deeper connection with consumers, digital and DTC capabilities and product and design innovation is paying dividends.\nWhile the supply chain challenges that have been well documented across many industries has limited our ability to fully service this growing demand in the short-term, I have never been so enthusiastic about our future and our outlook for 2022.\nEarlier today, we reported over 29% revenue growth versus 2020 and 11% over 2019.\nThird quarter revenue was approximately $637 million.\nEarnings leverage driven by gross margin increases was very good.\nWe estimate that factory closures and logistics delays impacted Q3 by at least $60 million.\nThe Wolverine Michigan Group's revenue was up 13% year-over-year and the Wolverine Boston Group's revenue was up over 33%.\nBoth groups delivered growth over 2019.\nAdjusted earnings per share for the company were $0.62 in line with our expectation despite the shortfall in revenue driven by macro supply chain issues.\nWe believe the company is well positioned to deliver accelerated future growth with a number of fundamental elements supporting our enthusiasm.\nOur brand portfolio strategy and international distribution base continue to reduce risk and provide a meaningful strategic benefit in the current environment as the company is not dependent on any single product category, geographic region, consumer group or distribution channel.\nWhile consumer lifestyle choices have increased demand for performance product, the underlying trends in this category are long-term in nature and are expected to persist.\nConsumers are increasingly focused on health and wellness with running, hiking the outdoors and exercise in general, serving as the primary activation to this mindset.\nParticipation in running in the U.S. has increased every year over the last five years.\nAnd a significant majority of new runners today they plan to continue running in the future.\nParticipation in all outdoor activities, including hiking, walking and boating has also increased with over 20 million new hikers in the U.S. alone since 2015.\nThis past spring and summer, National Park shattered attendance records and new boat purchases and water activities in general reached a 13-year high.\nConsumers' renewed affinity for the outdoors is expected to continue into the future, especially as consumers begin to travel again.\nThe work category has also showed strong growth supported by healthy macro industry conditions and work wear fashion tailwinds.\nWarehousing jobs have more than doubled since 2005 and construction companies are expected to hire hundreds of thousands of additional workers over the coming months.\nLooking ahead, the passage of a major infrastructure plan in the U.S. will further boost momentum in this category.\nAcross all brands and product categories, we have placed our consumers at the heart of our global strategy, and that has changed how we bring product to market and operate the business.\nThis strategic focus led to our recent acquisition of Sweaty Betty, a trend right women's active wear brand that adds a very meaningful DTC business to our portfolio with over 80% of revenue generated through DTC channels.\nIncluding Sweaty Betty, DTC e-commerce revenue more than doubled in Q3 relative to 2019 and our DTC stores are up over 35% versus that year.\nOur owned online business and the online business of our wholesale customers now account for over 30% of global revenue.\nTogether with the DTC businesses operated by our distributor partners around the world, nearly 40% of our global revenue and a larger percentage of our payers is now generated through consumer direct channel, enabling enhanced brand shopping experiences, a wealth of consumer insights and data and a more efficient business model.\nWe continue to capitalize on the fundamental consumer trends that are playing out in the market.\nIn addition to our strong DTC business, these trends are reflected by continued strength in retail sell-through and a historically high order backlog that now extends into Q3 of 2022.\nWe remain bullish on our outlook in light of these trends and the composition of our brand portfolio, which over indexes in trending performance and lifestyle categories.\nWe expect strong long-term consumer demand, especially for Saucony, Merrell, Sweaty Betty, our work brands and Sperry, which will launch a line of products in the active sport category next spring.\nFor our call today, Brendan Hoffman will provide some additional insight on key brand performance during the quarter.\nMike Stornant will review our Q3 financial performance and updated outlook in more detail.\nAnd I'll conclude with some final remarks.\nWith this, I'll now hand it over to Brendan.\nIn the third quarter, we acquired sweaty Betty, a powerhouse brand that operates in the global addressable active wear market of over $200 billion.\nThe brand delivers on our key strategic priorities by delivering a powerful line of industry-leading products, expanding our direct-to-consumer presence and growing our business internationally.\nWe plan to leverage these strengths by deploying Sweaty Betty's best practices and apparel expertise across our portfolio.\nThe business grew over 50% in the third quarter, ahead of our expectations.\nLess than three months after welcoming Sweaty Betty to the Wolverine family, we are even more excited about the growth potential, product collaborations and operational synergies in front of us.\nSaucony delivered a very strong performance in Q3 with more than 40% growth over 2020 and 60% versus 2019 despite some supply chain challenges.\nsaucony.com was up more than 50% and nearly tripled 2019.\nThe brand has seen global success with all regions contributing significant growth.\nOutside of the U.S. market, technical running and lifestyle performance in Europe was especially strong, up 30% versus 2020.\nOur Saucony Originals lifestyle business continues to perform well, especially internationally.\nOur performance in Europe continues to accelerate, while the Asia Pacific region is a big opportunity for us moving forward with the brand delivering over 60% growth in Q3.\nSaucony stores and the online business are performing well in China as the brand's joint venture there continues to gain momentum.\nSaucony continues to deliver a consistent flow of powerhouse performance product and trend-right lifestyle product.\nThis has translated to consistent robust growth for the brand over the last several quarters, and we expect this to continue into 2022.\nThe road running category leads the way, including the recent launches of the new Ride 14, the brand's biggest franchise shoe and Triumph 19.\nSaucony's trail running business also grew by more than 40% in the quarter.\nLet me shift to Merrell.\nThe brand continues to experience record demand and great momentum in all global channels.\nDuring Q3, Merrell was impacted by factory closures in Vietnam, which resulted in missed revenue opportunities of at least $25 million.\nDespite these challenges, Merrell still delivered mid-single-digit growth in the quarter versus 2020.\nMerrell's DTC business grew mid-single-digits in the quarter with merrell.com building on its nearly doubling of the business last year.\nMerrell stores also continued to outperform our expectations, a promising indicator of the strength of the brand and the consumers return to shopping in stores.\nMerrell holds the number one U.S. market share position in the hike category and is the category leader in many key markets across the globe.\nWhile Merrell continues to successfully optimize its well established and market-leading core product franchises, fresh innovative product offerings are driving brand's heat and new consumer interest.\nThe Moab Speed and Moab Flight collections are energizing the performance category.\nThese styles represent the brand vision for fast, lightweight footwear for the trail and light hiking and also build on the heritage and success of the world's number one hiker, The Moab.\nThis momentum is further fueled by the uptick in organic media placements that bridge both performance and lifestyle.\nFor example, Annie Leibovitz used the Moab Speed in the September issue of Vogue for a major photo shoot and style with the Louis Vuitton jacket and skirt.\nAdditionally, Merrell was featured on The Today Show during Q3, showcasing the Moab Speed, which aligns well to the brand's Step Further campaign, encouraging increased commitment to the outdoors.\nBoth collections have exceeded our expectations, and we are excited about the potential for new performance collections in 2022.\nMerrell's Lifestyle business performed better than the brand's overall growth in Q3.\nWe are seeing positive results from our strategic focus on further elevating Merrell as a lifestyle brand.\nRecent brand health research indicates that consumers are incorporating Merrell into their own identity at an increasingly higher degree.\nThese trends are manifesting in the strong performance we are seeing in lifestyle product, including the Hydro Moc and the newly launched Cloud all-day casual sneaker collection made with eco-friendly materials.\nAs we mentioned on our Q2 call, Merrell introduced its 1TRL capsule collection on merrell.com, which focuses on younger, fashion-forward consumers demanding authentic outdoor influenced style.\nLooking ahead, Merrell possesses a substantial growth opportunity globally, particularly in EMEA, which has seen increasing momentum for several quarters, and in Asia Pacific where the China JV is just beginning to gain momentum.\nOutdoor and performance trends are strong around the world, and Merrell is capitalizing on its heritage and brand positioning.\nIn Q3, our work business accounted for nearly 20% of total revenue and the category continued to deliver strong growth with Wolverine, the leader in the U.S. work boot category, up over 16%, Cat Footwear, up nearly 40% and with strong contributions from our smaller brands.\nAs Blake indicated, we expect continued strong growth in the work category as we pivot toward 2022.\nBased on the performance of Merrell, Saucony, Sweaty Betty, Wolverine and our other work brands, our performance business developed growth of nearly 30% over 2019 during the third quarter.\nThe Sperry brand continued its steady recovery in Q3 with over 40% growth.\nThe brand's DTC business was up 25% driven by ongoing e-commerce growth and very good Sperry stores performance.\nAll product categories delivered strong double-digit increases in the quarter.\nThe overall boat market showed strong growth, particularly in men's, and Sperry gained significant market share growth in this key category.\nFrom a fashion standpoint, there are clear indications that we are at the forefront of a boat shoe trend with very encouraging demand from key retailers for the first half of 2022.\nI hope you all saw 007 James Bond wearing a pair of our iconic boat shoes in No Time To Die.\nIn the coming months, Sperry plans to build on the energy created by recent collaborations with Rowing Blazers and Netflix Outer Banks and product capsules with John Legend and Rebecca Minkoff.\nThe brand is also well positioned for the current seasonal women's boot business with strong demand and healthy inventory levels.\nSperry will also leverage the easy on-off trend during Q4 with the new Moc Sider and the Cozy Float collections.\nIn Spring '22, the brand will launch its new Sperry Sport collection through a path into macro consumer trends with more trend-right performance-based product for the water.\nLooking forward, our product lines are robust across the brand portfolio and order demand continues to strengthen.\nWe have been flexible and responded quickly to navigate the ongoing macro supply chain challenges to service the increased demand we are seeing in nearly every brand.\nWe believe strong product coupled with more precise merchandising and consumer focus as well as healthier inventory positions will drive growth over the next year.\nOur DTC channels remain a top priority and a source of opportunity for the business.\nWe have pivoted to a more dynamic e-commerce operating model to enable faster implementation of technical enhancements and new commercial capabilities, which will also help us extend improved online functionality to our global online wholesale customers.\nIn addition to our global DTC e-commerce business, we are seeing meaningful wholesale growth with our online retail customers.\nAs global economies have reopened, we have seen consumers shift a portion of their spending back to brick and mortar stores.\nAbout 50% of our footwear is now sold online in the important U.S. market.\nThis bodes well for the current brand operating model that we are executing, including a more continuous product flow and best-in-class digital marketing content to benefit all channels.\nWe continue to look closely at our store fleet and suspect there may be favorable and profitable opportunities for us to explore as we expand our footprint in key markets starting in 2022.\nI'm now going to hand it off to Mike to review the third quarter financial results and our increased 2021 outlook in more detail.\nLet me start by reviewing the company's strong third quarter financial performance, and then I'll cover our revised outlook for 2021.\nThird quarter revenue of approximately $637 million represents growth of over 29% compared to the prior year and includes $39 million from the recently acquired Sweaty Betty business.\nOn a pro forma basis, Sweaty Betty grew over 50% versus 2020.\nBased on increased consumer demand experienced across the portfolio during the quarter, the company was on track to deliver just under $700 million in third quarter revenue.\nBut as Blake mentioned, the unprecedented factory closures and other well documented supply chain disruption impeded our ability to service this strong demand.\nDespite these headwinds, Saucony and Sperry each delivered over 40% growth.\nMerrell was impacted most heavily by the factory closures in Southern Vietnam, yet still delivered mid-single-digit growth.\nOur work business also continued to drive meaningful growth at over 20%.\nAdjusted gross margin improved 330 basis points versus the prior year to 44.6% due to the higher average selling prices, favorable product mix and the addition of Sweaty Betty for nearly two months of the quarter.\nMerrell, Saucony and Sperry all well exceeded gross margin expectations in the quarter, a testament to their strong position in the marketplace and robust pipeline of relevant trend-right product.\nSweaty Betty's premium positioning, distinctive product offering and strong consumer trends are yielding robust gross margins which are accretive to our underlying business in Q3.\nTotal air freight costs were approximately $10 million in the quarter, of which $7 million was excluded from our adjusted results.\nIncluding the full air freight impact, our adjusted gross margin would have been 43.5% still 220 basis points higher than last year.\nWe continue to use air freight where appropriate to mitigate exceptional supply chain delays caused specifically by COVID.\nAdjusted selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $208 million were $56 million more than last year, primarily due to increased revenue, the addition of Sweaty Betty and increased marketing investments.\nAdjusted operating margin was 12% for Q3, an improvement of 140 basis points over last year and ahead of our expectations.\nThis very strong leverage on the company's revenue growth resulted from gross margin expansion and a balanced operating expense management.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.62 compared to $0.35 in the prior year, growth of 77% or 3.5 times our revenue growth in the quarter.\nReported diluted earnings per share were breakeven and include a number of non-recurring or exceptional items comprised of approximately $34 million of cost related to bond retirements executed in the quarter to significantly improve the company's capital structure and future liquidity, including future savings of nearly $10 million in annual interest expense.\nApproximately $10 million of cost directly related to the acquisition of Sweaty Betty.\nApproximately $17 million of costs related to our legacy environmental matters.\nIncluding ongoing defense costs and an estimate of potential future settlement costs for a portion of the outstanding litigation.\nAnd finally, approximately $7 million of air freight considered to be well above normalized levels based on historical experience.\nDuring the quarter, the company and 3M entered into a non-binding term sheet outlining proposed settlement terms on certain individual lawsuits filed against the company related to our legacy environmental issue.\nWhile the proposed settlement remains subject to finalizing terms and contingencies that allow any of the parties to opt out of the proposed settlement, we believe this is another important step toward potential resolution of these matters.\nLet me now shift to the balance sheet.\nTotal inventory grew approximately 26% versus 2020, including 16 percentage points of growth from Sweaty Betty.\nUnderlying inventory was up approximately 10% compared to last year and still down compared to 2019.\nOur inventory position has improved over the last two quarters, especially for Saucony, Sperry and our work brands, but is still not in line with the higher demand.\nMerrell continues to manage through the recovery from closed Vietnam factories which has put more pressure on inventory levels.\nBased on current visibility, inventory levels will continue to improve as we benefit from supply chain diversification, the addition of several new factories and incremental capacity for 2022, higher production orders placed in mid-2021 and other actions we have taken to counterbalance macro supply chain headwinds.\nSince August 1, we acquired Sweaty Betty for approximately $410 million.\nThe purchase was financed through a combination of existing cash and borrowing under the company's revolver.\nWe also executed some important refinancing activities to support future growth and optimize our capital structure, most notably, a bond refinancing and a new credit facility that gives us added liquidity and flexibility to invest in growth.\nAs a result of these recent actions, we've added a powerhouse growth brand to the portfolio and our balance sheet remains extremely healthy with total liquidity of approximately $800 million.\nI will now provide an update on our outlook for the rest of 2021.\nFirst let me focus on the strength of demand signals across the portfolio that support a very optimistic outlook for growth over the next several quarters.\nOur order book remains at historically high levels and provides very clear demand visibility for our global wholesale and distributor businesses well into 2022.\nRetail sell through continues to be very strong.\nDespite shipment delays and supply chain disruption, our order cancellations have been limited as retailers remain committed to our industry-leading brands and product offerings.\nThe positive momentum of our performance and work footwear brands continues, and now Sperry is beginning to show signs of a healthy recovery.\nSweaty Betty is now the fourth largest brand in our portfolio and is driving outpaced growth.\nTrends in our DTC business remains strong with year-to-date underlying e-commerce revenue up nearly double 2019 and year-to-date underlying store revenue up mid-teens.\nFinally, demand in our APAC and Latin America regions is recovering nicely as we transition to spring 2022, and we see near-term strength across many international markets.\nAll of these indicators give us great confidence for the future.\nThe strength of new product offerings and improved go to market tactics across the portfolio will allow us to continue to fuel growth despite the macro supply chain headwinds that we believe will persist well into 2022.\nIn the short-term, the impact of factory closures and a volatile logistics environment is having an unplanned negative impact on revenue for the last four months of 2021.\nAs a result, we are adjusting our fiscal 2021 outlook.\nWe now expect fiscal 2021 revenue of approximately $2.4 billion, growth of nearly 35% compared to the prior year and approximately 28% growth on an underlying basis.\nDespite the shorter term supply chain impact, we still expect to deliver up to 25% growth in the fourth quarter.\nThere will be ongoing cost pressure related to higher freight and logistics costs throughout the fourth quarter, and we will continue to invest behind our future growth opportunities, including brand enhancing marketing and key talent.\nWe now expect full year adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.05 to $2.10 and Q4 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.38 to $0.43, representing 100% growth over 2020 at the high end of that range.\nFull year reported diluted earnings per share are now expected in the range of $1.16 to $1.21.\nWe have good line of sight to the start of 2022 and have great enthusiasm for continued brand momentum as we pivot into the New Year.\nWhile certain known supply chain headwinds will continue to be in play, we still expect to deliver mid-teens underlying growth and mid-20s overall growth in the first quarter of 2022.\nOur confidence in delivering double-digit underlying growth next year remains very high, and we believe Sweaty Betty adds significantly to the growth profile of the company.\nWith that, I will hand it back over to Blake for some closing remarks.\nOur healthy growth and strong financial performance in Q3 are a testament to the company's strategic focus and accelerated brand investments.\nOver the last several years, we've consistently invested behind digital and DTC capabilities, technology, talent and the e-commerce as well as product innovation and design.\nIn Q3, we made an important acquisition of Sweaty Betty, which will be an important catalyst for growth across our performance brands.\nOur product pipeline is robust, consumer demand is surging and brand heat and ongoing trends favor our brand.\nWe are confident as we plan for double-digit growth in 2022.\nThe advantageous position we find ourselves in today is a credit to our team's expertise and relentless work, especially over the last couple of years.\nGlobal marketplace continues to be dynamic and fast changing and our people and company are excelling in this environment.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:So the first quarter results were very good, looking at it from both year-ago comparisons and then to go back to two years ago comparison, pre-COVID.\nRevenues were up 39% and versus two years ago, they were up 9%, so the pre-COVID timeframe.\nEBITDA grew 119% versus year ago this quarter -- this year and then up 62% versus two years ago, so both give us a strong start for fiscal 2022.\nIn fact, it gives us confidence to firm up our full year guidance and increase it modestly even after considering the impact of some of these micro -- macro headwinds that we're looking at right now such as labor, raw material increases and supply chain challenges.\nSo Craig and Eddie will take you through those details in the next few minutes, but here are four trends that we're seeing coming out of the first quarter.\nThe first one is the diversity of our geographic portfolio, it is a strong positive for us, so this quarter, Brazil and Asia had a very strong Q1.\nNorth America came in right above what we forecasted, but they could have done better.\nThe labor shortages in the U.S. kept us from producing to demand, and we expect that that headwinds probably going to persist through quarter two.\nAnd then in the second half of the year, we expect to see some improvement in that trend.\nThen, I think you can expect North America to start contributing more to our growth.\nThe second trend coming out of the first quarter was REPREVE sales growth continues to build.\nSo you look at REPREVE sales versus year ago first quarter was up 39% and then from two years ago, pre-COVID, it was up 27%.\nI think, customers right now are continuing to step up their commitment to recycled materials in apparel and footwear and auto and we've had numerous positive customer wins over the last quarter.\nThe third trend is productivity and the investment in EvoCooler technology and our operation will provide strong long-term productivity and we will begin seeing a little bit of that in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year.\nThe production on the current small scale that we rolled out is meeting our expectations in terms of efficiency and output.\nAnd the fourth trend is labor and labor in the U.S. is a challenge right now.\nOur manufacturing and HR teams have been working on the obvious fixes such as labor rate and benefits to make sure that we remain competitive in the marketplace.\nHowever, they have discussed -- they discovered several longer term solutions by conducting front line employee round tables in our plants.\nWe've asked our employees what can we do to make their jobs more fulfilling and to keep them with us for a longer time and they've come up with several very interesting improvements that are pragmatic and they're being implemented, everything from the quality of training and the amount of training to changing the way that the work gets done.\nWe sometimes forget, I think that the employees that are closest to the action can solve problems probably better than anyone else in the company.\nSo, we'll share more of this with you in the upcoming quarters.\nSo all-in-all, a good start to the fiscal year.\nThere is still a great deal of work to do, but we're optimistic about the outlook.\nAs Al mentioned, our first quarter fiscal 2022 results surpassed our initial expectations and the strong results reflect the flexibility of our global business model, our strong presence in each region and the hard work and dedication of each and every one of our employees who as we like to say at Unifi are working today for the good of tomorrow.\nWe continue to be grateful for the daily contributions our employees make to our company and to our customers.\nTheir commitment to Unifi has allowed us to continue operating a strong business, while navigating the recovery.\nOn Slide 3, we provide an overview of the quarter and as Al said, we are executing very well, driving growth and proving out how resilient our business model has become.\nQ1 revenues were up 6% sequentially, slightly ahead of our expectations and up 39% on a year-over-year basis.\nAlongside our focus on meeting customers' expectations, the growing demand for our core products and product lines in each region contributed to the increased revenues, which of course naturally translated into significant year-over-year profit growth.\nDespite Q1 exceeding our initial expectations, we had to navigate several cost headwinds and input constraints.\nHiccups in the supply chain from global logistics stoppages and domestic labor shortages placed even more pressure on each business segments.\nDespite of these difficulties, our teams' quick actions ensured no meaningful disruptions to our lines of business.\nI'll break down our execution as well as some of the challenges we faced during Q1 by region.\nIn Brazil, the volatility remains post the regional shutdowns that impacted our business in April and May period.\nIn fiscal Q1, the volatility in the market was driven by the rising freight costs from China, the uncertainty in the exchange rate and the rising cost of textured yarn and Asia, all of which has increased the local market price for textured yarn.\nThe situation has been compounded by inflation concerns, which are increasing at a pace not seen in several years.\nEarly indications are this may have some impact on demand.\nHowever, this may actually result in customers consuming more locally produced yarns, which would help us gain market share.\nThis is something that will remain on our radar as we move through the rest of the fiscal year and we will keep you updated on this.\nDespite all of this, as you can see we had another excellent quarter in Brazil.\nIn the U.S. and Central America during the quarter, we continue the process of catching up with raw material and other cost increases through proactive selling price adjustments.\nWe have additional work to do in this area as we can already see that polyester and nylon raw material prices are rising as a result of the recent increase in crude oil prices.\nWhile this is a very painful process, it is something our customers are facing too and like us, they are having to pass on their input cost increases to their customers.\nIn the U.S. specifically, like many other businesses also faced labor challenges.\nWe see this as an opportunity to become a better employer and are allocating more resources into training and retention.\nFortunately, the elimination of the federal subsidy at the beginning of September has once again brought more people into the workforce, and we are taking advantage of that.\nIt should be noted that the impacts of COVID are still being felt primarily in our manufacturing plants, resulting in us having to quarantine a number of employees.\nUnfortunately, we have also lost a few of our employees to the virus, and our thoughts go out to their families and friends.\nLastly, we have experienced a few delays in the supply -- extended the lead times of certain products, but nothing that is truly disruptive to business.\nAnd in Asia, we experienced a very positive start to the quarter with continued sales increases in our REPREVE brand and other value-added products.\nAs you are aware, there are some concerns at the Chinese central government label around the energy consumption and air pollution levels and this placed some pressure on the business at the very end of the quarter.\nWe are seeing minor caution from customers and suppliers who are battling COVID lockdowns and energy cuts.\nThis situation remains volatile and introduces some uncertainty for the short term.\nWe do expect to overcome these challenges in the next few months as the demand is usually strong leading up to the Lunar New Year, which this year is at the very beginning of February.\nAscending back to the consolidated business.\nIt's great to see the progress we have made toward our fiscal 2022 and longer term goals in the face of these multiple headwinds.\nWe remain committed to maintaining a solid financial position and our current balance sheet provides a strong backbone for us to execute on growth-focused capital allocation priorities.\nBeyond the financials, we continue to observe a growing number of customers shifting their commitments to making products using recycled material.\nDuring the first quarter, we shipped more than 23 million hang tags to brand customers.\nYou will note that on Slide 4, products made with REPREVE fiber comprised 37% net sales, consolidated net sales increasing from 36% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.\nThis growth is regional and is primarily in our Asia, U.S. and Central American revenues.\nOur REPREVE momentum into new textile sectors and multiple brand adoptions across Europe has been very strong.\nLast month TenCate protective fabrics, a traditional workwear and industrial textiles company from the Netherlands began marketing, it's Tecapro line of workwear using inhibits taking -- REPREVE inhibit taking REPREVE further beyond traditional fashion textiles and into protective wear.\nThis is the first time our multi-functional REPREVE inhibit value-added combination is being used in flame retardant workwear to add in a sustainable twist to a highly durable products.\nTenCate chose REPREVE inhibit for quality, reliability, reputation, traceability and transparency and we've been excited to help them tell the sustainable and flame retardant story through a variety of co-marketing mediums.\nREPREVE's strength in the Turkish market continues, with a new line of denim by Mavi jeans.\nMavi jeans launched a nationwide TV commercial that showcases their adoption of recycled polyester in the new line of jeans.\nOther recent adoptions by European brands include French brands Jules and the German brands Marc O'Polo, Duke and Street One owned by CBR Fashion Group.\nOne of Inditex' brands Massimo Dutti has continue to roll out products using REPREVE RO.\nIn the U.S., we continued to see strong co-marketing in the menswear segment.\nHaggar has launched a new line of suit separates in a variety of fits under the name Smart Wash REPREVE suits.\nAnd I know from talking to employees and having direct conversations with them, it's a proud moment when they walk into are Kohl's or JCPenneys or go online and see this iconic U.S. brand shout out their sustainability story, which is based on REPREVE.\nGoing outside of the apparel market, our placements in the global homes good sector continues, with a new launch of several CD mattresses in Canada that feature REPREVE.\nNow turning to our operating segment performance during the first quarter.\nI'll provide some high level comments before Craig walks you through more specific details.\nStrength in our polyester and nylon segments persisted in the first quarter and benefited from strong sales momentum with robust customer demand.\nOur commercial and manufacturing teams have done a tremendous job navigating the headwinds I mentioned previously and we remain optimistic about the sales mix and pricing dynamics going forward for this segment.\nThe Asia segment demonstrated another strong quarter and volumes increased due to pull through on new and existing customer programs.\nShutdowns and uncertainty in Vietnam and Southeast Asia have not impacted us perhaps as much as other companies since it's a smaller part of that business.\nWhile we do anticipate some soft spots in China based on new temporary shutdown mandates related to managing energy level there, businesses are still running and the demand for sustainable yarns has never been higher.\nI'm confident that the teams' continued focus on meeting the ever-increasing sustainability and value-added demands of their customers will help us weather these challenges.\nAs mentioned by the financial performance, the Brazilian team has continued to do an exceptional job.\nDuring the first quarter, the strong price mix performance increased sales over 50% from the year ago quarter, driving more than 100% increase in gross profit dollars.\nLooking forward, we continue to anticipate a degree of moderation in profit from this region with the full year gross margin settling just below 20%.\nLast week, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced its final determinations that imports of polyester textured yarn from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are being unfairly sold below their fair value in the U.S. The financing dumping duty deposit rates range from 2% to 56% and are currently in effect.\nThe next step in these trade cases will be the U.S. International Trade Commission's final determination, which is scheduled for November 30th.\nWith that, I would call the -- call over to Craig.\nThe remainder of our financial statement metrics were generally consistent with our expectations as it relates to overall SG&A spending, our effective tax rate and the amount outlaid for capital expenditures and working capital associated with our investments in the business and our strong sales performance.\nConsolidated net sales increased 38.5% from $141.5 million to $196 million, primarily due to business recovery we have seen over the last five quarters of sequential sales growth.\nFor the Polyester segment, the single-digit volume change was muted partially by the labor pool challenges Al and Eddie mentioned earlier.\nThe price and mix change demonstrates the selling price adjustments that have been made over the last several months in response to rising input costs although we have not fully normalized the portfolio for today's cost levels.\nIn Asia, the sales volume growth again demonstrates new and existing customer programs that continue to be successful on the REPREVE platform, while higher pricing associated with raw material costs was offset by a greater mix of lower priced products.\nIn Brazil, momentum surrounding higher pricing and market share continued to benefit revenues, as pricing was up over 50%, driving a significant change in quarterly revenues for that segment.\nAnd nylon exhibited stability with much higher sales and production volumes to start off fiscal 2022.\nTurning to Slide 6.\nPolyester demonstrated significant gross profit and margin improvement, despite labor inefficiency challenges in the current environment and some pricing lags.\nThe gross margin increase of 260 basis points is very commendable under today's circumstances.\nThe Asia segment's volume growth led to a $2.4 million improvement in gross profit as that segment continues its strong year-over-year growth trajectory and remains a significant component of the global commercial model.\nIn Brazil, our agility against competition and commitment to deliver high value to the market allowed us to maintain strong pricing levels and market share, double gross profit and driving margin improvement of 910 basis points.\nLastly from a segment performance perspective on slide 7 and 8, we've included a two-year GAAP comparison for enhanced understanding of this just completed quarter's performance.\nSlide 7 shows the consolidated sales increase of 8.9% from the same quarter two years prior lifted by a healthy combination of volume, pricing and mix across our segments.\nSlide 8 provides a gross profit overview for the two-year comparison.\nShown here, the Polyester segment exhibited strength against the previously discussed headwinds.\nThe Asia segment exhibited a 430 basis point increase in gross margin with recent mix and efficiency gains and the Brazil's segment exceptional performance is highlighted with the comparable doubling of gross profit.\nAgain, we are pleased with the progress made across our portfolio over the last several quarters.\nMoving on to Slide 9, which provides a brief update on our balance sheet and capital allocation priorities.\nWe continued to have zero borrowings on our ABL revolver, which had an availability of $74 million as of September 26, 2021.\nUnder our balanced approach to capital allocation, we expect to continue to invest in the business to drive innovation and organic growth, maintain a strong balance sheet and remain opportunistic with share repurchases and M&A opportunities.\nBefore I pass the call back to Eddie, I'm pleased to announce that Unifi will be hosting an Investor Day event in February 2022.\nThe event will be hosted by our leadership team at our manufacturing facilities in North Carolina.\nWe believe it's important for our investors to explore our world-class facilities first hand.\nMore details will be released on this event in the near future.\nHowever, doing so will mean continuing to remain nimble as we navigate the numerous market dynamics.\nThese include inflationary pressures, particularly related to the cost of recycled inputs, energy shortages in Asia that have resulted in temporary slowdowns for several of our customers and suppliers, uncertainty related to the continued impact of the pandemic and ongoing labor pool constraints in the U.S. Again, our team has done a tremendous job navigating all these headwinds and I believe they will continue to do so.\nWe will keep a close eye on all of these issues as we progress through each quarter.\nLooking forward, we are excited by recent trends in our REPREVE and other value-added products.\nOur expectations remain positive on these developments and will continue to be driven by our innovation and commercial teams and we anticipate them to grow long term.\nOur strong performance during the first quarter reflects our regional focus, global commercial model, innovation pipeline and the upside potential each has even when stressed with challenges in the broader market.\nFor the second quarter that ends in December 2021, we expect net sales to range between $185 million and $190 million and after consideration for seasonally higher SG&A level, some normalization of Brazil segment profitability and recent increase in oil prices, we expect to achieve an adjusted EBITDA between $14 million and $15 million.\nFor the full year fiscal 2022, we expect sales to surpass $750 million, representing a 12% or more increase from fiscal 2021's revenues.\nWe expect adjusted EBITDA to grow from the fiscal 2021 level in a range between $65 million and $67 million and our effective tax rate guidance remains in the range of 35% and 40%, while our capital expenditures will range between $40 million and $44 million.\nWe will continue to focus on partnering with global brands and retail leaders who want to position themselves using sustainable products.\nAs stated on previous calls, we believe the importance and demand for sustainability will only grow and consumer behavior attest to that.\nWe remain dedicated to innovating and repositioning the business to drive long-term organic growth.\nSummary: ",

Hanson, our Chairman, President and CEO; and EVP and CFO, Suky Upadhyay.\nAs we're all aware, obviously, given the news recently, COVID is still very much with us, and we're watching it very closely, as you can imagine.\nBut given that even, we've seen some real progress since our last call, and I think that's obvious to everybody.\nThe world has not returned to normalcy yet, but travel is returning.\nWe have more team members in our offices, and I am personally looking forward to attending the AAOS meeting in about a month in San Diego.\nSo really looking forward to that meeting.\nWe have a lot of great technology that we're going to be able to showcase there and just really happy it's going to be in person again, finally.\nYou, our team members are the driving force for this progress that we've seen in our own facilities and certainly in our communities as well.\nAlso, I want to say that I hope in our investor community that you're continuing to stay safe and have been hopefully able to travel over the last few months to see family and friends.\nThis is an opportunity for us to take advantage of some travel as we begin to turn to more of a normal environment, of course, not there yet, and we know this isn't happening consistently anyway in all regions.\nBut overall, we are encouraged and we're doing our part to keep this moving forward.\nAnd every single day, we are supporting our customers and patients that they serve.\nWe're doing this safely, obviously, but this is a big focus for us as a mission-driven organization to be there for our customers so they can complete the procedures that they have and we can make sure that the patients receive the care that they deserve.\nAnd with that, I think it's a good lead into our Q2 call.\nAnd I think most importantly, our 2021 guidance view on a go-forward basis.\nAnd then I'll come back to close out the call with some updates on our active portfolio management and product in pipeline highlights.\nI'll wait to do that after he provides the guidance information.\nSo just to set him up a little bit, overall, let me just say that our performance in the quarter improved meaningfully from the first quarter of this year, and that was pretty much across all regions and product categories.\nAnd as recovery from the global pandemic continued to take hold, we saw that recovery in our procedures also move in the right direction.\nWhile we certainly anticipate some ongoing COVID pressure, we currently think it's going to be manageable by hospitals, and we expect that the recovery will continue to build sequentially throughout the second half of 2021.\nAgain, moving in the right direction.\nAnd my revenue and P&L commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted basis.\nAlso, I'll provide constant currency revenue growth versus 2019 as we think that is a more relevant comparison for this quarter.\nNet sales in the second quarter were $2.027 billion, a reported increase of 65.3% and an increase of 60.7% on a constant currency basis versus the same period in 2020.\nWhen compared to the second quarter of 2019, net sales were flat on a constant currency basis, and we did not have a material impact from selling days.\nOverall, consolidated and regional results were slightly better than the expectations we provided on our last quarterly call, with growth versus 2019 in the Americas and Asia Pacific and sequential improvement in EMEA.\nFor the quarter, the Americas increased 68.3% or up 1.9% versus 2019.\nWe continue to see variability by country within the region with the U.S. growing 66.2% or 3.3% versus 2019.\nEMEA grew 80.5% or down 7.3% versus 2019 with continued COVID pressure being a factor.\nWe did see improvement in EMEA as we moved through the quarter, and we expect that trend to continue through the back half of this year.\nLastly, Asia Pacific grew 24.4% or 2.8% versus 2019 in spite of some unexpected headwinds.\nWhile the region has been largely stable in recent quarters, it was impacted late in the second quarter by channel inventory contraction in our knee and hip categories within China, and advance of the rollout of volume-based procurement or VBP.\nIn addition, we saw a resurgence and increase of COVID19 in a number of markets, including Japan.\nDespite these headwinds, the region continued to pose growth.\nTurning to our business categories.\nThe global knee business increased 72.2% or down 6.3% versus 2019.\nIn the U.S., knees increased 77% or was flat versus 2019.\nWhile we are seeing sequential improvement in the recovery of procedural volumes in large joints, the path back to normalized market growth is taking a bit longer than most expected.\nStill, we continue to be encouraged by the team's execution and ongoing strong momentum for Persona and ROSA Knee.\nOur global hip business increased 39.9% or down 2.8% versus 2019.\nIn the U.S., hip grew 46.6% or up 3.1% versus 2019.\nStrong demand and favorable feedback continues for the Avenir Complete hip, which continued adoption for both gold and platinum accounts.\nThe sports, extremities and trauma category increased 53% or up 10.8% versus 2019 driven by solid growth in sports medicine, CMFT and upper extremities.\nWe continue to see strong surgeon registrations of the Signature ONE surgical planning system for shoulder procedures.\nOur dental and spine category grew 69.4% or up 0.8% versus '19, fueled by recovery in dental.\nNew products and better commercial execution drove growth in the quarter with strong contributions from implants and digital solutions in our dental business.\nFinally, our other category grew 105.9% or up 7.5% versus '19.\nThis reflects the ongoing demand for ROSA Robotics and strong capital purchases in the quarter.\nWe saw improvements both sequentially versus Q2 2020 in units sold as well as increased revenues from software due to the launch of our Partial Knee application.\nMoving on to the P&L.\nFor the quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.67.\nOur reported GAAP diluted earnings per share were up significantly when compared to a reported GAAP diluted loss per share of $1 in the second quarter of 2020.\nThe increase in year-over-year GAAP earnings was driven by higher revenue, offset by normalized spending levels and IPRD investments within the quarter.\nIn addition, the second quarter of 2020 had some onetime GAAP charges that did not repeat.\nOn an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of $1.90 was significantly higher than the prior year, driven as expected by the recovery of elective procedures since the pandemic drop in the second quarter of 2020.\nAdjusted gross margin was 71.7% and in line with expectations.\nOur adjusted operating expenses of $923 million stepped up sequentially versus the first quarter due to higher variable selling expenses related to higher sales and increased discretionary spending to support investments in commercial infrastructure and innovation through R&D.\nImproved revenue performance and stable gross margins more than offset higher spending to drive 26.2% operating margins, a slight improvement over the first quarter of this year.\nThe adjusted tax rate of 16.5% in the quarter was in line with our expectations.\nTurning to cash and liquidity.\nFor the quarter, operating cash flows were $453.9 million, and free cash flow was robust at $358.7 million, and we ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of just over $1 billion.\nWe continue to make good progress on deleveraging the balance sheet and expect to make another $300 million in debt repayments in the third quarter.\nMoving to our financial guidance.\nWe are tightening our guidance range to better reflect our year-to-date performance and a more informed view of the potential impact of COVID.\nThere are some key assumptions that underpin our 2021 financial guidance.\nWe assume no worsening of elective procedure trends due to COVID and that procedure volume recovery continues in the second half of the year.\nBut recovery may not be linear by region and/or by product category.\ne also expect to see seasonality impact in the third and fourth quarter as we have observed in prior years.\nWith the narrowing of our guidance range, we are now expecting reported revenue growth to be 14.5% to 16.5% versus 2020, with the impact of foreign currency unchanged at about 150 basis points of a tailwind for the full year.\nOn a constant currency basis, compared to 2019, we expect Q3 to grow sequentially over Q2 and for that improvement to continue in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to the P&L.\nOur adjusted diluted earnings per share is now in the range of $7.65 to $7.95, and we have narrowed our adjusted operating margin projection to be 26.5% to 27% for the full year.\nOur updated earnings per share guidance reflects our performance to date, our expectation of improved growth in the second half and that discretionary operating expenses remained consistent with Q2 through the balance of the year.\nWhile operating margins are expected to decline sequentially in the third quarter, in line with lower sales revenue and steady investment levels versus the second quarter, we expect overall second half operating margins to be stronger than first half operating margins.\nOur adjusted tax rate projection is unchanged at 16% to 16.5% for the full year.\nAnd finally, our free cash flow estimates remain in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion.\nWe will continue to update you on market dynamics and financial expectations as we move through the remainder of the year.\nTo summarize, our performance in Q2 was slightly better than our expectations that we have communicated to you through the second quarter.\nWhile we anticipate some ongoing COVID pressure, we have more confidence in the momentum of the recovery and our ability to execute against that backdrop.\nAnd I'm going to now just hit three topics before we move to Q&A.\nFirst, I want to talk about execution in some of the product and pipeline highlights that we have under that category; second, I'm going to talk about our progress against active portfolio management, which is a big effort for us, obviously; and then third is innovation.\nAnd inside of that innovation, how we believe we're going to be able to drive attractive long-term growth that ultimately will deliver value to you, our shareholders.\nSo let's start with our team's execution.\nAnd I've said this before, and I'll continue to say it, that the things that ZB was able to directly control over the past year, 1.5 years, the team -- they've executed against it, they delivered against it.\nAnd I'm very proud of the team for doing that during a time of significant turbulence around them.\nAnd in Q2, in the recent weeks, we've hit key milestones with our ZB products and our solutions.\nROSA for Partial Knee was approved back in April, as we've talked about before.\nAnd our first patient surgery was actually performed early in the quarter, and we've continued to see good traction with that technology so far and great feedback so far.\nAnd it's important for us because partial knees, I think most of you know, is a market where ZB has a sizable market share position.\nSo we're very excited about the possibilities here, not just from a revenue standpoint, but also the potential impact for patients in the surgery area.\nAnd then if I just look at ROSA overall, we did see another strong quarter in Q2 of market demand and traction with ROSA total knee as well with placement momentum broadly continuing across the world, not just in the U.S. but internationally as well.\nWe want to see strength in the U.S., but we want to see that OUS, and we did get to see that kind of mix again in Q2.\nWe also saw capital expenses for our customers being much stronger in Q2 and -- And as a result of that, we saw a shift back to upfront sales of ROSA.\nSo more of those happened in Q2 than what we would typically see.\nAnd again, that just speaks to the strength of capital budgets and people's desire to acquire in that way.\nBut what is clear is that there's a real focus for hospitals to be bringing in robotic systems for their ORs whether they buy them outright or they get them through other arrangements.\nEither way, that momentum, that demand is very real.\nAnd ROSA continues to be a cornerstone, one of the key ones, of our ZBEdge suite of connected solutions.\nSo again, a lot of enthusiasm on what that will mean in coming years in terms of expansion of indications, and overall robotics penetration for ZB.\nAlso in the quarter, we saw Revision continue its very strong momentum.\nAgain, this is a great tip of the spear product for us, where we can go in and get competitive conversions and revision but also use those competitive conversions for access to the typical total knee as well for that surgeon.\nSo very exciting, not just on the revision side but also opening the door to a much larger opportunity to get their typical knee conversion as well.\nWe're also excited about adding another key variable to our ZBEdge portfolio of connected technologies, and that is our Persona iQ, which will be the first and only smart implant on the market.\nAnd we certainly still have to get FDA approval on that.\nWe're working diligently with them to help with any information they need to move that forward, and we're certainly hoping to receive approval in the relatively short term.\nBut ultimately, again, that time line is up to the FDA.\nAnd it's important for us because it takes the Persona implant, which is that known and trusted design in an implant and it combines it with Canary Medical's tibial extension, which has the sensor technology in it.\nAnd the combination of those two things will now inside the body, give us an opportunity to measure the range of motion of that patient, step count, walking speed and other mobility metrics that we believe are going to be indicators of post-surgery progress.\nSo again, helping us close the loop in those connected technologies that we have in ZBEdge.\nSo more to come when we hear back from the FDA.\nBut once we do get that approval, we would look to limited launch the technology for a quarter or two and then post that time frame, move into full launch.\nSo let's move to my second topic that is on active portfolio management, and our efforts around active portfolio management.\nWe have the ZB portfolio management strategy in place.\nWe have the right process in place, and we have definitely built our capabilities to move this forward over the last 1.5 years to two years.\nSo we're excited about this phase of the organization.\nAnd we're focused, as we said before, on mission-centric M&A that is WAMGR-accretive.\nSo in other words, weighted average market growth accretive to the organization.\nAnd you've seen us move this forward already with the selective tuck-in acquisitions that we did late last year that really illustrate our strategy at work.\nThese are smaller deals, again, tuck-in size deals that were designed to fill portfolio gaps and better position us as an organization in high-growth, high-priority markets like sports medicine, ASC and sternal closure where we truly do believe we have a right to win in attractive markets with strong profitability.\nAnd of course, there's the planned spin-off transaction of our spine and dental businesses that is fully underway and on track.\nWe continue to be encouraged by the energy and the momentum around NewCo.\nAs CEO Vafa Jamali, builds out his team and refines his corporate strategy, and we believe creates two independent and even stronger companies that is going to maximize value for not just our customers, but also for you, our shareholders.\nAnd that brings me to the last topic that we have before we move to the Q&A, and that's going to be around innovation.\nAnd really inside of innovation, how we see our ability to drive attractive long-term growth that will ultimately deliver value to all of our stakeholders, including you, obviously, our shareholders.\nWe are focused on evolving ZB from what I would define as a metal and plastic provider of implants into a leading med tech innovator.\nAnd we have a lot of shots on goal across a number of programs to do this, including a number of robotics launches over the near term, smart implants that we have today, but also the technology road map that we have in smart implants.\nNew functionality with mymobility and really just the broader ZBEdge ecosystem of those connected technologies that are going to help us drive mix benefit and share of wallet benefit, but also competitive conversions.\nAnd I've mentioned before, more than 70% of our new product development investment is directed toward ZBEdge and those connected technologies inside of ZBEdge.\nAnd our exclusive partnership with Apple continues to be productive and collaborative.\nAnd we forged several other tech alliances that we know are going to drive future innovation that will benefit patients.\nAnd I believe this fundamental shift is coming for ZB and for our core markets with technology advancements, potentially changing the care paradigm for patients in the future, and that's really what our focus is.\nSo the momentum is real on the innovation front.\nAnd we think it will ultimately allow us to drive long-term growth that is very attractive to us and to you.\nAnd most importantly, it also gives ZB the chance to really change the lives of patients around the world.\nAnd let me close by saying that I continue to be highly confident in the ZB team and our business momentum.\nWhile there continues to be uncertainty due to the global pandemic that we cannot control, I truly believe that we are ready and well positioned for success.\nAnd our strategy is absolutely working.\nThe transformation of our business is well underway, and I'm excited about the value we can drive for our shareholders on a go-forward basis.\nYour dedication to safety is critical and your focus on delivering on our mission is unmatched and you do it daily.\nI remain incredibly proud of what we're accomplishing and what we're accomplishing together.\nWith that, operator, may we have the first question, please?\nSummary:

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm joined today by Scott Buckhout, CIRCOR's president and CEO; and Abhi Khandelwal, the company's chief financial officer.\nThese expectations are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied by today's remarks.\nYou can find a full discussion of these factors in CIRCOR's Form 10-K, 10-Qs and other SEC filings also located on our website.\nCIRCOR delivered another strong quarter and executed well despite a challenging global supply chain environment.\nWe continue to see strong demand for our mission-critical products with year-to-date orders in backlog up 11% and 15%, respectively.\nNotably, Industrial organic orders growth was 28% in the quarter and our Industrial backlog is up 30% year-to-date, well above pre-pandemic levels.\nWhile aerospace and defense orders were down in the quarter due to timing, we're well positioned on growing commercial and defense programs and continue to launch new products for our customers.\nRevenue in the quarter was up 2% organically with operating margin up 80 basis points year over year and 240 basis points sequentially.\nEPS was up 39% versus last year.\nIt's important to note that revenue and earnings for the quarter were adversely impacted by supply chain disruptions that intensified through the last month of the quarter.\nMore specifically, we saw approximately $10 million of revenue pushed out of Q3 due to supplier input delays, logistics constraints and ongoing labor availability challenges.\nThis reduced our organic growth by roughly 5 points in the quarter.\nOur teams are working to mitigate the impact of supply chain issues by qualifying alternate suppliers, reengineering product with higher-grade materials and expediting shipping in order to continue delivering to our customers as committed.\nLooking forward, we expect these challenges to continue through the fourth quarter, resulting in a $15 million impact on revenue.\nFor the year, we expect approximately $25 million of revenue to push out of 2021.\nThis is reflected in our revised full year guidance, which Abhi will discuss later.\nOur strategic priorities on people, growth acceleration, margin expansion and free cash flow continue to be our guiding principles.\nI'll talk more about select accomplishments from Q3 later in the call.\nLet's start with the financial highlights on Slide 3.\nOrganic orders of $194 million in the quarter were up 15% versus prior year.\nWe saw a strong year-over-year increase of 28% in industrial with growth in all regions.\nOrders were down 10% in aerospace and defense due to the timing of large defense orders.\nOrganic revenue was $191 million, up 1% versus prior year.\nRevenue came in approximately $10 million lower than expected as a result of the supply chain challenges that Scott mentioned upfront.\nAdjusted operating income was $19 million or 10.1%, up 80 basis points from prior year and up 240 basis points from the previous quarter.\nFinally, we delivered $0.50 of adjusted earnings per share, up 39% versus prior year and generated free cash flow of $7 million.\nMoving to Slide 4.\nIndustrial organic orders were up 28% versus last year and down 9% sequentially.\nOrder growth was apparent across all regions, with particular strength in North America and EMEA.\nAftermarket orders were up 42% and our downstream aftermarket backlog is the highest it has been since 2017.\nOur book-to-bill ratio for the quarter and year-to-date is 1.1%, an indication of continued end market demand.\nIndustrial organic revenue was up 3% versus last year and up 1% sequentially.\nBy region, we saw year-over-year strength in EMEA, China and India, partially offset by lower revenue in North America.\nDespite the strong backlog from the first half, supply chain and logistic constraints became a bigger challenge than expected late in the quarter.\nThis adversely impacted revenue by $6 million or 5 points of organic growth.\nAdjusted operating margin was 8.7%, up 80 basis points versus last year and up 70 basis points versus Q2.\nImprovements were driven by productivity and continued value-based pricing up 2%, partially offset by higher inflation.\nWe expect further margin expansion in Q4.\nTurning to Slide 5.\naerospace and defense orders were $54 million down 10% versus last year and flat sequentially.\nOrders were lower versus prior year due to a large non-repeat defense order for the Dreadnought submarine in 2020.\nThe commercial aerospace recovery continues led by narrow-body programs.\nWe've seen sequential growth for the past three consecutive quarters.\nRevenue was $61 million, down 2% year over year and up 2% from prior quarter.\nSlightly lower revenue was primarily driven by lower defense OEM shipments, partially offset by recovery in commercial aerospace, up 10% and an improvement in defense aftermarket revenue, up 7%.\nSimilar to Industrial, aerospace and defense was also impacted by the global supply chain and logistic constraints, which negatively impacted the quarter by $4 million or six points of growth.\nFinally, operating margin was 24.2% in the quarter, up 50 basis points year over year and up 430 basis points from Q2.\nWe were still able to expand margin in a challenging global environment through pricing actions, productivity and favorable defense program mix.\nWe expect margin in Q4 to be roughly in line with prior year.\nTurning to Slide 6.\nFree cash flow in the quarter was $7 million, an improvement versus prior year but lower than expected.\nMore specifically, we had planned for higher milestone collections on long-term projects that moved out of the quarter.\nWe will collect this cash in future quarters as we complete these projects.\nWe reduced our total debt by $23 million versus prior year and ended Q3 with $445 million of net debt.\nDue to the lower earnings and cash outlook for the year, we now expect to improve our leverage by approximately 0.3 turns by the end of the year.\nWe will continue to use all free cash flow generated to delever.\nStarting with fourth quarter guidance.\nWe expect revenue to be up 1% to 3% organically, which includes $15 million of delayed revenue out of the quarter due to continued global supply chain, logistics and labor challenges.\nFor Industrial, we expect orders in Q4 to be up more than 10% and revenue is expected to be up 3% to 6% with growth across most end markets.\nIn A&D, fourth quarter orders are expected to be up greater than 50% driven by large OEM defense programs.\nRevenue, on the other hand, is expected to be flat to down 5%, with double-digit growth in commercial aerospace and defense aftermarket, offset by lower deliveries on defense programs.\nWe're expecting adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 to $0.65 in the fourth quarter with incremental and decremental margins of 30% to 35%.\nCorporate cost is expected to increase by $1 million versus prior year.\nFinally, we're planning for free cash flow of $10 million to $15 million in Q4 as we expect supply chain constraints will continue to impact our ability to complete in-process projects and collect milestone billings from customers.\nAs a result of the supply chain challenges late in Q3 and into Q4, we are revising our full year guidance.\nOrganic revenue is expected to be flat to down 2%, which reflects $25 million of revenue delayed out of the year.\nAdjusted earnings per share of $1.69 to $1.74 is lower as a result of this reduction in volume and free cash flow is expected to be $4 million to $9 million.\nNow, I'll hand it back to Scott to discuss our market outlook.\nLet's get started with our Industrial outlook on Slide 8.\nAs Abhi mentioned, in the third quarter, we saw continued order strength across all Industrial regions, with year-to-date backlog exceeding pre-COVID levels.\nIn Q4, we expect another quarter of double-digit orders growth led by North America.\nVirtually all end markets are expected to grow with commercial marine and downstream showing the largest year-over-year improvement.\nOn revenue, we expect modest improvement year over year with growth between 3% and 6%.\nOur short-cycle products are expected to be up 6% to 9% overall, primarily driven by aftermarket growth between 8% and 11%.\nOur longer-cycle end markets are expected to be roughly in line with last year.\nMany of our midstream and downstream customers are prioritizing aftermarket projects in the near term and our OEM project pipeline and backlog remain strong.\nIn commercial marine, we expect to see growth as shipbuilding activity in Asia continues to recover from historically low levels.\nFinally, pricing is expected to net roughly 2% and as pricing actions that were taken in Q2 and Q3 start to roll through our top and bottom line.\nMoving to aerospace and defense.\nQ3 orders were flat sequentially and down versus prior year, driven by a large non-repeat order in Q3 2020.\nWe expect a significant increase in Q4 orders.\nThe increase versus prior quarter and prior year is driven by large defense orders, continuing recovery in commercial aerospace and strong medical growth.\nA&D revenue in the fourth quarter is expected to be flat to down 5% versus prior year, primarily due to supply chain constraints and the timing of shipments for large defense programs.\nDefense revenue is expected to be down 10% to 15% with lower shipments on our OEM programs.\nOn the other hand, government orders for defense spares and MRO services picked up in the third quarter and we expect aftermarket revenue growth of 10% to 15%.\nCommercial aerospace is expected to continue its recovery with 25% to 30% growth following three consecutive quarters of sequential orders growth.\nRevenue from commercial air framers will be up 20% to 25% and mostly driven by the increased recovery in narrow-body aircraft production, most notably the A320.\nAftermarket revenue growth is expected to improve as aircraft utilization continues to increase.\nFinally, pricing is expected to be a net benefit of 3% for defense and 4% for commercial.\nI'd like to provide a third quarter update on our previously shared strategic priorities.\nThese priorities continue to guide what our team works on every day.\nWe're investing in growth.\nWe launched eight new products in Q3 and remain on track to deliver 45 new products by the end of 2021.\nI'll share two exciting new products on the next slide.\nNext, our teams continue to drive price increases in both Industrial and aerospace and defense to help offset growing inflation.\nMany of these price increases are permanent and will help drive top and bottom-line growth going forward.\nIn Industrial, we increased prices or implemented surcharges on many of our product lines in Q2 and Q3.\nThis drove the incremental price we're showing in Q3 and Q4.\nFor A&D, we typically match the length of our customer contracts with our supplier contracts, which has helped us mitigate material inflation.\nAdditionally, we continue to use value-based pricing where appropriate, especially in the aftermarket.\nTo drive margin expansion, we're making key investments at two of our biggest industrial sites in the U.S. and Germany.\nWith new modern equipment and processes implemented, we expect to see an improvement in safety, quality and productivity.\nWe're making really good progress with our 80/20 initiative.\nWith this structured approach, we've built a meaningful pipeline of growth and simplification opportunities and have already used 80/20 to implement strategic price increases at our U.S. site.\nEven more importantly, when talking to the teams, it's apparent that 80/20 is becoming a part of our culture and how we do business.\nBefore we move to Q&A, I want to highlight two new products we recently launched.\nThese products are particularly exciting because they show how CIRCOR is accelerating growth by leveraging our technical expertise into new growing markets where we do not currently play.\nFor the past several years, our team has been looking for opportunities to penetrate the green energy sector by leveraging our sealing technology and competence in designing and manufacturing products for high-pressure gas storage and transport applications.\nThe first set of products is for applications in the hydrogen market.\nHydrogen Isolation Valves and Modular Dome Regulators are critical components of the control system on hydrogen gas transportation trailers.\nOur balanced isolation valve has very low leak rates at extreme temperatures and pressures and the Modular Dome Regulator developed and manufactured in India allows stable pressure control.\nWe're the first supplier to meet the latest EU transportation regulation on the balance valve and we're able to secure more than $1 million of initial orders so far in 2021.\nThe second new product I want to share is a switch module with kinetic sensors for landing gear position detectors on commercial aircraft.\nOur switch module inside the aircraft wheel is engineered to detect the landing gear position and turn on the electric motor allowing the aircraft a taxi itself of no engine or towing.\nThis technology not only allows more efficient and safer ground transportation, but also contributes to reducing carbon emissions by burning less fuel.\nBoth of these new products showcase how we're accelerating growth through new product development and expanding our portfolio into new markets.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:In today's remarks by management, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial metrics.\nTotal births at the hospitals where we provided NICU services were up 2.8% on a same-unit basis, and our NICU days were up 5.6%.\nKey metrics such as payer mix and rate of admissions continue to be favorable compared to last year.\nIn fact, for MEDNAX as a whole, our patient volumes, revenue and adjusted EBITDA were all ahead of the same period in 2019, which suggests that at this time, our business has more than recovered from the significant negative impact to the COVID-19 pandemic that we experienced in 2020 and earlier this year.\nMark will give some details of our comparisons to pre-pandemic levels.\nOur revenue for the quarter of $493 million was above our internal expectations as was our adjusted EBITDA of $73 million.\nBased on our results, we now expect that our 2021 adjusted EBITDA will exceed our prior internal expectation of being above $240 million, and we now expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA of at least $250 million.\nWe also fully expect adjusted EBITDA next year to exceed $270 million, absent any major external events.\nThis is still a preliminary view into 2022, and we'll be in a better position to provide a more specific outlook after we finish our budgeting process, but I believe we're building momentum in our business.\nDemand for the critical services that our affiliated clinicians provide not only recovered from last year's disruptions, but continues to grow.\nWe also estimate that the broader growth efforts we have in place have supplemented this demand so far in 2021.\nI'll give some detail here as we see our growth concentrated in several areas.\nFirst, we target opportunities to expand practices or add practices and enhance our hospital relationships and also directly improve care through the coordination of different subspecialties that many patients need to access.\nSecond, in our daily operations, we strive to provide the best 24/7 support possible to our practices, which combines our patient service access initiatives, improving technology support, improving revenue cycle management efficiency, recruiting the best talent and old-fashioned focused managerial actions.\nAnd third, we look for acquisition opportunities where we see a clear combination of bolstering hospital relationships, adding to our patient care and support and a demonstrable growth path within that acquisition.\nAcquisitions haven't been a major part of our activity so far this year, but they could play just as important role as organic growth when we do see them strategically.\nThe sum of these efforts is continuing to ramp up post-COVID.\nAnd importantly, after all of our reorganization activities, pre-COVID.\nFor the 2021 year-to-date, we estimate that we have added approximately three percentage points to our adjusted EBITDA growth versus 2020, over and above the pure same-store growth that our affiliated practices have experienced.\nIn addition to all this activity, we recently announced our investment in Brave Care, and I want to explain why this is actually a very key piece of our growth plan.\nWe again believe that we are totally uniquely positioned to grow in the combined pediatric and primary emergent care space.\nIn our major markets, MEDNAX, under our pediatrics brand alone has the concentration of pediatrician population density, hospital relationships and partnerships and an enormous and growing base of vital patient relationships and our market managerial support that's already in place in our major markets.\nWith our NightLight acquisition in place and in fact, thriving, we have a nucleus from which recent growth.\nBut for this to grow, we needed the engine and the talent to enable building something really meaningful.\nBrave Care brings scalable internal controls and patient-facing technology, systems and protocols that will otherwise take us years to create.\nThe proprietary technology systems and operating platform that Brave's team has built over a two-plus-year period gives patients and their parents a truly seamless experience when they visit.\nIt also gives great remote connectivity to clinicians through an extremely user-friendly remote mobile app, so parents always have a resource at their fingertips.\nBrave Care systems are integrated with all facets of clinical operations.\nAnd my view of the power of the Brave system is not theoretical.\nIt's proven and up and running in their existing clinics in the Northwest.\nOur investment in Brave the company by an operating partnership agreement that provides Brave a long-term incentives to help us plan, develop, equip and open pediatric clinics over the coming years.\nThe clinic will be ours, and will be led and managed by our team working alongside the Brave team.\nAt a high level, looking at our geography of existing services, we believe that there's an opportunity for us to open more than 100 pediatric clinics across our footprint within a few years.\nAnd as we move forward, we'll share with you how this will materialize.\nWe believe that our growth will include both De novo development and acquisitions, and we're already in discussions with certain existing platforms that we think overlap well with us and they can integrate into our strategic growth.\nIn summary, looking at all these factors, strength in our core of amazing patient relationships served by our sector leading clinicians, strength in our balance sheet, our growth efforts, efficiency and a smart strategic expansion into primary urgent care that together gives me confidence in our diversified growth potential in '22 and beyond.\nNow, Mark will provide additional details on our third quarter activity.\nI'll begin by providing some detailed volume comparisons to 2019 to flesh out Mark's earlier comments.\nI'll then walk through where we stand on the number of projects we've discussed so far this year and how they flow through the income statement and finish with our financial position as it stands today, and how we're looking at our capital structure as we look forward.\nCompared to 2019 on a same unit basis for the quarter, our hospital volumes were up 4.4%, and office-based volumes were up 2.8%.\nWithin hospital-based services, our NICU days were up 1.4%, pediatric intensive care was up 42% and pediatric hospitalist volumes were up 14%.\nOn the office-based side, maternal fetal medicine volume was up 8.6%, while pediatric cardiology was down 9%, with this decline likely reflecting some deferrals of appointments during the quarter due to the surge in Delta cases.\nTurning to G&A, our overall spend in Q3 was down about $4 million sequentially.\nThis primarily reflects sequential reductions in certain operating and legal expenses as well as RCM savings related to our agreement with R1, which should increase further in Q4.\nIn terms of the transition of our revenue cycle activities to R1, to date, our metrics reflect that there hasn't been any disruption in service to our practices.\nDSOs and cash collection activity in the third quarter were in line with our expectations and with the prior quarter.\nI'll also reiterate that under the terms of our agreement, we realized near-term G&A savings, which are reflected in our current P&L.\nAnd we also expect to benefit over time from future improvements in RCM performance, yield and revenue enhancements.\nDuring the third quarter, we also completed the support services related to the PSA arrangement attached to last year's sale of our anesthesia organization.\nOur Q3 G&A still reflects a comparable run rate of cost to what we were incurring previously, and we'll refine our views on an appropriate G&A level as we finish up our budgeting for '22.\nBut you'll see that our reimbursement for those costs in Q3, which we record in our investment in other income line, declined substantially.\nIt was $0.5 million this quarter versus about $9 million in a year ago period.\nHowever, the strength of our core operations more than offset this decline, and in fact, enabled both year-over-year and sequential growth in adjusted EBITDA.\nFinally, our transformational and restructuring expense in Q3 was $4.2 million, which predominantly reflects the cost of terminating other third-party agreements as part of the R1 transition.\nAll told, within our updated internal expectation of 2021 adjusted EBITDA, we expect our fourth quarter G&A expense to be flat to down compared to third quarter, based largely on our expectation of RCM cost savings.\nThis reinforces our prior view that the second half G&A will be lower than the $137 million we incurred in the first half of the year.\nTurning to our capital structure, we continue to improve our leverage position in the third quarter.\nWe generated $67 million of operating cash flow, which exceeded the investments we made in capex, acquisitions and our Brave Care transaction.\nBased on 9/30 debt of $642 million and our 2021 adjusted EBITDA expectation, net leverage stands at about 2.5 times.\nAnd we would anticipate that to decline by year-end based on fourth quarter cash flows.\nDuring the quarter, we also reduced our revolving credit facility capacity from $1.2 billion to $600 million, all of which is currently available to us with no remaining covenant restrictions.\nAs most of you know, we have $1 billion in outstanding 6.25% coupon senior notes due 2027, making our debt structure fairly inefficient given our cash position and current net leverage.\nGiven that our notes are callable in January of '22, we will be reviewing the best debt structure for our size, profitability and growth in capital plans.\nWhile we haven't made any determinations yet, I anticipate that we'll be able to achieve meaningful savings and interest expense once we determine the most appropriate capital stack for our business as it exists today,and in the foreseeable future.\nSummary: ",

risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors, including those described in MFA's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and other reports that it may file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nBefore we begin, I want to again recognize our entire MFA team.\n2020 was obviously a very challenging year on many levels, and our team powered through the adversity and persevered.\nThere is no quit in this group.\nAnd I think we made extraordinary progress in the second half of 2020 and particularly in the fourth quarter.\nSo the fourth quarter of 2020 on a macro level was very much an extension of the third quarter.\nInterest rate volatility was again muted, and accommodative Fed monetary policy continued to provide support for risk assets with little indication that this will change materially in 2021.\nThe short end of the curve remains firmly anchored, consistent with the lower for longer narrative.\nTwo-year rates inched into the high teens very briefly in mid-November, but are barely in double digits so far in 2021.\nThe yield curve does continue to surreptitiously steepen as the 10-year backed up 23 basis points in the fourth quarter and another almost 45 since year end.\nWith two 10s at approximately 125 basis points, this hardly qualifies as a steep yield curve by historical standards, but it has steepened by about 45 basis points since the end of the year.\nThis is not surprising in light of political developments as the expectation of additional stimulus will continue to raise concerns about inflation.\nI do have to smile a little when I hear this recent chatter about higher rates, however, with 10s yielding 135 as 10s were above 3% less than two and a half years ago.\nYes, we're off the lows at least for 10 years, but let's not kid ourselves.\nWe are still in an extraordinary and unprecedented low-interest rate environment.\nAgency origination crowded out nonconforming production for much of 2020.\nBut with even a modest increase in agency eligible mortgage rates, we've seen an increase in production from non-QM and business purpose loans in recent months, with rates at particularly low levels and credit spreads very tight, suffice to say there are no cheap assets out there.\nHowever, these same market conditions have pushed yields on issued securities to all-time lows.\nSo while it is a difficult period for assets, it's an extremely attractive one for liabilities.\nAnd MFA has taken advantage of this opportunity to lock in low-cost, term, nonrecourse debt, which will substantially reduce interest expense in the future.\nIn addition, a strong housing market, together with our ability to actively manage residential mortgage credit assets, has also been reflected in our financial results as we have achieved better-than-expected results on credit-sensitive assets resulting in reversals of prior credit reserves and sales of REO properties at attractive levels.\nPlease turn to Page 4.\nWe reported GAAP earnings of $0.08 per share in the fourth quarter.\nThese results were driven by continued price appreciation of loans held at fair value and by further improvement in credit leading to credit loss reserve reversals.\nOn the other hand, fourth-quarter earnings were reduced by expenses related to the acceleration of discount in connection with our payoff of the $500 million, 11% Apollo/Athene senior note in September and October.\nWe also closed out the outstanding warrant position of Apollo/Athene during the fourth quarter through straight warrant repurchases and a warrant exercise via a combination of cash and cashless exercise.\nThere are no more outstanding warrants.\nAnd the overall dilution associated with these transactions was less than 4%.\nObviously, our GAAP book value would have been up by approximately 2.4% for the quarter had it not been for these warrants.\nEconomic book value also negatively impacted by 3.9% by the warrants was nevertheless unchanged at $4.92 during the fourth quarter as our loans held at carrying value appreciated further.\nWe repurchased 14.1 million common shares for an aggregate purchase price of a little over $50 million during the quarter at an average price of less than 80% of September 30 GAAP book value and less than 75% of economic book value.\nWe viewed these purchases as among the best available investments in the fourth quarter.\nOur leverage declined modestly over the quarter to 1.7:1, primarily due to the payoff of the Apollo/Athene debt.\nAnd we paid $0.075 dividend to shareholders on January 29.\nPlease turn to Page 5.\nOur net interest income for the fourth quarter nearly doubled versus the third quarter, despite slightly lower overall interest income as our interest expense reductions began to meaningfully drive results.\nInterest expense reductions are due to some repo borrowing cost spread reductions, securitizations, which replaced repo and non-mark-to-market financing with substantially cheaper funding and the payoff of the Apollo/Athene note.\nThe impact of these efforts was not fully reflected in the fourth quarter, as they were all done at varying points within the quarter.\nWe also took advantage of a strong housing market to opportunistically liquidate REO properties, which we own mostly through resolution of nonperforming loans purchased years ago.\nThese sales totaled over $270 million for the year and were executed at prices well above our carrying value.\nWe believe that the hard work that we've done since emerging from forbearance at the end of June has benefited stockholders as our total shareholder return was 62% from June 30 to December 31.\nClearly, we still have wood to chop, but we are committed to continuing to rebuild shareholder value.\nWe illustrate our investment portfolio and summarize our asset-based financing on this slide.\nThe investment portfolio has not changed materially since September 30.\nWe did add $111 million of loans in the fourth quarter.\nJust to review this pie chart, the loans held at carrying value on our balance sheet are represented in three slices of the pie chart.\nThe purple section, PCD, or purchased credit deteriorated loans, this is accounting speed for reperforming loans and other loans are seasoned performing loans.\nThe gray section, business purpose loans, are fix-and-flip and single-family rental loans.\nAnd the red section is the non-QM loans.\nOn the financing side, you can see that 67% of our asset-based financing is non mark to market.\nWith the SFR securitization that we closed at the beginning of February, this is now over 70%.\nPlease turn to Page 7.\nAgain, continuing the theme of aggressively taking advantage of available market opportunities, we've executed three additional securitizations on $1.2 billion of UPB at successively tighter levels.\nAs you can see on this page, AAA yields on bonds sold on the most recent two deals were below 1%, and the blended cost of debt sold was in the low ones and was in some cases almost 200 basis points lower than the cost of borrowing we replaced.\nAlso noteworthy is that while some of the financing that we replaced with these securitizations was non mark to market, the securitized debt is similarly non mark to market, nonrecourse, and term.\nSo we actually increased the amount of this more durable financing, while substantially lowering the cost.\nBonds sold generated cash of between 91% and 94% of UPB, which also produced approximately $250 million of additional liquidity.\nPlease turn to Page 8.\nPage 8 provides the details of the repurchase and exercise of the previously outstanding warrant position.\nThrough a straight repurchase of warrants on December 10 for $33.7 million.\nIn an exercise through a combination of cash and cashless exercise on December 28, we were able to limit the dilution of warrants granted, which was 7.5% at the time of grant to less than 4%.\nApollo/Athene holds 12.3 million shares or about 2.7% of outstanding shares, and we continue to maintain a strong partnership with both Apollo and Athene.\nThat said, we think that the elimination of any uncertainty around an outstanding warrant position should have a positive impact on our stock.\nPlease turn to Page 9.\nWe announced on our third-quarter earnings call that our board had authorized a $250 million stock repurchase program and we executed this during the open-window period in the fourth quarter by purchasing 14.1 million shares at an average price of $3.61, which was accretive to GAAP and economic book value by $0.03 and $0.04, respectively.\nIn addition, the $33.7 warrant repurchase was included under this plan.\nSo, all in, we deployed almost $85 million during the quarter and still have $165 million available under this authorization.\nPlease turn to Page 10.\nWe announced the redemption of our $100 million 8% senior notes due in 2042.\nThese $25 par bonds were issued in 2012.\nThis redemption, which was completed shortly after year end will save $8 million in annual interest expense.\nWe did book a noncash charge of $3.1 million in the fourth quarter for unamortized issuance expenses.\nThese $25 par bonds were sold primarily to retail investors, similar to 20 firms, and hence, the relatively high issuance expense.\nPlease turn to Page 11.\nSo in the feel-good department and just to demonstrate that it's not solely about the numbers, I'm happy to report two significant accolades for MFA.\nFor the second year in a row, MFA was included in the Bloomberg Gender Equality index.\nWe were recognized as one of 380 public companies across 44 countries and regions for our commitment to and support of gender equality.\nAdditionally, MFA has been certified as a Great Place to Work by the Great Place to Work Institute.\nThis award is based on anonymous employee feedback through an engagement survey that we conducted through this organization.\nThis important validation of our culture is a testament to our people.\nManagement does not make MFA a Great Place to Work, our people do.\nIf management has a role, it's simply to hire great people, and our team collectively creates our culture.\nIn today's work-from-home world, this recognition is also an important distinction for us for hiring as almost all recruitment is virtual these days.\nWhile we have certainly appreciated the support of Apollo, Athene, and our other financing counterparties during the challenging times of forbearance and over the past six months, we are pleased to close out 2020 with a significantly more durable mix of financing and having paid off most of our higher-cost debt.\nFurther, the execution of the warrant transactions has eliminated with a relatively modest solution, a potential source of uncertainty in our future results.\n2020 was certainly a year of significant and unusual items, and while earnings have become more stable since June, there were some residual nonrecurring items in Q4 that I will discuss further shortly.\nMSA entered 2021 with all significant items related to forbearance period financing effectively behind us.\nOur continuing efforts to pursue securitization and other forms of non-mark-to-market financing have lowered our cost of funds and generated liquidity while maintaining relatively low leverage.\nThese efforts are already meaningfully benefiting net interest spreads, and we expect it to continue for at least the short to medium term.\nMoving now to the detail of our Q4 results.\nNet income to common shareholders was $37.6 million or $0.08 per share.\nNet income includes $25.3 million or $0.06 per common share of expenses recognized on the repayment of the senior secured term loan from Apollo/Athene.\nRecall that as we elected to account for this financing at fair value, GAAP required us to allocate a portion of the day 1 loan-to-value or approximately $14 million of the associated warrants.\nThis was recorded in shareholders' equity, while the residual loan value of approximately $481 million is recorded on our balance sheet as a liability.\nDue to changes in interest rates and market spreads, the fair value of this liability declined in Q3.\nHowever, as the loan was repaid at par, rather than at fair value, expenses are recorded on payoff related to the reversal of prior unrealized gains and the difference between par and the previously recorded carrying value.\nThe subsequent execution of the associated warrant transactions did not impact earnings directly, but they did result in modest book value dilution, as Craig has already discussed.\nAway from the impact of the repayment of the senior secured debt and warrant transactions, our results for the quarter primarily reflect the ongoing recovery in residential mortgage asset valuations, a net reduction in our CECL credit loss reserves, and the previously mentioned improvement in net interest income.\nSpecifically, the key items impacting our results are as follows: net interest income for Q4 was $19.4 million, almost double Q3, and it reflects the following.\nFirstly, higher net interest spreads, primarily on our residential whole loan portfolio as the impact of financing initiatives start to take hold.\nThe payoff of the senior secured debt resulted in high net interest income by approximately $12 million.\nAnd as Craig noted, we redeemed our 8% senior notes early in January '21.\nQ4 net interest expense includes a noncash charge of $3.1 million for unamortized deferred expenses that we incurred when this debt was originally issued in 2012.\nIn addition, future quarterly interest expense will be $2 million lower as a result of this note redemption.\nI would also note that since exiting forbearance in June, we have lowered our cost of funds across our entire portfolio by 140 basis points to 3.1% December 31, 2020, and this falls even further to 2.9% with the senior note redemption.\nAlso, we reduced our overall CECL allowance in our current value loans to $86.8 million, primarily reflecting lower estimates of future unemployment used for credit loss modeling purposes, but also partially due to lower loan balances.\nThis reversal and other net adjustments to our CECL reserves positively impacted net income for the quarter by approximately $16 million.\nAfter the initial significant increase in CECL reserves taken in Q1 and uncertainty related to COVID-19 economic impacts were at the highest, we have reduced our CECL reserves by almost $60 million in the past three quarters.\nActual charge-off experience to date remains very modest, with less than $2.5 million of net charge-offs taken in 2020.\nNonetheless, we continue to take a cautious approach in making our estimates for credit losses given uncertainty in the U.S. economic outlook as the time line to a post-COVID-19 impacted economy remains unclear and given the current political environment.\nOnce again, our loans at fair value performed strongly this quarter.\nNet gains of $49.8 million were recorded, including $30.9 million of market value increases and $18.9 million of interest payments, liquidation gains, and other cash income.\nBy the end of 2020, our fair value loan portfolio recovered all of the market value declines that were recorded in the first quarter.\nFinally, our operating and other expenses were $20.4 million for the quarter.\nThis reflects a lower run rate than we would normally expect primarily due to adjustments to lower incentive compensation accruals that were finalized in the fourth quarter.\nWe continue to estimate that annualized G&A expenses to equity should run at about 2% each quarter.\nTurning to Page 13.\nThe fourth quarter for the non-QM space was a continuation from where the third quarter left off.\nOrigination volume increased over the quarter, and loan premiums paid have risen to levels seen prior to the pandemic.\nWe were able to purchase approximately $80 million in the fourth quarter and are on track to purchase over $100 million in the first two months of 2021.\nWe saw prepayment speeds increase over the quarter as mortgage rates for non-QM loans have come down in recent months.\nThe reduction in rates lagged conventional loans as non-QM originators had to rebuild capacity after reducing staff at the onset of the pandemic.\nWe closed on a minority investment in one of our origination partners in the quarter, providing the needed capital for them to be able to grow originations.\nWe believe the strategy of aligning our interest with select origination partners will allow us to effectively grow our portfolio over time, while ensuring loan quality.\nWe executed on two additional securitizations in the fourth quarter, bringing the amount of collateral securitized in 2020 to approximately $1.25 billion.\nAs Craig mentioned previously, the securitizations have lowered our financing costs and at the same time have provided additional stability to our borrowings.\nSecuritization, combined with non-mark-to-market term -- a non-mark-to-market term facility, has resulted in over 75% of our non-QM portfolio financed with non-mark-to-market leverage.\nAnd we expect to continue to be a programmatic issuer of securitizations.\nTurning to Page 14.\nA significant percentage of our borrowers in our non-QM portfolio have been impacted by the pandemic.\nMany of our borrowers are owners of small businesses that were affected by shutdowns across the nation.\nWe instituted a deferral program at the onset of the pandemic in an effort to help our borrowers manage through the crisis.\nThrough our services, we granted almost 32% of the portfolio temporary payment relief, which, we believe, helps put our borrowers in a better position for long-term payment performance.\nSubsequent to June, we reverted to a forbearance program instead of a deferral as the economy opened up.\nForbearance program instituted are largely now determined by state guidelines.\nFor clarity, the deferral program, tax on the payments missed to the maturity of the loan has a balloon payment.\nForbearance requires the payments missed to be repaid at the conclusion of the forbearance period.\nIf those amounts are unable to be paid in one month, we allow for the borrower to spread the amounts owed over an extended period of time.\nOver the fourth quarter, we saw an improvement in delinquencies compared to the third quarter as 60-plus day delinquencies dropped almost a full percentage point.\nIn addition, approximately 30% of delinquent loans made a payment in December.\nThe current state of affairs is unique as although we have seen economic stress and increase unemployment levels, home values have been improving, as low levels of supply combined with low mortgage rates have supported the market.\nIn addition, our strategy of targeting lower LTV loans should mitigate losses under a scenario with elevated delinquencies.\nIn many cases, borrowers, which no longer had the ability to afford their debt service, will sell their home in order to get the return of their equity.\nTurning to Page 15.\nOur RPL portfolio of $1.1 billion has been impacted by the pandemic but continues to perform well.\n81% of our portfolio remains less than 60 days delinquent.\nAnd although the percentage for the portfolio 60 days delinquent in status is 19%, over 24% of those borrowers continue to make payments.\nPrepayment speeds in the fourth quarter continued to rise as mortgage rates continue to be historically low.\nAnd while 30% of our RPL borrowers were impacted by COVID, we have worked with our servicers to provide assistance to borrowers and have seen improvement in delinquency levels over the quarter.\nTurning to Page 16.\nOur asset management team continues to drive performance of our NPL portfolio.\nThe team has worked through the pandemic in concert with our servicing partners to maximize outcomes on our portfolio.\nThis slide shows the outcomes for loans that were purchased prior to the year ended 2019, therefore, owned for more than one year.\n36% of loans that were delinquent at purchase are now either performing or paid in full.\n45% have either liquidated or REO to be liquidated.\nWe have significantly increased our activity, liquidating REO properties, selling 87% more properties as compared to a year ago.\n19% are still in nonperforming status.\nOur modifications have been effective as almost three-quarters are either performing or have paid in full.\nWe are pleased with these results as they continue to outperform our assumptions at the time of purchase.\nTurning to Page 17.\nThe fourth quarter saw a continuation of the trend we have experienced in 2020 of large principal paydowns in our fix-and-flip portfolio.\nA strong housing market, supported by record-low mortgage rates and limited housing inventory has allowed many of our borrowers to successfully complete the projects and sell quickly into a strong market.\nThis, combined with the seasoned nature of our portfolio, currently at weighted average loan rates of 17 months, led to us receiving $141 million of principal payments in the fourth quarter and a total of approximately $650 million for all of 2020.\nWe expect this trend to continue in 2021.\nMSA's fix-and-flip portfolio declined $118 million to $581 million in UPB at the end of the fourth quarter.\nPrincipal paydowns were $141 million, which is equivalent to a quarterly paydown rate of 59 CPR on an annualized basis.\nWe advanced about $11 million of rehab draws and converted $3 million to REO.\nWe began purchasing fix-and-flip loans again in the fourth quarter and acquired approximately $15 million UPB of new loans in the quarter.\nThe average yield for the fix-and-flip portfolio in the fourth quarter was 5.97%.\nAll of our fix-and-flip financing is non-mark-to-market debt with the remaining term of 18 months.\nAfter declining by approximately $40 million in the third quarter, the total amount of seriously delinquent fix-and-flip loans increased $19 million in the fourth quarter to $162 million.\nSo far in the first quarter, delinquency trends have been good, and we've seen delinquencies trend down again closer to third-quarter levels.\nSimilar to the third quarter, improved economic expectations and a strong housing market contributed to a decline in fix-and-flip loan loss reserves.\nLoan loss reserves declined by $4 million to approximately $18 million at the end of the fourth quarter.\nTurning to Page 18.\nSeriously delinquent fix-and-flip loans increased $19 million in the quarter to $162 million at the end of the fourth quarter.\nIn the quarter, we saw $25 million of loans paid off in full, $3 million cured to current of 30 days delinquent pay status, and $3 million of loans converted to REO, while $50 million became new 60-plus day delinquent loans.\nDespite the increase in delinquency in the quarter, we are pleased that delinquency levels have declined from the high levels we saw in the second quarter of 2020 and with the continued robust level of full payoffs we've seen from loans in serious delinquency.\nAs mentioned previously, we have seen delinquencies trend down in the first quarter, closer to the third-quarter delinquency loans.\nApproximately two-thirds of the seriously delinquent loans are either completed projects or bridge loans where limited or no work is expected to be done, meaning these properties should be in generally salable condition.\nIn addition, approximately 15% of the seriously delinquent loans are already listed for sale potentially shortening the time until resolution.\nWhen loans pay off in full from serious delinquency, we often collect default interest, extension fees, and other fees of payoff.\nFor loans, where there's meaningful equity in the property, these can help.\nSince inception, we have collected approximately $2.6 million in these types of fees across our fix-and-flip portfolio.\nWe believe that our experienced asset management team gives us a tremendous advantage in loss mitigation and the term non to market -- non-mark-to-market financing of our fix-and-flip portfolio allows us to efficiently work through our delinquent loans.\nWe believe that recent economic trends, in particular, the strong housing market with robust home price appreciation, combined with our loss mitigation efforts, can lead to acceptable outcomes on our delinquent loans.\nTurning to Page 19.\nOur single-family rental loan portfolio continued to perform well in the fourth quarter.\nThe portfolio yielded 5.27% in the quarter.\nThat number does not include prepayment penalties with our feature of almost all of our rental loans and are recorded in other income.\nWhen including those, the SFR portfolio yield was 5.99% in the fourth quarter.\nPrepayments increased in the quarter to a three-month CPR of 33%.\nThis was primarily due to payoffs on some of our three-year balloon loans that were approaching maturity.\nSo far in Q1, prepayments have trended back down to mid-teen CPR loans.\n60-plus state delinquencies increased modestly in the quarter to 5.6%.\nWe resumed our acquisition of rental loans in the fourth quarter and purchased $12 million of loans in the quarter.\nAs Craig mentioned earlier, we closed our first securitization consisting solely of business purpose rental loans in the first week of February.\nApproximately $218 million of loans were securitized.\nWe sold approximately 91% of the bonds at a weighted average coupon of 106 basis points.\nThis transaction lowers the funding rate of the underlying asset by over 150 basis points and increases the percentage of SFR financing that is non mark to market to 77%, up 54% from 23% at the end of the fourth quarter.\nI believe that MFA has made great strides since July 1st of last year.\nSignificant asset price appreciation drove earnings and book value.\nWe made substantial progress in moving our asset-based financing from expensive durable debt to equally durable, but materially cheaper securitized debt, paying off other expensive debt, repurchasing MFA common stock at material discounts to book, and most recently, the settlement and elimination of the outstanding warrant package.\nConsiderable market uncertainties still exist as the country and the world continues to face challenges around the pandemic, politics, and monetary and fiscal policy, but MFA is well-positioned to weather these uncertainties, respond to opportunities as they arise, and we are taking proactive steps to further position our company to thrive in the future.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Joining me on the call today are Dale Gibbons and Tim Bruckner, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Credit Officer.\nI will first provide an overview of our quarterly results and how we are managing the business in this current economic environment, and then Dale will walk you through the Bank's financial performance.\nI would like to focus on three trends that were present this quarter and will continue throughout the year: PPNR strength, credit provisioning expense and balance sheet growth.\nCombined, these trends will support earnings and capital growth and dividend distribution throughout 2020 and 2021.\nStarting with our second quarter results, Western Alliance generated net income of $93.3 million and earnings per share of $0.93, which was up 12% over the previous quarter.\nTangible book value per share of $27.84 was an increase of 4.2% over the previous quarter and 12.9% year-over-year.\nDriving these results was record operating pre-provision net revenue of $194.7 million, up 27.7% year-over-year and 19.1% quarter-over-quarter, with strong operating PPNR ROA growth of 18 basis points to 2.56%, which benefited from a recognition of $13.9 million in Payment Protection Program net fees.\nThese results demonstrate that the long-term earnings power of Western Alliance's core business remained strong amid the current economic and market volatility and will support significant ongoing capital accumulation, provide financial flexibility to fund balance sheet growth and accommodate changes to the allowance for credit losses or revisions to the economic outlook.\nIn the quarter, we recorded provision for credit losses of $92 million versus $51.2 million in Q1, which was primarily attributable to changes in macroeconomic forecast assumptions and net charge-offs of $5.5 million.\nDale will go into more detail in a bit on the specific drivers of our provisions, but our total loan ACL to funded loan ratio now stands at 1.39% or $347 million.\nContinuing our strong balance sheet momentum from 2019, loans increased $1.9 billion this quarter to $25 billion and deposits grew $2.7 billion to $27.5 billion.\nWithout the inclusion of PPP, loans grew a more modest $117 million and deposits demonstrated strong growth of approximately $1.6 billion.\nThe lower adjusted loan growth reflects muted demand, for which we held back our marketing activities and directed our focus to low-loss, high-quality loan segments, in addition to assisting our clients with their PPP applications.\nWe are encouraged by our pipeline and our opportunity to continue to grow in low-risk asset classes.\nThroughout the crisis, we have continued to attract new high-quality relationships to our bank at pricing and terms that would not have been available to us in other circumstances.\nFurthermore, this quarter's positive operating leverage supported our expanding PPNR, as our strong efficiency ratio improved sharply to 36.3% compared to prior year.\nBecoming more efficient during this economic uncertainty provides the incremental flexibility to maintain PPNR.\nLooking ahead, we will continue to invest in new product offerings and infrastructure to maintain operational efficiency, but Q2 levels are temporary and will eventually rise back to a sustainable level in the low-40s.\nHowever, our branch-light business model and our National Business Lines strategy continue to give us a competitive advantage.\nFinally, supported by our healthy PPNR generation, Western Alliance remains well capitalized with a CET1 ratio of 10.2%, which puts us in a position of strength, uniquely prepared to address what's ahead in this uncertain environment.\nNow, let's take a moment to provide an update on Western Alliance's response to the COVID pandemic.\nWe continue to follow CDC protocol and state-by-state return to work guidance, as our organization returns to the office.\nAs I initially described on our Q1 earnings call, WAL's unique credit risk management strategy is focused on establishing individual borrower level strategies and direct customer dialog to develop long-term financial plans.\nOur approach to payment deferral requests is to look for resourceful ways to partner with our clients, along with assessing their willingness and capacity to support their business interests.\nWe asked our clients to work hand in hand with us, whereby our clients contribute liquidity, capital or equity as an integral component to modify payment plans.\nOur approach collectively uses the resources of the borrower [Phonetic], government and bank's balance sheet to develop solutions that extend beyond the six-month window provided for in the CARES Act.\nSince April 1, WAL has funded $1.9 billion in PPP loans, which provided expedient liquidity to over 4,700 clients and benefited more than 150,000 employees.\nAt quarter end, $2.9 billion or 11.5% of loans had been modified with the bulk of these loans receiving principal and interest deferrals.\nExcluding the Hotel Franchise Finance segment, in which we executed a unique sector deferral strategy, the Bankwide deferral rate is approximately 5%.\nThe vast majority of our borrowers elect to utilize their own resources or PPP funds to bridge their business through the COVID crisis.\nI will provide an update on the portfolios most impacted by COVID later on, but I did want to highlight, in our Hotel Franchise Finance portfolio, our sophisticated hotel sponsors continue to see value in and support their properties with 92% of deferrals achieved by posting additional liquidity as a component of future payment deferrals.\nOur differentiated deferral strategy provides our customers the runway to resolve their liquidity issues and allow the appropriate time to recover.\nUnlike the cookie-cutter big bank approach, we established the expectation that the burden of responsibility of solving the long-term cash flow problems remains with our client base.\nIn our Gaming book, all borrowers continued to make interest payments as 90-day principle-only deferrals were approved for 37% of the portfolio.\nToday, 95% of our clients are open for business and are experiencing a strong rebound of demand.\nThese facts and the daily conversations with our people and clients help me feel confident that our credit mitigation strategy and early approach to proactively managing our risk segments is bearing fruit and puts Western Alliance in a strong position to come out on the other side of the pandemic in better shape than our peers.\nDale will now take you through our financial performance.\nOver the last three months, Western Alliance generated net income of $93.3 million or $0.93 per share.\nAs mentioned, net income was impacted by elevated provision expense for credit losses, driven by the adoption of CECL in Q1 and changes in the economic outlook during the quarter.\nNet interest income increased $29.4 million, primarily as a result of loan growth and lower rates on liabilities, as interest expense was cut in half.\nOperating non-interest income fell $5.2 million to $11.1 million from the prior quarter as lower levels of financial activity generated lower -- fewer fees.\nWe also benefited from several non-operating items during the period, including a recovery of approximately 40% or $4.4 million of the mark-to-market loss on preferred stock holdings we recognized in Q1.\nAdditionally, bank owned life insurance was restructured, resulting in an increase of $5.6 million as we surrendered and reinvested lower-yielding policies.\nIn addition to this gain, this should moderately increase BOLI revenue prospectively.\nFinally, non-interest expense declined $5.7 million, primarily from an increase in deferred compensation expense of $3.3 million related to PPP loan originations, plus a 52% decrease in deposit costs and a 64% decline in business development and travel expenses.\nStrong ongoing balance sheet momentum, coupled with diligent expense management, drove operating pre-provision net revenue of $194.7 million, which was up 27.7% year-over-year.\nWe believe this is the most relevant metric to evaluate the ongoing earnings power of the Bank.\nOur strong PPNR covered an 80% increase in provision costs from Q1 to $92 million, while driving earnings per share up 12% to $0.93 on a linked quarter basis.\nTurning now to our interest drivers, investment yields increased 4 basis points from the prior quarter to 3.02%.\nHowever, the overall quarterly portfolio yield decreased by 32 basis points from the prior year due to the lower rate environment.\nLoan yields decreased 45 basis points, following declines across most loan types, mainly driven by the 83 basis point reduction in one-month LIBOR during the quarter.\nYield reductions were partly offset by an average yield on our PPP loans of 5.02%.\nProspectively, we expect loan yields to trend toward the end-of-quarter spot rate shown of 4.66%.\nInterest-bearing deposit costs fell by 50 basis points in Q2 to 40 basis points, as this quarter received the full benefit of our proactive steps taken to reduce deposit rates immediately after the FOMC cut rates twice in March.\nThe spot rate of total deposits at quarter end was 20 basis points.\nTotal funding costs declined by 34 basis points when all of the Company's funding sources are considered, including non-interest-bearing deposits and borrowings.\nThe spot rate on total funding costs of 31 basis points is higher than the quarterly average due to the issuance of subordinated debt mid-quarter at 5.25%.\nWe expect funding costs to have stabilized at these levels as no further Fed actions are anticipated.\nDemonstrating the flexibility of our business model, despite a transition to a substantially lower rate environment during the quarter, net interest income rose 10.9% or $29 million during Q1 [Phonetic] to $298.4 million, up 17% year-over-year.\nOur origination of PPP loans, coupled with strong balance sheet growth and immediate steps taken to reduce the cost of interest bearing deposits, counteracted the decline in prime and LIBOR.\nPPP lending supported our net interest margin during Q2 as SBA fees were recognized, resulting in a loan yield of 5.02% in this sector.\nWe estimate most of PPP loans will be forgiven within eight months from origination.\nOf the $43 million in triple PPP loan fees we received from the SBA net of origination costs, one-third or $13.9 million was recognized in the second quarter.\nNet interest margin contracted 3 basis points to 4.19% during the quarter, as our earning asset yield fell 34 basis points, but was offset by an equal improvement in funding costs.\nOur outsized deposit growth and mounting cash reserves will continue to place downward pressure on the NIM until the excess liquidity can be deployed, which we expect will take two to three quarters.\nWith regards with our asset sensitivity, our rate risk profile has declined notably over the last year, and we are now asymmetrically positioned to benefit from any future rate increases as 70% of our loan portfolio is behaving as a fixed rate since floors on variable-rate loans have largely been triggered.\nOur estimated net change of net interest income in a 100 basis point parallel shock higher is 4.2% over the next year, and we now project zero net interest income at risk if rates move lower.\nTurning now to operating efficiency, on a linked quarter basis, our efficiency ratio improved 550 basis points to 36.3%, which continues to demonstrate our industry-leading operating leverage.\nAs mentioned earlier, the non-interest expense improvement is related to an increase in deferred compensation expense of $3.3 million unrelated PPP loan originations, plus a 52% reduction in deposit costs and a 64% decrease in development and travel costs.\nNormalizing for PPP net loan fees and interest, the efficiency ratio for Q2 would have been 38.4%.\nAdditionally, our branch-light model has given us the flexibility to identify two locations that we are transitioning from full service offices to loan production facilities.\nOur core underlying earning power remained strong as pre-provision net revenue ROA increased 18 basis points from the prior quarter to 2.56% and return on assets was flat at 1.22%.\nWhile we expect the 2.56% is a high watermark as elevated liquidity will hold down the margin, we believe we will continue to maintain industry-leading performance.\nThis provides a significant flexibility to fund ongoing balance sheet growth, capital management actions or any credit demand.\nOur balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans increased $1.9 billion to $25 billion, and deposit growth of $2.7 billion brought our deposit balances to $27.5 billion at quarter end.\nThe loan to deposit ratio fell to 90.9% from 93.3% in Q1, as our strong liquidity position continues to provide us with balance sheet capacity to meet all funding needs.\nOur cash position increased to $1.5 billion as deposit growth continues to outpace credit expansion.\nWhile this impairs the margin near term, we believe it provides us with inventory for good credit growth as demand resumes.\nOf note, during the quarter, we issued $225 million of bank level subordinated debt to ensure ample capacity to support our growth trajectory by bolstering our total capital ratio.\nFinally, tangible book value per share increased $1.11 over the prior quarter to $27.84, an increase of $3.19 or 13% over the prior year.\nThe vast majority of the $1.9 billion in loan growth was driven by increases in C&I loans of $1.6 billion, residential loans of $154 million and construction loans of $138 million.\nResidential and consumer loans now comprise 9.8% of our loan portfolio, while our construction loan concentration continues to trend downward and is now at 8.8% of total loans.\nExcluding PPP loans, loan growth was $117 million, which was affected by line paydowns from draws during Q1 and offset by growth in residential and construction.\nHighlighting our continued focus on growth in low-risk assets, tech and innovation loans were flat in total, while within the category, capital call and subscription lines grew $35 million, mortgage warehouse loans grew $325 million and residential mortgages grew $165 million.\nCorporate finance loans decreased $233 million compared to the increase we saw in Q1 as borrowers repaid their line draws, reducing utilization rates down from 38% to 17%.\nAnd all loan growth was fully funded by deposit growth.\nWe continue to believe our ability to profitably grow deposits is both a key differentiator and a core value driver to our firm's long-term value creation.\nNotably, year-to-date deposit growth of $6.1 billion is higher than the annual deposit growth of the Company in any previous calendar year.\nDeposits grew $2.7 billion or 10.9% in the second quarter, driven by increases in non-interest-bearing DDAs of $2.3 billion, which now comprise over 44% of our deposit base.\nPPP loan related deposits grew $1.1 billion, and savings and money market accounts were up $845 million.\nHOAs contributed to total deposit growth by adding $136 million, and Tech & Innovation increased $262 million as capital raising activity during the quarter was active.\nExcluding PPP-related deposits, growth would have been $1.6 billion or 6.5%.\nRegarding asset quality, special mention loans increased $292 million and non-performing loans rose $53 million during the quarter.\nOne-half of the increase in SM loans are from the hotel portfolio.\nGenerally consistent with our previously discussed Tech & Innovation rating guidelines, these loans were downgraded as we do not have clear line of sight to more than six months of remaining operating liquidity.\nThese borrowers are current, however, as they made loan prepayments that were -- we required for us to consent to a deferral modification.\nOur other borrowers in this segment are also paying as agreed or provide cash -- or provided cash payments when the -- that when coupled with the payment deferral, have no additional debt service requirement until sometime in 2021.\nSecond, we've aggregated an event planning and leisure sub-segment, in which the business models are essentially dependent on social distancing relief, and in some cases, the resumption of group events.\nOf the $150 million total exposure to this sector, $60 million has been moved to special mention and $40 million to non-performing.\nWhile the portion to FM has over a year of current liquidity, it was downgraded as the revenue models have been sharply impaired.\nThe loan moved to non-performing has had -- now has limited remaining liquidity.\nThe remainder of the migration to special mention is fairly granular from our client spreads throughout our metropolitan markets where liquidity has been tightened.\nThese loans are generally collateralized by an array of assets that include real property.\nFrequently, a loan may be downgraded to SM because of liquidity concerns, even though collateral average may be considerable.\nFor this reason, migration to special mention has a low correlation to ultimate credit losses as over the past five years, less than 1% has moved through to charge-off.\nOur allowance for credit losses rose $86 million during the quarter as the change in mix of the balance sheet released $4.2 million of reserves and changes to the outlook accounted for $96.2 million, including covering $5.5 million of net charge-offs.\nRevisions to the CECL macroeconomic outlook assumptions, which have declined since March 31 but have generally stabilized since April, accounted for the entire net reserve build.\nThe earning [Phonetic] allowance related to loan losses was $347 million excluding held-to-maturity securities, or 1.39% of funded loans, an increase of 25 basis points.\nThe current reserve build reflects our best estimate of the future economic environment as of quarter end, including the impact of government stimulus programs and credit migration actions.\nWe have migrated to a consensus economic outlook of Blue Chip Economic Forecasts as it tracks largely management's view of a recession and recovery.\nNet credit losses of $5.5 million were recognized during the quarter, which were mainly attributable to small business and C&I borrowers.\nIn all, total loan ACL to funded loans increased 25 basis points to 1.39% in Q2 as provision expense for loan losses of $87.3 million significantly outpaced net loan charge-offs.\nRelative to most other banking companies, our lower consumer exposure continues to result in lower total loan losses.\nI would now like to briefly update you on the current status of a few exposures to the industries generally considered to be the most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring the last two weeks of the quarter, Tim Bruckner, the credit administration team and I conducted the most extensive quarterly portfolio review process in the Bank's history.\nThe review covered 95% of WAL's outstanding loan balances, excluding purchased residential mortgages.\nOur $2 billion Hotel Franchise Finance business, focused on select service hotels, represents approximately 8.2% of the loan portfolio.\nThe financial flexibility of these borrowers is maximized by working with financially strong institutional operating partners with deep industry experience, expertise and conservative underwriting structures focused on loan to cost.\nOccupancy rates are tracking national averages, currently around 46%, which have tripled compared to the lows in April of around 15% and are now only a few percentage points short of fully covering estimated operating expenses.\nAt approximately 55% occupancy, select service hotels are also estimated to cover amortizing debt service.\nAs a testament to the operating models of the select service hotels, revenue per available room has fallen 55%, but they have been able to shrink their cost structure by over 40%.\nAnd as a result, the typical hotel is operating at breakeven.\nNearly 85% of our hotel portfolios either pay as originally agreed or on proactive payment deferral plans that bridge into 2021.\nWe feel positive about the trajectory of the portfolio and that our proactive deferral strategy will produce relatively stronger credit performance, given the active support of our sponsors have demonstrated through the material upfront payments made to receive deferral plans.\nTo augment the strategy, we nearly doubled the reserve of the portfolio this quarter and increased the ACL to loans ratio by 93 basis points to 1.95%.\nThe investor dependent portion of our Technology & Innovation segment is primarily focused on lending to established growth companies with successful products and strong investor support, which provides greater operating and financial flexibility in this environment.\nOverall, a significant sponsor support and an active fund raising environment continue for these growth firms.\n81% of loans have greater than six months' remaining month liquidity, up from 77% in Q1.\nAdditionally, we have had over 50 clients successfully raise over $1.4 billion in new capital since March 1.\nOur $509 million Gaming book is focused on off-strip, middle market gaming-linked companies whose revenue is driven by local demand factors.\n37% of the portfolio is on 90-day principle-only payment deferral as they continue to cover interest payments.\nAdditionally, these clients benefited from $28.4 million of PPP loans.\nInclusive of our recent closure mandates in Nevada to limit certain business activities, businesses representing 95% of the portfolio are open for operations.\nUpon reopening, all casinos borrowers are performing at or above their COVID operating plan, and no loans were downgraded to criticized or classified at quarter end.\nLastly, our commercial real estate portfolio continues to perform as 99% of our industrial leases are current.\n90% of our office rents are paid on par with the national average.\nThe sub-segment of CRE that's showing signs of stress for the industry is retail.\nWAL's CRE retail exposure of $676 million is focused on local personnel service-based retail strip centers with limited merchandise retail exposure.\nSimilar to HFF, we are utilizing deferrals to support a path to recovery for these borrowers, while requiring demonstrated sponsor support with high level of additional payment reserves.\nOf note, 67% of WAL's [Phonetic] investor CRE retail tenants paid May's rent payments compared to 50% nationally.\nWe continue to generate significant capital and maintain strong regulatory capital ratios with tangible common equity to total assets of 8.9% and a common tier 1 ratio of 10.2%, an increase of 20 basis points during the quarter.\nExcluding PPP loans, TCE to tangible assets is flat from Q1 at 9.4%.\nInclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payment of 25% per share, our tangible book value per share rose $1.11 in the quarter to $27.84, an increase of 12.9% in the past year.\nWe continue to grow our tangible book value per share at a rate significantly faster than our peers as it has increased three times that of our peers over the last 5.5 years.\nIn conclusion, we expect loan growth to be fairly flat in Q3 as PPP pay-offs and forgivenesses are largely offset by the organic growth in low risk asset classes.\nDepending on the timing of the realized PPP forgiveness, organic loan growth should offset PPP run-off, resulting in net loan growth being relatively stable.\nWe anticipate another strong quarter of deposit growth in Q3, primarily by executing on our deposit initiatives and achieving our market share gains in mortgage warehouse.\nThe anticipated deposit growth and resulting liquidity will primarily be deployed into residential mortgage assets to improve returns on cash over the next several quarters.\nHowever, as PPP loans roll off and liquidity continues to rise, pressure on NIM will also continue until it can be fully deployed into productive assets.\nWhile we are pleased with our deposit growth, the pace is exceeding loan growth.\nAnd as Dale mentioned, it will take several quarters to redeploy this liquidity into low risk loans or assets providing yields greater than the Fed's current offering.\nOperating PPNR is expected to decline modestly as PPP income begins to abate, loan balances growth -- grow begin -- growth begins to reignite and the deployment of excess liquidity continues and deferred loan origination costs return to normal levels.\nOur long-term asset quality and loan loss reserves are informed by the economic consensus forecast, which is [Phonetic] consistent going forward, should preclude material increases in reserve levels from this point.\nThe pace, timing and size of future net charge-offs are uncertain to us as we have not seen a material increase in delinquencies or substandard [Phonetic] migration.\nFinally, our strong capital base and access to ample liquidity will allow us to both take advantage of any market dislocations to grow in low-risk areas and to address any credit demands in the future.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These risks and other factors could adversely affect our business and future results.\nFor more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our 10-K or 10-Q that we have on file with the SEC and the company's other SEC filings.\nIf you did not receive a copy, these documents are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at dukerealty.com.\nThe fundamentals in our business continue to be the best we've ever seen.\nWe now have had three successive quarters of demand at or near all-time records, and projected market level rent growth has risen from the 10% range to the mid-teens percent nationally and in some submarkets as high as 35%.\nDuring the quarter, we began roughly $350 million of new developments with expected strong value creation and IRRs, and we raised our full year guidance on starts once again.\nCap rate compression and rent growth continued to outpace material cost increases, allowing us to drive improved margins.\nThe margins on our development pipeline are now over 60%, and our core portfolio achieved record rent growth of 22% on a cash basis from second-generation leasing activity.\nThese quarterly results and our improved outlook for the balance of the year resulted in our raising key components of our 2021 guidance, including year-over-year core FFO growth now expected to be at 13.8% and growth in AFFO per share of 11.6%.\nBased on these results and our optimism about the balance of the year, we have raised the dividend by almost 10%.\nMark will go over these changes in detail momentarily.\nI'll first cover market fundamentals and then review our overall operational results.\nIndustrial net absorption registered 121 million square feet, which is only one million square feet less than the all-time record.\nThis was more than enough to offset the new supply as completions came in at about 79 million square feet.\nThis positive net absorption over deliveries for the quarter reduced vacancy down to 3.6%, setting yet another record low.\nThe strong fundamentals increased nationwide asking rents during the third quarter by 10% compared to the previous year.\nCBRE now projects demand for the full year in the mid-300 million-square-foot range and likely to break the all-time 2016 record of 327 million square feet.\nCompletions for the year are projected to be about 270 million square feet.\nNational asking rents for the full year are expected to be in the mid-teens with some markets like Northern New Jersey and Southern California likely to see increases of 30% to 35%.\nThe reaction to supply chain bottlenecks continues to be in the early stages of a long-term boom for our sector, with CBRE reaffirming roughly 1.2 billion square feet of projected aggregate demand over the next five years.\nIncreasing inventory levels, safety stock, consumer spending and online shopping trends are driving much of this demand.\nDemand by occupier type remains broad-based with e-commerce and logistics services companies continuing to make up roughly 60% of our activity, with the e-commerce contribution about 10% lower compared to 2020 and the 3PL contribution about 10% higher than this time last year.\nIt is also noteworthy that Amazon's share of demand this year is about 10% of overall total demand compared to 18% of demand in 2020.\nTurning to our own portfolio.\nWe executed a very strong quarter by signing 9.5 million square feet of leases.\nThe strong lease activity for the quarter resulted in continued growth in rents within our portfolio as we reported 35% on a GAAP basis and 22% cash, notably, with only 25% of our transactions occurring in coastal Tier one markets.\nWe now project our mark-to-market on a GAAP basis within our portfolio to be 28%.\nWe started $349 million of new development totaling two million square feet that consisted of six speculative projects and two build-to-suits in the quarter.\n80% of this volume was in our coastal Tier one markets.\nOur team has continued to lease our speculative projects successfully as evidenced by stabilizing seven new developments during the quarter and increasing the development pipeline to 60% leased.\nTo put our track record of leasing speculative projects in context, the $897 million of projects that we placed in service this year through September 30 increased from 39% leased when the construction started to 90% leased when they were placed in service.\nFor all of our speculative developments we've started since the beginning of 2019, our average lease-up time is less than two months from the dates the projects were placed in service.\nOur team's continued ability to quickly lease up speculative development projects will be a key contributor of our future growth.\nSticking with the development pipeline.\nAt quarter end, we totaled $1.1 billion with 86% of this allocated to Tier one markets and 60% preleased.\nWe now expect value creation from this pipeline of over 60%, which is primarily due to rapid appreciation of rents and land.\nWe are also very proud to remind everyone that we target only developing the lead certified standards.\nWe expect the lead percent of our total NOI to trend toward 25% by the end of 2022.\nOn the construction cost side of things, our teams have taken steps to mitigate schedule risk related to materials such as contracting for steel nearly a year out, and we've only had minor delays in a few of our projects.\nThe outlook for new starts is strong and is reflected in our revised guidance of our midpoint being up $175 million.\nOn a longer-term basis, we either own or control land, primarily in coastal infill markets that can support roughly $1 billion of annual starts over the next four years if the supply/demand picture remains robust, which we believe it will.\nIt is also important to note the market value of the land we own is about 2 times our book basis, and on average, we've only owned this land for about two years.\nLand we control and will be closing over the next few quarters is also well below market.\nThe favorable land value, we will continue to support high development margins and very good IRRs long term.\nAnd overall, we believe we are very well positioned to continue to lead the sector and grow through new development.\nFor the quarter, disposition proceeds totaled $738 million, including outright sales and contributions to joint ventures.\nThe outright sales comprise our entire remaining portfolio in St. Louis, three buildings in Indianapolis and one building in Chicago.\nThe activity also included the first two tranches of the Amazon property contributions to our newly formed joint venture with CBRE Global Investors.\nThe pricing in aggregate was at an in-place cap rate of 4.8%, which was inflated a bit by a high 5% cap rate for the St. Louis portfolio in which pricing was impacted by expected rent roll-downs on looming tax abatement expirations.\nWe acquired one facility in the third quarter totaling $24 million, a 63,000-square-foot facility in the San Gabriel Valley submarket of Southern California.\nThis third quarter activity has further shifted the geographic position of our portfolio on an NOI basis to approximately 40% in the coastal Tier one market.\nLet me also note that just after quarter end in very early October, we closed on the sale of a 517,000-square-foot Amazon facility in Columbus, Ohio.\nThis sale represents our final property disposition for the year.\nI will now turn our call over to Mark to discuss our financial results and guidance update.\nCore FFO for the quarter was $0.46 per share, which represents 15% growth over the $0.40 per share from the third quarter of 2020.\nAFFO totaled $151 million for the quarter compared to $135 million in the third quarter of 2020.\nSame-property NOI growth on a cash basis for the three and nine months ended 2021 compared to the same periods of 2020 was 3.8% and 5.3%, respectively.\nThe growth in the same-property NOI for the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020 was mainly due to rent growth, partially offset by an 80 basis point decrease in occupancy in our same-property portfolio due to an extremely high occupancy comp of 98.6 in 2020.\nOur balance sheet is in great shape with plenty of dry powder to fund our growth.\nWe had $273 million of sale proceeds in 1031 escrow accounts at the end of the quarter that will be used to fund near-term building and land acquisitions.\nWe finished the quarter with reduced leverage as a result of the significant disposition activity during the quarter, but intend to return to recent leverage levels by the end of the year as we continue to grow through development.\nAs a result of our continued strong operating results, we announced revised core FFO guidance for 2021 in a range of $1.71 to $1.75 per share compared to the previous range of $1.69 to $1.73 per share.\nThe $1.73 midpoint of our revised core FFO guidance represents a nearly 14% increase over 2020.\nFor same-property NOI growth on a cash basis, we have increased our guidance to a range of 5% to 5.4% from the previous range of 4.75% to 5.25%.\nWe continue to outperform our underwriting assumptions for speculative developments, both in the timing of lease-up and in the rental rates we're achieving, while we have maintained a solid list of build-to-suit prospects as well as land sites in various stages of due diligence and entitlements.\nBased on these prospects, our revised guidance for development starts is between $1.3 billion and $1.45 billion compared to the previous range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion.\nWe've updated a couple of other components of our guidance based on our more optimistic outlook as detailed in a range of estimates exhibit included in our supplemental information on our website.\nIn closing, I'm incredibly proud of our team's execution in leasing, capital deployment and development starts.\nWe started the year with very solid growth expectations and have exceeded every one of them, resulting in a nearly 14% growth in core FFO at the revised midpoint.\nOur shareholders should be very pleased with our dividend increase of $0.025 per share.\nThis 9.8% increase marks our seventh straight year of annual dividend increases, representing a growth of over 65% over that period.\nLooking out to the next few years, our operating platform is perfectly positioned to take advantage of the numerous growth drivers benefiting the logistics sector.\nThese drivers, combined with the undersupply of new available warehouse product, will allow us to maintain our high occupancy rates and rent growth while creating substantial profit margins on our $1 billion-plus development pipeline.\nThe net result of these factors is our belief we can continue to grow earnings at approximately 10% pace for the foreseeable future.\n[Operator Instructions] Sean will now open it up and take our first question.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Joining us today are Patti Poppe, our Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Foster, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nThese statements are based on assumptions, forecasts, expectations and information currently available to management.\nWe also encourage you to review our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2021.\nThis quarter, we delivered non-GAAP core earnings of $0.24 per share.\nWe are reaffirming our 2021 non-GAAP core earnings per share guidance of $0.95 to $1.05, and we no longer expect to issue equity in 2021.\nWe continue to see rate base growth of 8.5% and longer-term earnings-per-share growth of 10%.\nChris will provide more details on the financials in just a bit.\nAs you saw at Investor Day, our experienced team is driven and focused on delivering clean energy safely every day.\nWe have a very sophisticated and continually improving PSPS algorithm year-over-year.\nIn fact, when we backcast our current model to the previous utility caused fires between 2012 and 2020, we would have prevented 96% of the structure damage had the current model been in place.\nThis year, we also implemented enhanced power line safety settings to address wildfire risk we faced from extreme drought conditions.\nIn fact, since the end of July through mid-October, we saw 46% decrease in CPUC reportable ignitions in high fire threat districts and an 80% reduction in ignitions on enabled circuits.\nThese enhanced safety settings make our system and our customers safer.\nWe're delivering on the 2021 wildfire mitigation plan with our lean operating system and deploying it across the entire Company to deliver predictable outcomes for customers and investors.\nIn addition to quarterly operational, financial and regulatory updates, I'd like to spend some time on the work done and the changes made since 2019 that make our system safer and more resilient.\nLet's start on slide 4, with how we've improved our PSPS program since 2019.\nIn 2019, we had seven events that impacted over 2 million customers.\nSince then, we've installed approximately 1,300 weather stations, 500 high definition cameras and over 1,100 sectionalizing devices to better pinpoint exactly where we need to initiate PSPS.\nOur 2021 PSPS algorithms are informing -- are informed by more granular weather forecasting and we're using Technosylva software to incorporate machine learning into our fire spread modeling, so we can better predict where the risk is on our system in real time.\nOur continuous improvement approach applies to addressing safety risks while minimizing disruption to our customers.\nAs you can see on slide 5, our model shows that by backcasting our new 2021 PSPS algorithm on to 2012 through 2020, we would have prevented 96% of the structure damage from fires caused by overhead electrical equipment in our service area.\nAs you know, this year, we experienced extreme drought conditions in our service area.\nDue to these conditions, we saw fire spread on non-red flag warning days.\nWe assess these risks and identified where we needed to focus.\nGuided by former CAL FIRE and local fire authority personnel who now work for PG&E, we implemented additional wildfire mitigation in our high fire threat areas.\nYou can see the results of our safety focus on slide 6.\nWe've compared the data since we implemented our enhanced powerline safety settings against the most recent three-year averages.\nWhat we've seen is a 46% reduction in CPUC reportable ignitions in our high fire threat districts from the end of July through mid-October.\nOn the specific circuits where we first implemented the enhanced powerline safety settings, we've seen an 80% decrease in ignitions over the same time period.\nWe're working hard to reduce the customer impact from these new necessary protocols.\nWe've optimized our protective device settings on all circuits that have enhanced powerline safety settings and we've adjusted our circuit restoration procedures.\nThese enhancements are making outages smaller and faster to restore, while still removing the ignition risk.\nWe're communicating transparently, our commitment to preventing fires of consequence to communities where enhanced powerline safety settings are in place.\nLet me make it real with one story.\nOn Monday, October 11, we initiated a PSPS event that affected about 20,000 people.\nThe wins came in as forecasted, and in 33 instances, outside of the PSPS zones and the highest wind areas, our lines automatically de-energized due to the unpredictable disturbances and potential risk was mitigated.\nWe know our protocols are working.\nWe will continue to work around the clock to make these solutions less disruptive to customers and know that we are keeping them safe while we do that.\nOur experience since implementing these settings in late July will serve as an important guide for our 2022 planning.\nAs we continue to keep people safe each day, I want to talk a bit about the risk reduction work we've completed since 2019.\nLet's start on slide 7 with our enhanced inspection.\nAs you can see, we're on track to complete our enhanced inspections on 0.5 million assets in 2021 in our high fire threat areas.\nThese inspections are scheduled to be conducted every year on all assets in Tier 3 and every three years for all assets in Tier 2.\nAt the bottom of this slide, you'll see a couple of points on our routine inspection program.\nWe get a lot of attention internally, but really isn't well known outside of PG&E.\nAs you can see in the green box, we conduct vegetation management inspections across our entire system annually and in high fire threat areas, we patrol those conductors twice a year.\nIn 2021, we plan to complete 1800 miles of enhanced vegetation management work, combined with what we completed in 2019 and 2020 adds up to over 6,000 miles by the end of this year.\nWhile we are focused on keeping people safe with inspections and vegetation management, we're also focused on the longer-term hardening of our system.\nIn the last three months, we've made great progress against our multi-year 10,000 mile undergrounding program.\nOur engineering team is scoping out the work as you'll begin to see in our 2022 wildfire mitigation plan.\nOur goal is to engage the entire community around the imperative of undergrounding and we are succeeding.\nWe are engaging stakeholders through undergrounding advisory group with representatives from environmental groups, labor, telecom, consumer advocacy groups, county tribes among others.\nAnd we're gathering ideas on innovations in engineering, equipment and construction from the world's best through our RFI process.\nWe're continuing to work on system hardening as you can see here and we'll provide an update on how we're thinking about that work as we further develop our undergrounding program.\nAs a sneak peek, I'll share one project we completed this year.\nIn September, we completed undergrounding powerlines in Santa Rosa, which resulted in 11,000 customers who will no longer be impacted by PSPS.\nThis is one of many projects.\nThis is the right solution for our customers in that area and that's why we did it.\nSimple solutions based on customer needs.\nAs I mentioned, more to come on our undergrounding plans as we move into early 2022.\nAt PG&E, effective implementation of our wildfire mitigation plan is enabled by our lean operating systems, which we're deploying across the entire Company.\nThese brief 15-minute huddles provide daily visibility on the metrics that matter most, help us identify gaps and quickly develop plans to support our teams closer to our customers giving us control and predictability of our operations.\nAs you know, this summer, we were challenged by the Dixie fire and the impact of fire had on all of our customers.\nI'll repeat what we said since Investor Day, our actions around Dixie were those of a reasonable operator and we're confident in the framework created by AB 1054.\nAB 1054 resulted in a wildfire fund to provide liquidity for resolved claims, a maximum liability cap for reimbursement by investor-owned utilities and enhanced prudency standards when determining that reimbursement amount.\nWe're reflecting that view in our financial statements which show a gross charge of $1.15 billion.\nWe booked an offsetting $1.15 billion receivable that reflects our confidence to recover costs.\nAs I highlighted, PG&E is working hard every day to deliver clean energy safely.\nWe're building on the mitigation programs we started in 2019.\nWe're staying nimble to respond to current conditions.\nAnd we are improving our performance enterprisewide.\nFor example, our team just last week responded to an atmospheric river weather event that included among the highest rainfall totals observed in a 48 hour timeframe ranging from 16 inches at Mount Tam [Phonetic] to 5 inches in downtown Sacramento.\nThe strongest wind gust recorded was 92 miles per hour from Mines Tower in Alameda County with at least a dozen other locations experiencing gust greater than 69 miles per hour.\nEven in the face of these difficult conditions, we completed our work without any serious safety incidents while returning service to 632,000 of the 851,000 customers impacted within 12 hours.\nI am very proud of the safe and rapid response of our team.\nNow, I'll hand it over to Chris to cover financial and regulatory items.\nAs Patti referenced earlier, our financial plan remains on track and is supported by a regulatory construct [Phonetic].\nI'll cover the highlights first, then go into more detail.\nToday, we are announcing [Phonetic] that we no longer see a need for equity in 2021.\nWe are reaffirming our non-GAAP core earnings per share guidance for this year and we anticipate issuing our 2022 guidance on our Q4 earnings call.\nAdditionally, we are seeing progress on recoveries related to prior wildfire risk reduction investments to help the balance sheet.\nLet's start with the share count used for Q3 2021 and year-to-date GAAP and non-GAAP core earnings per share.\nWe're in a GAAP loss position for both Q3 2021 as well as year-to-date 2021 due to our grantor trust election this quarter.\nAs a result, we're required to use basic shares outstanding to calculate both GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP core earnings per share for Q3 and year-to-date.\nOur full year guidance as always assumed a GAAP positive year and our full year non-GAAP core earnings per share of $0.95 to $1.05 per share, reflects our fully diluted share count.\nSo there is no impact there.\nI'll start with our Q3 result.\nWe continue to be on track for the 2021 non-GAAP operating earnings per share of $0.95 to $1.05.\nThis is calculated using our fully diluted share count I just mentioned, consistent with our assumption when we initiated guidance.\nSlide 9 shows our results for the third quarter.\nNon-GAAP core earnings per share for the quarter came in at $0.24.\nWe recorded a GAAP loss of $0.55 including non-core items.\nThis quarter, we recorded a $1.3 billion charge we've previously guided to as a result of our grantor trust election.\nAs you recall, this charge is expected to reverse over time as the Fire Victim Trust sells shares.\nMoving to slide 10.\nAs Patti mentioned, we took a $1.15 billion charge this quarter for the Dixie fire.\nWe also recorded a $1.15 billion of offsetting receivables.\nAnd the receivables reflect our confidence to recover cost based on the facts of information available to us today.\nAnd as a reminder, we recognize a receivable if we believe recovery is probable under the applicable accounting standard and due to the fact currently available, we're not yet probable for recovery of amounts exceeding insurance for the 2019 Kincaid and 2020 Zogg fires.\nTherefore, we hasn't recorded offsetting receivables for either of those fires.\nOn slide 11, we show the quarter-over-quarter comparison for non-GAAP core earnings of $0.24 per share for Q3 2021 versus $0.22 per share for Q3 2020.\nEPS increased due to $0.03 of growth in rate base earnings, $0.02 from using basic share count as a result of the GAAP loss I mentioned earlier and $0.01 from lower wildfire our litigation costs, partially offset by $0.01 decrease due to timing of taxes that will net to zero over the year.\nWe expect a stronger fourth quarter due to timing of the regulatory revenue and efficient work execution.\nMoving to slide 12.\nWe are reaffirming our non-GAAP core earnings per share of $0.95 to $1.05.\nOn the debt side, we expect to complete an initial AB 1054 securitization transaction this month, for $860 million.\nOur separate rate neutral securitization has also been approved by the CPUC.\nAnd once we resolve the final legal steps, we anticipate will start issuing bonds early next year.\nNow some updates on regulatory matters.\nI'll specifically highlight important filings reflecting both our focus on timely cost recovery for historical spend and our focus on the planet supporting California's clean energy future.\nTurning to slide 13.\nAt the end of the third quarter, we've requested cost recovery for approximately 80% of the unrecovered wildfire related costs on our balance sheet.\nAnd we already have final decision, settlement agreements or interim rates for roughly 60%.\nIn September, we filed a settlement agreement for our 2020 wildfire mitigation and catastrophic event application.\nOur request was $1.28 billion comprised of prior wildfire expense including costs that were incurred in 2018.\nGiven some of these cost predate the wildfire mitigation plan construct, we feel that settlement of $1.04 billion is a reasonable outcome.\nMost recently on this front, in September, we felt the recovery of $1.4 [Phonetic] billion of additional wildfire mitigation and catastrophic event costs.\nMost of the costs were incurred last year, and under our proposal, most of the revenue will be recovered in 2023 and 2024.\nYou should expect to see similar filings in the coming years as we seek timely recovery of any incremental spend in these areas.\nNext, I'll cover a brief update on our cost of capital application.\nIn late August, we filed the cost of capital application for rates starting in January 2022.\nThe request was filed off-cycle as a result of the disconnect between lower interest rate and the increase in cost of capital for California utilities as seen from higher interest costs and equity issuance costs.\nAt this stage, we'll follow the recent direction by the administrative law judge and for our materials that would have been included in the cost of capital adjustment mechanism advice letter by next Monday.\nThe filing will include calculations of the ROE, cost of debt and the resulting overall return on rate base from the operation of the adjustment mechanism.\nDOJ's order asked to submit the relevant information into the cost of capital proceeding rather than requesting us to file an advise letter.\nOur focus on triple bottom line of people, planet and prosperity is also not slowing down.\nJust last week, we filed for key transportation electrification investment and we'll accelerate technology adoptions for underserved communities, and of course support California's greenhouse gas reduction goals.\nEV Charge 2 is an extension of our fully subscribed and successful EV Charge Network Program.\nWe are requesting a total revenue requirement for roughly $225 [Phonetic] million from 2023 through 2030.\nThis phase of the program will provide the infrastructures to support 16,000 new charging ports which is just scratching the surface to meet the demands of our customers.\nTill [Phonetic] today are driving nearly 20% of the electric vehicles in the country.\nWe are proud to serve the largest base of customers owning and purchasing EVs in the US.\nI'll close by reiterating that we are delivering against the financial plan for 2021.\nOur focus continues to be on addressing the critical need to reduce wildfire risk in the near term, while running the business effectively to the long term.\nWe're investing in needed [Phonetic] wildfire mitigation and we've eliminated our 2021 equity need.\nWe'll continue to focus on improving our balance sheet while making the right investments to deliver clean energy safely to our customers.\nWith that, I'll hand it back to Patti.\nEvery day, we are more and more excited about the future we're creating here at PG&E.\nWe can see the difference that's been made and the value to be unlocked.\nWe continue to reduce wildfire risk and we're encouraged by the protections we have in place for our investors and the hometowns where we live and operate.\nOur 2021 PSPS protocols are the right solution on high wind days, and our enhanced powerline safety settings are necessary and effective and reductions ignitions and the resulting damage, given our current drought conditions.\nWe're focusing our work to make our system safer every day.\nWe're adapting based on what we learn so we can best serve our customers and you, our investors.\nWe'll deliver on the financials and we'll continue to implement the necessary processes to run a high performing utility.\nJenny, please open the line for Q&A.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Andy Simanek, head of investor relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\nAlso, for financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website.\nThroughout this conference call, all revenue growth rates, unless noted otherwise, are presented on a year-over-year basis and adjusted to exclude the impact of currency.\nI am amazed by the resilience of our customers, partners, and team members.\nAnd I'm incredibly proud of the way Hewlett Packard Enterprise continues to serve the needs of our global communities during such an unusual and evolving circumstances.\nWe delivered a very impressive third quarter at HPE with strong orders growth, expanded margins, and record free cash flow.\nOverall, I am pleased to see how our differentiated portfolio is resonating with the market and our edge-to-cloud strategy is driving improved momentum across our businesses.\nBased on the strength of our Q3 performance and our confidence about our momentum in the market, we are again raising our fiscal year 2021 earnings per share and free cash flow outlook, and we are also resuming stock repurchases.\nRevenue in Q3 was $6.9 billion, in line with our outlook and normal sequential seasonality.\nOur Q3 orders were up strong double digits year over year, and our year-to-date order volume has increased 11%, showing the strength of our edge-to-cloud offerings.\nWe significantly expanded our non-GAAP gross and operating margins, driving our year-to-date non-GAAP operating profit and earnings per share, up 28% and 27% year over year, respectively.\nWe generated record year-to-date free cash flow of $1.5 billion, up $1.1 billion year over year, putting us well ahead of the original outlook we announced last October.\nI am particularly pleased that we were able to deliver these results while mitigating against industrywide supply constraints by taking proactive inventory measures working closely with our suppliers and deploy our best-in-class engineering capabilities to establish specific response plans.\nThe impact of the pandemic continue to accelerate the shift we predicted years ago to an edge-centric, cloud-enabled, and data-driven world.\nNow more than ever, there is a greater need for secure connectivity, faster insights from data, and a cloud experience everywhere.\nWe expect these trends to continue.\nDigital transformation is no longer a priority but a strategic imperative.\nTo help our customers transform their businesses and be future-ready today, we have been focused on doubling down in key areas that are resonating strongly in the market.\nWe had a record number of orders in both our intelligent edge business and high-performance compute and mission-critical solutions business.\nDue to strong demand and execution, these growth businesses now make up nearly 25% of our total company revenue.\nOur intelligent edge business accelerated its momentum again in Q3, with 23% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by a record number of new orders.\nStrong customer demand for secure connectivity has generated a backlog five times greater than at the close of Q3 last year, as customers increasingly look for solutions to collect, connect, analyze, and act on data at the edge.\nWe are leaning into this demand and continue to invest and innovate at the edge.\nIn June, we announced new AI ops, IoT, and security features for our Aruba Edge Services Platform, or ESP, designed to streamline network operations, maximize IT efficiency, and more easily extend the network from the edge to the cloud.\nOur Aruba ESP continues to gain traction with customers in different verticals.\nIn the third quarter, customers including Save A Lot, Monument Health, and Circa Resort and Casino, all standardized their networks on Aruba ESP.\nIn our high-performance compute and mission-critical solutions business, revenue was up 9% year over year, driven by a record number of new orders.\nWe also generated a record order book, which now exceeds $2.5 billion.\nThe exponential growth in data, along with AI and big data analytics, are all driving an increased need for high-performance computing and mission-critical capabilities in enterprises of all sizes.\nTo meet this demand, we bolstered our artificial intelligence capabilities with the acquisition of Determined AI, a start-up that delivers a puzzle software stack that to train AI models faster at any scale using its open-source machine learning platform.\nWe also continued to see an increasing number of customers accessing our high-performance computer solutions as-a-Service through HPE GreenLake.\nWith our HPE GreenLake Cloud Services for HPC, customers gained powerful specialized computing and AI capabilities with a sustainable cloud experience.\nFor example, in Q3, HPE was awarded a $2 billion contract to be realized over a 10-year period with the National Security Agency to deliver high-performance computing solutions through the HP GreenLake platform.\nThe service will help the National Security Agency efficiently process data and unlock new insights in sustainable new ways.\nOur core businesses generated robust year-over-year orders growth, as well as strong profitability and free cash flow in the quarter.\nYear to date, compute and storage orders are up mid-single digits, with Q3 operating margins of 11.2% and 15.1%, respectively.\nWe continue to offer more of our core capabilities as-a-Service.\nIn Q3, we introduced unified compute operations as-a-Service through our HP GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform.\nThis new cloud-based management service simplifies provisioning and automates the management of compute infrastructure wherever it resides.\nOur storage business is transforming into a cloud-native software-defined data services business through organic innovation and targeted acquisitions.\nIn May, we introduced our new cloud data services available through HPE GreenLake, as well as a new HPE Alletra cloud-native data infrastructure.\nAnd just this week, we closed the acquisition of Zerto, an industry leader in cloud data management and protection, and run some way of data recovery services, which will be soon available as-a-Service through HPE GreenLake.\nThis acquisition immediately positions HPE GreenLake in the high-growth data protection market with a proven scale solution.\nHPE was the first to market four years ago in delivering and as-a-Service cloud experience on-premises in a colocation or at the edge with HPE GreenLake.\nToday, our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform has more than 1,100 customers.\nOur annualized revenue run rate this quarter was $705 million, up 33% year over year, driven by strong as-a-Service orders growth, up 46% year over year.\nOrganizations across sectors, including retail, healthcare, financial services, and public sector, are turning to HPE GreenLake.\nFor instance, we helped Liberty Mutual shift from a traditional capex IT spend to a new pay-as-you-go model, creating a cloud experience on-premises to provide transparency into consumption while improving their speed in adapting to capacity demands.\nThey standardized critical workloads on HPE Synergy delivered through HPE GreenLake, resulting in a reduced data center footprint and significant cost savings, including a monthly unit rate well below public cloud alternatives.\nWe also see in the power of the full HPE edge-to-cloud portfolio as customers are turning to HPE for integrated solutions that combine secure connectivity, data insight capabilities, and cloud experiences.\nWoolworths Group Australia and New Zealand's largest retailer selected HPE GreenLake to power its new Wpay payment platform.\nThey needed a solution that combines a powerful mission-critical architecture with the ability to scale and also provide a better cost efficiency back to Wpay and its merchant partners.\nDelivered through HPE GreenLake, their solution leverages our full edge-to-cloud portfolio, including HPE Aruba, HPE NonStop, HPE Primera, and HPE Synergy.\nHPE Pointnext Services also provided expertise to us over the company's digital transformation.\nI believe this is a great example of the power of our HPE edge-to-cloud portfolio.\nTo extend our leadership position in cloud services and further accelerate our pivot as-a-Service, we are relentlessly innovating.\nWe made several compelling announcements at HPE Discover in June.\nI am particularly excited about our new HPE GreenLake Lighthouse offering, a secure cloud-native stack built with HPE Ezmeral software to autonomously optimize different workloads across hybrid estate, reducing time to deployment and operating costs.\nWe also introduced Project Aurora to secure the enterprise, embedded in our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform.\nProject Aurora automatically and continuously verifies and attests the integrity of the hardware, freeware operating systems, platforms and workloads, while also detecting advanced threats.\nAnd finally, demonstrating our continued commitment to acquiring assets that complement our own capabilities, we acquired data platform developer Ampool.\nAmpool will accelerate HPE Ezmeral analytics run time to deliver high-performance analytics for engineers and business analysts.\nI am proud of HPE's performance in Q3 and year to date and the significant progress we have made in becoming the edge-to-cloud company.\nThe momentum we have in the market compels us to move even further and faster, and our ability to transform with increasing speed is imperative.\nThis transformation is my No.\nAt this pivotal moment, our purpose to advance the way people in the work has never been more important.\nOur vision to become the edge-to-cloud company is proving its tremendous relevance and our portfolio is winning in the marketplace.\nFueled by our purpose, vision, and portfolio, we have the opportunity to build a more digitally enabled inclusive world.\nWe have a mandate to imagine new digital transformation strategies that support our own ESG goals and those of our customers, leading to better business outcomes and societal impact.\nWe will never waver from our commitment to being a force for good and a strategic partner for our customers.\nWe will continue to bring bold new innovation to our customers, and we will continue to create value for our shareholders.\nAnd I'm grateful for the incredible team, and I'm confident in and excited about the future.\nI hope you will join us for our virtual Security Analyst Meeting on October 28 to hear more about our position in the market, our priorities, and our outlook for the year ahead.\nI'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nAntonio discussed the key highlights on Slides 1 and 2.\nSo, now let me discuss our Q3 performance, starting with Slide 3.\nI'm pleased to report that we are experiencing very strong demand across all of our businesses.\nQ3 was marked by accelerating order growth, strong gross and operating margin expansion, and robust cash flow generation.\nBuilding on the strength from the last quarter, we delivered Q3 revenues of $6.9 billion, up 3% from the prior quarter and in line with normal sequential seasonality, also in line with our outlook that factored in some of the expected supply chain constraints we flagged.\nWe're working to ensure disruption is minimal by taking proactive measures and coordinating with our world-class suppliers to establish tailored recovery plans.\nI am particularly proud of our non-GAAP gross margin that hit another record level of 34.7%, up 40 basis points sequentially and up 420 basis points from the prior-year period.\nThis is driven by our deliberate actions to shift toward higher-margin software-rich offerings, strong pricing discipline, and cost takeout.\nAs previously indicated, we continue to invest in high-growth, margin-rich areas of our portfolio, both in R&D and go-to-market, particularly in Aruba Software and as-a-Service, which increased our non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter.\nWe also booked two one-time charging totally $28 million for a legal settlement and bad debt associated with likely fraud involving a channel partner in APJ.\nEven with these investments and one-time charges, our non-GAAP operating margin was 9.8%, up 190 basis points from the prior year, which translates to a 25% year-over-year increase in operating profit.\nWe continue to be focused on driving further efficiencies in the business.\nWithin other income and expense, we benefited from stronger operational performance in H3C and strong gains related to increased valuations in our Pathfinder venture portfolio.\nAs a result, we now expect other income and expense for fiscal year '21 to be an income of approximately $50 million.\nWith strong execution across the business and despite two unanticipated one-time charges, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.47, up 31% from the prior year and above the higher end of our outlook range for Q3.\nQ3 cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion, and free cash flow was $526 million.\nThis puts us at a record $1.5 billion of year-to-date free cash flow, up $1.1 billion from the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in operating profit.\nFinally, the strength of our business has positioned us to contribute substantial capital to our shareholders.\nWe paid $157 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q4 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in October.\nWe are also announcing today the resumption of share buybacks as a result of greater free cash flow generation and visibility.\nI'll come back to capital allocation more broadly when we discuss the outlook.\nNow, let's turn to our segment highlights on Slide 4.\nOur growth businesses, which now represent nearly 25% of our total company revenue, are executing strongly and experiencing record order levels.\nIn the Intelligent Edge, we accelerated our top-line momentum with record levels of orders and 23% year-over-year revenue growth.\nSwitching was up over 20% year over year, whereas wireless LAN experienced more acute supply constraints and was up mid-single digits.\nAdditionally, the Edge-as-a-Service offerings were up triple digits year over year, which reflects enabling software platforms, as well as Network-as-a-Service.\nWe also continue to see strong operating margins at 15.8% in Q3, up 540 basis points year over year, which included a $17 million one-time legal settlement that impacted margins by 2 points.\nSilver Peak continues to perform strongly and contributed 7 points to the Intelligent Edge growth.\nIn addition, we started generating meaningful revenue synergies by cross-selling the Aruba portfolio, which reinforces the merits of the Silver Peak deal.\nIn HPC and MCS, demand strengthened even further with a record order level.\nRevenue grew 9% year over year as we continue to achieve more customer acceptance milestones and deliver on more than $2.5 billion of awarded contracts, including the contract that Antonio mentioned with the NSA worth $2 billion over 10 years.\nWe remain on track to deliver on our full-year and three-year revenue growth CAGR target of 8% to 12%.\nIn compute, revenue grew 4% quarter over quarter, reflecting normal sequential seasonality despite previously anticipated supply chain tightness.\nOperating margins of 11.2%, were up 190 basis points from the prior year, due to disciplined pricing and the rightsizing of the cost structure in this segment.\nWithin Storage, revenue grew 1% year over year and 3% quarter over quarter, ahead of normal sequential seasonality, driven by strong growth in software-defined offerings.\nNimble grew 10% year over year, with ongoing strong dHCI momentum, growing double digits year over year.\nAll-Flash Arrays grew by over 30% year over year, led by Primera.\nThe mix shift toward more software-rich platforms helped drive Storage operating margins to 15.1%, up 10 basis points year over year, offset by continued investments in our cloud data services.\nWith respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, revenue grew for the third consecutive quarter year over year as reported with both order and revenue growth expected for fiscal year '21.\nWithin HPE Financial services, revenue was flat year over year and sequentially.\nWhile our bad debt loss ratio did increase slightly to 94 basis points this quarter, it was entirely due to a one-time $11 million reserve charge related to the already mentioned likely fraud in APJ by a channel partner.\nAbsent this one-off event, our bad debt loss ratio would have improved to just 61 basis points aligned to pre-pandemic levels.\nMore importantly, we continue to see improved cash collections above pre-pandemic levels.\nOur operating margin was 11.1%, up 300 basis points from the prior year.\nAnd our return on equity at 18.3%, is well above the 15% plus target set at SAM.\nSlide 5 highlights the key metrics of our growing as-a-Service business.\nWe have made significant progress since our Analyst Day last October by adding over 200 new enterprise GreenLake customers to over 1,100 today and increasing our TCV by over $1 billion to a current lifetime TCV of well over $5 billion.\nFor Q3 specifically, our ARR was $705 million, which was up 33% year over year as reported, and total as-a-Service orders were up 46% year over year.\nIt is also important to note that the mix of our ARR is becoming more and more software-rich as we build out our GreenLake Cloud Platform, which is improving our margin profile.\nWe look forward to providing more disclosure around our software and services mix at our analyst day later this fall, which I believe reinforces the significant value add of GreenLake.\nOverall, based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is executing and progressing toward achieving our ARR growth target of 30% to 40% CAGR from FY '20 to FY '23.\nSlide 6 highlights our revenue and earnings per share performance to date where you can clearly see the strong rebound from last year and sustained momentum for the last three quarters.\nThe demand environment continues to strengthen.\nAnd with the operational execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we have increased non-GAAP earnings per share in Q3 by 31% year over year.\nTurning to Slide 7.\nWe delivered another record non-GAAP gross margin rate in Q3 of 34.7% of revenues, which was up 40 basis points sequentially and up 420 basis points from the prior year.\nThis was driven by strong pricing discipline and a positive mix shift toward high-margin software-rich businesses like the intelligent edge and next-generation storage offerings.\nWe have also benefited from our new segmentation we implemented beginning of fiscal year 2020, that gives us much better visibility into each business unit and enables the better resource allocation and discipline to drive operating leverage.\nMoving to Slide 8.\nYou can also see we have expanded non-GAAP operating profit margin substantially from pandemic lows to 9.8%, which is up 190 basis points from the prior-year period.\nWe are driving further productivity benefits and delivering the expected savings from our cost optimization plan, while simultaneously increasing our investment levels in R and D and field selling costs, which are critical to fuel our long-term innovation engine and revenue growth targets.\nAs mentioned previously, Q3 operating expenses also included one-time charges not included in our guidance, totaling $28 million for a legal settlement and the likely forgery involving a partner.\nExcluding these one-off charges, our operating margin would have been 10.2%.\nTurning to Slide 9.\nWe generated a record year-to-date levels of cash flow with $2.9 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.5 billion of free cash flow, which is up $1.1 billion year over year.\nThis was primarily driven by increased operating profit.\nI would like also to underscore that this year, our free cash flow seasonality will be different than in prior years.\nWe expect increased financial services volume that includes more than $150 million in Q4 financing for a very large deal that is predominantly GreenLake and will benefit our ARR margins for years to come.\nWe also have further restructuring payments and growing working capital needs as we continue to buffer our inventory levels in the light of the disruption in the global IT supply chain.\nNow moving on to Slide 10, let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified balance sheet.\nAs of July 31, the operating company net cash balance turned positive due to our strong free cash flow.\nFurthermore, we made additional progress during the quarter, securitizing over $750 million of financial services-related debt through the ABS market.\nThe refinancing of higher cost unsecured debt with ABS financing allows us to boost access to financing market at a cheaper cost of debt capital, as well as diversify and segregate our balance sheet between our operating company and our financial services business.\nBottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensure we have ample liquidity to run our operations, continuing to invest in our business to drive growth and return capital to shareholders.\nNow turning to our outlook on Slide 11.\nI'm very pleased to announce that we are once again raising our full-year guidance to reflect the continued momentum in the demand environment and our strong execution.\nThis will be the fourth guidance increase since SAM in October 2020.\nWe now expect to deliver fiscal year '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.88 and $1.96.\nWith respect to supply chain, as indicated last quarter, industrywide tightening somewhat constrained our supply as expected.\nWe continue to take proactive inventory measures where possible.\nAnd you can see our efforts in inventory balances that increased $1.3 billion year to date that also reflects the strengthening demand environment and a substantial order book we have across the business.\nWe expect the challenged supply chain conditions to persist until at least the middle of calendar year 2022 and have factored these into our revenues, costs, and cash flow outlook.\nFrom a top-line perspective, although we remain prudent given the challenged supply chain environment, we are very pleased with the accelerating Q3 order momentum across all segments of the business.\nMore specifically for Q4 '21, we expect revenue to be above our normal sequential seasonality from Q3 and are comfortable with current consensus levels.\nFor Q4 '21, we expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.14 to $0.22 and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44 to $0.52.\nAdditionally, given our record levels of free cash flow year to date and confidence in our raised outlook, I'm very pleased to announce that we are also raising fiscal year '21 free cash flow guidance to $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, that is a $600 million increase at the midpoint from our original SAM guidance with the top end of this free cash flow guidance range at the peak levels attained in fiscal year '19.\nAs you recall, at the end of the first half of fiscal year 2020, we suspended our share buybacks to preserve liquidity in the context of the global pandemic disruption.\nAlthough we continue to operate in a challenged supply environment, our order momentum and improved cash flow generation visibility give us confidence to reinstate our share repurchase program.\nWe are targeting up to $250 million of share repurchases in Q4 of fiscal year '21, and we'll update investors on our capital management policy for fiscal year '22 at SAM in October.\nAs a reminder, we always follow a disciplined, return-based capital allocation framework to maximize long-term shareholder value.\n1 priority remains delivering sustainable profitable growth through both organic and inorganic M and A investments while remaining committed to paying dividends to our shareholders.\nIn addition, we will consider opportunistic share buybacks when we see a favorable return for doing so.\nSo, overall, and to conclude, I am very proud of the progress we have made year to date in fiscal year '21.\nIt's clear that our edge-to-cloud strategy is resonating with customers and driving improved momentum across all of our businesses.\nOur growth businesses in the Intelligent Edge and HPC/MCS have accelerated top-line performance with record levels of orders.\nOur core business of Compute and Storage is demonstrating momentum with robust orders and improved margins and our as-a-Service ARR is accelerating.\nAll of this translates to improving revenue momentum, strong profitability growth, and record levels of free cash flow.\nWe look forward to closing out our fiscal year much leaner, better resourced, and positioned to capitalize on the strong demand environment.\nLastly, as Antonio mentioned, we look forward to having you join us for our virtual Securities Analyst Meeting in late October, where we will provide an update on our strategy, business insights, and financial outlook.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm Susie Lisa, senior vice president of investor relations for CVS Health.\nToday's call is being broadcast on our website, where it will be archived for one year.\n2021 was an important year for CVS Health.\nWe exceeded our financial goals.\nWe advanced our strategy and we brought greater value to the people we serve, playing a critical role in the nation's pandemic response.\nWe ended a strong 2021 with another strong quarter.\nWe exceeded our adjusted earnings per share expectations for the fourth quarter in a row delivering $1.98 adjusted earnings per share in the final quarter of 2021 and $8.40 adjusted earnings per share for the full year.\nWe are entering 2022 with powerful momentum.\nWe are delivering healthcare solutions that are personalized, connected, and increasingly digital.\nWe are engaging millions of consumers across our businesses and in our community health destinations across America.\nCVS Health is becoming a bigger part of their everyday health.\nTurning now to our performance.\nFor the full year 2021, CVS Health grew adjusted revenue by 8.8% to $292 billion.\nWe delivered adjusted operating income of $17.3 billion, up 8.1% year over year.\nAnd we increased adjusted earnings per share by 12%.\nWe generated strong cash flow from operations of nearly $18.3 billion for the full year, exceeding our most recent guidance of at least $13.5 billion.\nThis strong performance positions us well for 2022.\nAt this early stage of the year, we are maintaining our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $8.10 to $8.30.\nOur forecast reflects increased volume from COVID testing and front store sales in our retail business relative to our forecast at investor day, offset by the accelerated timing of vaccine boosters pulled into the fourth quarter of 2021.\nShawn will provide more details on our results and guidance shortly.\nOur 2021 performance demonstrates our ability to anticipate, deliver, and exceed consumers' expectations for healthcare.\nConsumers are a major force driving change in healthcare, and we continue to engage successfully with individuals in more places and on their terms, virtually, in the home, and in their local community.\nCustomers and clients continue to realize the superior value we are providing with our integrated health solutions, particularly those that address the most prevalent, costly, and complex health conditions, such as diabetes, cancer, and chronic kidney disease.\nTurning to the segment highlights.\nIn healthcare benefits, we delivered 9.4% adjusted revenue growth for the full year 2021, driven by our performance in government services.\nWe had another strong year of Medicare growth with increases across all product lines.\nTotal Medicare Advantage membership grew at 9.8% on a year-over-year basis, as we added over 265,000 new members in 2021 and exceeded our initial growth expectations.\nAs a result of our strategic focus on dual-eligible special needs plans, enrollment nearly doubled in 2021.\nOur full year medical benefit ratio of 85% was in line with our guidance expectations.\nFor the full year 2021, the utilization of total healthcare services in aggregate was in line with normalized historical baseline levels.\nTurning to 2022, we had an impressive annual enrollment period in our Medicare business.\nFor the second consecutive year, we grew all Medicare product lines, and our growth rates this year exceed the industry averages in all categories.\nWe grew total Medicare Advantage membership by 11.6% versus the prior year, reflecting increases in individual and group Medicare Advantage of over 15% and 6%, respectively, year over year.\nWe also led the industry in absolute Medicare PDP net membership growth.\nThis added nearly 295,000 net new members, while the overall PDP market continues to decline.\nWe had a solid 2022 selling season in our national accounts commercial business.\nWe expect to grow membership in the low single digits for the full year and maintained strong client retention of 96%.\nOur success is driven by the combination of our competitive cost structure, our integrated benefit designs, including medical and pharmacy, and products and services that utilize CVS Health capabilities, such as Transform Care Diabetes and Virtual Primary Care programs.\nMembership enrollment was lower than expected in the eight ACA individual exchanges we entered this year.\nWe continue to build this business gradually, with select geographic expansion, a focused price discipline, and the appeal of co-branded Aetna CVS Health offerings.\nConsistent with our prior guidance, we do not expect this offering to contribute materially to our financial results in 2022.\nOverall, our deep understanding of consumer needs, innovative product portfolio, and our service excellence will drive growth in our healthcare benefits segment.\nOur comprehensive range of products and benefit design that address consumers' whole health needs remains a key differentiator and fueled a strong selling season.\nFor 2022, we forecast 7% to 9% revenue growth and 15% to 17% adjusted operating income growth.\nTurning to pharmacy services, we delivered 7.8% revenue and 20.6% adjusted operating income growth in 2021.\nWe continue to be a consultative partner to our clients and members.\nWe're delivering industry-leading cost trends and savings, service excellence and a broad product portfolio, and a commitment to transparency.\nWe consistently create value for our customers and clients with our better-than-market drug trend.\nWe continue to enhance our utilization programs to ensure access to the therapeutics that are the most clinically appropriate.\nFor 2022, we achieved a client retention rate of over 98% and drove $8.8 billion of net new business revenue.\nWe are a leader in specialty pharmacy, delivering revenue growth of 12.3% for the fourth quarter and 9.3% for the full year versus prior period.\nOur specialty pharmacy programs drive value in the marketplace and they differentiate us as we pair programs with digital capabilities to deliver a convenient and connected experience.\nFor pharmacy services in 2022, we expect 6% to 8% revenue growth and 7% to 9% adjusted operating income growth, as we create long-term value for our clients and our members.\nOur retail segment plays a critical role as a community health destination for millions of Americans.\nThis segment outperformed the industry and our expectations in 2021.\nWe grew revenue 9.8% year over year to just over $100 billion, marking an important milestone in the history of this CVS Health business.\nWe delivered an exceptional 24% adjusted operating income growth in 2021.\nPharmacy sales and prescriptions filled both increased by nearly 9% year over year.\nThis was notably driven by consumers who came to CVS Health for COVID-19 vaccine administration.\nFor the full year 2021, CVS Health administered more than 32 million COVID-19 tests and more than 59 million vaccines.\nOver 35% of COVID-19 vaccines in 2021 were administered during the fourth quarter.\nOur work to test and vaccinate America for COVID is a powerful example of the relationships we are building with consumers, which leads to new customers seeking a range of other health services at CVS Health.\nFront store sales growth was strong throughout 2021, up 8.4% versus the prior year.\nThey were led by consumer demand for the over-the-counter COVID-19 tests, as well as cough and cold, beauty, and personal care products.\nWe sold over 22 million OTC COVID-19 tests with approximately 70% of sales in the fourth quarter.\nWe are progressing on optimizing our retail portfolio and pivoting our stores into three formats: primary care clinics, enhanced health hubs, and traditional CVS pharmacy locations.\nWe are executing our plan to dedensify stores based on consumer health and buying needs, omnichannel preferences, and shifts in the U.S. population.\nFor 2022, as I mentioned, given the earnings outperformance and pull-forward of vaccine boosters in 2021, we are maintaining our 2022 guidance.\nThis now implies retail revenue to be plus or minus 1% versus prior year, and a low 20% decline in adjusted operating income growth.\nShawn will provide more details.\nOur digital approach is focused on delivering a superior experience for consumers by creating a more connected and seamless health journey.\nWe are making progress toward setting a new standard for digital healthcare for consumers.\nCVS.com is one of the top health websites with over 2 billion visits in 2021, up nearly 55% over the prior year.\nOur digital capabilities for health interactions such as COVID testing and vaccines, prescription services, and sales of health and wellness products have dramatically increased consumer engagement across all CVS Health businesses.\nWe now serve 40 million customers digitally, up approximately 10% in the last six months alone.\nIn 2021, we launched several new digital health services powered by advanced analytics to personalize the experience.\nWe made it easier to join our CarePass program reaching 5.6 million subscribers in the quarter, up more than 40% year over year.\nWe integrated CarePass for our Aetna Commercial members and are excited about the adoption we are seeing.\nWe also simplified the CarePass enrollment for all consumers, which is driving more growth in subscribers.\nFor our HealthHUB and MinuteClinic patients, we simplified and digitized the check-in process for patients.\nOur self-service digital tool enables individuals to complete traditional paperwork in advance of their appointment.\nAlmost 80% of patients are already utilizing this capability.\nAt our investor day, we promised a superior healthcare experience for consumers that will improve health outcomes, lower cost, and provide broader access to care.\nWe are making several moves to realize our vision for healthcare.\nWe're advancing our care delivery capabilities, optimizing our retail portfolio, and further diversifying the health products and services that we offer.\nWe're driving this evolution both through internal initiatives and by seeking to execute capability-focused M&A for complementary health services.\nWe will connect consumers in more places in more ways and on their terms, with our digital-first technology-forward approach, as well as an enhanced omnichannel health experience.\nThese strategic moves will accelerate the growth of our foundational businesses.\nIn all this work, we will place the consumer at the center of all that we do.\nWe remain focused on delivering on our commitment to sustainability for our shareholders, our customers, and our communities.\nWe recently launched CVS Health Zones, aim to advance health equity and to address social determinants of health in high-risk communities.\nWe are collaborating with trusted national and local organizations to confront the six key social determinants of health through local investments.\nOur goal is to equip communities with the resources needed to close gaps in care for specific health conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease.\nHealth Zones is now active in five geographies with additional markets planned in 2022.\nWe remain committed to the environment and have pledged to reduce our overall impact, cutting greenhouse gas emissions across our operations and supply chain, and decreasing resource consumption, especially paper and plastic.\nIn December, CVS Health was named to the 2021 S&P Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index for the 9th consecutive year and the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the third consecutive year.\nOur financial performance, execution, portfolio of assets, and differentiated strategy all create strong momentum into 2022 and a clear pathway to achieve low double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth over time.\nI would also like to take a moment to recognize the continued contribution of our colleagues who have played a vital role in helping our nation prevail over the pandemic.\nI am proud of what we have done and are doing every day to make a difference.\nOur fourth quarter results reflect the continuation of the strong performance delivered in the first three quarters of the year, as we once again exceeded our expectations for revenue, cash flow, and adjusted earnings per share.\nWe maintained our focus on growth, operational execution, and supporting the communities we serve as the effects of the pandemic persists.\nStarting with the enterprise as a whole.\nTotal fourth quarter adjusted revenues of 76.6 billion, increased by 10.6% year over year.\nWe reported adjusted operating income of 4.1 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.98, representing an increase of 40.8% and 52.3% versus prior year, respectively.\nFor full year 2021, we reported total adjusted revenues of 292.1 billion, an increase of 8.8% versus prior year, reflecting robust growth across all business segments.\nWe delivered adjusted operating income of 17.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $8.40, up approximately 8.1% and 12% year over year, respectively.\nAnd we generated significant cash flow from operations of nearly 18.3 billion.\nThis marks a record year of cash flow from operations for CVS Health and reflects the strength of our financial results, accelerated collections, and focused improvements in our working capital position.\nTurning to the healthcare benefits segment.\nFourth quarter adjusted revenue of 20.7 billion increased by 10.1% year over year, driven by membership growth in our government services business and lower COVID-19-related investments, slightly offset by the repeal of the health insurer fee.\nAdjusted operating income of 510 million grew by over 230% year over year, driven by lower COVID-19 related investments and improved underlying performance, partially offset by higher COVID-related medical costs compared to prior year.\nOur adjusted medical benefit ratio of 87% improved 130 basis points year over year, driven by lower COVID-19 related investments, partially offset by the repeal of the health insurer fee.\nAs a result of the omicron variant, we experienced higher COVID testing and treatment costs in the fourth quarter, but this was largely offset by lower non-COVID costs, particularly in Medicare and Medicaid.\nDays claims payable at the end of the quarter was 49 and was, as expected, lower than the third quarter and consistent with normal seasonal trends and historic levels.\nOverall, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves.\nIn the pharmacy services segment, fourth quarter revenues of 39.3 billion increased by 8.2% year over year, driven by increased pharmacy claims volume, growth in specialty pharmacy, and brand inflation, partially offset by the impact of continued client price improvements.\nTotal pharmacy membership increased by approximately 400,000 lives sequentially, reflecting sustained growth in government programs.\nTotal pharmacy claims processed increased by 8.2% above prior year.\nApproximately half of this growth was attributable to net new business in 2021, with COVID-19 vaccine administration and new therapy prescriptions also contributing to the year-over-year growth.\nAdjusted operating income of $1.8 billion grew 16.8% year over year, driven by improved purchasing economics, reflecting the products and services of our group purchasing organization, and growth in specialty pharmacy.\nIn our retail long-term care segment, we delivered exceptional revenue and adjusted operating income growth versus prior year and once again exceeded our expectations.\nFourth quarter revenue of 27.1 billion was up by 12.7% year over year, representing an increase of 3 billion.\nThere are two main components to this increase: one, approximately 60% was driven by the administration of COVID-19 vaccines and testing; front store sales, including demand for over-the-counter COVID test kits and related treatment categories; as well as strong COVID-related prescription volume.\nThe remaining 40% was attributable to a combination of underlying sustained pharmacy growth and broad strength in front store sales trends, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure.\nThis strong revenue growth helped produce adjusted operating income of 2.5 billion.\nThis quarterly result was 38% above prior year and significantly exceeded our forecasts.\nThe increase in adjusted operating income was driven by a few key components: the administration of COVID-19 vaccines, underlying strength in pharmacy and front store sales, and a $106 million gain from an antitrust legal settlement, which were partially offset by the combined impacts of ongoing but stable reimbursement pressure, and business investments, including the minimum wage increase and store improvements.\nIn terms of the improved performance in the quarter versus our expectations, there are two primary components.\nApproximately 75% was driven by vaccines, largely third-dose boosters, which we previously expected to impact the first quarter of 2022.\nAnd the remaining 25% was driven by the nationwide surge in demand for over-the-counter and diagnostic COVID-19 testing, combined with stronger underlying front store sales performance.\nLooking at cash flow and the balance sheet.\nOur liquidity and capital position remained strong at the end of the fourth quarter with full year cash flow from operations of nearly 18.3 billion and nonrestricted cash of over 3.8 billion.\nThrough our proactive liability management transaction in December, we paid down 2.3 billion in long-term debt in the quarter, bringing the total long-term debt we have repaid since the close of the Aetna transaction to a net total of 21 billion.\nIn addition, we returned over 2.6 billion to shareholders through our quarterly dividends in 2021.\nOur consistent outperformance during 2021 provides solid momentum as we head into this year, setting the stage for our continued strong outlook in 2022 despite multiple COVID unknowns that remain challenging to predict, such as additional variants, vaccine and testing protocols, and government testing initiatives.\nAs Karen noted earlier, we are maintaining our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $8.10 to $8.30.\nWe feel this is an appropriate stance at this early point in the year, especially given the earnings outperformance of retail in Q4 was due largely to the pull-forward of third-dose vaccine administration from 2022 into 2021.\nThis represents 2% to 5% growth versus our revised 2021, adjusted earnings per share baseline of $7.92.\nAs you think about the adjusted earnings per share baseline and year-over-year growth, I'd like to encourage you to keep a few things in mind.\nFirst, recall that our 2021 baseline of $7.92 removes items we do not forecast, prior year's development, net of profits returned to customers and net realized capital gains.\nIt also includes the annualized impact of our investment in our colleagues through an increase in minimum wage.\nSecond, it is also important to note that the baseline now includes a net favorable component attributable to COVID-19, driven by vaccines and testing of approximately $0.30 per share.\nCVS Health continues to help lead the nation's COVID-19 pandemic response, clearly demonstrating the power of our integrated business model, consumer engagement, and local community health destinations.\nWhile there is no change to our Retail segment guidance, I would like to provide more detail on our COVID-19 retail volume assumptions for 2022.\nWe expect that COVID-19 testing both in-store diagnostic and over-the-counter will continue at higher volumes than anticipated at investor day, offset by a reduced outlook on vaccines.\nIn 2022, we expect vaccine volumes to decline approximately 70% to 80% and in-store diagnostic testing volumes to decline 40% to 50% compared to 2021.\nFor over-the-counter test kits, we expect modest full-year volume growth versus 2021.\nRelative to vaccines, our outlook does not assume any impact from the administration of a fourth COVID-19 booster.\nAs such, we expect the contribution of COVID-19 vaccines to be more heavily weighted to the first half of the year.\nAs I mentioned, the impact of COVID-19 remains one of the most challenging aspects of developing our guidance due to many factors, including the risk of additional surges, potential new testing or vaccine protocols, legislative changes, and OTC test kit dynamics such as supply challenges, coverage mandates, and government initiatives.\nTurning to items that are below adjusted operating income on our income statement, we expect our interest expense for 2022 to be approximately $2.3 billion.\nWe are purchasing shares to offset dilution.\nAnd as a result, we expect that diluted share count to be approximately flat versus 2021.\nOur expectation for the effective income tax rate is approximately 25.6%, consistent with 2021.\nIn terms of cash flow and capital deployment, we anticipate continued strong cash flow from operations in 2022.\nAnd we are updating our guidance range to $12 billion to $13 billion, reflecting the improved cash flow results for 2021.\nCapital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion as we invest in technology and digital enhancements to improve the consumer experience, as well as our community locations.\nAs we detailed in December, we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings, while also having the flexibility to deploy capital strategically for capability-focused M&A.\nTo conclude, the strong 2021 performance of CVS Health is expected to carry into 2022 as we continue to execute our strategy.\nWe have solidified our leadership role in healthcare delivery as a trusted partner to our consumers and their communities.\nAs we build upon this trust, we will continue to drive meaningful improvements that lower the cost of care, improve access and build engagement and convenience, ultimately enabling people to live healthier lives.\nSummary:

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:There are certain risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed in our filings with the SEC that may impact our results.\nDuring our call today, we will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe third quarter was another outstanding quarter for our company, as we achieved our fifth straight quarter of exceptional results since reopening our properties last spring, this sustained level of strong performance is a direct result of the fundamental changes we made to our operating philosophy last year.\nUpon reopening, we sharpened our focus on driving play from our most loyal guests.\nWe streamlined our cost structure, and we adopted a more efficient approach to doing business that touched every part of our operations.\nOur record third quarter performance and our results over each of the last five quarters attributes to the transformation of our business model, and the disciplined approach we have taken to operating our business.\nThese exceptional results have significantly enhanced our free cash flow and strengthen our balance sheet with our leverage declining to 2.5 times at the end of the third quarter.\nAs a result of our strong financial position and our prospects for continued growth our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of $300 million allowing us to return a portion of our robust free cash flow to our shareholders.\nSo let's review the operating performance and helped to make this possible.\nFor the second straight quarter revenues exceeded both 2019 and 2020 levels setting a new third quarter record, strong flow through resulted in an adjusted EBITDAR of more than $340 million, also a third quarter record.\nOur quarterly EBITDAR was 42% higher than the third quarter of 2020 and 60% higher than the third quarter of 2019, and our companywide operating margins exceeded 40% for the second straight quarter.\nOur third quarter margin grew nearly 400 basis points over last year's record, and is up more than 1,400 basis points from 2019.\nEvery segment of our business contributed to this outstanding performance, as we set new third quarter EBITDAR record in each of our three operating segments.\nIn our Las Vegas Locals segment revenues grew 35% over last year and EBITDAR was up almost 60%, operating margins exceeded 54% and have been at or above the 50% mark every quarter of this year.\nIn Downtown, Las Vegas, we posted record third quarter EBITDAR of $13.2 million on margins of 31%.\nThis is a substantial improvement over the EBITDAR loss we reported a year ago and is up double digits over our record third quarter 2019 results.\nAnd in our Midwest and South segment, we set new third quarter records for both revenues and EBITDAR, as EBITDAR grew 22% over prior year and 42% from 2019.\nThis strong performance was broad-based, as 11 of our 17 regional properties set new EBITDAR record for the third quarter.\nNationwide, of the 26 properties that were open the entire quarter 21 grew EBITDAR by double digits over last year, with 18 setting new third quarter EBITDAR records.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the record levels of revenues, EBITDAR and margins we have produced throughout 2021 are the result of deliberate actions we have taken since reopening last year including focusing on the right customer transforming our operating model and implementing new capabilities and refinements throughout our business, and we are continuing to implement initiatives and technologies to enhance customer convenience, build loyalty, streamline processes and reinforce our operating efficiency.\nAn example of this is our BoydPay cashless technology, which is now live at 11 properties in four states.\nWhile initially BoydPay was focused on our slot product we are quickly expanding BoydPay's capabilities to other areas both gaming and non-gaming.\nIn the next several weeks, we will be expanding BoydPay to the majority of our restaurants in Las Vegas.\nIn addition, we recently launched a field trial for BoydPay at table games in Nevada, with Pennsylvania soon to follow.\nOur goal is to create a tool that will make it easier for our guests to make wagers and pay for non-gaming amenities right from their smartphone.\nWe're making excellent progress toward this objective and expect BoydPay will become available at every Boyd Gaming property next year pending regulatory approvals.\nWe're also using technology to create new revenue opportunities and enhance the guest experience in other ways as well.\nFor example in Nevada, we recently relaunched Boyd Sports offering an unmatched selection of bidding opportunities through the most expansive wagering menu in the state.\nWe're pleased with the customer reception so far with strong increases in activity from both new and reactivated guests.\nBeyond these new initiatives we also have additional organic growth opportunities available throughout our operations.\nAcross the country many of our hotels have been running below capacity since reopening due to a tight labor market.\nAs a result, we've not been able to accommodate many rated customers who have established gaming histories with us.\nAs the labor market normalizes, we will be able to bring more hotel rooms online driving gaming revenue growth from these customer segments.\nIn Downtown Las Vegas, we anticipate continued growth as tourism throughout the city recovers and Hawaiian visitation improves, and we also have opportunities for future growth in our mid-week business and our meeting and convention business.\nOverall, we expect to see further recovery in visitation throughout our portfolio, as restrictions are lifted, COVID numbers improve and travel resumes.\nOn top of our organic growth opportunities we are well positioned for further gains in the digital space.\nWe view online gaming and online casinos in particular, as a strategic growth opportunity for our company.\nWith gaming operations across 10 states and a strong player loyalty program, we have the foundation to build a robust digital complement to our land-based casino operations.\nOur iGaming operations are off to a good start in both, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, where our Stardust branded online casinos have delivered strong results since launching in April.\nExpanding our iGaming operations is a strategic priority for our company, and we will look to further build our online casino capabilities and geographic presence over time.\nIn sports betting our partnership with FanDuel continues to grow, our current focus is Louisiana where we are preparing to launch sports betting at our five properties in that state by year-end pending regulatory approval.\nOnce live this will extend our partnership with FanDuel the six of our nine regional states.\nIn all, we expect our digital operations including sports, casino, and social casino will generate more than $20 million in EBITDAR this calendar year.\nDigital is a profitable business for us today, and there will be an increasingly important part of our overall strategy in the years ahead, generating incremental revenue and EBITDAR for our company, expanding our customer base and importantly building loyalty among our guests by providing us another opportunity to engage with them.\nWe also continue to benefit as a 5% equity partner in FanDuel's accelerating expansion across the country and their position, as one of the leading online sports and casino operators in the country.\nSince our last call FanDuel launch new sports betting operations in Arizona and Connecticut, and expect to go live in Maryland, Washington State and Wyoming by the end of the year.\nSports betting operations in 15 states by year-end FanDuel is a clear leader in the expansion of digital gaming, and we are participating in its success as an equity owner and a partner.\nWhile the opportunity in digital is substantial we also have strategic opportunities to further expand our traditional gaming operations.\nIn Northern California construction on the Wilton Rancheria tribe Sky River Casino was progressing.\nSteel Structures topped off last month, and we are quickly moving forward both exterior and interior construction.\nThis project remains on time and on budget, and we are on track to open Sky River early in the fourth quarter of next year.\nAnd in Louisiana we continue to make progress on development plans for a new land-based facility of Treasure Chest Casino featuring expanded gaming space and significantly upgraded non-gaming amenities.\nTreasure Chest has been a strong performer for years and this project will allow us to further enhance the property and it was already producing strong results.\nBefore turning it over to Josh, I want to provide an update on our ESG initiatives.\nSince issuing our first ESG report earlier this year, we've convened teams of corporate and property executives to focus on a number of strategic ESG initiatives including reducing our water and energy consumption, lowering our carbon footprint, encouraging employee volunteerism and workplace giving enhancing the diversity of our workforce and refine our responsible gaming efforts.\nWe look forward to providing you with an update on our progress in next year's ESG report.\nWe also continue to support our communities during times of need, as we did after Hurricane Ida struck South Louisiana in late August.\nTo assist our South Louisiana communities with the recovery effort Boyd Gaming made a significant contribution to our partners at Second Harvest Food Bank helping them provide much needed food and water to thousands of local residents in the immediate aftermath of the storm.\nAt the same time, we extended full pay and benefits to our team members of Treasure Chest and Amelia Belle while those properties were closed following the storm.\nWe also provided immediate cash benefits to all of these employees, and we are providing additional relief as needed through the Boyd Gaming Team Member Crisis Fund.\nGiving back to our communities, and being a responsible corporate citizen have always been core tenants of our company, we were proud to uphold our commitment after Hurricane Ida, and we will continue to honor that commitment as a central part of our company's ESG philosophy.\nIn summary, after our fifth strong quarterly performance in a row, we have great confidence in our future and our ability to grow our business.\nOur restructured operating model and our tight focus on the right customer are delivering exceptional results.\nCompanywide EBITDAR has exceeded the $1 billion mark in just nine months with margin, significantly higher than pre-closure levels.\nWe're confident that this level of performance is sustainable and that we will maintain much of the margin improvements we have achieved over the last 18 months.\nOur free cash flow has more than doubled and our balance sheet is the strongest it has ever been, giving our Board the confidence to authorize a new share repurchase program, and we have opportunities for incremental growth ahead.\nAs the pandemic fades, additional visitors will return to our properties.\nAs the labor market normalizes, we will be able to bring more hotel rooms online increasing our capacity to host profitable customers, and we will further leverage our nationwide portfolio our extensive customer database and our partnership with FanDuel to continue expanding our digital business.\nWe are well positioned for the future.\nAnd while our recent success, as a result of our transformed operating strategy has also attributed to the strength of the entire Boyd Gaming team.\nOur team members are successfully executing the strategy that is creating these exceptional results.\nI cannot say enough about their dedication and effort over these past 15 months in dealing with the COVID pandemic and an uncertain environment.\nIt is an honor to lead this team, and we look forward to continued growth and success in the months and years ahead.\nResults for the third quarter and year-to-date have been truly outstanding.\nOur performance reflects a transformed operating philosophy that we implemented after reopening our properties in the third quarter of last year focused on building loyalty and efficiently serving our core customer.\nThis operating philosophy structurally changed how we execute our business including reevaluating our approach to marketing, as well as scrutinizing every other facet of our operation.\nAnd as you've seen in our results we have consistently executed this strategy for five quarters generating revenues that are now surpassing 2019 levels with significantly higher EBITDAR across our business.\nAnd as Keith mentioned, we are optimistic about our future, as we have multiple avenues for continued growth, as well as confidence that we will continue to operate at higher levels of margin.\nToday, we are financially a much stronger company, and at any point in our history.\nTotal EBITDAR over the last 12 months surpasses $1.2 billion and leverage at the end of the third quarter was 2.75 times and expected to further decline by year-end.\nAs a result of our strong operational performance, we are now generating robust levels of free cash flow, approaching $700 million over the past 12 months.\nTo reflect our confidence in the company's future our Board authorized a $300 million share repurchase program.\nThis amount is an addition to $61 million remaining from a prior approval.\nGiven our sizable and growing free cash flow, we will also continue to invest in opportunities to generate high returns for our company.\nThese growth opportunities will be balanced with returning capital to shareholders and maintaining current levels of leverage over the long term.\nOperator, that concludes our remarks, and we're now ready to take any questions.\nSummary: ",

Assi Ginzburg, Chief Financial Officer; Smadar Lavi, Vice President of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations.\nActual future results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties.\nFor a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, please see Risk Factors section as described in Ormat Technologies annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q that are filed with the SEC.\nIn addition, during the call, the company will present non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA.\nBecause these measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nDoron, the call is yours.\nThis was a productive quarter for Ormat.\nAs we are progressing with our plans to grow our Electricity and Energy Storage segment, the quarter was highlighted by execution of our organic and M&A growth strategies.\nWe completed the expansion of the McGinness Complex in Nevada with higher generating capacity than originally planned, and made significant progress ramping up generation of the Puna plant in Hawaii.\nSimultaneously, we closed a significant acquisition of two operating power plants and two other assets, which should contribute to our future growth.\nIn the Energy Storage segment, we continue with our BD efforts to secure new interconnection in land position to support our pipeline and we recently released two storage asset for construction.\nThe progress in our growth reinforces our belief that we can achieve our stated goals of increasing Ormat's combined geothermal energy storage and solar generating portfolio to more than 1.5-gigawatt by 2023.\nWhile we continue to view 2021 is a buildup year in which we lay additional groundwork to accelerate our growth.\nThe increased backlog and sales pipeline, along with the -- I guess the only tailwinds and significant portfolio growth coming from our Electricity and Energy Storage segment support our target of an annual run rate of more than $500 million in adjusted EBITDA toward the end of 2022.\nLet me start my review of the financial results on Slide 5.\nTotal revenue for the second quarter were $146.4 million, down 16% from the prior year.\nThe driver for the decrease were the product segment, which was impacted by low product backlog.\nSecond quarter 2021 consolidated gross profit was $52 million, resulting in a gross margin of 35.4%, 200 basis point lower than in the second quarter of 2020, mainly driven by the reduction in the Electricity segment.\nThis quarter, we experienced mostly temporary issues related to the Olkaria, Steamboat and Brawley complexes.\nThese issues reduced our Electricity gross profit by approximately $8 million.\nFor the six months, gross margin was 40.1%, similar to the same period last year.\nWe delivered net income attributed to the company stockholders of $13 million or $0.23 in the quarter compared to $23 million or $0.45 per share for the same quarter last year.\nOur effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 22.6%, which is lower than the 33% effective tax rate from the second quarter of 2020, mainly due to the movement in the valuation allowances for each quarter.\nWe now expect the annual effective tax rate to stand by approximately 33% for the full-year 2021, assuming no material one-time impacts.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased 13.6% to $84.5 million in the second quarter, impacted mainly by gross profit reduction and higher G&A expenses, driven by increased legal costs.\nMoving to Slide 6; breaking the revenue down, Electricity segment revenues increased 4% to $134 million, supported by contribution from new added capacity at our Steamboat and McGinness Hill complexes, as well as Puna resumed operation.\nIn addition, our Steamboat Complex had a mechanical issue, it was resolved few days later.\nAnd in Brawley, we experienced a surface leak in one of the injection wells, which reduced generation.\nIn the Product segment, revenue declined 83% to $7.4 million, representing 5% of total revenue in the second quarter.\nThe decline year-over-year is expected to continue throughout '21, due to the lower backlog and the beginning -- from the beginning of the year.\nEnergy storage segment revenues increased nearly 124% year-over-year to $5.6 million in the second quarter, representing 4% of our total revenue for the quarter.\nThe growth was mainly driven by revenues from the acquired Pomona energy storage asset and the contribution of our Vallecito facility in California, which started commercial operation in April of 2021.\nLet's move to Slide 7.\nGross margin for the Electricity segment for the quarter decreased year-over-year to 37.4%.\nThis was the result of a higher cost related to the repair of the recovery of the Olkaria, Steamboat, and Brawley complexes.\nIn addition, in the second quarter last year, we did record a business interruption insurance recovery of $2.7 million related to Puna complex compared to zero this year.\nIn the Product segment, gross margin was 20.1% in the second quarter compared to 20.6% in the same time last year.\nThe Energy Storage segment reported again a positive gross margin compared to a negative gross margin in the second quarter last year.\nThe improvement was primarily driven by the acquisition of the Pomona Energy Storage assets.\nTurning to Slide 8.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased 40% to $84.5 million in the second quarter, impacted mainly by gross profit reduction and higher G&A expenses, driven by increased legal costs.\nThe Electricity segment generated 94% of the total Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter and the Product segment generated 4%.\nThe Storage segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $2 million, which represent 2% of the total adjusted EBITDA.\nReconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are provided in the appendix slide.\nOn Slide 9; our net debt as of June 30, 2021, was $1.40 billion.\nCash and cash equivalent and restricted cash and cash equivalent as of June 30 was approximately $330 million compared to $537 million as of year-end.\nIn addition, we had $46 million of marketable securities.\nSlide 9 breaks down the use of case for the six months and illustrates our ability to reinvest in the business, service debt, and return capital to our shareholders in form of cash dividends.\nAll from cash generated by operation and our strong liquidity position.\nOur long-term debt as of June 30, 2021, was $1.4 billion, net of deferred financing costs and its payment schedule is presented on Slide 30, in the appendix.\nThe average cost of debt was 4.9%.\nDuring July, we closed two new corporate loan raising approximately $175 million out of which $50 million are green bonds provided HSBC bank.\nFunds were used to finance the Terra-Gen acquisition.\nOn August 4, 2021, the company Board of Directors declared approved and authorized payment of quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share pursuant to the company's dividend policy.\nThe dividend will be paid on September 1, 2021, to shareholders of record as of the close of business day on August 18, 2021.\nIn addition, we expect to pay dividend of $0.12 per share in the next quarter.\nThat concludes my financial overview.\nTurning to Slide 12, for a look at our operating portfolio.\nPower generation in our power plants increased by approximately 2.4% compared to last year.\nIn the second quarter, we see the continued contribution of Steamboat related started operation in mid-2020.\nThe incremental contribution of McGinness Hill for approximately one month and the generation from Puna that is operating still in passive capacity.\nThese were partially offset by continued curtailment in low performance of the field in Olkaria power plant and other operational issues in the US that I will elaborate shortly.\nWe recently completed the expansion of our McGinness Hill facility and are now providing electricity for approximately 6,000 homes, while offsetting approximately 63,000 tons of CO2 emissions, delivering the highest level of efficiency and safety in the geothermal industry.\nWith the addition of the acquired operating assets, we are running one-gigawatt electricity portfolio, an increase of 83-megawatt in the second quarter.\nAs noted on Slide 13, Puna resumed operation in November 2020.\nWe have ramped Puna generation to approximately 28-megawatts, following the repair of a turbine, up from 20-megawatts in our last quarterly report.\nWe expect to reach 30-megawatts by year-end.\nWe have continued discussions with HELCO and the PUC about our new PPA and continue selling electricity under our existing PPA, which is in effect until the end of 2027.\nTurning to Slide 14.\nLet me discuss some of the challenges we experienced this quarter in a few of our operating assets.\nAnd I would start with the known one in Kenya.\nOur revenue in Olkaria complex was down year-over-year, as a result of continued curtailment and a reduction in the performance of the resource.\nThe combination of which has resulted in approximately a reduction of generating capacity of 25-megawatts.\nThis reduction in capacity reduced our quarterly gross margin by approximately $2.7 million.\nWe are operating to restore the complex generating capacity through our continuous drilling campaign in Kenya, and are optimistic we will see an increase in production through and by the end of the year.\nWe expect a similar quarter reduction in revenue until capacity is fully restored.\nWe also experienced a mechanical failure at our Steamboat Complex, resulting in revenue loss and interest expenses that reduced gross margin by approximately $2 million.\nThe Steamboat complex is now back to full operation.\nIn the Brawley Complex, we had a leak in one of the injections well and a pump failure in one of the production well which caused the reduction of the generating capacity to three-megawatt.\nWe are working to restore full production in Brawley.\nThe second half of 2021 will be impacted by the low performance of the Olkaria and Brawley power plant.\nAnd we have updated our annual guidance accordingly.\nTurning to Slide 15.\nIn July, we closed the acquisition Terra-Gen asset.\nThis acquisition added a total net generating capacity of approximately 67.5-megawatts to our portfolio.\nIn addition, we bought the greenfield development asset adjacent to Dixie Valley with high resource potential.\nAnd an underutilized transmission line capable of handling between 300-megawatts to 400-megawatts on 230-kilowatt electricity, connecting Dixie Valley to California.\nWith this acquisition, we now own 10 operating plants in Nevada, generating a total of 443-megawatt.\nThe proximity of this plant to population centers in both Nevada and California is important.\nCalifornia remains at the forefront of driving the adoption of renewable energy with supportive mandates and requirements already in place and more being considered.\nUtility companies in California are increasingly looking for affordable and reliable renewable energy.\nThis dynamic made the acquired transmission lines increasingly important.\nTurning to Slide 16 for an update on our backlog.\nWhile the results of our product segment continue to be impacted by the lower backlog at the beginning of the year, we are starting to see encouraging signs of recovery.\nWe have seen clear signs of improvement in this business, including an expansion of our backlog, reinforcing our confidence that this is a short-term phenomenon.\nAs of August 4, 2021, our product segment backlog increased 59% by $22 million to reach $59 million compared to $37 million in early May this year.\nWe signed a few contracts during the quarter, including a new contract with Star Energy Geothermal to supply products to a new 14- megawatt Salak geothermal power plant in Indonesia and then other contract to supply equipment to the project in Japan.\nDespite the recent improvements in this segment, we anticipate continued weakness in our product revenue during 2021 and have adjusted our annual guidance accordingly.\nPartially offsetting the weakness of the product segment, there has been a consistent improvement in our Energy Storage segment.\nAs I mentioned earlier and as discussed in Slide 17, this business continues to become a more important part of our consolidated results.\nThis quarter our projects in both the East Coast and Texas enjoyed higher revenues due to higher market prices.\nThe Storage Segment again generated positive EBITDA and we released two new project for construction in Ohio and California.\nMoving to Slide 18.\nAs previously mentioned, the supported mandates being implemented in California and the increasing demand for affordable and reliable renewable energy in this state.\nOne example is the recent ruling by CTC [Phonetic] require electrical load service entities LLCs to procure 11.5-gigawatt of new clean electricity by 2026.\nOne gigawatt of this procurement must deliver thermal power with an 80% capacity factor produce zero onsite emission and be weather- independent.\nNo form of renewable energy generation is more poised to fill this slate than geothermal, with a 95% capacity factor and thermal flexible generation.\nGeothermal energy is not only an excellent complement to intermittent resources, but the natural replacement for baseload fossil fuels and nuclear generation.\nCalifornia efforts to achieve its goal of 100% carbon free electricity by 2045, through massive deployment of renewable energy and energy storage resources enable us to sign new contracts for geothermal and we did this quarter with CPA for 14-megawatt Heber South geothermal power plant in the Imperial Valley, California.\nWe also issued our first ever request for the -- for the 26-megawatt Heber 2 and actively look for opportunities for our storage platform.\nMoving to Slide 20 and 21.\nAs we have communicated, 2021 will be a significant buildup year, comprised mainly of geothermal project.\nThis build up support of robust growth plans, which is expected to increase our total portfolio by almost 50% by the end of 2023.\nOur medium-term goal in the electricity segment is to add an additional 240-megawatts to 250-megawatts by year-end 2023, above the 80-megawatts added since the beginning of 2021.\nAnd in our rapidly growing energy storage portfolio, we plan to enhance our growth and to increase our portfolio by 200-megawatts to 300-megawatts by year-end 2022.\nAchieving this growth target is expected to help us reach an annual run rate of more than $500 million in adjusted EBITDA toward the end of 2022 that we expect to continue to grow as we move forward with our plans in 2023 and onwards.\nSlide 22 displays 13 projects underway that comprise the majority of our 2023 growth goals.\nWhile we are experiencing some delays in the permitting process, we are still on track to meet our growth target for the end of 2023.\nMoving to Slide 23 and 24, the second layer of our growth has come from the energy storage segment.\nSlide 23 demonstrates the energy storage facilities, we have announced or started construction.\nWe released two new projects for construction Boeing grant and Pomona [Phonetic].\nThe other projects included our growth plan are in different stages of development and their release will require site control and execution of an interconnection agreement, all obviously subject to economic justification.\nAs you can see on Slide 24, our energy storage pipeline extends two-gigawatt and plus [Phonetic] include 36 name, potential projects, mainly in Texas, New Jersey, and California.\nMoving to Slide 25, the significant growth in both our electricity and storage segment will require robust capital investment over the next couple of year.\nTo fund this growth, we have over $750 million of cash and available lines of credit.\nOur total expected capital spend for the remainder of 2021 includes approximately $280 million for capital expenditures as detailed on Slide 31 in the appendix.\nOverall, Ormat is well positioned with excellent liquidity and ample access to additional capital to fund future initiative.\nWe expect total revenues between $650 million and $685 million with Electricity segment's revenues between %585 million and $595 million.\nWe expect Product segment revenues between $400 million and $60 million.\nGuidance for Energy storage revenue are expected to be between $25 million to $30 million.\nWe expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $400 million and $410 million.\nWe expect annual adjusted EBITDA attributable to minority interest to be approximately $31 million.\nAs noted in previous quarter, adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2021 includes insurance proceeds of approximately $10 million.\nOperator, if you please?\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:This quarter's results continue to demonstrate the unique benefits of Western Alliance's National Commercial Business Strategy to position Western Alliance as one of the country's premier growth commercial banks that can consistently generate leading balance sheet and earnings growth with superior asset quality across economic cycles.\nThis quarter the bank produced record net revenues, PPNR and EPS, while expanding on net interest margin generating the highest return on tangible common equity in the bank's history and returning asset quality to pre-pandemic levels.\nFor the second quarter Western Alliance earned total net revenues of $506.5 million, net income before merger and restructuring charges of $236.5 million and adjusted earnings per share of $2.29, an increase of 20.5% from the prior quarter.\nThese results benefited from a $14.5 million reversal of credit loss provision consistent with our excellent asset quality results.\nStrong balance sheet growth continued with loans rising $2 billion excluding PPP loans or 29% on a linked quarter annualized basis and deposits by $3.5 billion or 37%.\nOur deposit and loan pipelines are very active and total assets now stand at $49.1 billion.\nNet interest income totaled $370.5 million up $53.2 million or 16.8% for the quarter as robust balance sheet growth rising NIM and access liquidity deployment significantly moves the earnings needle.\nStrong loan growth led to a 5.5% or $1.5 billion increase in average loan balances quarter-over-quarter.\nAdditionally, after closing the AmeriHome acquisition on April 7, we added $4.5 billion in held-for-sale mortgages primarily GSE qualified or 12.4% of our average interest earning assets yielding approximately 3.21% as an alternative to cash or mortgage backed securities.\nOptimizing our interest earning assets mix helped NIM expand from 3.37% to 3.51% in the second quarter.\nFee income was a record $136 million, representing 27% of total revenue as it began to integrate and optimize AmeriHome's mortgage banking related activities throughout the rest of Western Alliance.\nMortgage banking related income was $111.2 million in the second quarter demonstrating our ability to adjust win share as gain on sale margins fluctuate to maintain earnings.\nI think it's worth reemphasizing that what most attracted us to AmeriHome's business model was their low costs and flexible mortgage production and servicing ecosystem.\nTheir leverages are complementary corresponded and consumer direct channels to feed and enhance value throughout Western Alliance's commercial businesses while minimizing risk.\nBusiness-to-business correspondent mortgage lenders have several business levers and the flexibility to sustain earnings throughout the rate or throughout rate and economic cycles.\nDespite the evolving mortgage sector fundamentals AmeriHome continues to meet our expectations and contributed $0.39 to earnings per share in Q2.\nWe have optimized AmeriHome's balance sheet to Western Alliance capital levels with a servicing portfolio of $57.1 billion in unpaid balances.\nNo -- yeah, UPD, sorry.\nExpanded the number of correspondent sellers by 57 to 819 and taken advantage of market dislocations to drive value.\nIn the second quarter since April when the transaction closed, AmeriHome generated $20.7 billion in loan production or 25% above levels for the full quarter period a year ago and only down 3.6% from Q1 with 47% from traditional home purchases.\nGain on sale margin was 64 basis points for the quarter in line with 2019, 63 basis points.\nGiven the flexibility of AmeriHome's business model, we continue to stand by our full-year guidance of $1.41.\nAsset quality continued to improve this quarter as the economic recovery extended in breadth.\nTotal classified assets declined $43 million in Q2 to 49 basis points of total assets which is lower than Q1 '20s levels on both a relative and absolute dollar amount just as the pandemic impact was beginning to be felt.\nFor the quarter, net loan charge-offs were zero.\nFinally, Western Alliance is one of the most profitable banks in the industry with a return on average assets and a record return an average tangible common equity of 1.86%, 28.1% respectively which will continue to support capital accumulation to strong capital levels.\nTangible book value per share modestly declined to $32.86 from $33.2 as goodwill and intangibles doubled to $611 million in Q2 mainly from recognizing the AMH platform value.\nAt this time, Dale will take you through the financial performance.\nFor the quarter, Western Alliance generated adjusted net income of $236 million or $229 million adjusted earnings per share up 22.9% and 20.5% from the prior quarter.\nThis is inclusive of a reversal credit provisions that Ken mentioned of $14.5 million.\nIt excludes pre-merger -- pre-tax merger and restructuring expenses of $15.7 million related to AmeriHome.\nAdditionally, pre-provision net revenue of $277 million rose 37% quarter over quarter, excluding those same charges.\nAfter the AmeriHome acquisition, total net revenue grew $169.5 million during the quarter to $506.5 million, an increase of over 50% from the prior quarter.\nNet interest income rose $53 million during the quarter to $370.5 million, an increase of 24% year-over-year, primarily a result of our significant balance sheet growth and deployment of liquidity into higher yielding assets.\nAverage earning assets increased $4.1 million, while lower yielding cash proportion held at the Fed fell to 4.4% from 15%.\nNon-interest income increased $116.3 million to $136 million from the prior quarter and now represents 27% of total revenue due to mortgage banking-related income of $111 million from AmeriHome.\nWithin this category, net loan servicing revenue was a negative $20.8 million, as high refinance activity drove accelerated amortization of servicing rights but was far exceeded by gain on sale of mortgage loans.\nPre-AmeriHome WAL contributed 18% Non-interest income or $24.8 million in the second quarter compared to $19.7 million in the first quarter, supported by $7 million of income from equity investments.\nNon-interest expense, including merger and restructuring charges increased $94.5 million mainly due to the acquisition of AmeriHome which increased compensation costs as we added approximately 1,000 new members to the WAL team, as well as new costs related to loan servicing and origination expenses.\nTurning now to our net interest drivers, you can begin to see the benefit of AmeriHome to our strategy to expedite and optimize the deployment of excess liquidity into higher yielding assets as we added $4.5 billion in loans held for sale yielding 3.2% as opposed to cash yielding 10 basis points.\nInvestment yields improved to 10 basis points from the prior quarter to 2.47 while on a linked quarter basis loan yields excluding HFS declined 11 basis points following ongoing mix shift toward residential loans and a slight reduction in non-commercial real estate loan returns.\nInterest bearing deposit costs were flat from the prior quarter at 22 basis points.\nThe total cost of funds increased 8 basis points to 27 based on the -- due to issuance of $600 million of subordinated debt and the assumption of AmeriHome borrowings.\nThe spot rate for total deposits, which includes non-interest bearing was 11 basis points.\nWe expect funding costs have generally stabilized at these levels.\nAs a result net interest income grew $53.2 million to $370.5 million during the quarter or 24% year-over-year as average earning assets increased $4.1 billion.\nCash as a portion of the average interest earning assets fell to 4.4% from 15% in the quarter, which drove expansion by 14 basis points to 3.51%.\nAdditionally excluding the impact of PPP loans the margin would have increased 22 basis points.\nOur efficiency ratio rose to 44.5% from 39 in the first quarter mainly driven by the addition of AmeriHome employees and increase in incentive compensation costs.\nAs mentioned on our first quarter call we expected the efficiency ratio to rise to the mid-40s as a result of the acquisition.\nPreprovision net revenue increased $75 million or 37% from the prior quarter and 35.4% from the same period last year.\nThis resulted in preprovision net revenue of return on assets of $231 million for the quarter an increase of 28 basis points compared to $203 million in the first quarter.\nThis continued strong performance and leading capital generation provides a significant flexibility to fund ongoing balance sheet growth, capital management actions or meet credit demands.\nBalance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans held for investment increased to $1.3 billion or 4.6% to $30 billion and deposit growth of $3.5 billion brought balances to $41.9 billion at quarter end.\nIn all, total assets have grown 54% year-over-year as we approach the $50 billion asset level.\nBorrowings increased $1.2 billion over the prior quarter to $1.8 billion primarily due to $600 million subordinated debt issuance as well as the assumption of AmeriHome borrowings.\nFinally tangible book value per share decreased $0.16 over the prior quarter to $0.3286 but increased 18% year-over-year again driven by the AmeriHome acquisition of intangible assets that were largely offset by Q2 earnings and the issuance of common stock from our ATM of 700,000 shares for $70 million.\nDespite heightened competition and pricing pressure we continue to generate consistent strong organic loan growth from our flexible national commercial business strategy.\nLoans held for investments grew $1.3 billion in the quarter or $2 billion excluding PPP payoffs of approximately $700 million.\nA majority of growth this quarter was driven by an increase in residential real estate loans of $2 billion, which now comprise 17% of total loans as we look to deploy excess liquidity and integrated new flow arrangements from the recent Galton and AmeriHome transactions.\nThis was supplemented by growth in capital call lines of $162 million and construction and land loans of $89 million.\nTurning to deposits, we continue to see broad-based core deposit growth across business channels.\nDeposits grew $3.5 billion or 9.2% in the second quarter driven by increases in non-interest bearing DDA of $2.6 billion, which now comprise 48% of our deposit base and savings in money market deposits of $534 million.\nMarket share gains in mortgage warehouse continue to be significant drivers of deposit growth during the quarter along with strong performance from regional commercial clients, robust fund raising activity and tech innovation and seasonal inflows from the HOA banking relationships.\nOur asset quality continued to significantly improve this quarter.\nTotal classified assets fell $43 million in the second quarter to $238 million to 49 basis points of total assets.\nWhile our total classified assets ratio declined 16 basis points to 49 basis points due to continued improvement in COVID impacted clients.\nFinally, special mention loans declined $69 million during the quarter to 1.35% of funded loans.\nSimilarly, quarterly net credit losses were negligible at $100,000 for the quarter or zero basis points of average loans compared to a $1.4 million net loss in the first quarter.\nOur loan allowance for credit losses fell $16 million from the prior quarter to $264 million due to continued improvement in credit trends and macroeconomic forecasts and loan growth in portfolio segments with low expected loss rates.\nIn all, total loan ACL to funded loans declined 9 basis points to 88 basis points or 91 basis points when excluding PPP loans.\nFor comparison purposes the loan allowance for credit losses to funded loans was 84 basis points at year end 2019 before CECL was adopted.\nFinally, given our industry-leading return on equity and assets, we continue to generate significant capital to fund organic growth and maintain regulatory capital ratios.\nOur tangible common equity to total assets of 7.1% and Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.2% were weighted down this quarter by the AmeriHome acquisition and strong asset growth.\nHowever we issued 700,000 shares under our ATM shelf during this quarter and completed a $242 million in credit linked note transaction that reduced risk-weighted assets as we continue to look for ways to optimize our capital levels to support ongoing growth.\nAdditionally we completed $844 million in mortgage servicing rights dispositions and have already completed our expected Q3 mortgage servicing sales.\nCapital levels should build from here.\nInclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.25 per share our tangible book value per share declined $0.16 for the quarter to $0.3286 compared to an increase of 18% over the past 12 months.\nI'll now hand the call back to Ken for closing comments.\nAt the midpoint of the year I thought I would take this opportunity to reflect back upon our performance.\nWe deployed excess liquidity and turbo charged our net interest income.\nYear-to-date non PPP loans have grown $3.6 billion and deposits have grown $10 billion or 2.75 times the amount of loan growth providing us an opportunity to deploy liquidity and growth and grow net interest income AmeriHome's past Q2 guidance and is tracking to full year projections.\nAsset quality improved with substandard special mention and non-accrual loans tracking downward with nearly no net charge-offs for the quarter.\nReturn on tangible common equity was 28.1% for the quarter.\nPPNR, a key metric for the company earnings power was 37.1% -- grew 37.1% and we executed several capital raising transactions that Dale just mentioned.\nSo, for the second half of the year I think you can expect loan and deposits to continue to grow between $1 billion and $1.5 billion per quarter.\nNet interest income to grow quarter-to-quarter with incremental liquidity deployed into loans and investments to overcome the interest drag of the new sub debt and credit linked note issuances.\nNIM will continue to see some pressure as competition, interest rates and loan mix nudge loan yields downward.\nPPNR will follow net interest income and fee income growth and will continue to rise throughout the year.\nAsset quality will remain steady although with net charge-offs tracking to prior year -- prior year's performance or prior quarter's performance.\nWe continue to believe we will exit the year at a $9 earnings per share run rate level.\nAnd lastly, we will deploy growth based capital strategy to support above trend balance sheet growth.\nSummary: ",

detailed in the Company's SEC filings and last night's news release.\nIt cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without our express permission.\nThe purpose of the call is to review our second quarter 2021 results detailed in our news release issued yesterday.\nThe global COVID pandemic is far from over.\nBut with the growing availability of vaccinations, there is cautious yet positive momentum as domestic travel appears to be on the rebound and aircraft backlogs have started to grow again.\nWhile there remains uncertainty ahead, our focus has shifted toward a return to growth.\nAll of us recognize that the past year and a half has been unprecedented.\nThe global pandemic required Hexcel to take aggressive and swift restructuring actions, which we did.\nWe also took advantage of the lower production levels to drive cost and efficiency improvements.\nThese efforts have positioned us to exit the pandemic more focused and more efficient for a strong rebound.\nThe way our team responded to the challenges has been phenomenal and as reflected in the results we reported in our news release last night.\nOur robust start to the year continued into the second quarter with results in line with or slightly ahead of our expectations.\nWe achieved strong margin performance despite lower year-over-year sales as a result of a favorable margin mix from higher carbon fiber sales.\nCombined with the efficiency improvements and reductions in our overhead costs, we were able to deliver $0.08 of adjusted earnings per share for the quarter.\nIf you remember back to the second quarter of 2020, we also reported $0.08 of adjusted EPS.\nHowever, on sales, that were almost 17% higher in constant currency.\nThis demonstrates the cost controls actions that we took quickly in 2020 and that continue today are making a significant difference in the sustained value we offer to our shareholders.\nAs we anticipated last quarter, we believe inventory destocking is largely behind us as we move into the second half of the year.\nSpecifically, destocking for the A320 and 737 MAX are basically complete.\nThe widebody still have some inventory to burn through and we expect that will take a few more months to align with announced build rates.\nWe are encouraged that airlines such as United are placing orders with the commercial aerospace OEMs as revenue passenger kilometers continue to grow around the world.\nDeliveries climbed in June for both Airbus and Boeing, which we believe is further evidence that we, along with our customers, are beginning to emerge from the effects of this pandemic-driven downturn.\nHowever, while we anticipate gradual increases in build rates in the coming months, we recognize that it will take some time for rates to return to 2019 levels.\nEven with vaccines restoring confidence in travel, there are uncertainties with additional variants of the COVID-19 virus spreading.\nUS air travel is steadily increasing, but still about 25% lower than before the pandemic.\nEuropean travel is improving.\nHowever, the recovery is slower with flights remaining about 50% lower than pre-pandemic levels.\nSo while we see some encouraging signs and are planning for increased demand and a gradual recovery, we recognize that the effects of the pandemic on commercial aerospace and our business are likely to remain for some time.\nEven so, we are very excited about the future and pride ourselves on our relentless drive for continuous improvement.\nWith that in mind, we have taken full advantage of this time to deepen our customer relationships, which had never been stronger, to further improve our processes and to build our broad portfolio and our commitment to continued innovation.\nWe announced in May that we are building a flagship center of excellence for research and technology in the US to support next generation developments in advanced composite technologies.\nWhen it opens in 2022 at our Salt Lake City Campus, it will be our largest center for innovation and product development in North America and a showcase for our advanced composites technologies.\nEventually, about 150 scientists and other employees will work at the new center, including many of the experienced and talented R&T employees currently working in Dublin, California.\nWe will eventually sell the property in California, with the proceeds expected to fund a significant portion of our construction costs for the new center.\nWith about 100,000 square feet of laboratory and office space and the latest state-of-the-art testing equipment, it will allow us to expand our research to further develop new products and processes and provide an even greater opportunity for us to collaborate with our customers on the latest and advanced composites technologies to deliver innovative solutions and support future growth.\nDesign efforts are well underway and we expect to break ground in the fourth quarter of this year.\nWe're excited to make this investment in innovation today to ensure our continued leadership tomorrow.\nI look forward to inviting many of you to visit once the site opens toward the end of next year.\nI recently completed touring all of our US locations to conduct site readiness reviews.\nWhat I found during these site visits thrilled me.\nOur workforce is engaged, focused and highly motivated for a return to growth.\nThe caliber of site leadership and the shop forward teams across our plants is truly outstanding.\nI was shown numerous examples of increased productivity, significant process enhancements and a long list of continuous improvement projects our team has implemented across our manufacturing footprint during the pandemic to reduce costs, further enhance worker safety and job quality, and to position Hexcel to expand margins as growth returns.\nThe ability of the supply chain to ramp up remains a watch item for us and we are working very closely with our suppliers to successfully overcome any challenges that arise.\nThe same focus applies to our labor requirements, which I'm happy to say are growing once again.\nAt this point, we have been able to attract the labor we need.\nYet, we anticipate further challenges, which we'll address through robust recruitment, planning and continuing to stay in lockstep with our customers.\nNow, let me highlight some of the results from the quarter.\nAerospace sales of $154 million were down almost 25% compared to the second quarter of last year.\nNarrow-body demand is recovering quickly, with second quarter sales reaching their highest level since the first quarter of 2020.\nSales to Other Commercial Aerospace such as regional and business aircraft were down 27% compared to 2020.\nBusiness jets is the largest portion of this sector and sales continue to recover, but remain lower year-over-year.\nSpace and defense sales were about $107 million, which represents relatively flat year-over-year performance, affected primarily by pandemic-related production delays.\nAs you know, we have significant content on both the Lockheed Martin F-35 and Sikorsky CH-53 K, with these platforms receiving new orders within the past month.\nBoth will continue to be strong programs for us, as well as the 100-plus other defense and space programs in this sector.\nIndustrial sales were about $60 million during the quarter, which was a 15% decline in constant currency.\nWind energy sales, which is the largest submarket in Industrial, declined 44%, which reflects ongoing softer demand, along with the previously reported closure of our wind blade prepreg production facility in North America last November.\nIn addition, solid sales in other industrial markets, including automotive and recreation, helped offset reduced wind energy sales during the quarter.\nThroughout the pandemic, we have maintained a strong focus on cash and in the first half, our free cash flow was almost $30 million compared to just over $33 million for the first six months of 2020.\nSustainability is at the heart of Hexcel.\nInnovating and producing modern lightweight advanced composite materials enabling the evolution of more aerodynamic, fuel-efficient aircraft producing significantly lower emissions than older generation aircraft.\nMore broadly, responsibility has been one of our four primary values for many years and it calls on us to strive to be good citizens in the communities in which we live and work.\nWe continue to build on our sustainability goals highlighted in our sustainability report first published several years ago and we are now excited to participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project or CDP.\nInitially, the CDP report will be submitted selectively to some of our customers this year and we expect to share next year's submittal publicly.\nWe recognize that many of our investors evaluate our progress in relation to sustainability and especially, our ongoing work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nAnd you can be assured of our continued strong focus and actions on this topic.\nAs a reminder, the year-over-year comparisons are in constant currency.\nThe majority of our sales is denominated in dollars.\nHowever, our cost base is a mix of dollars, euros and British pounds as we have a significant manufacturing presence in Europe.\nAs a result, when the dollar strengthens against the euro and the pound, our sales translate lower, while our costs also translate lower, leading to a net benefit to our margins.\nConversely, a weak dollar is a headwind to our financial results.\nWe hedge this currency exposure over a 10-quarter horizon to protect our operating income.\nQuarterly sales totaled $320.3 million.\nThe sales decrease year-over-year reflects production rate decreases by our commercial aerospace customers in response to the pandemic, combined with the continued supply chain destocking.\nYou will recall that in the second quarter of 2020, OEM production rates were only beginning to be reduced midway through the quarter and the supply chain destocking had not yet begun to any great degree.\nI say this is a reminder to consider when evaluating the year-over-year sales comparisons.\nTurning to our three markets.\nCommercial aerospace represented approximately 48% of total second-quarter sales.\nSecond quarter commercial Aerospace sales of $153,7 million decreased 24.8% compared to the second quarter of 2020 with destocking continued.\nWe believe the substantial destocking is now behind us as we enter the third quarter of 2021 and that our narrow-body production is generally aligned with OEM production rates.\nHowever, our widebody sales are still facing some lingering supply chain adjustments that are expected to conclude by the end of the summer.\nSpace and defense represented 33% of the second quarter sales and totaled $106.9 million, decreasing 2.7% from the same period in 2020.\nWhile the demand outlook remains favorable for composite secular growth to enhance performance and extend capabilities, quarter-to-quarter sales can fluctuate as we experienced in the second quarter.\nLockheed Martin has publicly commented the F-35 deliveries in 2021 will be lower than initial expectations on pandemic-induced disruptions, which impacts the supply chain and our deliveries.\nSales were also softer due to some short-term pandemic-related interruptions impacting other programs, including a number of space-orientated platforms with customers located outside of the United States.\nIndustrial comprised 19% of second quarter 2021 sales.\nIndustrial sales totaled $59.7 million, decreasing 15.1% compared to the second quarter of 2020.\nWind demand remained subdued, while other industrial markets, including automotive and recreation, witnessed growth in the second quarter of 2021.\nWind energy represented approximately 45% of second quarter industrial sales.\nOn a consolidated basis, gross margin for the second quarter was 19.3% compared to 14.5% in the second quarter of 2020.\nThe strengthening gross margin benefited in the quarter from a higher mix of carbon fiber sales and production.\nOur margin recovery will not be completely smooth quarterly progression though, as it will be impacted at times by step-ups in the utilization of major assets such as precursor and carbon fiber lines.\nSecond quarter selling, general and administrative expenses increased 24.3% or $7 million in constant currency year-over-year.\nResearch and technology expenses decreased 3.2% in constant currency.\nThe other expense category consisted primarily of restructuring costs in Europe.\nIn terms of the year-over-year comparison of SG&A expenses, the second quarter of 2020 was artificially low as pandemic-induced restructuring actions related to non-recurring reductions in stock compensation accruals as well as a temporary implementation of salary reductions.\nAs a point of reference, second quarter 2021 SG&A expenses are lower by approximately 21% or $8.4 million compared to the pre-pandemic second quarter of 2019.\nOur targeted $150 million of annualized overhead cost savings is being fundamentally achieved at the end of the second quarter.\nAs we now pivot to increasing sales and production levels, our focus will be to drive efficiencies and minimize the amount of cost as we can, while at the same time preparing for significant growth.\nAdjusted operating income in the second quarter was $19.3 million, reflecting strong variable margin performance and robust overhead cost control.\nThe year-over-year impact of exchange rates was favorable by approximately 70 basis points.\nNow, turning to our two segments.\nThe Composite Materials segment represented 75% of total sales and generated a 9.6% operating margin compared to 6.3% in the prior year period.\nAdjusting for non-recurring costs, the adjusted composite materials operating margin in the current period was 10.7% compared to 8.9% in Q2 2020.\nThe Engineered Products segment, which is comprised of our structures and engineered core businesses, represented 25% of total sales and generated a 7.4% operating income margin or 7.6% adjusted operating margin compared to 2.6% adjusted operating margin in the second quarter of 2020.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 18.8%.\nThe pandemic and consequent mix of results across the countries in which we operate is expected to continue to impact the Company's overall effective tax rate throughout 2021.\nNet cash generated by operating activities was $38.9 million year-to-date.\nWorking capital was a use of $19.6 million year-to-date, primarily related -- primarily due to increased receivables.\nCapital expenditures on an accrual basis was $3.8 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $11.5 million for the prior year period in 2020.\nCapital expenditures continue to be tightly managed with a focus on improving existing asset efficiency and new technology flexibility.\nFree cash flow for the second quarter of 2021 was $35.8 million compared to $51.8 billion in the prior year period.\nContinued tight cost control and lower capital expenditures are supporting free cash flow generation.\nLiquidity, at the end of the second quarter of 2021, consisted of $115 million of cash and an undrawn revolver balance of $543 million.\nOur liquidity remains well above the bank covenant minimum of $250 million and we have no near-term debt maturities.\nOur revolver matures in 2024 and our two senior notes mature in 2025 and 2027 respectively.\nOur share repurchase program is restricted through March 31st 2022 by the revolver amendment executed in January 2021.\nDividends also remain suspended at the current time.\nOur Board continues to regularly evaluate capital allocation priorities.\nAs our earning release states, we are not providing financial guidance at this time.\nHowever, I would like to reinforce and expand upon the financial outlook shared during the First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call.\nWe continue to expect 2021 annual sales to be lower than 2020 and below the current market consensus due to recent commercial aerospace production rate adjustments.\nThe remainder of our previously stated expectations remain largely unchanged, including some additional restructuring costs are anticipated in the remaining quarters of 2021 and are expected to be below first and second quarter levels.\nWe continue to expect the fiscal year 2021 adjusted operating margin percentage to be in the low single digits.\nCapital expenditure in 2021 will continue to be managed closely and are expected for the full year to be at a similar level to 2020.\nWe expect to generate positive free cash flow in 2021 and further reduce debt levels.\nWe expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 25% in 2021.\nLastly, repeating some broad context from the first quarter's earning call in April, we continue to target strong mid-teens-plus operating margins once we achieve sales in the range of $1.8 million to $1.9 million [Phonetic] and we are targeting to exceed prior peak margins when we return to previous peak sales levels.\nWe believe the worst is behind us and we are cautiously optimistic of a continued and steady recovery during the remainder of 2021 that will propel us into 2022 when we expect a significant return to growth, which will extend into 2023 and beyond.\nWithout a doubt, some of this growth will come from pent-up demand for air travel.\nYet, much of it also comes from airlines ready to replace older, less efficient aircraft with more aerodynamic and fuel-efficient solutions as the world demands long-term reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.\nNo company has a broader or more vertically integrated portfolio of strong, durable and lightweight advanced composite solutions that lead to fewer emissions than Hexcel.\nThe market is demanding lighter, yet high-performing materials and we anticipate strong pull for our entire portfolio from carbon fiber to prepreg to engineering core for many years to come.\nAdditionally, no team is better prepared to meet a quick ramp up than our Hexcel team.\nOver the past several months, while demand retracted, we planned for the inevitable rebound.\nWe have become more efficient, more cost effective and more competitive than ever.\nThroughout the downturn, we have improved our processes to ensure that we continue making gains, especially in employee safety, quality and on-time delivery.\nCertainly, there are risks ahead and especially so within the supply chain and the availability of raw materials and labor.\nIt comes down to staying focused and aligned with our customers and we intend to do just that.\nI'm excited about the path ahead.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:These statements reflect the participants' expectations as of today, but the actual results could be different.\nParticipants also expect to refer to certain adjusted financial measures during the call.\nOur company began fiscal '22 with positive momentum following an incredibly challenging year battling the pandemic.\nIn each successive quarter, our people worked with great tenacity and success to improve top and bottom-line results to close the gap pre-pandemic levels, drive the recovery, and return to profitable growth.\nWe entered the pandemic year from a position of strength following 11 consecutive quarters of comp sales growth in our footwear businesses.\nOur overall performance in a difficult environment reflects the strong competitive positions of our retail and branded concepts, the strength of our Footwear Focus strategy, and our success capitalizing on opportunities to bolster these positions.\nAs a result, fiscal '22 is off to an incredibly strong start with the first quarter that meaningfully exceeded our expectations.\nOur outperformance was driven by better-than-anticipated results at every division, led by record first-quarter revenue and profitability at Journeys.\nEven as the pandemic continued to impact our businesses to varying degrees, the pace of our recovery accelerated each month and overall in Q1, reflecting stellar execution, combined with a temporary boost from U.S. government stimulus, and pent-up demand as the economy reopens faster than anticipated.\nI'd like to begin today by outlining some of the key highlights from the quarter.\nFirst, revenue and operating profit exceeded pre-pandemic levels, increasing 9% and 125%, respectively, over Q1 Fiscal '20 two years ago, even with our stores opened for a little less than 90% of the possible operating days in the quarter, given closures primarily in the U.K. and Canada.\nNext, higher operating profit, combined with pre-pandemic share repurchases delivered outstanding Q1 earnings per share of $0.79, compared with a loss of $3.65 last year with positive earnings per share of $0.33 two years ago, all on an adjusted basis.\nAnd finally, we achieved record first-quarter digital revenue and profit as we continue to capitalize on the accelerated shift to online spending.\nWe sustained last year's 64% growth and added another 43% on top of that.\nOther highlights include hitting our highest store traffic numbers compared to pre-pandemic level as the vaccine rollout increased shoppers' confidence to return to physical stores, increasing the gross margin of almost 500 basis points compared to last year as our merchandise assortments and inventory management continued to fuel strong full-price selling, leveraging SG&A significantly compared to pre-pandemic levels, and achieving greater capital efficiencies by managing inventories and capital spending effectively leading to a healthy balance sheet and solid cash position.\nWe were pleased that every business in every channel contributed to the beat versus expectations with the stores delivering the biggest gain.\nWe've always known our customers enjoy our differentiated store experience and the exceptional service they receive in person, and that has been so exciting to see the strength of our brands draw enthusiastic shoppers back in as economies reopen.\nIt was, however, the combination of the store and e-commerce results that led to the strength in the quarter.\nOur online business, from a strong foundation prior to COVID-19, generated double-digit operating margins due to our focus on full-price selling, disciplined marketing spend, and shipping-and-return policies to reinforce profitability.\nTo advance our digital capabilities at an even faster pace, we announced we promoted Parag Desai to the newly created position of chief strategy and digital officer.\nIn this new role, Parag will drive greater synergies and continue to integrate systems and digital best practices across our e-commerce portfolio, while also working with our divisions to deepen consumer insights and CRM capabilities.\nOur digital investments have been generating strong results and we are confident Parag's appointment will accelerate progress, ensuring that we take advantage of the many omni-channel opportunities the pandemic presented.\nTurning now to discuss each business in more detail beginning with Journeys, which again led the way delivering record first-quarter revenue and profit with 75% operating income growth versus pre-pandemic level.\nThere are several factors that shaped Journeys' exceptional Q1 performance starting with superb execution by its merchant team.\nThe pandemic has only magnified Journeys' industry-leading capabilities of anticipating, identifying, and securing the brands and styles most coveted by our team customers.\nThe combination of the right assortments and effective consumer engagement drove strong demand and full-price selling, including later in the quarter when we captured a healthy share of the increased consumer spending following the arrival of government stimulus checks and tax refunds.\nIn addition, Journeys' store team executed with excellence, achieving much higher conversion rates and increased transaction size, capitalizing on improving store traffic to drive store revenue above pre-pandemic levels.\nOn top of this, Journeys' online team delivered e-commerce sales that more than doubled pre-pandemic levels as new website visitors increased by almost 30% and generated close to 50% of Q1 online revenue.\nWith these incredibly strong vendor relationships, the Journeys team accomplished all of this while skillfully managing through the supply chain disruptions, which persisted in the industry throughout the quarter.\nJourneys' offering of casual products resonated strongly with consumers as comfort continue to rain as the fashion choice of the pandemic.\nWhile teens always have a big complement of fashion athletic footwear in their closets, we have talked about when fashion swings toward non-athletic or casual footwear, Journeys is especially well-positioned among its competition to deliver this assortment.\nMoreover, current teen fashion trends are diverse and playing into a number of Journeys' brand strengths.\nWhile fashion athletic grew nicely year over year, the gains in casual outpaces growth, including a strong start to the sandals season.\nCongratulations Journeys team on another record quarter as the destination for fashion footwear for teens.\nOver in the U.K., Schuh delivered a commendable performance under very difficult circumstances.\nStores were open for less than 20% of the possible operating days during the quarter due to government-mandated lockdowns that began around Christmas and continued until after Easter.\nDespite the substantial loss of store days, revenue was in striking distance of Q1 two years ago and operating income exceeded pre-pandemic levels, including some one-time gains.\nThe Schuh team leaned successfully into its best-in-class digital capabilities throughout the pandemic to take advantage of the shift to online purchasing.\nThe first quarter was no exception as direct comps grew by more than 70% on top of last year's 90% growth and constituted more than 80% of Schuh's total revenue.\nPrior to COVID-19, Schuh had the most advanced digital capabilities among our retail businesses, which have only strengthened over the past year through enhanced CRM capabilities, including more robust prospecting.\nSchuh implemented significant operational changes to facilitate this digital growth, including reconfiguring its DC and labor model to add more e-commerce, packing stations, extending the deadline for next-day delivery through new freight carrier arrangements, and using stores as many DCs by rotating store fulfillment of e-commerce orders.\nstores at the end of the quarter.\nWith seven of the top 10 best-performing brands in common, many of the trends driving Schuh's business were similar as usual to the ones driving Journeys, but with more of a fashion athletic tilt.\nBefore moving on from Schuh, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate the team on the official certification of its operations by Carbon Footprint Ltd as a carbon-neutral organization.\nIt has for a long time been a part of Schuh's DNA to operate in a socially responsible manner, consistent with its purpose pillars, and this accomplishment is the result of the team's efforts over several years.\nThis impressive achievement was realized ahead of schedule and provides the roadmap for our other businesses as we seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and work with our partners to reduce the carbon footprint of the products that we sell.\nFor Johnston & Murphy, the first quarter marked another positive step forward in its recovery.\nAs vaccines rolled out, consumers began their return to life phase more quickly than expected, gathering with family and friends in social outings and occasions.\nIn Q1, retail store traffic improved in each successive month, digital sales grew a notable almost 20%, attracting new customers to the brand, and wholesale revenue increased.\nThe announced recovery plan is centered around new product technology and innovation with 90% of new product development focused on expansion of its casual offering.\nWe were pleased that Q1's success was driven by high demand for newly developed casual styles, led by the athletic-inspired Amherst and Activ8 collections, and a new holistic marketing campaign in support of these launches.\nAt the same time, we saw continued gains in golf shoes and apparel this spring further validating our success extending J&M beyond its dress shoe roots.\nWhile sales lagged pre-pandemic levels, we are encouraged by these trends and expect the recovery to accelerate once America begins the return to office phase likely begin in earnest as we enter summer and move into fall.\nIn yet another highlight, license brands is now beginning to realize the benefits of the Levi's footwear license and Togast acquisition that closed in January 2020 right as the pandemic began.\nRevenue more than doubled to record Q1 levels, and operating profit improved considerably versus pre-pandemic levels as Levi's footwear was well received in accounts ranging from department stores to Journeys and Journeys Kidz to family footwear.\nThis progress reinforces our excitement about the potential to create value by combining powerful brands with our fully integrated footwear sourcing capabilities.\nTurning now to the current quarter.\nWhile Q2 is typically our lowest volume quarter as teams and consumers in general turn their attention to getting out-of-school and summer activities, the momentum from Q1 has continued into May.\nWhile we expect government stimulus and pent-up demand to ebb at some point, we expect Journeys' strength to continue, Schuh's strength to build with the opening of stores in the U.K. economy, and Johnston & Murphy's recovery to continue, but it will likely take until back to work in the fall to propel another step function improvement.\nVaccine rollout progress should benefit store traffic in the back half of the year, and we expect that a good amount of the digital business that we captured during the pandemic will be sticky and anticipate a much higher e-commerce penetration as compared to fiscal '20.\nWe're anticipating a more normalized back-to-school with a significant return to in-person learning and a more normalized holiday.\nSome COVID effects will linger, but with higher savings and continued government aid, the consumer is well-positioned to spend.\nWhile stimulus has been a positive, the strength we're seeing in our results goes well beyond this tailwind to the traction and momentum we're experiencing as a result of our strong portfolio of businesses and the strategic direction we embraced a couple of years ago with our footwear focused strategy.\nThe pace of our recovery only reinforces our belief that the path we were on prior to the pandemic and now is the right path forward.\nWhat we're most excited about is we see opportunities to solidify the digital gains we made and capitalize on the ongoing industry consolidation to further expand our market share.\nCOVID-19 has provided us the real opportunity to transform our business at a faster case, and our results demonstrate that's what we're accomplishing.\nQ1 results far exceeded both our expectations and last year across the board.\nFor comparison purposes, we believe that comparing to two years ago, our pre-pandemic fiscal '20 provides the most meaningful assessment of current performance is there is simply too much noise in fiscal 21's results for drawing informative comparisons.\nHowever, looking back at how our business has changed since fiscal '20, e-commerce has become a larger percentage, and our licensed brand segment has become a larger piece of the total as well due to the acquisition of Togast and strong Levi's sales.\nThese changes come with an overall lower gross margin rate due to the impact of direct shipping expense and the expansion of our wholesale volume, which should be more than offset with lower SG&A from these businesses, coupled with the impact of our cost reduction initiative once our business normalizes post-pandemic.\nWhile these changes will reshape the P&L, they have a positive impact on operating margins and an added benefit of a less capital-intensive business model.\nTurning back to Q1.\nI'm pleased to report that the first quarter continued the sequential improvement of our operating results since the onset of the pandemic.\nHigher revenue in excess of pre-pandemic levels, combined with SG&A that remains well managed, led to significantly higher operating income versus fiscal '20, and Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $0.79 compared to $0.33 in fiscal '20.\nIn terms of the specifics for the quarter, consolidated revenue was 539 million, up 9% compared to fiscal '20, driven by continued strength in e-commerce, up 144% versus fiscal '20 combined with strong results from Journeys and licensed brands compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nWe did not provide overall or store comp results in Q1 as our comp policy removes any stores that are closed for seven consecutive days, either this year or last year.\nAnd therefore, we feel that overall sales is a more meaningful metric.\nOverall digital sales increased to 25% of our retail business compared to 11% in fiscal '20, led by Journeys' penetration improvement, Schuh's ability to capture lost store sales online, and J&M's double-digit improvement compared to fiscal '20.\nLicensed brands revenue was up 122% versus fiscal '20.\nConsolidated gross margin was 47.8%, down 160 basis points from fiscal '20.\nAs we have experienced since the onset of the pandemic, increased shipping to fulfill direct sales pressure the gross margin rate in all our businesses, totaling 150 basis points of the overall decline, driven mainly by Schuh's much higher level of digital sales due to store closures.\nWhile e-com puts pressure on our gross margin rate, as I mentioned, it comes with a lower cost structure and a high operating income rate.\nJourneys' gross margin increased 130 basis points driven by lower markdowns in both stores and online.\nSchuh's gross margin decreased 1,030 basis points due largely to the higher shipping expense from the shift in channel mix since e-commerce accounted for so much issues revenue in the quarter.\nJ&M's gross margin decrease of 200 basis points was due to more closeouts at wholesale and higher markdowns at retail.\nHowever, it was a sizable sequential improvement.\nFinally, the combination of lower revenue at J&M, typically the highest gross margin rate of our businesses, and the revenue growth of licensed brands, typically our lowest gross margin rate negatively impacted the overall mix by 90 basis points.\nAdjusted SG&A expense was 44.3%, a 340-basis-point improvement compared to fiscal '20 as we leverage from higher revenue and ongoing actions around expense management.\ngovernment program, which provides property tax relief, rent abatements, and our ongoing rent savings on renewals.\nThe next largest areas of savings came from the reduction in store selling salaries, driven by the effective use of workforce management tools to drive higher conversion in the face of wage pressure.\nThese savings were partially offset by incentive compensation driven by improved profitability and increased marketing expenses needed to drive traffic to both stores and online.\nOver the past many years, our organization has been intently focused on a critical effort to reduce occupancy costs, given the shift of traffic online.\nAnd we continue to have even greater traction during the pandemic.\nIn Q1 this year, we negotiated 48 renewals and achieved a 29% reduction in cash rent or 27% on a straight-line basis in North America.\nThis was on top of a 23% cash rent reduction or 22% on a straight-line basis for 123 renewals last year.\nThese renewals are for an even shorter term, averaging approximately two years compared to the three-year average we have seen in recent years.\nWith over 40% of our fleet coming up for renewal in the next 24 months, this will remain a key priority for us going forward.\nIn summary, the first quarter's adjusted operating income was 18.8 million versus fiscal '20's 8.4 million.\nJourneys, Schuh, and licensed brands all achieved higher operating income compared to fiscal '20.\nOur adjusted non-GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was 36%, reflecting the impact of foreign jurisdictions for which no income tax benefits were recorded.\nTurning now to the balance sheet.\nQ1 total inventory was down 18% compared to fiscal '20 on sales that were up 9%, with all divisions showing improvement.\nOur ending net cash position was 214 million, 32 million higher than the fourth quarter's level, driven by strong cash generation from operations.\nCapital expenditures were 12 million as our spend remains focused on digital and omnichannel, and depreciation and amortization was 11 million.\nWe closed 17 stores and opened one during the first quarter.\nDue to limited visibility in the business of the impact of the pandemic, we will not be providing guidance for the second quarter or full fiscal 2022.\nThat said, I do want to share some high-level thoughts on how we are expecting the upcoming quarter to play out.\nAs I mentioned, we believe it is best to use the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 as the reference point.\nQ1 revenue benefited from stimulus and new Levi's business with headwinds from store closures at Schuh.\nAnd while J&M's trend is improving, it remained lower than fiscal '20.\nExpenses in Q1 benefited from rent abatements and some government relief programs.\nSelling salary dollars were lower in the quarter as Schuh stores were opened for less than 20% of the quarter.\nAs we transition into Q2, in May, we continue to feel the tailwind is stimulus but expected to wane as we progress through the quarter.\nAs we enter back-to-school late in Q2, we assume that schools will return to in-person learning this fall with which should be a more normalized back-to-school selling season for Journeys and Schuh.\nAround the same time, we expect more customers should begin returning to their offices which should further benefit J&M's trend.\nNow getting to more specifics of Q2, starting with revenue, we expect higher revenue compared to fiscal '20 levels.\nThis is mainly due to growth at Journeys, Schuh stores coming back online, and continued strength from the Levi's business.\nJ&M's trajectory is expected to improve but remain under fiscal '20's level.\nDirectionally, the overall sales increase for Q2 compared to fiscal '20 could be a little less than the 9% increase we experienced in Q1.\nOur view does not contemplate additional store closures or restrictions from COVID-19 beyond what we know today.\nGross margin rates for Q2 will be below fiscal '20 levels, but better than the 160-basis-point decline we experienced in Q1.\nThe sequential improvement is expected to come from better margin at Schuh, which will have a lower penetration of e-com compared to Q1.\nOverall, higher e-commerce penetration and the higher shipping costs that come with it continue to put pressure on our rate versus fiscal '20.\nAdditionally, we anticipate the pressure from J&M to continue into Q2, as well as the impact of the license brand's growth on our business model as previously discussed.\nWe expect that the adjusted SG&A rate in Q2 will be in the ballpark of the rate in fiscal '20.\nSequentially, we will not see the large SG&A leverage we saw in Q1 as the benefits from rent abatements and some government relief programs will be less than Q1.\nCompared to fiscal '20, higher revenue, combined with our ongoing cost reduction initiatives, will drive an improvement but will be offset by higher performance-based compensation.\nAs a reminder, our EVA program pays for year-over-year improvement and we paid no incentive compensation last year, which will have an impact in every quarter this year.\nIn summary, we expect operating income to be around breakeven for Q2, which is historically our lowest volume quarter of the year, making it difficult to turn a large profit.\nFor taxes, with operating income around breakeven in Q2, we expect a negligible tax expense.\nThe annual tax rate is expected to be approximately 32%.\nIn addition, thinking about the year, we'd also like to note we had a number of expense pick-ups like rent abatements in the back half of fiscal '21 during the pandemic we don't expect to repeat in the back half of this year.\nGiven the accelerated shift of our business from stores to digital and the impact from the pandemic, we continue to make progress on reshaping our cost structure with rent expense as a critical component.\nWe have good experience reducing our cost base.\nDuring fiscal '19 and '20, we identified 43 million in expense savings, and in addition, following the divestiture of Lids, we eliminated the 9 million stranded costs associated with that business.\nMore recently, in fiscal '21, during the pandemic, we reduced our adjusted SG&A expense by over 15%.\nWhile a good amount of this was temporary, there are also significant permanent dollar savings.\nThis has become a core competency of Genesco.\nAs a reminder, our initial target for this year is to identify savings in operating expenses of 25 million to 30 million or approximately 3% on an annualized basis.\nThese savings are coming from reduced occupancy costs and selling salaries and lower IT, transportation, and marketing costs from our procurement initiatives already under way.\nThese savings are before investing in the variable expenses necessary for our increased digital sales, as well as minimum wage and other new cost pressures, and increased inflation that time will tell whether it's temporary or permanent.\nTo date, we have made significant process on the targeted savings and we'll continue to provide updates as the year unfolds.\nThis cost-saving initiative is one part of a multipronged strategy to transform our business, all designed to reflect the more capital-efficient model.\nCombined with lower capital expenditures on stores, fewer lease obligations, and efficient use of inventory, it will drive further improvements and return on invested capital and allow for improved flexibility in our operating model.\nThe team has much to be proud of and remains aligned on delivering on our footwear-focused strategy.\nAs I said, the footwear-focused strategy we embarked on a couple of years ago is the right strategy for our business and the foundation of our strong performance.\nLet me briefly revisit the rationale behind this strategy and how it continues to drive results.\nAcross our company, we aspire to create and curate leading footwear brands that represent style, innovation, and self-expression, to be the destination for our consumers' favorite fashion footwear.\nOur strong strategic positioning in a specialty consumer markets we serve, close connections with our customers, and enduring leadership positions are what make each of our footwear businesses distinctive on their own, and the synergies they share make them stronger together.\nWe are best known for our retail platform, but we have an important and valuable side of our business that successfully owns and licenses brands, giving us another good platform for future growth.\nOur opportunity to unlock the full potential of Genesco is to accelerate the digital and omnichannel potential in our retail businesses and to meaningfully grow our brand inside.\nWe operate in an industry undergoing substantial change with the continued consumer adoption of digital commerce, positioning our company to effect transformational change.\nWe made substantial progress on this in fiscal '20, and the pandemic despite its challenges was an accelerant to this change.\nLooking at the retail side of our business, Journeys' understanding of teens and unrivaled access to merchandise they want equips Journeys uniquely well to serve this fickle customer and to navigate the shifts that are an advantageous and inherent part of fashion footwear in this market segment.\nSchuh occupies an essentially identical position in the UK.\nBoth brands have exceptional merchandising abilities and a passionate focus on customer service.\nBoth serve as key omnichannel distribution partners for the current most relevant youth footwear brands.\nGiven that they enjoy significant overlap in their vendor bases, their combined scale allows for stronger brand relationships underscored by activities like joint top to top global summit and shared special makeup product collections sold exclusively at Journeys and Schuh.\nVendor scale, along with product and consumer insights, provide great synergies, as well as strategic and operational initiative sharing.\nA strong example of this is Schuh entering into the kids' business and now a substantial, profitable, and growing part of Schuh by borrowing and leveraging Journeys' know-how and success.\nThe anchor of the branded side of our company is Johnston & Murphy, whose leadership position is founded on brand equity that has taken 170 years to build.\nThis heritage, ability to interpret and shape its customers' evolving fashion needs through time, and established omnichannel expertise provide a strong foundation for recovery from the pandemic.\nAs a complement to brands we own, licensed brands allows us to leverage our footwear capabilities and expertise across other well-known brands with strong brand equity and opens additional tiers of distributions.\nOur branded businesses benefit from common wholesale trade relationships and product trend inspiration exchange.\nAnd in addition, the global sourcing platform spanning across J&M and licensed brands provide some of the most meaningful benefits.\nFor example, licensed brands designs, develops, and sources product accounting for one-third of the casual footwear sold in J&M factory outlets, including the top-selling style overall.\nOur branded platform is Genesco's most promising platform for future growth.\nThis platform allows for leveraging of our robust direct-to-consumer capabilities, complemented by well-developed wholesale channel relationships, giving us the opportunity to add additional footwear brands that can plug into this infrastructure and capitalize on today's retail landscape where brands increasingly go direct to consumer.\nLicenses plugged into this infrastructure also add value, evidenced by the success we're having with Levi's and the enhanced capabilities Togast added to our footwear sourcing platform.\nIn addition, not only do we benefit from a North American shared services platform in areas like technology, logistics, finance, and HR, but size and scale matter even more in our now technology and digitally driven retail sector as the investments to keep pace with consumer expectations continue to grow.\nWhile Journeys and Johnston & Murphy go to market as separate and distinctive brands, they share almost all of their retail systems and services, providing significant cost-sharing and enhanced benefits.\nFrom point-of-sale software to merchandising systems to loss prevention and real estate, the retail technology and infrastructures of these two concepts are largely integrated.\nFor example, the point-of-sale software upgrade we're rolling out this year will serve both Journeys and J&M.\nLikewise, the wholesale technology infrastructures of J&M and license brands are significantly integrated as well.\nAs we look to the remainder of fiscal '22 and beyond, further leveraging these synergies within and across platforms is an important step in delivering increased value on top of the six strategic growth pillars driving our footwear-focused strategy.\nThese six pillars put in place prior to the pandemic emphasize continued investment in our digital and omnichannel capabilities, deepening our consumer insights, driving product innovation, and reshaping our cost base.\nOn future calls, like the last one, I'll provide an update on the significant progress we're making on these six pillars and corresponding strategic initiatives, which are having real impact to driving growth and profits for Genesco.\nNot only have we taken care of our customers and each other during the pandemic, but we began the year on a firm foundation that allowed us to grow and create tremendous value in our company.\nIn addition, over the last several months, we've added four very qualified and experienced directors to our board, whose perspectives will be invaluable as we shape our future.\nGenesco is on the right path.\nOur strategy is working.\nOur future is bright.\nAnd I have never been more excited about the people and potential in our business.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Our SEC filings can be found in the Investors section of our website at unum.com.\nNet income for the second quarter of 2021 included the after-tax cost related to the early retirement of debt of $53.2 million or $0.26 per diluted common share.\nThe after-tax amortization of the cost of reinsurance of $15.5 million or $0.08 per diluted common share, an after-tax impairment loss on the right-of-use asset related to one of our operating leases for office space we are no longer using to support our general operations of $11 million or $0.05 per diluted common share, a net after-tax realized investment gain on the company's investment portfolio of $600,000 or $0.01 per diluted common share and a net tax expense related to a U.K. tax rate increase of $24.2 million or $0.12 per diluted common share.\nNet income in the second quarter of 2020 included an after-tax impairment loss on the right-of-use asset of $10 million or $0.05 per diluted common share and a net after-tax realized investment gain of $25.4 million or $0.12 per diluted common share.\nSo excluding these items, after-tax adjusted operating income in the second quarter of 2021 was $286.2 million or $1.39 per diluted common share compared to $250.1 million or $1.23 per diluted common share in the year ago quarter.\nI am very pleased with our second quarter results.\nWe showed a 13% increase year-over-year in after-tax adjusted operating income to $1.39 per share.\nThese improved results were driven in large part by the significant decline in COVID-related mortality this quarter and by excellent performance in our investment portfolio.\nGiven our strong second quarter results, we are raising our outlook for full year 2021 growth in after-tax adjusted operating income per share to a decline of approximately 1% to 3% compared to our previous outlook of a decline of 5% to 6%.\nWe believe we're making good progress to returning to our pre-pandemic levels of profitability and margins over the coming quarters with the trajectory of that improvement dependent on the developing trends in COVID and the Delta variant.\nEmbedded in our expectations is that COVID mortality will improve but only slightly in the third and fourth quarters.\nIn many ways, results for this quarter played out in line with our expectations, with declining mortality impacts, solid underlying premium trends and further strengthening of our healthy capital position.\nThis quarter was also highlighted with some areas of positive upside relative to our expectations.\nMost notably, we saw continued excellent returns from our alternative investment portfolio, which is benefiting from the strong financial markets and growth in the economy.\nWe also saw a record level of quarterly operating income for Colonial Life along with an impressive recovery in sales.\nAnd rounding it out, we had favorable underlying benefits experience from our Closed Block business lines, both long-term care and the Closed Disability Block.\nIn addition to the positive trends we saw this quarter, I am pleased that our indicators continue to support our expectation of generating slightly positive growth in premium income in our core business segments this year with further improvement expected into 2022.\nSales trends are emerging in line with our expectations at our primary business lines within Unum US.\nAnd Colonial Life showed very strong results this quarter with over a 50% increase from the year ago quarter, a good indicator of consumer interest in the basic financial protection products we offer.\nIt also highlights that the agency model of Colonial Life is quite resilient as we saw some of the most pronounced headwinds in the early stages of the pandemic.\nIn addition to sales trends, we remain very encouraged with the strong levels of persistency we're seeing across the majority of our business, which provide a solid base to grow.\nFinally, we're seeing a pickup in natural growth primarily from higher wages in many sectors of the economy as we continue to build back premium income that was impacted by the sharp spike in unemployment in the first half of 2020.\nThe environment we are seeing today is quite good for our core business.\nWe often talk about wage inflation, but you have to add to the mix there is renewed recognition for the need to prepare for the unexpected.\nAnd in a competitive world for talent, employers are looking to ensure that they have competitive benefits package for their current and prospective employees.\nTurning to our capital position at quarter end.\nIt remained very healthy as well, with holding company cash of $1.7 billion and weighted average risk-based capital for our traditional U.S. insurance companies at 375%.\nBoth of these measures are in excess of our targets and provide substantial flexibility for us going forward.\nAdditionally, this quarter, we successfully completed a 30-year debt issue and redeemed a shorter high-coupon maturity, enabling us to further extend our debt stack while reducing the overall coupon.\nLeverage remains approximately 28% -- 26% and provides further capital flexibility for us.\nThis strong capital position creates options for us as we look to create value for our shareholders.\nOur deployment strategy will first focus on continuing to invest in the growth of our core business segments, both organically and through capability-driven acquisitions.\nWe like our position in the employee benefits market, and putting money to work to grow our core franchise is where we are focused.\nWe also expect to be consistent in returning capital to shareholders through dividends, which will increase by 5.3% with the dividend to be paid this month.\nWe do have funds in excess of these needs, so as we look to the future, we are constantly evaluating how to best deploy or hold on to this capital.\nA key question is how we can use these funds to lessen the challenge to our current share price from the overhang of our legacy LTC block.\nOur goal is to help reduce the LTC discount in our stock.\nAnd in the future, this funding would be utilized in any risk transfer transaction that we explore on a portion of this block should that become an option for us.\nWhile we are clearly optimistic looking forward, we do see areas of our business that continue to be impacted by the pandemic.\nResults in our short-term disability line and leave services continue to be impacted by COVID-related claims, which remains stubbornly high.\nThe group life and AD&D business within Unum U.S. returned to profitability in the second quarter after recording losses in the previous two quarters as COVID-related mortality in the U.S. declined materially from the peak levels experienced late last year through the early months of 2021.\nWhat we are watching now is that the Delta variant is impacting a younger, unvaccinated population that has different dynamics from what we have seen to date from COVID-19.\nRecently updated estimates for COVID-related mortality for the third quarter and second half of 2021 are pointing to persistently high counts and only a marginal improvement relative to the second quarter.\nWe continue to watch these trends closely and are reflecting them in our own plans.\nThere is room for optimism, though, as we have started to see employers looking at the role that they might play in getting more of the population vaccinated.\nAs we look at growth in our enterprise, the steps we're taking -- we've taken to run our business more efficiently have freed up funds that we're reinvesting in new products and capabilities that tackle some of today's critical business workplace challenges.\nDuring the quarter, we launched our new Total Leave and behavioral health solutions, and we've logged our first sales for both offerings.\nOn the digital front, platforms like My Unum and Colonial Life's improved portal are steadily providing more self-service, real-time capabilities for clients and customers.\nAnd new technology we're testing will enhance the digital enrollment experience, automate processes and allow people to interact with us in new ways.\nEqually important is the work we're doing to strengthen our culture and engage our employees across the enterprise.\nWe've taken steps during the quarter to accelerate and expand our inclusion and diversity journey, and we broaden the scope of our social justice fund to support even more groups facing discrimination.\nThese and many other efforts help place Unum among the Points of Light, Civic 50, and in Forbes Best Employers for Diversity, Best Employers for Women and Best Employers for New Graduates.\nWe're also happy to receive another perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index and to be named a best place to work for disability inclusion.\nThese efforts and accomplishments reflect the strong culture we have built.\nWe are proud of how it has helped us endure through the challenges of the past 1.5 years and how the engagement of our team will propel us going forward.\nNow I'll ask Steve to cover the details of the second quarter results.\nI'll start with the Unum US segment, which reported adjusted operating income for the second quarter of $179.3 million compared to $115.7 million in the first quarter.\nThese results improved significantly due to the improvement in COVID-related mortality in our group life business line, which I'll provide more detail on in a moment.\nWe also saw improved operating income from the supplemental and voluntary line, while income in the group disability line declined compared to the first quarter.\nWithin the Unum US segment, the group disability line reported operating income of $59.9 million in the second quarter compared to $64.1 million in the first quarter.\nThe primary driver of the change was lower net investment income, which largely resulted from a lower level of on calls.\nPremium income was generally consistent between the two quarters and on a year-over-year basis increased 1.1%.\nThe group disability benefit ratio for the second quarter was 74.7%, which is consistent with the first quarter benefit ratio of 74.8%.\nWe feel the benefit ratio will likely remain at this level over the near term due to the impacts we are seeing from COVID in the Delta variant, which we now believe will likely persist through the second half of the year.\nAdjusted operating income for Unum US group life and AD&D showed a sharp improvement in the second quarter to income of $5.2 million compared to a loss of $58.3 million in the first quarter.\nThis improvement is consistent with our expectations and largely explained by the significant reduction in COVID-related mortality in the U.S., which declined from approximately 200,000 nationwide observed deaths in the first quarter to approximately 52,000 in the second quarter.\nWe estimate that we incurred approximately 800 excess claims from COVID in the second quarter compared to an estimate of 2,050 COVID claims in the first quarter.\nOur average size of claim increased in the second quarter by approximately 10% as we experienced a mix shift to a more younger, working-age policyholders who typically have higher benefit amounts.\nNon-COVID-related mortality had little impact on results this quarter relative to the first quarter as lower incidents was offset by higher average claim size.\nNow looking ahead to the third quarter, our current expectation for nationwide COVID related mortality of approximately 40,000 compared to approximately 52,000 experienced in the second quarter.\nAssuming the shift in the mix continues to more younger, working-age individuals with a continued higher average benefit amount, we would estimate third quarter group life operating income to show a modest improvement over second quarter results to approximately $15 million.\nWe are closely watching the impacts emerging from the COVID variants, which have led to increase in estimates for second half mortality expectations.\nNow shifting to the Unum US supplemental and voluntary lines.\nWe saw an improved quarter with adjusted operating income of $114.2 million in the second quarter compared to $109.9 million in the first quarter.\nLooking at the three primary business lines.\nFirst, we remain very pleased with the performance of the individual disability recently issued block of business both in the second quarter and throughout the pandemic.\nThough the benefit ratio did increase to 48.4% in the second quarter from 42.4% in the first quarter, it continues to perform quite well compared to our pre-pandemic experience as new claim incidence trends and recovery levels remain favorable.\nThe voluntary benefits line recorded a strong level of income as well.\nThe benefit ratio increased in the second quarter relative to the first quarter, though it did remain consistent with the pre-pandemic results.\nThe benefit ratio in the group critical illness line increased, offsetting the improved experience in the life lines of business.\nAnd then finally, utilization in the dental and vision line was higher this quarter, as was the average cost per procedure, pushing the benefit ratio to 77.1% in the second quarter compared to 73.2% in the first quarter.\nDental and vision utilization has been volatile since the significant decline in utilization we did experience in the second quarter of 2020.\nSales for Unum US in total declined 3.1% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis compared to a decline of 10.3% in the first quarter.\nFor the employee benefit lines, which include LTD, STD, group life, AD&D and stop loss, total sales declined by 3.1% this quarter.\nWe saw good activity and results in the core markets for group disability and group life.\nWhile large case sales were down year-over-year, we are seeing a good level of quote activity in the group markets, which is back to pre-pandemic levels.\nSales trends in our supplemental and voluntary lines showed similar improvement in the second quarter relative to the first quarter.\nFor this quarter, total sales declined 3.1% year-over-year compared to the 22.3% decline in the first quarter.\nOur recently issued individual disability sales increased 4.9%, and dental and vision sales increased 2.4% year-over-year.\nVoluntary benefit sales were down 7% in the quarter, which is consistent with our view that these sales will take longer to recover.\nLarge case DB sales in particular have a longer sales cycle and are more concentrated around January one effective date.\nPersistency for our major product lines in Unum US remained in line to higher this quarter relative to the first quarter of 2020, providing a good tailwind for premium growth for the full year and into 2022.\nWe have also seen favorable trends and natural growth in our employee benefits lines primarily from higher wage growth at this point.\nNow moving to the Unum International segment.\nAdjusted operating income for the second quarter was $24.8 million compared to $26.4 million in the first quarter and $15.1 million in the second quarter of 2020.\nThe primary driver of these results is in our Unum UK business, which generated adjusted operating income of GBP16.8 million in the second quarter compared to GBP18.6 million in the first quarter and GBP10.1 million in the second quarter of 2020.\nWe are pleased with these results, which showed improved underlying benefits experience particularly in our group life line.\nThe reported benefit ratio in Unum UK, which showed an increase to 82.5% in the second quarter from 75.3% in the first quarter was impacted by the increase in inflation in the U.K. in the second quarter compared to the first quarter.\nHigher inflation triggers higher inflation-related benefits to certain of our policyholders as well as higher net investment income from the inflation index linked yields in our investment portfolio.\nThe rapid increase in inflation in the U.K. from the first to second quarter did distort somewhat the timing of these two factors and produced a net negative impact of slightly less than GBP three million to adjusted operating income this quarter.\nThis short-term impact to income is expected to balance out over the course of the year.\nOverall, we are very pleased with the results in our International business with benefit ratios adjusted for inflation for Unum UK improving both on a sequential and year-over-year basis.\nPremium growth for our International businesses was also favorable this quarter compared to a year ago.\nLooking at the growth on a year-over-year basis and in local currency to neutralize the benefit we saw from the higher exchange rate, Unum UK generated growth of 3% with strong persistency and the ongoing successful placement of significant rate increases on our in-force block.\nAnd Unum Poland generated growth of 12.4%, a continuation of the low double-digit growth this business has been producing.\nWith this growth, our Unum International in-force premium is now at its highest level.\nNext, we are very pleased with the results generated by Colonial Life, with adjusted operating income of $95.8 million in the second quarter compared to $73.3 million in the first quarter.\nThis record quarterly income level was primarily driven by improved benefits experience and higher net investment income.\nThe benefit ratio improved to 51.7% in the second quarter from 55.4% in the first quarter as experience in the life insurance block improved with the overall decline in COVID-related mortality.\nExperience in both the accident, sickness and disability lines and the cancer and critical illness line also improved relative to the first quarter.\nAdditionally, net investment income increased on a sequential basis, which was primarily driven by higher income from bond calls.\nLooking out to the third quarter, we anticipate adjusted operating income to settle back to the low to mid-$80 million range as some of this favorable experience moderates.\nWe're very excited with the rebound in sales activity we experienced in Colonial Life this quarter, increasing 53.7% on a year-over-year basis.\nWhile this strong recovery comes off of a COVID depressed result in the year ago quarter, this quarter marks a return to year-over-year growth as face-to-face sales reemerge, and we drive further utilization of our digital sales and enrollment capabilities.\nAs expected, premium income declined 4.3% on a year-over-year basis and will likely continue with negative comparisons for the next couple of quarters until sales volumes have sufficiently recovered.\nPersistency for Colonial Life continues to show an encouraging trend at 78.3% for the first half of 2021, almost one point higher than a year ago.\nThen in the Closed Block segment, adjusted operating income was $111.2 million in the second quarter compared to $97 million in the first quarter, both very strong quarters relative to our historical levels of income for this segment.\nResults this quarter benefited from strong levels of net investment income due to higher levels of miscellaneous investment income, which I'll cover in more detail in just a moment, as well as favorable underlying benefits results in both long-term care and the Closed Disability Blocks.\nLooking within the Closed Block, the LTC block produced a slightly lower interest adjusted loss ratio of 74.6% in the second quarter compared to 77.7% in the first quarter, both results quite favorable to our long-term expected range of 85% to 90%.\nOver the past four quarters, the benefit ratio for LTC was 70% excluding the impact of the fourth quarter 2020 reserve assumption update.\nWe continue to see higher mortality experience in the claim a block in the second quarter and estimate that counts were approximately 5% higher than expected.\nLTC claims incidence was slightly higher in the second quarter, though we have seen higher recoveries on many of these claims, which mitigates the financial impact.\nLooking forward to the second half of the year, we anticipate that the interest adjusted loss ratio for LTC will likely remain slightly favorable to our long-term assumption range as mortality and incidence trends continue to normalize from the impacts of COVID.\nFor the Closed Disability Block, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 69.6% in the second quarter and 68.9% in the first quarter.\nThe underlying experience on the retained block, which largely reflects the active life reserve cohort and certain other smaller claims blocks we retained, performed favorably to our expectations primarily due to lower submitted claims.\nSo overall, it was a very strong performance this quarter for the Closed Block segment driven by both higher miscellaneous income and favorable underlying benefit experience.\nWe estimate the quarterly operating income for this segment will over time run within the range of $45 million to $55 million, assuming more normal trends for investment income and claim results.\nSo wrapping up my commentary on the quarter's financial results.\nThe adjusted operating loss in the Corporate segment was $48.5 million in the second quarter compared to $38.9 million in the first quarter.\nWe anticipate the quarterly losses in the Corporate segment will moderate in the second half of the year to the low to mid-$40 million range.\nI'd now like to turn to our investment portfolio, where we are seeing very favorable overall credit trends.\nFirst, there were no downgrades of investment-grade securities to high yield this quarter.\nIn fact, we had net upgrades in ratings overall for the portfolio, which generated a small capital benefit to us this quarter.\nIn addition, our internal watch list of potential credit concerns is now lower today than it was coming into the pandemic in early 2020.\nFirst, we saw a high level of miscellaneous investment income from bond calls again this quarter as many companies look to refinance higher coupon debt and take advantage of today's lower interest rates and tight spreads.\nWe had approximately $10 million higher investment income from bond calls this quarter relative to our historical quarterly averages.\nOver the past several quarters, this has been extremely volatile and difficult to predict from quarter-to-quarter.\nWhile these bond calls enhance current period investment income, it is a challenge to replace the lost deals in today's low interest rate environment.\nSecond, as I mentioned previously, we continue to see strong performance in the valuation mark on our alternative investment assets, which totaled $51.9 million in the second quarter following a positive mark of $35.9 million reported in the first quarter.\nBoth quarters are well above the expected quarterly positive marks on the portfolio of $12 million to $14 million.\nThis quarter's very strong returns, primarily reflected returns for the period ending March 30, 2021, due to the lags in reporting typical on many of these investments.\nThe higher returns this quarter were generated from all three of our main sectors, credit, real estate and private equity, and reflect the strong financial markets and strong economic growth.\nIt is hard to predict quarterly returns for miscellaneous investment income, but the third quarter so far, we are seeing a continuation of favorable trends in bond call premiums.\nMoving now to our capital position.\nThe financial position of the company continues to be in great shape, providing a significant financial flexibility.\nThe risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. insurance companies improved to approximately 375%, and holding company cash was $1.7 billion as of the end of the second quarter, which are both well above our targeted levels.\nDuring the second quarter, we successfully completed a debt offering issuing $600 million of a 30-year senior note with a coupon of 5 1/8.\nThis was the lowest coupon on a 30-year debt issue in our history.\nThe proceeds from the issue were used to redeem the $500 million of 4.5% issue that would have matured in 2025.\nAnd you'll see the debt extinguishment costs associated with the redemption included in our net income this quarter.\nImportantly, this transaction enabled us to extend the duration of our debt stack and reduce the overall coupon on our outstanding debt.\nWith the issuance and the redemption completed in the second quarter, our leverage ratio currently is 26.2%, providing additional financial flexibility.\nAn important industry development recently was the finalization of the C1 factor changes, which have been under consideration by the NAIC for the past several years.\nAt our outlook meeting this past December, we indicated that our capital plan for 2021 -- in our capital plan for 2021, we assumed a negative impact of approximately $225 million from the adoption of the factor changes.\nAs you are likely aware, the NAIC concluded by adopting a recommendation from Moody's analytics, which are not as impactful to our capital plan as we previously had assumed.\nWe now estimate the impact to our capital position to be less than $70 million rather than the $225 million we had previously projected, a very good outcome for us, which provides upside to our capital expectations for year-end 2021.\nI'll close my comments with an update to our outlook for 2021.\nPreviously, we expected a modest decline of 5% to 6% for full year 2021 after-tax adjusted operating income per share relative to the 2020 level of $4.93 per diluted common share.\nGiven the strong second quarter results and our updated view on COVID trends, we are revising our outlook upward and now look for 2021 after-tax adjusted operating earnings per share to decline by a range of approximately 1% to 3% relative to 2020.\nOur underlying performance is expected to remain quite healthy, but COVID and the Delta variant will continue to be an important driver of results.\nAs you'll hear from the rest of the team, we continue to be very pleased with the operational performance of this company through what has been an extraordinary environment.\nWe believe we are well positioned to benefit from today's improving business conditions, and we remain vigilant as the pandemic continues.\nSo let me ask the operator to be open up the session.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:On the call today are Jeff Jones, our President and CEO; and Tony Bowen, our CFO.\nSome of the figures that we'll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis.\nSuch statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance.\nAs such, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially.\nYou can learn more about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2019 and our other SEC filings.\nDuring Q&A, we ask that participants limit themselves to one question with a follow-up after which they may choose to jump back into the queue.\nWhen we talked with you last quarter, we outlined our strategic objectives to digitally enable every aspect of our business to deliver our expertise to consumers in new and exciting ways, and we're seeing some positive results.\nWe're focused on serving Assisted clients with higher quality and better value and are on track to achieve our goal of holding share in the category.\nWe are seeing stronger demand for our Virtual product Tax Pro Go.\nWe continue to grow clients in DIY.\nClient satisfaction scores are up across all products following a year in which we saw unprecedented growth.\nAnd we continue to make strides in small business including another strong quarter from Wave.\nWhile I'm pleased with these early results we identified a couple of areas to improve DIY performance in the second half, that I will comment on later.\nFirst, I'll provide our perspective on what we've seen in the tax industry.\nThen I'll review our tax season to date results, discuss our expectations for the second half of the season and provide an update on small business.\nFinally, Tony will review our third quarter results and offer additional thoughts on our financial outlook for the fiscal year.\nStarting with the industry.\nOverall trends in filings are consistent with our expectations.\nAt this point the increase in DIY mix is at levels lower than last year.\nSo while there was speculation by some that the second year of the new tax law would cause more Assisted filers to switch to DIY, we aren't seeing any evidence of this in either our data or the industries and the change has actually moderated.\nTurning to our performance, I'd like to spend some time providing an update on our progress in each of the key areas we outlined last quarter.\nWe're focused on leading the industry with upfront transparent pricing, enhancing our standard operating procedures and digitizing how tax pros serve clients through Work Center.\nIn pricing, we're bringing upfront and transparent to life in an even stronger way this year through a new price estimator tool to help our tax pros provide clients a better estimate at the outset.\nUpfront transparent pricing is the key element of our recently launched No Surprise Guarantee, which also provides three audit assistance and a midyear tax check-in for clients across all of our products.\nWe've also improved Work Center which digitizes how our tax pros serve and communicate with clients, providing them with a superior experience.\nWe're seeing results from these efforts with higher retention for both new and prior clients as well as better conversions.\nClient survey scores increased 3 points for price for value and 2 points for overall quality, considering the 9 point improvement in these scores last season, these results are tremendous.\nThis has led to a significant improvement in client trajectory compared to this time last year.\nWith a lot of season left, we're confident that we will achieve our goal of holding share in the Assisted category.\nTax Sseason '20 marks the second year of Tax Pro Go.\nAn innovative product that provides clients with access to be unparalleled expertise of our tax pros from the convenience of their mobile device.\nThis year we redesigned the client experience to improve the product flow, simplified pricing, and made it easier to connect with our expert tax pros.\nWe're also highlighting the advantages of this product in our marketing, which is driving an increase in Tax Pro Go demand and mobile usage.\nWe're seeing the results of these efforts with improvements in key client service metrics and strong client growth.\nAnd while we're still in the early stages of this product, this continued growth gives us confidence that we can satisfy unmet needs and attract new clients to our brand.\nIn DIY, we've maintained our challenger strategy of investing to improve the product and user experience, pricing at a level that is competitive and provides value to clients, and communicating this value to grow awareness in compelled DIY consumers to switch to H&R Block.\nWe continue to utilize AI and machine learning to improve ease, speed and personalization in our product.\nWe've also increased the prominence of Online Assist, which provides DIY clients with on-demand access to a tax pro through chat, phone and screen sharing.\nThis product is priced competitively and is supported by the unmatched expertise of our extensive tax pro network.\nAnd our service levels have been tremendous this season, with most clients able to access the Tax Pro within one minute.\nCollectively, these efforts have led to strong results in our net promoter scores increasing over 3 points.\nThis is a significant -- this is significant considering the 9 point increase we saw last year.\nAnd our product has received a number of third-party accolades, including number one in thestreet.com's ranking of the best online tax software and NerdWallet's best software for simple returns.\nWhile we're excited about the progress we're making in our product and in the value we're delivering for our clients, we believe we can improve both our volume and net average charge result in the second half and have already taken the appropriate steps.\nFirst, we made changes to optimize our marketing investment to drive greater new client demand.\nAnd second, we have corrected an issue with a key online page that didn't allow clients to choose a different product, resulting in a loss of monetization.\nSince we have remedied the issue we have seen a 4% improvement in net average charge in DIY.\nWe're confident that we've made the appropriate changes and believe that our second half will be stronger.\nWe expect to end the year growing DIY clients in line with the category.\nFinally, in small business, starting with tax.\nWe've highlighted our expertise through new tools and a redesigned experience.\nWe're beginning to see traction from these new initiatives but believe it will take some time to increase awareness of our small business expertise.\nWith Wave, we continue to innovate to simplify the financial lives of small business owners.\nDuring the quarter, Wave continued to make progress on its strategic roadmap in a number of areas.\nWe're seeing demand grow for Wave advisors, where clients can get personalized help from our in-house bookkeepers.\nIn payroll, we're adding full service capabilities in more states to automatically file clients state and federal payroll taxes.\nAnd in payments, we've made key changes to streamline the client onboarding process to assist clients and getting the right product and to gather key information earlier in the process.\nAll of these improvements are fueling Wave's impressive performance which continued this quarter with year-over-year revenue growth of over 40%.\nTo summarize, we're on track to deliver our financial outlook for the year by digitally enabling our business, driving improved client trajectory in Assisted, innovating in Virtual, enhancing our award winning DIY product and expanding in small business.\nWe have clear visibility in the areas for improvement and are focused on executing in the second half to deliver stronger results by seasons end.\nWith that, I'll now hand the call over to Tony.\nBefore I get into the details of our results, as a reminder, we typically report a loss during the fiscal third quarter due to the seasonality of our tax business.\nTherefore, third quarter results are not representative of our full year performance.\nStarting with revenues, we saw a year-over-year growth of $51 million or 11% to $519 million.\nThis increase was primarily due to higher tax preparation fees due to volume growth in Assisted and DIY and the acquisition of just over 200 franchise offices this year which continues to be a good use of capital.\nThe volume growth also resulted in higher royalties as well as increased revenues related to our Tax Plus products.\nIn addition to increases in our tax business, Wave contributed $11 million, which represents a year-over-year increase of more than 40%.\nTotal operating expenses increased $65 million or 11% to $672 million.\nThe majority of this increase was anticipated as it was driven by Wave, increased compensation due to higher Assisted volumes, and planned investments related to our technology roadmap.\nWe also recorded $19 million of incremental marketing expense during the quarter that was entirely due to a pull forward of recognition from Q4 to Q3, and was not due to an increase in spend.\nBecause of this timing shift, we expect marketing expense to be lower in Q4.\nI'll discuss our full year outlook including expectations for operating expenses later in the call.\nInterest expense was $26 million, which reflects an increase from the prior year due to higher draws on our line of credit.\nThe changes in revenue and expenses resulted in an increase in pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $18 million.\nGAAP loss per share increased $0.08 to $0.66.\nAs we shared last quarter, we are now reporting GAAP and non-GAAP EPS.\nAdjusted loss per share increased $0.07 to $0.59 driven by the increase in pre-tax loss and lower shares outstanding, partially offset by an increased tax benefit.\nAs a reminder, while beneficial on a full year basis, the lower share count negatively impacts earnings per share in quarters in which we report a loss.\nIn discontinued operations there were no changes to accrued contingent liabilities related to Sand Canyon during the quarter.\nRegarding capital, our priorities remain unchanged.\nAt the top of list is maintaining adequate liquidity for our operational needs to account for our seasonality.\nWe came into this year with a strong financial position after generating over $500 million of free cash flow in fiscal '19.\nWe then make strategic investments back in to the business that we believe deliver value to our clients, ultimately benefiting our shareholders.\nMaking prudent investments to drive sustainable growth remains a key element of our capital allocation.\nLast, we will deploy excess capital through quarterly dividends and share repurchases.\nWe've increased our quarterly dividend each of the last four years, resulting in a 30% increase over that time.\nRegarding share repurchases in the third quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for $66 million at an average price of $23.35.\nYear-to-date, we have repurchased a total of 10.1 million shares for $247 million at an average price of $24.36.\nGoing forward, we will continue to be opportunistic in our share repurchase approach.\nI'd now like to provide thoughts on our financial outlook for the remainder of the year.\nStarting with the tax industry, we continue to expect overall return growth of around 1%, with Assisted volume flat to slightly up and DIY growing around 3%.\nThis is consistent with the trends we've seen over the last several years.\nFor H&R Block, as Jeff shared, we expect growth in DIY clients in line with the category, and an improvement in client trajectory in Assisted as we hold market share in that category.\nCombined this would be the third consecutive year of overall client growth.\nRegarding pricing, in Assisted we expect net average charge to remain consistent with last year, following a year in which we reset price.\nIn DIY, during the first half of the season, we saw a decrease in net average charge, due to the product issue that Jeff discussed.\nWe've remedied this and combined with anticipated growth in Online Assist, we expect mix to improve in the second half, resulting in net average charge similar to last year.\nConsistent with the outlook we provided last quarter, we expect these client growth and net average charge expectations along with Wave to result in revenue growth of 1.5% to 3.5%.\nFor the full year, we expect to grow revenue faster than EBITDA resulting in a decline in EBITDA margin compared to fiscal '19.\nThis year, we realized approximately $15 million of unplanned one-time expenses -- one-time expense increases, due to legal cost and Refund Advance fees, which will also impact our margin.\nDespite these expense increases, we continue to expect EBITDA margin to be within our previously provided range of 24% to 26%.\nGiven our year-to-date results, this full year outlook infers a significant increase in EBITDA in the fourth quarter.\nThis will be achieved through continued revenue growth as well as a reduction of certain expenses in the fourth quarter related to the timing of marketing expense recognition that I mentioned earlier and lower compensation related to accrued bonuses.\nAs we indicated last quarter, we expect the tax rate of 19% to 21% due to favorable settlements with tax authorities during the second quarter.\nThe rest of our financial outlook also remains unchanged with total depreciation and amortization of $165 million to $175 million, of which $70 million to $80 million will be amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions.\nThis amortization expense reflects both Wave and tax office acquisitions and is excluded from earnings per share for non-GAAP reporting.\nWe continue to expect interest expense of $90 million to $100 million and capital expenditures of $70 million to $80 million.\nTo conclude, I'm confident in our plans for the second half of the tax season, and we are on track to deliver our financial objectives for the fiscal year.\nTheir dedication to providing help and inspiring confidence in our clients and communities is what makes H&R Block the great company it is today.\nOverall, I'm excited about the progress we're making toward our long-term goals and I'm confident we're taking the steps necessary to deliver on our objectives for the fiscal year.\nI look forward to sharing more with you when we report our full-year result in June.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:To follow along with the slides, please visit jabil.com within our investor relations section.\nAt the conclusion of today's call, the entire call will be posted for audio playback on our website.\nThese statements are based on current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially.\nAn extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified on our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 and other filings.\nWith that, I'd now like to shift our focus to our strong quarter and outstanding results.\nFirst off, the team delivered $400 million of core operating income on roughly $8.6 billion in revenue, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.7%.\nThese results were primarily driven by broad-based strength in several key end markets, including healthcare, industrial and semi cap, and of course, mobility, as customary for our first fiscal quarter.\nAnd finally, it's worth noting that our team was able to accomplish all of this in spite of the chaotic global supply chain environment.\nIn summary, we delivered strong results, grew in key end markets, and successfully navigated a dynamic global supply chain, clearly demonstrating the power of Jabil by way of our scale, tools, team, and relationships.\nIn a few moments, both Mike and Mark will provide more details on the quarter, while also addressing our improved outlook for the year.\nBut before I hand it over, I'll pass along some thoughts from Jabil's procurement and supply chain team, as you may find it helpful when modeling our year.\nIn short, demand continues to outstrip supply, particularly as it relates to semiconductors, an issue that has persisted since 2019.\nThat said, Jabil continues to leverage best-in-class tools and relationships to maximize our allocation and keep the factories in production to the best of our ability.\nSo far, we have been extremely successful.\nAs we move ahead, we anticipate continued supply chain challenges, which have been incorporated in our guidance similar to previous quarters.\nWe do expect some relief toward the back half of the fiscal year, but the general consensus is that demand will remain ahead of supply for the next six months.\nAs Adam just highlighted, Q1 was an exceptional quarter.\nThe team delivered strong results on three fronts: revenue, core operating income, and core diluted earnings per share.\nOur results were better than expected due to a combination of continued end-market strength and excellent operational execution by the entire Jabil team, along with lower tax and interest expense.\nNet revenue for the first quarter was $8.6 billion, up 9.4% over the prior-year quarter.\nGAAP operating income was $350 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.63.\nCore operating income during the quarter was $400 million, an increase of 9.6% year over year, representing a core operating margin of 4.7%.\nCore diluted earnings per share was $1.92, a 20% improvement over the prior-year quarter.\nNow turning to our first quarter segment results on the next slide.\nRevenue for our DMS segment was $4.7 billion, an increase of 11.1% on a year-over-year basis.\nThe strong year-over-year performance in our DMS segment was broad-based, with strength across our healthcare, automotive, and mobility businesses.\nCore margin for the segment came in at 5.4%.\nRevenue for our EMS segment came in at $3.9 billion, an increase of 7.4% on a year-over-year basis.\nThe stronger year-over-year performance in our EMS segment was also broad-based, with strength across our digital print and retail, industrial and semi cap, and 5G wireless and cloud businesses.\nCore margin for the segment was 3.8%, 40 basis points higher than the prior year, reflecting solid execution by the team.\nTurning now to our cash flows and balance sheet.\nIn Q1, inventory days came in at 66 days, a decline of five days sequentially.\nThe management team continues to be fully focused on this metric, particularly in the current environment.\nAnd I expect over the medium to longer term, our inventory days to normalize below 60.\nCash flows used in operations were $46 million in Q1 and net capital expenditures totaled $73 million.\nWe exited the quarter with total debt-to-core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.3 times and cash balances of $1.2 billion.\nDuring Q1, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares or $127 million.\nTurning now to our second quarter guidance on the next slide.\nDMS segment revenue is expected to increase 4% on a year-over-year basis to $3.8 billion, while the EMS segment revenue is expected to increase 14% on a year-over-year basis to $3.6 billion.\nWe expect total company revenue in the second quarter of fiscal '22 to be in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.7 billion.\nCore operating income is estimated to be in the range of $290 million to $350 million.\nGAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $266 million to $326 million.\nCore diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.55.\nGAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.39.\nThe tax rate on core earnings in the second quarter is estimated to be approximately 24%.\nNext, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight our balanced portfolio of businesses by end market.\nToday, both segments are in incredibly good shape.\nIn September, I highlighted several long-term sustainable secular trends in strategically important end markets, such as Healthcare, Automotive, Cloud, Semi-Cap, 5G Infrastructure, and the associated connected devices, along with power generation and energy storage.\nFor the remainder of FY '22 and beyond, we continue to expect these secular trends to drive strong growth.\nOur electric vehicle business in particular continues to outperform in spite of global supply chain issues as the transition to ED accelerates.\nAnd importantly, our broad-based growth associated with these secular trends is expected to drive solid year-over-year core operating margin expansion in both segments.\nAll of which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver strong financial results for FY '22.\nAnd a balanced capital allocation framework approach is aligned and focused on driving long-term value creation to shareholders.\nI would like to wish each and every one of you a safe and happy holiday.\nI'd also like to recognize their hard work and tireless commitment, which drove solid results for our first fiscal quarter.\nNot only did our team deliver a favorable first quarter, but the diversification of our business was fundamental to the results, with each sector having a material contribution in the solutions we offer our customers and with each sector having a material contribution to our financial results.\nSpecifically, the four sectors in our DMS segment focus on margins while offering reliable cash flows, while the four sectors in our EMS segment focus on cash flows, while offering reliable margins, a perfect complement as the well-diversified construct of Jabil continues to drive our execution.\nIf we dig a little deeper, we find secular trends embedded within certain sectors, secular markets where we now play and have a substantial presence.\nWe believe these markets will drive our growth, with the overwhelming majority of such growth occurring organically as we place our attention on secular opportunities, opportunities such as 5G, electric vehicles, personalized healthcare, cloud computing, and clean energy.\nFurthermore, our commercial portfolio is intentional, and we think quite special.\nEach slice of this pie harbors domain expertise, affording us an essential collection of valuable capabilities.\nAlthough what's most impactful is the way in which we merge these capabilities with precision and speed as we serve our customers.\nOur approach is further enhanced by seamless collaboration across the organization, combined with our unique Jabil structure.\nAnd when done correctly, we simplify the complex for many of the world's most remarkable brands.\nAnd we do so as we lean into a massive market, where things need to be built and supply chains need to be optimized.\nOne of the key outcomes of our approach is the fact that with each passing year, our results become less dependent on any single product or product family, which improves our resiliency, especially during times of macro disruption and cyclical demand.\nI'll now take you through an update to our fiscal '22 financial plan where you'll see the continued earnings power of the company.\nWe've increased core earnings per share to $6.55 for the year, up $0.20 from our September outlook.\nWe've also increased revenue to $31.8 billion, up from our initial guide of $31.5 billion.\nIn addition, we're committed to delivering free cash flow in excess of $700 million, while maintaining a core margin of 4.5% for the year as we navigate this challenging environment.\nIn concert with these strong numbers, please note that our path forward is well understood throughout the company and what needs to be done remains crystal clear.\nQuite simply, what we're doing is working a positive testament on how our team is managing the business.\nMoving on from the financials, I'd like to talk about purpose.\nAt Jabil, purpose serves as our guidepost.\nWhen we think about purpose, we think about our behaviors, behaviors such as keeping our people safe, servant leadership, DE&I, protecting the environment, and giving back to the many communities where we live.\nPlease note that these behaviors, as displayed by our team, are exceptional.\nIn closing, our improvement is steady and our strategy is consistent.\nAnd as a team, we value our role as a responsible and reliable partner to those we serve.\nAll in all, I feel good about where we've been, but I feel even better about where we're going.\nIn simple terms, at Jabil, we build stuff, and we do so really, really well.\nWe also solve problems over and over again.\nI want each of you to always be your true self without fear or anxiety as you care for one another.\nTo everyone on the call today, I wish you a safe and peaceful holiday.\nBefore we begin our Q&A session, I'd like to remind everyone on our call that we cannot address customer or product-specific questions.\nOtherwise, we're now ready for your Q&A.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; and Matt Bilunas, our CFO.\nDuring the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.\nToday, we are reporting record Q3 financial results of $11.9 billion in sales and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.08, which is up 1% over last year and up 84% compared to two years ago.\nAgainst a still evolving backdrop, our leaders continue to drive new ways of operating, and our employees continue to do amazing things to support our customer's technology needs in knowledgeable, fast, and convenient ways.\nOur omnichannel capabilities and our ability to inspire and support across all of technology in a way no one else can means we are uniquely positioned to seize the opportunity in this environment and in the future.\nWe continue to capitalize on strong customer demand as more people sustainably work, entertain, cook, and connect at home.\nAnd Domestic comparable sales growth was up 2% on top of 23% last year.\nFrom a merchandising perspective, the biggest contributors to our comparable sales growth in the quarter were appliances, home theater, and mobile phones.\nProduct availability continued to improve throughout quarter.\nWe have pockets of constraints in areas like appliances, gaming, and mobile phones.\nSimilar to last quarter, however, we do not believe this materially limited our overall sales growth.\nWhile we have faced and continue to face supply chain challenges, including delays and higher costs, we are proactively navigating a situation that we have been dealing with for several quarters, as our industry has been facing disruptions and supply constraints since early in the pandemic.\nOur merchant demand planning and supply chain teams made strategic sourcing and inventory decisions early in the year to set us up well heading into holiday.\nAnd we are resourcefully adapting to the constantly evolving environment with actions like pulling up product flow, adjusting store assortment based on availability, and acquiring additional alternative transportation.\nWe have deep, long-standing relationships with our transportation and logistics vendors, and they have been incredibly supportive as we navigate.\nIn addition, through our close partnerships with our product vendors, we have a great deal of visibility into and can influence the status of product in the supply chain process.\nWe have varying degrees of inventory and supply chain challenges every holiday season, and this year will be no different.\nBut we entered Q4 with 15% more inventory year over year and feel confident in our ability to serve our customers throughout the holiday.\nAs expected, we did experience a more promotional environment for many of our products when compared to last year.\nWhen compared to two years ago, we still saw a less promotional environment during Q3.\nFrom a sales channel perspective, results were similar to last quarter.\nCustomers are returning to stores, and they are also choosing to interact with us digitally and via phone and chat at much higher rates than pre-pandemic.\nOnline sales were 31% of domestic revenue compared to 16% in Q3 of fiscal '20, growing by more than $2 billion during that time.\nOur app saw a 19% increase in unique visitors versus last year, and phone and chat sales continued to climb versus last year and two years ago.\nWe continue to be an industry leader in fast and convenient product fulfillment for our customers.\nDuring the third quarter, we reached our fastest small product delivery times ever.\nCompared to last year, same-day delivery was up 400%, and we nearly doubled the percent of products delivered within one day.\nBased on a third-party analysis of competitor websites, we are the leader in one-day-or-less published shipping time across a sample of higher-volume ZIP codes and higher-demand items.\nIn addition to partnering with a diversified set of delivery partners, we also thoughtfully used our employee delivery capability, as we now have more than 400 stores doing employee deliveries, with almost 60% of our customers living within 10 miles of an employee delivery location.\nWe also have an industry-leading in-store pickup experience.\nWe have, by far, the broadest assortment of CE products available for pickup, and the process is incredibly fast.\nIn Q3, more than 90% of online orders that were available for product pickup were ready in less than 30 minutes of the order being placed.\nCustomers clearly find value in coming to our stores to pick up their products as the percent of online sales picked up at our stores remained high at 42%, even with our fast home delivery options, with one-third of our store-pickup customers choosing our convenient curbside option.\nAnd our customer NPS for order pickup in Q3 was up versus last year and two years ago.\nIn fact, in the last year, 31% of all our purchasing customers bought online and picked up in store at least once.\nThese strong Q3 results and our market-leading omnichannel capabilities are due to our amazing associates across the company and the investment decisions we have made in the last several years in supply chain, store operations, our people, and technology.\nClearly, our business has changed dramatically in the last two years, with digital sales more than double pre-pandemic levels and phone, chat, and in-home sales growing.\nCustomers are starting their research and shopping online and then branching out from there to all forms of digital and physical shopping depending on their specific needs.\nStores are crucial to our customer experience, and they need to be even more efficient and must keep pace with greater customer expectations.\nFor example, we know customers sometimes seek out in-person help to answer questions.\nAnd other times, they would rather use digital tools to learn about products or pick up their orders in our stores.\nWe have made the right investment decisions to position us as a leader in omnichannel retailing.\nWhile we are proud of our progress, there are even more opportunities ahead of us.\nAnd it is more important than ever to build on our position of strength and truly become a customer-obsessed company.\nThis means we put the customer at the heart of all we do by anticipating their needs, listening, learning, and applying those insights to create long-term relationships and seamless experiences.\nThat led us to launch Best Buy Totaltech last month.\nTotaltech is a bold new membership program, leveraging our strengths across merchandising, fulfillment, installation, tech support, and product repair, unique capabilities that customer's value and no one else can match.\nOur membership program offers product discounts and periodic access to hard-to-get inventory, free delivery and installation, free technical support, free product protection, and many other benefits.\nLet me provide a tangible example of how the offer can come to life.\nA Totaltech member purchases a 65-inch TV and gets a $150 member discount.\nShe gets the TV delivered and mounted on the wall in her living room.\nThe next month, she buys a new iPhone for her daughter.\nAs long as she keeps up her membership, she gets two years of product protection on the TV she bought and two years of AppleCare+ protection for the phone.\nA few weeks later, she can't get her laptop to connect to her printer, so she hops on a dedicated chat line with Geek Squad who fixes the problem by remoting into her computer so she can get on with a productive day of working from home.\nAs a member, she received all those benefits for $199 per year.\nAs you can see, not only do members receive significant savings, they can also be confident that whatever their technology needs are, we will be there to help.\nThe goal is to create an experience that makes it inconceivable for members to purchase their tech from anyone else, driving a larger share of consumer electronic spend to Best Buy.\nWe successfully rolled out the program nationally and online and converted more than 3 million former tech support members.\nIt is very early as we just launched last month.\nBut so far, we continue to see behaviors that we intend to drive and that we saw in the pilot, including more frequent interaction and higher incremental spend than non-members.\nGiven the breadth of the offer, it is resonating well across all customer demographics, and our new members are skewing younger than our former Total Tech Support membership program.\nNPS numbers across all channels are higher than for non-members as well.\nAnd importantly, our employees believe in and love articulating the value of membership to our customers.\nAs we've discussed in previous calls, we are in the midst of multiple store pilots and tests.\nOf course, we are always piloting concepts.\nBut right now, we are very focused on piloting and testing to build a framework that will move us from a retailer that's focused foremost on its stores to a true omnichannel one that provides equal focus on all the ways customers shop with us.\nI will provide a few updates on our progress.\nWe launched phase 1 of our virtual store pilot last month.\nFor this, we built out a physical store in one of our distribution centers with merchandising and products that is staffed with dedicated associates, including vendor-provided expert labor.\nIt has no physical customers.\nInstead, customers interact with our experts via chat, audio, video, and screen sharing depending on their preference and are able to see live demos, displays, and physical products.\nIt is early, and we have not rolled out all the product categories yet.\nBut initial results are showing much higher conversion rates, as well as higher average order value than we see with historical chat interactions.\nIn Charlotte, we have made significant progress rolling out the market pilot designed to leverage all our assets in a portfolio strategy across stores, fulfillment, services, in outlet, lockers, our digital app, and both in-store and in-home consultation labor.\nWe launched our new outlet featuring all product categories in addition to a new services hub model and remodeled eight stores.\nAnd in Houston, we are continuing to see strong results from our experiential store pilot and plan to roll out aspects of this more broadly in stores across the country as we enter next year.\nThese are not the only pilots happening, and thus, they aren't the only pilots that will influence where we go as a company.\nFrom Northern California to Houston to The Bronx, we are assessing new formats and learning our way to the right physical model.\nAt the same time, we are piloting and evolving our labor models in other markets to meet our customer's changing shopping behaviors.\nThat means leveraging technology in stores that don't have as much labor and developing a much more flexible workforce.\nThis is a workforce that can not only provide expert help across product categories, both in-store and virtually, but also flex into other activities like curbside fulfillment, and it empowers employees to flexibly pick up shifts at other stores or at our distribution centers.\nI also want to highlight our unique ability to both inspire and support our customers through our consultation and our Geek Squad services.\nWe have almost 3,000 consultants and designers to provide free consultations across customers' homes, in-stores, and virtually.\nThese consultations represent one of our highest NPS experiences, consistently over 80.\nImportantly, they also lead to longer-term and stickier customer relationships as more than 85% of customers who use the program stated they intend to continue shopping with their consultants.\nTurning to the product support we provide, as many of you likely know, when something goes wrong with your products or delivery or installation, it is a highly unplanned and often emotional event.\nNot surprisingly, our customer research tells us that customers value quick response times and demand transparency, fast repair times, and quality repairs from a trusted provider.\nOur Geek Squad has an industry-leading set of capabilities that garner market-leading NPS and also drive additional revenue for Best Buy in the moment and over time.\nAround 20% of our phone and computer repair customers purchase additional products the day they receive the repair.\nAdditionally, our data shows that customers who have phone or computer repairs are far more likely to make a purchase in the following 12 months.\nOver time, we have also been evolving our partnerships with our vendors in response to changing customer shopping behavior.\nOur in-store vendor experiences are crucial to our customer experience and remain a significant source of competitive advantage.\nWe have extended many of these in-store experiences to digital experiences.\nOur vendors partner with us to provide expert training and tools for our consultants and designers.\nAnd importantly, our vendors are increasingly sending sales leads from their own websites to our consultants and designers.\nWe are also leveraging our unique Geek Squad capabilities to strengthen and expand our partnerships with our vendors.\nWe are already the nation's largest physical destination for Apple-authorized repair services, including same-day iPhone repairs, attracting new customers as one-third of these Apple repair customers are new or reengaged customers for Best Buy.\nIn October, we launched Samsung-authorized phone repair service nationally.\nRoughly 30% of our stores will offer same-day, in-store repairs completed by Samsung-certified Geek Squad agents using Samsung parts, diagnostics, and tools.\nPhone repair is a universal need for customers, and this expansion gives Best Buy the capability to repair the overwhelming majority of phones in the marketplace.\nIn addition, we are also starting to leverage our industry-leading and convenient buy-online-pick-up-in-store experience in partnerships with our vendors.\nCustomers purchasing select items on samsung.com now have the option to pick up their products at their local Best Buy store.\nAnd shoppers purchasing Insignia, Toshiba, and Pioneer Fire TVs on amazon.com can pick up their TVs at their local Best Buy stores.\nFor many of our vendors, we use our considerable supply chain expertise to transport their product often from the country of origin to our distribution centers.\nIn addition to helping our vendors, it allows us to increase our level of visibility into incoming inventory and to garner greater scale.\nAnd finally, we have been investing in our long-standing advertising business, building new capabilities to help vendors effectively reach our customers.\nBest Buy's relevance, customer relationship, and first-party data have grown along with customer's technology needs and our ability to meet those needs.\nThese are all great examples of value we can provide to our vendor partners that many other retailers cannot.\nIn addition to focusing our performance on our core CE and appliance categories, we are continuing to expand our assortment in newer categories where we can leverage our ability to commercialize new technology.\nFor example, we created a robust online experience and assortment for electric transportation.\nAnd during Q3, our sales in the category more than doubled.\nAs a result, we are expanding our online assortment of electric bikes by four times and also plan to assort them in physical stores early next year.\nAnd because customers are looking to us to complete their solutions, we have been expanding our assortment in categories, like outdoor living, as more and more consumers look to make over or upgrade their outdoor living spaces.\nThis includes products like patio furniture, grills, fire pits, and electric mowers, just to name a few.\nIn fact, earlier this month, we acquired Yardbird, a leading direct-to-consumer company that specializes in premium sustainable outdoor furniture, including dining sets, lounge seating, fire tables, and accessories.\nWe are excited about the opportunity to use our expertise in merchandising and supply chain to scale this business, both online and in physical locations across the nation.\nWe also made an exciting acquisition recently in the health space.\nLet me take a second to reiterate our overall health strategy and how the acquisition fits.\nOur Best Buy Health strategy focuses on three areas that start with our strength in retail and build to connecting patients to physicians.\nThe first focus area is the consumer health category for customers who want to be healthier, sleep better, or need to monitor a chronic condition, like diabetes or heart disease, for example.\nYou can see this built out in a robust way on our website.\nThe second area is active aging, which includes device-based emergency response and other services for Generation A, who wish to live independently in their homes.\nThis opportunity shows up prominently in our physical stores.\nThe third focus area is virtual care.\nBest Buy's role in virtual care is to enable people in their homes to connect seamlessly with their healthcare providers.\nThe trend to this type of care is increasing, accelerated in large measure by the pandemic.\nTo more fully meet that growing customer demand and accelerate our work with new and innovative services, we acquired a company called Current Health.\nCurrent Health developed a market-leading remote patient monitoring platform that allows physicians to monitor and connect with patients in their home.\nTheir platform includes an FDA-cleared wearable medical device that monitors vital signs, a home hub which integrates to hundreds of other monitoring devices, and integration to the patient's electronic health record.\nWith their remote monitoring platform, combined with the scale, expertise, and connection to the home that Best Buy has, we will be able to create a holistic care ecosystem that shows up for customers across all their healthcare needs.\nTo be clear, even though the healthcare industry is evolving quickly, in many ways as a result of the pandemic impacts, it adopts new ways of doing things at a much slower pace than other industries like retail.\nVirtual care is a truly nascent space with significant opportunity, but it will take time and investment to develop our offerings and scale.\nAs you can see, technology developments are driving our initiatives across the company.\nWe need technology tools and capabilities to help us as we transform and evolve the way we operate and serve our customers.\nThat is why we continue to devote significant resources to technology investments.\nFor example, we are leveraging our investments in electronic sign labels to very nimbly highlight Best Buy Totaltech member pricing for customers shopping in our stores.\nWe also just launched the ability for our electronic sign labels to provide important messaging regarding product availability, so that customers will easily be able to see if the product is in stock in that store or at another store nearby, or when it could be delivered and installed.\nTechnology was instrumental in recently launching the first of many new communication enhancements to improve our award-winning appliance customer experience.\nMetro delivery customers that utilize the appointment tracker page on the day of their delivery can now see how many stops away their driver is at any given time.\nIt may seem like a small enhancement but already we can see significant customer engagement with the page, another step toward our goal to make customers feel confident and in control throughout the research, purchase, fulfillment, and use of their large product.\nTechnology was also crucial in our recent launching of next-day delivery of appliances and large TVs, which we are piloting first for in-store and online customers in our Minneapolis and Baltimore markets.\nNext month, we are launching a new capability, leveraging QR codes for high-velocity products that are locked up, particularly in areas of high shrink.\nInstead of waiting for an associate to unlock the product, the customer can scan the QR code and then proceed to check out to pay and pick up the product.\nAnd we recently implemented enhancements to our digital platform, improving flexibility across our workforce by seamlessly giving employees the ability to pick up open shifts at nearby locations in addition to their home location.\nThese examples are a small token of the work our digital and technology teams are doing to improve the customer and employee experience.\nAnd of course, we are also continuing to make significant investments in fundamental technology capabilities, like data and analytics, and broader cloud migration in order to drive scale, efficiency, and effectiveness.\nI would like to take a moment to extend my gratitude to our people.\nOver the past 21 months, they have flexibly dealt with rapidly changing store operations as we responded to impacts of the pandemic.\nThey created safe environments for customers and worked tirelessly to provide excellent service, even in situations where customers resisted following safety guidelines and in some cases were disrespectful.\nIn addition, we have increased the level of pilots and tests in the field as we evolve our operating model.\nThis has introduced a great deal of change.\nI am truly grateful for and impressed by our associates' dedication, resourcefulness, and flat-out determination.\nAnd I'm thrilled to say that our in-store NPS in Q3 increased versus last year and versus two years ago before the pandemic despite all of these disruptions.\nNow, I would like to briefly touch on our ESG efforts and how we are working across the company to have a positive impact on our planet.\nEarlier this month, we announced that we are a founding member of the Race to Zero initiative that aims to accelerate climate action within the retail industry.\nBest Buy's participation builds on our existing efforts to reduce our carbon footprint.\nWe are proud of our progress in reducing emissions 61% since 2009, and we have pledged to be carbon neutral by 2040.\nWe have also taken on a more specific focus on the circular economy within our operations and with our customers.\nIn Q3, we collected and responsibly recycled more than 48 million pounds of consumer electronics, keeping products and commodities out of landfills.\nTo help our customers live more sustainably, last quarter, we sold more than 5 million ENERGY STAR-certified products, helping our customers reduce their carbon footprint and save on utility bills.\nWe also kept more than 600,000 devices in use longer and out of landfills by leveraging our customer trade-in program, Geek Squad repair services, and Best Buy outlets.\nThese are initiatives our customers and vendors value and capabilities no one else has at our scale and breadth.\nIn summary, we have delivered remarkable year-to-date results, and I am so proud of the execution of all our teams.\nWe are looking forward to a strong holiday season and believe we are extremely well-positioned with both the tech customer's wants and fast and convenient ways to get it.\nWe launched some of our Black Friday deals in mid-October that included a price guarantee for all customers, and this past Friday started Black Friday early by making almost all of our Black Friday deals available.\nThroughout the holiday season, we are promising free next-day delivery on thousands of items.\nAnd of course, store pickup, whether in-store or curbside, will be a great and convenient option for our customers to get their products.\nBuilding on that, as we think about next year and beyond, we are mindful of just how much the consumer has changed and how enduring that change will be.\nTerms like home nesting and virtual care have been invented to describe what all of us know so well, that where we work, entertain, receive healthcare, and connect has changed, and our homes are now central to our lives more than ever before.\nThe penetration of technology associated with this way of living has been and continues to be sizable.\nAnd we are already seeing shorter upgrade cycles as technology evolves, and we constantly optimize our homes.\nThe demand for convenience and experience on the customers' terms has exponentially driven change.\nOur hypothesis has consistently been that true omnichannel retailing would create differentiated experiences that allow us to seamlessly and conveniently engage and retain customers.\nAs such, we have continuously invested in these experiences and notably, we never defined omnichannel as being stores and online.\nInstead, we included our unique and powerful service, virtual, and in-home capabilities.\nWe are certain that technology will continue to play a more dominant role in consumers' lives.\nGiven our omnichannel capabilities, the ones we have today and the ones we are building for the future, we are fully confident that we will capitalize on a much larger, more broadly defined consumer electronics category, and be able to better serve a customer who will be using and upgrading much of that CE more frequently.\nWe plan to hold an investor event next March to share more detail on our initiatives, provide our thoughts on our financial model going forward, and introduce longer-term financial targets.\nWe are once again reporting strong financial results that continue to support our belief that technology plays an even more important role in everyone's lives, and we are uniquely positioned to serve them.\nDespite lapping the extraordinary 23% comparable sales growth from last year, we were once again able to generate positive comparable sales growth in each fiscal month of the third quarter.\nCompared to our guidance, enterprise revenue of $11.9 billion exceeded the high end of our revenue outlook of $11.6 billion, driven by the better-than-expected comparable sales growth of 1.6%.\nOur non-GAAP gross profit rate and SG&A expense were essentially in line with our expectations.\nCompared to last year, enterprise revenue grew $57 million, and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.08 increased $0.02, a lower share count resulted in a $0.12 per share benefit on a year-over-year basis.\nOur non-GAAP operating income rate of 5.8% decreased 30 basis points as we invested in the launch of our new Totaltech membership.\nWhen comparing our results against two years ago for the third quarter of our fiscal '20, total revenue grew more than 20%.\nAdditionally, our domestic store channel revenue was approximately flat versus two years ago, while online revenue grew almost 150% in that time frame.\nAs a result of the higher revenue and our ability to adjust to a new customer shopping behavior, our enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate was 160 basis points higher this quarter than the comparable quarter from two years ago.\nLet me now share more details specific to our third quarter.\nIn our domestic segment, revenue increased 1.2% to almost $11 billion.\nThis increase was driven by a comparable sales increase of 2%, which was partially offset by the loss of revenue from store closures in the past year.\nAs Corie shared, the biggest contributors to the comp sales growth in the quarter were appliances, home theater, and mobile phones.\nAfter delivering significant growth for the past several quarters and lapping a 46% comp in the third quarter of last year, computing comparable sales were down slightly on a year-over-year basis but still up nearly $1 billion from two years ago.\nIn addition, our services comparable sales declined 5.6% this quarter.\nThis was primarily the result of our new Totaltech membership, which includes benefits that were previously stand-alone revenue generating services, such as warranty and installation.\nIn our International segment, revenue decreased 7.8% to $925 million.\nThis decrease was driven by the loss of approximately $90 million in revenue from exiting Mexico and a comparable sales decline of 3% in Canada.\nPartially offsetting these items was the benefit of approximately 450 basis points from foreign currency.\nTurning now to gross profit.\nThe domestic gross profit rate decreased 60 basis points to 23.4%.\nAs expected, the decrease was due to, one, lower profit margin rates, which were primarily driven by lapping lower levels of promotions, product damages, and returns compared to last year as well as higher inventory shrink; and two, lower services margin rates, which included rate pressure from Totaltech.\nThe previous items were partially offset by higher profit sharing revenue from the company's private label and co-branded credit card arrangement.\nThe gross profit rate pressure from our new membership offering primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and associated costs compared to our previous Total Tech Support offer.\nAs Corie mentioned, like many others, we saw increased transportation costs within our supply chain.\nHowever, this pressure was offset by reduced parcel expense since our mix of online sales was lower than last year.\nThe international non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 240 basis points to 25%.\nThe higher gross profit rate was driven by improved product margin rates in Canada and a loss of lower margin sales from the Mexico exit.\nMoving next to SG&A.\nDomestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $9 million and improved 20 basis points versus last year as a percentage of revenue.\nAs expected, higher advertising expense and increased technology investments were partially offset by last year's $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation and lower incentive compensation.\nWhen comparing to two years ago, domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $155 million and decreased 230 basis points as a percentage of revenue.\nThe largest drivers of the increase versus fiscal '20 were higher incentive compensation, increased technology and advertising investments, and additional variable costs due to the higher sales volume.\nPartially offsetting these items was lower store payroll expense.\nMoving to the balance sheet.\nWe ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in cash.\nAt the end of Q3, our inventory balance was 15% higher than last year's comparable period and was 13% higher than our Q3 ending inventory balance from two years ago.\nThe increased inventory represents our plans to support the current demand for technology, as well as last year's unusually low inventory balance.\nEarlier this month, we completed our acquisitions of Current Health and Yardbird, which will be reflected on our cash flow statement in Q4.\nThe combined purchase price of the two transactions was approximately $485 million, and they were funded with cash.\nThe Current Health acquisition was a larger cash outlay at approximately $400 million and is expected to have a slightly negative impact on our Q4 non-GAAP operating income.\nWe are not expecting either acquisition to have a material impact on our revenue performance this year.\nDuring the quarter, we returned a total of $577 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $405 million and dividends of $172 million.\nWith a year-to-date share buyback spend of $1.7 billion, we still expect to spend more than $2.5 billion in share repurchases this year.\nLet me next share more color on our guidance for the fourth quarter, which remains very similar to the implied guidance we provided last quarter.\nWe expect comparable sales growth to be in the range of down 2% to up 1% to last year, which is on top of our 12.6% comparable sales growth in the fourth quarter of last year.\nLike other companies, we continue to monitor the evolving impacts of the pandemic and supply chain pressures driven by global demand.\nWe are confident in our ability to navigate the ever-changing environment.\nFrom a profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-GAAP rate that is approximately 30 basis points below last year's rate due to the estimated impact of our new Totaltech offer, which we expect to be partially offset by a more favorable product mix.\nFrom a non-GAAP SG&A standpoint, we are planning dollars to increase approximately 8% compared to last year.\nThe largest drivers of SG&A increase are expected to be technology investments, increased advertising, health investments, and higher compensation, in addition, incentive compensation.\nIn addition, we are planning on increased spend compared to our previous outlook for store labor and call center support this holiday season to better support the customer experience.\nTurning to our full year outlook.\nWe expect the following: enterprise revenue in the range of $51.8 billion to $52.3 billion compared to our previous guide of $51 billion to $52 billion, comparable sales growth of 10.5% to 11.5% compared to our previous guide of 9% to 11%, and a non-GAAP gross profit rate slightly higher than last year.\nFor SG&A, we expect growth of approximately 9.5%, which compares to our prior outlook of 9%.\nWe expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 20%, and we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Our second quarter results reflect another step forward in our strategy execution as we continue to reshape and position the company for sustainable and profitable growth.\nConsolidated revenues improved 1% sequentially to $142 million with a 28% increase in international Fluids Systems and a 15% improvement in Industrial Solutions rental and service revenues, offsetting the previously anticipated pullback in Industrial Solution product sales that we discussed on our prior quarter call.\nSecond quarter EBITDA generation was $7 million.\nTurning to the specifics of the segments.\nOur Industrial Solutions business continues to demonstrate the value of our diversification efforts as we expand our presence in the power transmission and other industrial end markets.\nAs anticipated, coming off the exceptionally strong first quarter product sales, segment revenues declined 15% sequentially to $45 million in the second quarter as site access product sales pulled back to $10 million for the quarter.\nPartially offsetting the product sales reduction, rental and service revenues improved 15% sequentially, contributing $33 million of revenue in the second quarter, including a record $25 million contribution from the power transmission and other industrial end markets, reflecting strong performance both in the United States and in the United Kingdom.\nIndustrial Blending revenues also pulled back to $2 million in the second quarter, reflecting the anticipated impact of product transition with our primary customer.\nWith the lower revenue, our Industrial Solutions operating margins declined modestly to 22% in the second quarter, generating $15 million of EBITDA.\nReflecting on our first half 2021 performance, it's worth highlighting that the power transmission and other industrial end markets contributed $75 million of our Site and Access Solutions revenues.\nThis annualized run rate of $150 million represents a 30% improvement over the previous high of $115 million achieved in 2018, illustrating the continued momentum in our market penetration.\nMeanwhile, our historical upstream oil and gas end market contributed less than 20% of the first half 2021 segment revenues, reflecting the lower industry activity and our focus on the more stable industrial end markets.\nIn the Fluids Systems segment, revenues improved 11% sequentially, benefiting from project start-ups and the early phases of recovery within certain international markets following the COVID-related disruptions that significantly impacted the previous four quarters.\nOur international revenues improved 28% sequentially to $35 million in the second quarter, benefiting primarily from improvements in Europe and North Africa.\nIn North America, revenues improved modestly to $62 million with a 19% improvement in the U.S., largely offset by the seasonal pullback in Canada.\nDespite the revenue growth and positive earnings contributions from our international businesses, the Fluids segment remained below EBITDA breakeven in the second quarter, impacted by elevated operating expenses, including employee severance and cost associated with our ongoing inventory rationalization efforts.\nIn addition, the quarter is impacted by an unfavorable sales mix on U.S. land, which we expect to normalize going forward.\nDuring the second quarter, I'm very pleased to highlight that we won two notable fluids contracts, including a three year award in Thailand to provide drilling and completion fluids on land, which reflects our first entry into the Southeast Asian market.\nThis contract is expected to provide approximately $25 million of revenue over the three year term with work scheduled to begin in the third quarter.\nIn addition, as part of the latest Shale Oil tender in the Gulf of Mexico, we were awarded a contract to continue providing drilling fluids, reservoir drilling fluids and related services for two deepwater drillships, which we expect will generate approximately $30 million of revenue annually.\nWe believe the recent contract awards are a direct result of our continued focus on providing differentiated technology and superior customer service.\nAs global activity improves in the energy market, we feel we are well positioned to capture our fair share of the value chain, while also continuing to reshape our cost structure to generate profitable growth and provide an acceptable return on capital.\nAnd with that, I will hand the call over to Gregg to discuss in more detail the financials for the second quarter.\nI'll begin by covering the specifics of the segment and consolidated financial results for the quarter before providing an update on our near-term outlook.\nTotal revenues for the Industrial Solutions segment declined 15% sequentially to $45 million in the second quarter, which includes a $43 million contribution from the Site and Access Solutions business and $2 million from Industrial Blending.\nThe sequential decline primarily reflects the anticipated $10 million reduction in product sales following the exceptionally strong Q1 performance along with a $3 million decline in Industrial Blending product sales.\nRental and service revenues improved 15% on a sequential basis, coming in at $33 million for the second quarter, which reflects our strongest quarter in nearly two years.\nThe sequential growth was driven by robust demand in both the U.S. and the United Kingdom with the U.S. benefiting from a few large scale utility projects completed in the second quarter.\nAs a result of the $8 million decline in revenues, the Industrial Solutions segment operating income declined by $3 million sequentially to $10 million, contributing $15 million of EBITDA in the second quarter.\nComparing to the second quarter of last year, revenues from the Site and Access Solutions business increased $16 million or 59%.\nThis increase includes an $11 million or 50% improvement in rental and service revenues along with a $5 million improvement in product sales.\nLooking at the first half 2021 for the Industrial Solutions business, as Paul touched on, it's notable that we're continuing to see a significant shift within our segment revenue mix.\nMore specifically, the power transmission end market contributes more than half of our Industrial Solutions segment revenues, while our historical E&P market activity accounts for less than 20%.\nTurning to Fluids Systems.\nTotal segment revenues improved by 11% sequentially to $97 million in the second quarter.\nRevenues from U.S. land increased $10 million or 24% sequentially, reflecting the benefit of the 16% improvement in market rig count along with an increase in market share, which stands at roughly 20%.\nAll U.S. land regions contributed to the sequential revenue improvement.\nRevenues from the Gulf of Mexico declined modestly, contributing $8 million in the second quarter.\nIn Canada, revenues followed the typical seasonal pattern through spring breakup, declining 61% sequentially to $5 million in the second quarter.\nOutside of North America, as Paul noted, we are beginning to see the early signs of recovery, particularly in Europe and North Africa.\nInternational revenues improved $8 million sequentially to $35 million in the second quarter as delayed projects moved forward, although it's worth noting that COVID-related restrictions continue to suppress customer activity, particularly in the Middle East.\nAs Paul touched on, while our international Fluids business performance was relatively in line with our expectations, our U.S. operations were negatively impacted by elevated expenses in the quarter along with an unfavorable sales mix.\nOn a year-over-year basis, our Fluids Systems revenues increased $22 million or 30%.\nU.S. land revenues increased by $21 million or 74%, which significantly outpaced the 16% increase in market rig count over this period.\nThe strong revenue growth primarily reflects our increased market share and improvements in customer spending per well along with higher barite sales and our continued expansion into stimulation chemicals.\nGulf of Mexico revenues declined $6 million or 44% year-over-year, driven primarily by the changes in customer drilling and completion plans, including a strong contribution from completion fluids in the prior year quarter.\nInternational revenues improved $6 million or 22% year-over-year, benefiting from new project start-ups and the recovery of customer activity in several European markets and Algeria, while the Middle East remains roughly $2 million below prior year levels, reflecting the ongoing COVID challenges.\nSG&A costs were $23 million in the second quarter, which includes $6.9 million of corporate office expenses, reflecting a $2 million increase from both the prior quarter as well as the second quarter of last year.\nThe sequential and year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to higher long-term incentive expense, including awards tied to our relative share price performance as well as the April 1 restoration of certain austerity measures, including the company matching contributions to our U.S. retirement plan.\nInterest expense decreased modestly to $2.2 million in the second quarter, nearly half of which reflects non-cash amortization of facility fees and discounts.\nOur weighted average cash borrowing rate on our outstanding debt is approximately 3.5%.\nThe second quarter includes a $400,000 income tax expense despite reporting a pre-tax loss.\nWe are currently unable to recognize the tax benefits on our U.S. losses, and therefore, the income tax expense primarily reflects taxes on foreign earnings.\nOur net loss in the second quarter was $0.07 per share, which compares to a net loss of $0.06 per share in the first quarter and a net loss of $0.29 per share in the second quarter of last year, which included $0.09 of charges.\nTurning to cash flow.\nNet working capital changes used $7 million of cash in the second quarter as we saw DSOs return as anticipated to a more typical level from the unusually strong performance achieved in the prior quarter.\nWith the higher working capital, cash used in operating activities was a modest $2 million for the quarter.\nInvesting activities again used less than $1 million of cash in the second quarter with $2 million of capital investments largely offset by proceeds from sales of used mats from our rental fleet and other underutilized assets.\nWe ended the second quarter with a total debt balance of $78 million and a cash balance of $35 million, resulting in a modest 14% debt to capital ratio and 8% net debt to capital ratio.\nAs such, the convertible notes are now classified as long-term debt in the June 30, 2021 balance sheet.\nNow turning to our near-term outlook.\nAs we look ahead, we are encouraged by the improving longer term fundamentals in both business segments, but we continue to see significant inflationary pressures on raw materials and transportation.\nWe are also closely monitoring the evolving situation with the COVID variants around the world.\nIn the Site and Access Solutions business, while we are very pleased with the strong growth rate in targeted end markets, we expect the near-term market activity in the utility sector will face the typical seasonal slowdown seen in past years as utility companies reduce project activity during the period of high electricity demand associated with the elevated summer temperatures.\nAlthough we are continuing to execute our geographic expansion efforts, we anticipate that Q3 rental and service revenues will return to near Q1 levels.\nLooking beyond Q3, we continue to be encouraged by the robust pipeline of opportunities as we execute our growth strategy.\nOn the product sales side, although it is always difficult to predict the timing of sales activity, we expect revenues will remain relatively in line with Q2 in the near-term, with the fourth quarter expected to benefit from the year end strength in the utility sector.\nIn total, we expect Q3 revenues for the Industrial Solutions segment will pull back modestly to roughly $40 million.\nAnd with the seasonal slowdown in rental project activity as well as our ongoing investments to support our growth strategy, we expect operating margins to decline into the low to mid-teens for the third quarter, which should reflect the softest quarterly results for the year.\nBeyond Q3, we expect both revenues and operating margin will rebound in Q4, benefiting from the year end product sales demand and our ongoing penetration in the power transmission and other industrial markets.\nIn Fluids Systems, we continue to expect our international markets will recover through the second half of 2021, ultimately returning to pre-COVID levels by the end of the year.\nWith the lingering effects of COVID, particularly in the Middle East, we expect international revenues will increase by roughly 10% in Q3 with a more pronounced improvement in Q4.\nIn addition, we expect to see strong quarter-over-quarter growth in North America in Q3, led by our robust recovery in Canada from the seasonal trough and the continued improvements in U.S. land.\nIn the Gulf of Mexico, we expect Q3 revenues will remain fairly in line with the second quarter as a Q3 start-up on the second deepwater drillship will likely offset the decline in completion fluids products which are excluded from the recent contract award.\nIn total, we anticipate our Fluids segment revenues will grow by a low-teens percentage in Q3, which should bring the segment closer to breakeven operating income for the quarter with a return to positive income expected in Q4.\nWith regard to capex, we expect expenditures in the near-term will remain fairly limited with investments focused on growth opportunities within the Industrial Solutions segment.\nCorporate office expense is expected to increase by roughly $1 million from the Q2 level, largely reflecting the timing of long-term performance-based incentive expense along with the full lifting of salary austerity measures put in place during 2020.\nOverall, I'm pleased with the continuing progress we've made in the second quarter.\nLooking ahead, there are obvious ongoing market hurdles to navigate, including meaningful cost inflation as well as the elevated uncertainty regarding the impact of the COVID variants around the world.\nWith that said, we remain encouraged by the longer term market fundamentals in all of the key industries that we serve, which we believe provides the opportunity for sustainable and profitable growth over the long-term.\nFurther, with our very modest debt level and our capital-light Fluids business model, we are well positioned to fund growth objectives and generate strong free cash flow over the long-term.\nOur key priorities remain unchanged, beginning with our expansion and diversification of the Industrial Solutions business.\nAs we continue to execute on our strategy, we're very pleased with the growing market awareness of the unique value proposition that we provide within the multi-billion dollar power transmission market.\nBenefiting from our strong utility sector growth, our Industrial Solutions segment contributed 35% of our first half revenues, while consistently generating strong profitability and returns.\nExpanding this business remains our highest priority, including expansion of our geographical reach and invest in the necessary capital to support our targeted growth plans.\nOn the Industrial Blending operations, although we are disappointed by the shift in outlook that our primary customer is seeing in the demand for disinfectants and cleaning products, it's important to highlight that we view this reduction in near-term demand as a typical challenge for a new business.\nOver the past year, the surge in cleaning product demand associated with the fight against COVID, provided us an opportunity to quickly penetrate the Industrial Blending market and showcase our agility and capabilities.\nDuring a period of extreme urgency, our ability to move quickly, execute every facet of the manufacturing process and deliver quality and consistent products was met with extremely high praise from our customers.\nOur near-term priority for this business remains unchanged to capitalize upon our proven capabilities to build a diversified industrial and specialty chemical blending business.\nIn Fluids Systems, we are proud of the efforts of our global team in reshaping the business, while maintaining the highest quality of service for our customers.\nInternationally, with the worst of COVID hopefully behind us, we feel we are well positioned to benefit from what many expect to be a robust multi-year growth cycle.\nIt's important to note that prior to COVID, our international operations maintained a long history of stable and profitable performance.\nAnd despite the challenges of the past 18 months, we've continued to build upon our global relationships, expanding in key markets where we expect to play a meaningful role going forward.\nWe've also added to our extensive resume and geothermal drilling, a small but growing area that we believe will see a tailwind in the energy transition.\nWe expect our international Fluids growth will outpace North American market in the years to come, driven primarily by our extensive geographical footprint in the EMEA region and our expanding presence in Asia Pacific.\nIn the U.S. Fluids business, while the market outlook continues to strengthen, we are taking further actions to scale the business for what we expect to remain a structurally smaller market in the future.\nIn addition, with the U.S. oil and gas industry now benefiting from stronger commodity prices, our near-term focus also includes driving the much-needed price increases.\nWe expect both of our cost and pricing actions on U.S. land will continue through the second half of the year as we strive to generate consistent cash flow and acceptable return on invested capital.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:New factors emerge from time to time and it's simply not possible to predict all such factors.\nOn our call today, Allan will review highlights from the third quarter, our response to the pandemic and the strength of the new home market, and then recap our strategic objectives for the coming quarters.\nBob will cover our third quarter results in greater detail as well as our expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year.\nI will then come back to provide an update on our land spending and balance sheet, followed by a wrap up by Allan.\nWe generated very strong financial results in the third quarter with increases in both home closings and gross margins leading to nearly 40% growth in adjusted EBITDA.\nWe also reported our highest third quarter net income in over 10 years.\nFrom a sales perspective, after weathering a very difficult environment in April, we experienced improved demand in May, which accelerated in June, leading to the best June sales pace we have generated in a decade.\nTogether, these results have positioned us for a strong finish to our fiscal year.\nLast quarter, we outlined our initial response to the pandemic, highlighted by the priority we place on the health and safety of our employees, customers and trade partners.\nThis continues to be our highest priority, with ongoing implications for every aspect of our business.\nIn addition to our safety protocols, over the course of the third quarter, we reviewed and revised numerous operational and financial practices.\nThere were three primary outcomes from these adjustments.\nFirst, we preserve liquidity by maintaining a full draw on our revolver until the end of the quarter.\nWhile this increased interest expense in the quarter, it ensured that we had substantial cash to deal with any potential disruption and closings.\nWith strong sales and greater clarity around the operational environment, we fully repaid the revolver and do not currently intend to have it drawn other than for seasonal liquidity needs.\nSecond, we paused land spending to apply new COVID-related risk criteria to our underwriting.\nTemporarily slowing land spending contributed to an increase in liquidity during the quarter.\nBut more importantly, it allowed us to review every proposed transaction against new risks to employment, household income and supply.\nWhile our review resulted in us exiting a handful of positions, in the vast majority of cases, we were able to validate and renegotiate pending transactions.\nGoing forward, we are confident we have a lot pipeline that supports our growth ambitions.\nAnd third, we improved the cost structure of the business.\nAs we adapted to a new working environment, we realized there were opportunities for us to improve our cost structure without reducing our ability to sell and build a growing number of homes in the quarters ahead.\nThat was important to us because we saw the demand was rebounding quite quickly.\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the new home market was very strong supported by wage growth, low unemployment, low mortgage rates, low housing supply and high consumer confidence.\nIn late March, that momentum gave way to the pandemic.\nAnd in April, industrywide demand plummeted.\nBut as you've heard and read, housing demand began recovering very quickly, and by June, was arguably better than prior to the pandemic.\nFor you and for us, that raises two crucial questions.\nWhere did this surge in demand come from?\nAnd is this sustainable?\nOnly time will reveal the answers.\nBut here is what we think is driving it and why it may last.\nFirst, low mortgage rates have gotten even lower.\nThis is a real plus for buyers as it improves affordability, increasing access to new homes for all buyer segments, especially first-time buyers.\nSecond, working from home and schooling from home have led to a massive reappraisal of shelter needs.\nOur buyers are telling us that new homes offer crucial advantages over most apartments and used homes, including more space, more flexible floor plans and better outdoor living features, plus they're move-in ready and don't require costly cleaning or time-consuming improvements.\nThird, the shift to remote work appears to be durable.\nDespite some challenges posed by remote work, both employees and employers have experienced an enormous boost to productivity arising from the elimination of commutes.\nKnowledge workers in particular are capable of working from completely different places, which can only benefit demand for new homes.\nAnd fourth, this may be the tipping point demographers have predicted for a decade, reflecting the moment that ownership-reluctant millennials embrace the inevitability and desirability of homeownership.\nThis is our most speculative observation, but millennials represent about a quarter of the US population, so their housing preferences have to be watched very closely.\nDespite the many challenges presented by the pandemic, we see no reason to deviate from our longer-term balanced growth strategy, which targets a double-digit return on assets by growing EBITDA faster than revenue from a more efficient and less leveraged balance sheet.\nAs we monetize our longer-term assets and increase the share of lots controlled by option, we will generate plenty of liquidity to both grow the business and remain on course to reduce our long-term debt below $1 billion.\nFinally, I want to express our corporate support for the elimination of prejudice, discrimination and injustice in our country.\nWe have shared on social media a letter I wrote to our employees expressing both my personal views and our corporate commitment to addressing these issues in our company and our communities.\nI am extraordinarily pleased with the enthusiasm our team has shown to learn about and honestly discuss these issues.\nWe are taking steps that will allow us to share the benefits of greater inclusion and diversity with our employees, customers, trade partners and shareholders.\nI know our efforts can make a difference.\nAs Allan highlighted earlier, adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was up nearly 40% versus the prior year to $54 million.\nThis performance was driven by strong results across our core metrics.\nSpecifically, compared to last year, we grew homebuilding revenue by 10% to $532.5 million as we benefited from an 8% increase in closings combined with a 3% increase in our ASP.\nOur gross margin, excluding amortized interest, impairments and abandonments, was up approximately 180 basis points to 21.2%, driven by increased margins on spec homes and our ongoing efforts to simplify product and reduce incentives.\nThis margin excludes impairments and abandonments associated with our reunderwriting process totaling $2.3 million.\nSG&A as a percentage of total revenue was 11.7%, down 50 basis points, even with $1.4 million in one-time charges associated with improving our ongoing cost structure.\nTotal GAAP interest expense was up around $2.1 million, primarily due to our decision to carry a fully drawn revolver through nearly the entire quarter for liquidity purposes.\nEven with that, however, our cash interest expense was down $3.7 million as a result of our prior debt retirements and refinancing activities.\nOur tax expense in the quarter was about $5 million for an average tax rate of 24%.\nTaken together, we owned $15.3 million of net income from continuing operations or $0.51 in earnings per share this quarter, up $3.6 million versus the prior year.\nAs clarity into market conditions has improved, we are comfortable offering the following guidance into our expectations for the full year and the fourth quarter.\nFor the full year of fiscal 2020, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be up 5% to 10% compared to last year with a big improvement in gross margin more than offsetting the impact of fewer home closings.\nThis would represent the second highest level of EBITDA we've produced in a decade.\nFor the fourth quarter, the pandemic has impacted a variety of our operational metrics, particularly timing.\nFor example, our beginning backlog is essentially flat to the level we had last year, but the stage of completion is very different.\nThe COVID outbreak impacted the timing of both orders and spec starts during the quarter such that a larger than usual share of this backlog will deliver in the first quarter of fiscal '21 rather than the fourth quarter of this year.\nAccordingly, we expect our backlog conversion ratio will be in the low-70% range rather than the high-80%s like last year.\nOur margin expectations reflect the strength in demand that occurred during the third quarter and our cost improvement efforts.\nSpecifically, we expect gross margins will be up at least 100 basis points to around 21% and SG&A will be down more than 5% on an absolute dollar basis.\nFinally, with our reunderwriting complete, a cash component of land spend will accelerate, likely exceeding $100 million.\nAt the beginning of the third quarter, we owned or controlled more than a three-year supply of land based on our trailing 12-month closings.\nThis position allowed us to pause land spending, assess the demand environment and reunderwrite land deals that were in process.\nThis process resulted in modest land acquisition and development spending during the quarter totaling just under $56 million.\nWith our reunderwriting process complete and demand improvements evident, we have resumed our regular land acquisition and development activity and expect to return to more normalized spending levels in our fiscal fourth quarter and into fiscal 2021.\nOf course, we'll take a disciplined approach given the ongoing spread of the coronavirus and the long-term impacts the pandemic may have on the economy.\nStrategically, we expect to sustain a lot position representing at least three years' supply with a growing share controlled by options, allowing us to better leverage our spend, improve return on assets and reduce risk.\nWe ended the third quarter with over $400 million of liquidity, more than double this point last year.\nThis reflected more than $150 million of unrestricted cash and no outstandings on our revolver.\nWith a durable business model that mixes to be built and spec homes and a growing land positions supported by larger share of options, we expect to generate sufficient liquidity to both reduce borrowings and grow our business in the years ahead.\nWe have no significant maturities until 2025 and our clearly defined deleveraging path includes $50 million term loan repayments in each of the next three years.\nAfter our upcoming September repayment, we will have just over $100 million remaining on our goal of bringing our total debt below $1 billion.\nThe third quarter of fiscal 2020 was very successful.\nWe increased closings and improved margins, driving both revenue and profitability growth.\nWe also took steps to improve our business and ongoing cost structure.\nThese results, coupled with the tremendous sales momentum that we experienced in the back half of the quarter, position us to realize the objectives of our balanced growth strategy.\nWhile there have been and will continue to be many challenges associated with operating during the pandemic, I'm very proud of our team for taking decisive steps to improve long-term shareholder value.\nIt is because of them that I'm confident we have the people, the strategy, and the resources to navigate this fluid environment and execute our plan over the coming years.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'll share a broad commentary on our consolidated performance for the quarter.\nPlease note that our comments will be on an as-adjusted basis and all comparisons are to the third quarter of fiscal 2021 unless otherwise indicated.\nFor the third quarter of our fiscal 2022, RPM generated record consolidated EBIT and sales despite a difficult comparison to the prior year.\nThese results were driven by our associates worldwide who persevered despite an extremely challenging operating environment, including ongoing raw material and labor shortages, omicron-related disruptions that were particularly acute in the third quarter as well as material wage, and freight cost inflation.\nOur consolidated adjusted EBIT growth was driven by three of our four segments: construction products, performance coatings, and specialty products, which leveraged selling price adjustments and operational improvements to the bottom line.\nOur consumer group is the outlier.\nMike will discuss this in more detail when he presents our segment results.\nWith our primary raw material costs up more than 40% on average versus a year ago, our consumer group will need to catch up with significant selling price increases, which will be instituted at the end of this month.\nWe have been fast to respond to supply chain challenges by quickly scaling up in-house resin production at a manufacturing facility we acquired in September.\nAdditionally, due to our ongoing investments in the fastest growing areas of our business, our high-performance building, construction, and coating systems have generated accelerated growth.\nConstruction and industrial maintenance activity is robust and energy markets have recovered while consumer takeaway remains strong.\nDue to three years of extraordinary work by our associates to implement our MAP to Growth operating improvement program, we have made structural improvements to RPM while maintaining our entrepreneurial culture, which is the core strength of RPM.\nAs a result, our performance coatings group and construction products group are operating not only at record sales and EBIT but at record margins in the third quarter.\nOur specialty products group is trending toward this same performance with record results in sales and EBIT and improving margin performance.\nAnd we are making good progress in our consumer business.\nIn short, we are playing offense almost everywhere, investing in accelerating organic growth, significant increases in capital expansion, particularly in the areas of Nudura ICF, roof restoration coatings, and a number of our consumer product areas, all of which are building positive momentum as we go into the fourth quarter and we roll into fiscal 2023.\nDuring the third quarter, we generated consolidated net sales of $1.43 billion, an increase of 13%, compared to the $1.27 billion reported during the same quarter of fiscal 2021.\nOrganic sales growth was 13.4% or $170.1 million.\nAcquisitions contributed 1.4% to sales or $17.8 million, while foreign exchange was a headwind that decreased sales by 1.8% or $23.4 million.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.38, which was unchanged compared to the year-ago quarter.\nOur consolidated adjusted EBIT was up 0.8% to a record $80.6 million, compared to the $79.9 million recorded in the fiscal 2021 third quarter.\nOn a double-stack basis, comparing fiscal Q3 '22 to pre-pandemic Q3 of FY '20, sales, EBIT, adjusted EBIT, net income, diluted EPS, and adjusted diluted earnings per share all achieved double- or triple-digit growth.\nSimilar to the first and second quarters of fiscal '22, our third quarter performance reflects the benefits of our balanced business portfolio where softness in one segment is generally offset by strength in the others.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2022, three of our four operating segments, construction products group, performance coatings group, and specialty products group generated strong double-digit sales growth.\nCombined sales in these three segments increased 19% while sales in the Consumer segment were up modestly.\nAgain, after removing Consumer, the remainder of RPM produced exceptional adjusted EBIT growth of 97%.\nOur consumer group continued to be disproportionately impacted by inflation as well as by omicron-related labor and supply chain disruption, particularly during December and January.\nThis instability in supply caused inefficiencies and continued to negatively impact conversion costs, resulting in a decline in adjusted EBIT at our consumer group for the fourth consecutive quarter.\nLater in the call, we'll discuss the actions we're taking to address these challenges affecting this segment.\nOur construction products group generated third quarter record net sales of $482 million, up 21.7% compared to the fiscal 2021 third quarter.\nOrganic sales growth was 23.2% and acquisitions contributed 2.2%.\nForeign currency translation headwinds reduced sales by 3.7%.\nCPG record revenue growth was largely due to the segment's ongoing success in promoting its differentiated restoration solutions, which offer particular advantages versus new construction, given the current raw material and labor shortages.\nThese same challenges have continued to help speed the adoption of the segment's innovative building envelope products.\nCPG's fastest-growing businesses are those providing roofing systems, insulated concrete forms, commercial sealants as well as concrete admixtures, and repair products.\nThe segment's international operations generated strong top-line growth in local currencies, which was muted by the strengthening U.S. dollar.\nCPG fiscal 2022 third quarter adjusted EBIT increased 89.7% to a record $35.1 million.\nDespite a difficult prior-year comparison, CPG was able to dramatically increase adjusted EBIT and EBIT margin to third quarter records due to improved product mix, volume growth, and operational improvements.\nAll of these factors, combined with selling price increases, helped to offset higher raw material inflation.\nOur performance coatings group's fiscal 2022 third quarter net sales were a record $270.9 million, an increase of 19.6% over the year-ago period.\nOrganic sales increased 17.8% and acquisitions contributed 3.4%, which were partially offset by foreign currency translation headwind of 1.6%.\nPCG continued its momentum with all of its North American businesses generating double-digit organic sales growth.\nPCG's businesses serving emerging markets generated explosive growth and its European companies continued their steady rebound.\nDriving its strong top line were increased industrial maintenance spending, recovery in energy markets, and price increases.\nPCG's best performing businesses were those providing polymer flooring systems, corrosion control coatings, and raised flooring systems.\nAdjusted EBIT increased 89.9% to a record $26.8 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2022.\nAdjusted EBIT increased as a result of volume growth, operational improvements, and a more favorable product mix.\nAdditionally, adjusted EBIT margin was a third quarter record.\nSpecialty products group reported record net sales of $189.4 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2022, an increase of 11.9% compared to the fiscal 2021 third quarter.\nOrganic sales increased 11.9% and acquisitions added 0.8%, which were offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 0.8%.\nSPG generated record sales as a result of strong performance at nearly all of its businesses, with the highest growth coming from those serving OEM and food additive markets.\nIn addition, this segment's sales of disaster restoration equipment rebounded after securing the supply of semiconductor chips and reconfiguring its products to accommodate them.\nThis is an example of how our businesses quickly adjust to challenges, demonstrating a key advantage to RPM's entrepreneurial culture.\nThis business did face a tough comparison to the prior-year period when demand for its restoration equipment was inflated because of Winter Storm Uri.\nAdjusted EBIT was a record $26.6 million in fiscal 2022 third quarter, an increase of 5.4%, compared to adjusted EBIT of $25.3 million in the last year's quarter.\nThis record-adjusted EBIT was largely due to operational improvements.\nOur consumer group achieved record net sales of $491.6 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2022, an increase of 2.9% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2021.\nOrganic sales increased 3.6%, which was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 0.7%.\nAs we anticipated, the segment grew revenue in part due to its ability to mitigate the severe alkyd resin shortages it had experienced by leveraging the new Texas manufacturing facility we acquired in September.\nDuring the third quarter, sales and productivity were challenged by unreliable shipping and supply, resulting from labor shortages caused by the omicron variant, particularly in December and January.\nSpeaking of challenges, the consumer group also faced a difficult comparison to the prior-year period when sales increased 19.8% and adjusted EBIT increased 48.6% due to elevated demand for its home improvement products during the pandemic's first phase.\nFiscal 2022 third quarter adjusted EBIT was $17.2 million, a decrease of 63.9%, compared to adjusted EBIT of $47.8 million reported during the prior-year period.\nDue to the nature of its products and the markets it serves, inflation has been more impactful on the consumer group than RPM's other segments.\nAnd raw material inflation, in particular, has had the most significant impact on EBIT.\nPartially offsetting these factors were price increases and operational improvements as the consumer group is currently investing in capacity and process improvements to meet customer demand as well as build resilience in its supply chain.\nThe consumer group is continuing to implement price increases to catch up with the inflation this segment has experienced over the last four quarters.\nLastly, I'd like to note that we have significant liquidity, which enables us to fund internal growth initiatives, make acquisitions, reward our investors with cash dividend payments, and repurchase our shares.\nHelping to keep our liquidity strong is a $300 million bond offering we completed in January.\nAlso during the third quarter, we repurchased $15 million of our common stock.\nFor the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter, our operations and those of our suppliers are expected to be impacted by ongoing supply chain challenges and raw material shortages, which will exert pressure on revenues and productivity.\nThe strengthening U.S. dollar will also unfavorably impact the translation of our results in international markets.\nIn addition, the war in Ukraine is creating some supply and inflationary pressures, which Frank will address in a little bit.\nWhile it's too soon to tell, rising interest rates may slow business and consumer spending in the coming months.\nDespite these challenges, we expect to generate fiscal 2022 fourth quarter consolidated sales growth in the low teens versus a difficult comparison to last year's fourth quarter sales, which grew 19.6%.\nOn a segment basis, we anticipate sales growth in the low teens in all four of our operating groups as a result of strategic investments we are making to capitalize on market opportunities and industry trends.\nWe anticipate that consolidated adjusted EBIT for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 will increase in the low teens versus the same period last year when adjusted EBIT was up 10.6%.\nWe expect that earnings will continue to be affected by raw material, freight, and wage inflation as well as by the impact on sales volumes from operational disruptions caused by raw material shortages.\nOur consumer group will be disproportionately impacted by these issues.\nIts EBIT margins have eroded all three quarters of this fiscal year due to inflationary pressures, which have a greater impact on the consumer group than RPM's other segments.\nWe continue to work to neutralize these factors by improving operational efficiencies, employing additional price increases to catch up with inflation, and adding manufacturing capacity to improve resiliency.\nThis concludes our prepared comments.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm Anvita Patil, Hecla's assistant treasurer.\nWith that, I will pass the call to Phil.\nWe're going to start with Slide 4, where you'll see there's four key messages that we're trying to communicate.\nFirst, silver as fundamental to the transition to the lower carbon energy, with solar power being a key renewable to make it happen.\nSilver demand for the use -- to be used for it, energy, has increased and is continuing to increase.\nThe United States Energy Information Agency projects that silver demand for solar will be half a billion ounces annually.\nRealize the current silver market is only a little more than a billion ounces, so that's a huge increase in the demand for silver for energy use.\nSecond message, for the transition to solar power to happen, you really have to have a reliable supply chain.\nAnd so to do that, you need silver mined in reliable countries.\nAnd most silver is mined in China, Peru, and Mexico.\nHecla has the United States largest reserve of any mining company and produces more than 40% of all the silver mined here.\nWe are the most reliable silver producer.\nOur third message is that on the ESG front, Hecla stands out with the safety record of our employees that is 40% below the national average, and we are also net neutral on greenhouse gas emissions for Scope 1 and 2 because we have among the smallest emissions in our industry.\nAnd that small amount allows us to use offset credits set at very, very low cost to get net neutral.\nAnd then the final message, and really what we'll spend the bulk of this conference call on is what a great year Hecla had operationally as well as financially.\nAside from our safety and environmental performance, our most significant achievement, though, was the implementation of the new underhand closed bench or the UCB mining method at the Lucky Friday.\nNow we mined 86% of our tons last year with the UCB method, but we we didn't speak about this until almost the end of the year because we wanted to make sure we understood how the cycle worked, confirmed how it would improve our seismicity management, determine how we manage dilution, and consider the impacts on the workforce.\nWe wanted to put ourselves in a place where we are now, which is where we're focusing on optimizing the method, not whether the method works or not.\nAnd it clearly works with the UCB method contributing to the 75% increase in the lucky Friday silver production over 2020.\nAnd 2022's silver production is expected to be 20% increase over 2021, and we'll have even more growth in '23 as the mine becomes a consistent 5 million ounce producer.\nNow, the Lucky Friday has been around for 80 years, but this new mining method fundamentally changes this long standing mine.\nWell, if you look at the history of the mine, Lucky Friday has never had sustained production about 2.5 million ounces.\nSo with the higher grade that we get as we go deeper and this new mining method, that production doubles and the costs stay relatively flat.\nAnd so what happens is the lucky Friday generates two or three times or more free cash flow than what we've done in the past.\nAnd so it's because of the innovation of this new mining method and our determination to make the mines safer to mine it better, that the lucky Friday provides this growth exposure to silver without the risk of large capital investment.\nAnd in this inflationary time, having growth with low capital is very unusual and you have so much less risk to get that growth.\nNow, Lauren is going to talk about the method more in detail, and I also encourage you to consider our technical report that was filed as an exhibit to the 10-K that describes the method and gives a lot of visibility into the Lucky Friday's strong economics.\nNow adding a strong Lucky Friday in 2021 led to a record financial year with revenues of $807 million and adjusted EBITDA of $279 million.\nCash flow from operations was $221 million and free cash flow was $111 million, and those were the second highest in our history.\nThis and last year's performance has allowed Hecla to generate in excess of $200 million in free cash flow over the past two years and further enhance our common stock dividend policy by lowering the realized silver price threshold to $20 per ounce.\nSo as a result of this, about 20% of our free cash flow went to shareholders last year.\nWe spent a little less than $50 million as drilling -- we were able to resume our drilling and our operations in sites after the slowdown that we had in 2020 due to COVID-19.\nSo as a result of that, our silver reserves increased 6% over last year, and they're now the second highest in our history at 200 million ounces, with Greens Creek's reserves at 125 million ounces.\nAnd it's -- that's its highest since 2002, and it's an increase of about 12% over 2020.\nThe chart on the left shows not only that we replaced mining depletion, but also converted 26 million ounces of resource to reserves.\nNow, our gold reserves at the end of 2021 were 2.7 million ounces.\nThe second highest in our history, and that's shown in the graph on the right.\nOur companywide measured and indicated resources declined largely due to reserve conversions.\nHowever, we did increase our silver inferred resources by 8% to 490 million ounces, with increases at Greens Creek, Lucky Friday, and San Sebastian.\nAnd we expect to continue to see increases in reserves and resources that should allow us to maintain our reserve lives of the 14-plus years that we have.\nI mentioned the technical report on the Lucky Friday.\nWe also filed reports for Greens Creek and Casa Berardi to give support for the reserves.\nAnd in those reports, there's an economic analysis that's in Section 19 that shows very strong economics of the reserves.\nAnd what it does is it assumes that the inferred resources that we mine, which is about 5% to 15% of what we typically mine at those two mines, that that was waste.\nAnd so what we've also done is we've included in Section 21 the summarized information, the supplemental information that gives our long-term plans that includes this inferred materials at their expected grade.\nLiven our long history of the two mines, we have a pretty good idea of what the mine will look like when you include the inferred material so that gives you a sense of what that looks like.\nAnd so I'd encourage you to look at Section 21 as Section 19.\nWith that, I'd like to pass coal over to Russell.\nTurning to Slide 7, as Phil noted earlier, we generated record revenue of more than $800 million, of which silver contributed 34% while gold contributed 42%.\nEach of our operations contributed significantly to our revenue, led by Greens Creek at about 50%, Casa Berardi at 30%, and Lucky Friday at 16%.\nWith the projected production growth at Lucky Friday, we anticipate its contribution to grow.\nRecord revenues, coupled with high margins, generated record adjusted EBITDA for the year of $279 million, resulting in our leverage ratio being 1.1 times, which is significantly below our target of two times.\nOur cash flow from operations at $221 million and free cash flow of $111 million were the second highest.\nAs a result of our consistent and strong operational performance, our balance sheet has continued to strengthen as we entered the year with $210 million in cash and excess of $440 million of liquidity.\nTurning to Slide 8, there's been a lot of discussion in the industry regarding inflationary pressures, both in the operating costs of companies as well as capital costs.\nAt Hecla, we are facing inflationary pressures, too.\nHowever, we anticipate those factors to be muted relative to the rest of the industry for a few reasons.\nFirst, for the most part, we operate high grade, high value but low tonnage underground mines.\nAnd since we don't move a lot of rock, our production comes from processing less tons than others within the industry.\nTherefore, making our mines less susceptible to some cost pressures.\nSecond, we are less exposed to increasing costs of energy as the majority of the power at our sites come from local utilities based on renewable energy sources.\nAnd third, we don't have any large capital expenditures to speak of.\nAs you look on Slide 8, we don't have any planned large capital expenditures as our capital ranges from a low of $91 million in 2020 to what we anticipate spending in 2022 of $135 million.\nIn 2021, our total capital and production costs were approximately $480 million, split approximately $370 million as production cost and $109 million for capital.\nOur 2022 total expected spend on production costs is about 6% higher than 2021.\nAnd while our guided capital spend for 2022 is slightly higher than 2021, it is primarily due to our investment at the Lucky Friday.\nA 5% inflation factor would add less than $7 million to the total capital spend.\nTurning to Slide 9, what record revenue generation, strong margins, and consistent capital spend add up to as a strong free cash flow at all our operating mines.\nYou can see all our minds generate positive free cash flow, and companywide, we generated more than 110 million in free cash flow during 2021, which was the second highest in the company's history.\nWith this strong and consistent free cash flow generation, we've seen an increase to our cash balance of 60% over 2020 and more than three times that of 2019.\nWith that, I'll pass the call to Lauren to go through operations.\nI will start on Slide 11.\nGreens Creek had another strong year as the mine produced 9.2 million ounces at an all-in sustaining costs of $3.19 per ounce, which was below our lower end of guidance at $3.25 per silver ounce.\nThe cost beat was due to higher byproduct credits and more favorable treatment charges than originally estimated.\nThe 2021 realized silver margin at the mine was approximately $22 per ounce, an increase of 75% over 2020.\nThese high silver margins drive the solid free cash flow generation at the mine.\nIn 2021, Greens Creek generated $185 million in free cash flow and over the past three years has generated more than $445 million in free cash flow.\nIn addition to the strong operational and financial performance, we increase reserves by 12%, and at 125 million ounces, the reserves are the second highest since 2002.\nThis high grade, high margin mine is among the best in the world.\nSilver production guidance for 2022 is 8.6 million to 8.9 million ounces as we will be mining lower grades for the production sequence.\nSilver cash costs are expected to be in the range of seventy $0.75 to $2.50 per ounce while the silver all-in sustaining cost guidance is $6.50 to $8.50 per ounce.\nMoving to Slide 12.\nIntroduction of the UCB mining method and anticipated higher grades depth have positioned the Lucky Friday for a strong decade ahead.\nWe are very excited about the UCB mining method, which is showing significant improvements in managing seismicity and improving productivity.\nLucky Friday has 75 million ounces in silver reserves, which translates to a reserve mine life plan of 17 years.\nThe Lucky Friday mine produced 3.6 million ounces of silver in 2021 with almost one million ounces produced in the fourth quarter.\nIn 2021, production was a 75% increase over 2020.\nAll-in sustaining costs for the year were $14.34 per ounce in line with our guidance.\nThe mine generated $32.7 million in free cash flow for the year with 86% of the tons mined using the UCB method.\nThe mine is expected to produce 4.3 million to 4.6 million ounces of silver in 2022 and cash costs of $0.75 to $2 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs of $7.25 to $9.25 per ounce.\nProduction in 2022 is planned to be almost 20% greater than 2021 while the all in sustaining cost per ounce is expected to decline by more than 30% due to higher production and byproduct credits.\nTurning to Slides 13 and 14, the UCB mining method is a new productive mining method developed by Hecla in an effort to proactively control fault slip seismicity in deep, high stress narrow-vein mining.\nThe method uses bench drilling and blasting methods to fragment significant vertical and lateral extensive vein beneath a top cut, taking a long strike of the vein and under engineered backfill.\nThe method is accomplished without the use of drop raises or lower mucking drives, which may result in local stress concentrations and increased exposure to seismic events.\nLarge blasts using up to 3,500 pounds of a pumped emulsion and programable electronic detonators fragment up to 350 feet of strike length to a depth of approximately 30 feet.\nThese large blast proactively induce fault slip seismicity at the mine at the time of the blast and shortly after it.\nThis blasted corridor is then mined underhand for two cuts.\nAs these cuts are mined, little to no blasting is done to advance them.\nDilution is controlled by supporting the hanging wall and foot wall as the mining progresses through the blasted ore.\nThe entire cycle repeats and stoping advances down dip, under fill, and in the de-stress zone.\nThe method allows for greater control of fault slip seismic events, significantly improving safety.\nIn conjunction, a notable productivity increase has been achieved by reducing seismic delays and utilizing bulk mining techniques.\nMoving to Slide 15, the Casa Berardi mine achieved record throughput as the mill achieved 4,187 tons per day in 2021.\nOur investments in mill optimization continued to deliver results in 2021 with mill recoveries increasing four percentage points in conjunction with the increase in throughput.\nFor the year, the mine produced 134.5 thousand ounces of gold at cash costs of $1,125 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs of $1,399 per ounce while generating free cash flow of $13.7 million.\nFrom 2019 to 2021, the mine has generated more than $100 million in free cash flow.\nWhile our investments in optimizing production have yielded results, we are seeing increased costs is due to the greater volumes mined and processed, contractor costs and higher underground maintenance costs.\nFor 2022, our production guidance for the mine is 125,000 to 132,000 ounces at cash costs of $1,175 to $1,325 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs of $1,450 to $1,600 per ounce.\nOf note is a 16% increase in reserves at the mine to 1.8 million ounces, mainly attributable to additions at the 160 pit.\nWith these reserves, Casa Berardi has a reserve mine plan of 14 years.\nSlide 17 shows our consolidated production guidance, so it takes all of the production guidance that Lauren's given you on a mine by mine basis and aggregates it.\nAnd then we also give you guidance with -- for '23 and '24.\nAnd as we look at our business for the next few years, we anticipate seeing growth in the production of silver due to the high grade material we'll be mining at the Lucky Friday coupled with the productivity gains due to the UCB method.\nWith these improvements, we anticipate seeing margins and free cash flow generation at Lucky Friday continue to expand, and we expect that the mine will move to be in the best third of the cost curve of primary silver mines.\nCasa Berardi will hold its position as a top tier silver asset, continuing to deliver the significant margins and free cash flow.\nJust a comment on the guidance relative to the guidance that we gave a year ago, realize that with higher zinc prices, we're able to mine -- and remember, Hecla is the third largest zinc producer in the United States.\nSo as a result, we're able to mine lower grade silver and actually generate the same or maybe even better cash flow.\nSo that's why you see a little bit of a reduction in the production from a year ago to this year.\nOn the gold side, we anticipate production of -- over the next few years to grow slightly with our gold production coming from Casa and Greens Creek.\nSo we're going to remain a very low cost silver producer with our all-in sustaining cost guidance being $9.75 to $11.75.\nOn gold, we're guiding to a sic of $14.50 to $1,600 per ounce and we're going to continue to work to improve the operations at Casa and deal with the inflationary pressure that we see in the Abitibi.\nLooking to capital, we anticipate spending approximately $135 million, as Russell mentioned, which is slightly higher than previous years.\nRemember that this change is driven mainly from new equipment increasing the number of stokes at the Lucky Friday.\nAnd so just a slight increase as a result of that.\nCost and capital assumptions include costs associated with managing COVID and assume 5% inflation.\nWe also anticipate spending 45 million for exploration and pre-development of that.\nA quarter of that will be spent at Greens Creek and Casa.\nIn addition to extending reserves and resources, both properties have programs identifying testing new targets.\nThe Nevada program, which is about a third of the program, is going to focus on the two miles of the East Graben Corridor at Midas, where we've had some very high grade intersections.\nAnd we're going to complete the pre-development drift and exploration drilling at Hollister's Hatter Graben.\nAt San Sebastian, we're testing for deeper mineralization near the mine infrastructure to try to expand the huge zone type mineralization, as well as mining more for just silver and gold in an area called La Roca.\nOur programs for Republic and the [Inaudible] districts that have been on hold for a number of years will also have some drilling this year.\nI want to take a moment to speak about the reset that we are taking in our Montana assets.\nWe withdrew the previous owner's plan of operations on both properties since it was based on their view of what the mines would be, but they really didn't have the data to formulate what we need to do for a modern, innovative mine plan.\nSo we're submitting a new plan of operation limited to geologic and environmental activities for just the Montanore site so we can develop our own plans.\nAt this point, Rock Creek will only have care and maintenance activities with our mineral and property rights intact.\nthat host more than 300 million ounces of silver and 3 billion pounds of copper.\nGiven the growing importance of these two metals, we believe that this sort of one step back to allow two-step forwards approach will allow production to begin as early as next year and next decade.\nSo that has not changed our view that early in the next decade, we should be able to be in production there.\nBefore I open the line to questions, I want to take just a moment to remember my friend and predecessor, CEO R. Brown, who passed away recently.\nArtworks for Hecla for almost 40 years, and he was the CEO for Hecla for almost half of that.\nThe UCB method is only the most recent example of Hecla's culture of innovation.\nOur art had Hecla on the cutting edge of a number of new technologies.\nMany that are standard in many operations around the world like pace backfill and the circular shaft that we had at the Lucky Friday.\nHis legacy is continuing innovation not only at the Lucky Friday, but the automation advances that we've had at Greens Creek and Casa Berardi.\nHecla would not be the company that we are today without him.\nAnd so please keep his family in your in your thoughts.\nWith that operator, I would like to open the call to questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:So it was.com Kessel Stelling, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will begin the call.\nHe will be followed by Jamie Gregory, Chief Financial Officer and Kevin Blair, President and Chief Operating Officer for more detailed information.\nWe ask that you limit yourselves to two questions.\nDuring the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures related to the company's performance.\nAnd now here's Kessel Stelling.\nWe have two main stories today and probably many more.\nOne is of our strong core operating performance for the first quarter pre and post coronavirus arrival.\nThe other equally important story is the strength and resilience of our company, which is again proven our ability to innovate to execute quickly and effectively manage day-to-day operations while also shifting priorities and resources to meet the emerging needs.\nFrom the very beginning of this COVID-19 healthcare crisis, the decisions and actions taken by our team have been guided by two principles, doing what's best for the physical and financial well-being of our team members and doing what's best for our customers.\nWith those principles in mind, in March, our branches were converted to drive through and appointment only and we implemented aggressive cleaning, sanitizing, hygiene protocols at all of our company facilities.\nMore than 80% of 5,400 team members are now working from home and our IT team did a fabulous job quickly repositioning our workforce.\nWe've offered additional paid-time off the team members who are sick, who are quarantining or dealing with child care or other related family hardships and we're offering bonus payments to our hourly team members required to work on site to serve our customers.\nTo help our customers through this period of financial stress, we're waiting NSF and monthly service fees and offering payment the permit and other loan relief as appropriate.\nAlthough social distancing is more or less eliminated the in-person hands on approach we usually take toward community service, we're doing everything we can to support needs across our footprint, including matching contributions to the American Red Cross, providing financial support for feeding America and funding meals for first responders and front-line healthcare providers.\nI am especially proud of the effort our team has made to deliver paycheck protection program loans to our customers.\nSince the launch of P3 on April 3, our team has processed, approved and funded more than $2 billion in loans for 8,300 customers.\nWe're continuing to process submissions in our pipeline, preparing to find as many as possible with the additional appropriations made available this week.\nKevin Blair will talk more about the key aspects of our COVID-19 response later in his remarks.\nBefore I cover highlights for the first quarter, I want to talk about our confidence in our ability to manage through this current crisis and to emerge from it in even stronger position.\nSince the last crisis, our company has continually taken steps to prepare for an adverse economic environment including efforts to strengthen management in the key risk areas of capital credit and liquidity.\nWe routinely deploy stress testing and sensitivity analyzes to inform business decisions and we believe we're well positioned to sustain an economic downturn such as we're facing today.\nOn capital, our internal stress testing process gives us confidence in our ability to maintain strong capital ratios and stressed economic environments and our liquidity position remains strong.\nWe're also assessing and reprioritizing strategic initiatives under our Synovus forward program Kevin Blair is going to share more details later in the call on steps we're taking to ensure we're addressing the shorter term imperatives while also focusing on the right initiatives for strengthening our company long-term.\nI'll briefly walk through highlights of the quarter on slide four.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.21 compared to $0.98 a year ago.\nThis year-over-year decline was driven by a 225 basis point reduction in the Fed funds rate, the schedule loss of loan accretion from acquired loans and a significant increase to the allowance that accounts for the anticipated impact of COVID-19 under the CECL framework.\nWe were very pleased with the fundamentals of our core performance including period end loan growth of $1.1 billion, deposit growth of $1.4 billion and core transaction deposit growth of more than $600 million.\nCore net interest income, which excludes purchase accounting adjustments was flat for the quarter.\nHowever, the core net interest margin declined 5 basis points from the prior quarter, slightly more than our original expectations due to the more significant reduction in interest rates.\nAdjusted non-interest revenue of $99 million grew $7 million from fourth quarter benefiting from significant activity in mortgage, capital markets and fiduciary businesses.\nThis was despite lower seasonal core banking fees and increased fee waivers as part of our effort to serve clients during this COVID-19 disruption.\nAdjusted non-interest expense totaled $271 million for the quarter, up $6 million versus the previous quarter, largely due to the $5 million increase in seasonal payroll taxes that were referenced during our fourth quarter earnings call.\nWe also had an incremental $1 million in expenses associated with COVID related bonus payments for certain front line team members.\nProvision for credit losses was $159 million and resulted in an allowance for credit losses ratio of 1.39%.\nThese metrics incorporate the impact from COVID and the first quarter of CECL.\nBefore I get started walking through the quarterly performance.\nI'd like to highlight that we have withdrawn our 2020 guidance.\nWe will give some near term indications of financial performance on key metrics throughout my commentary and we are committed to reestablishing longer-term targets when the economy stabilizes.\nWe discussed our increased productivity a bit on the fourth quarter call and it continue on to the first quarter with $3.1 billion in total loan production.\nOur Wholesale Banking team one boarded 155 new customers during the quarter, which represented $1 billion in new loans.\nIn March, we saw $300 million increase in line utilization.\nC&I line utilization plateaued at 50% in March as some customers increased draw-out of an abundance of caution related to the economic situation.\nWe are confident in the credit quality of our growth this quarter as we remain disciplined in our underwriting.\nIn the second quarter, we expect loans from the paycheck protection program to serve as the primary engine for loan growth as additional pipelines have declined.\nRate cuts in March led to loan yields of 4.6% excluding purchase accounting a decline of 15 basis points from the prior quarter.\nThe full quarter impact of these March costs will have a greater impact on the average loan yields in the second quarter.\nOn adjusted for hedges, approximately 50% of our loans have a floating rate.\nAs previously discussed, we have a hedging program in place to help mitigate the impact of changes in short-term rates on our floating rate loan portfolio.\nAt quarter end, we had $2.8 billion in receipt fixed swaps associated with these hedges with an average rate of 1.4% versus one month LIBOR.\nSlide six shows deposit growth of $1.4 billion, which included a continue to increases in core transaction deposits of $623 million.\nIn the first quarter, we took advantage of reduced pricing on wholesale broker deposits to increased balances and replace higher call single service deposits.\nWe will continue to monitor these markets for opportunities and while it remains a dynamic deposit environment and remain focused on growing our core deposit base and maintaining a prudent liquidity profile.\nIn terms of overall deposit pricing, we've certainly seen a response to the recent FOMC actions.\nAnd as you can see our total interest-bearing cost in March were approximately 30 basis points lower than the average from the prior quarter.\nIn this easing cycle, the FOMC cut their target rate by 225 basis points and our general expectation is for cycle betas to end in the low to mid 30s as deposits repriced throughout the year.\nAs you can see on slide seven, net interest income of $373 million declined $26 million from the prior quarter.\nThe majority of that decline or $25 million was attributable to the expected decline in purchase accounting adjustments.\nThe core net interest margin, which excludes PAA decreased 5 basis points from the prior quarter to 3.35%.\nAs we look into the second quarter, we expect net interest income to remain relatively flat as a result of significant loan growth associated with P3.\nHowever, this growth along with the depressed rate environment and an elevated cash position is expected to weigh on our net interest margin.\nExcluding those impacts, we reiterate that we expect the margin to decline 4 basis points to 5 basis points per 25 basis point decrease.\nWe expect the majority of the impact from March rate cuts to be realized in the second quarter.\nOn slide eight, you will see that we have had continued success in fee revenue generation, which increased to $99 million adjusted.\nThat's an increase of $7 million from the prior quarter and up $21 million or 27% versus the prior year.\nIn the first quarter, we continue to have diversified strength in our fee revenue business.\nMortgage revenue driven by high production levels and elevated secondary gain on sale margins increased $3 million.\nCapital markets volumes were higher by $2 million as our commercial clients locked in lower rates on their borrowings and income from brokerage grew $1 million, driven by increase in contributions of new hires in 2019 and higher transaction revenue from elevated market volatility.\nThese increases more than offset reductions in areas such as service charges on deposit accounts, primarily due to a decline in retail NSF fees.\nHowever, COVID is already impacting customer behavior including significant declines in capital markets activity, lower debit and credit card transaction volumes and overall business disruption for commercial clients.\nThis disruption will likely result in fee revenue declining 15% to 25% in the second quarter from our recent run rate of approximately $90 million.\nWe would expect an increase in non-interest revenues as the economy stabilizes.\nMoving to slide nine.\nIn the first quarter, non-interest expense was $276 million for $271 million adjusted.\nAdjusted expenses increased $6 million from the prior quarter, generally in line with our prior guidance.\nWith the increased level of COVID related expenses, which we currently estimate of $5 million to $6 million in the second quarter we expect adjusted expenses to remain relatively stable quarter-on-quarter before declining in the second half of the year.\nAs Kevin will discuss in a moment, we remain confident that our efforts over the past six months to identify ways to improve our operating efficiency will result in positive operating leverage over the long-term.\nWe are tailoring the timing of our Synovus forward initiatives to ensure they do not distract from our focus on team members customers and communities.\nThis doesn't change our commitment to our strategy, it simply adjust the timing.\nSlide 10 shows our credit quality metrics as well as the summary of our provision for credit losses and allowance.\nNet charge-offs at 21 basis points remain within prior guidance.\nThe NPL ratio did increase from the prior quarter to 41 basis points and this is up 1 basis point from the prior year.\nAdditionally, past-dues return to the low end of the recent range at 22 basis points.\nWhile we expect to experience stress in the portfolio as we progressed in the current economic environment, it is important to note that we are entering this downturn well positioned from a credit quality standpoint with NPAs, NPLs, past dues and charge-offs at or near lows for this economic cycle.\nProvision for credit losses and allowance for the quarter were impacted by the adoption of CECL on January 1 which generally results in higher provision for credit losses compared to the incurred loss.\nAs you can see on slide 11, the day one reserve increase was $110 million or 39%.\nWe did a lag the five-year transition period for regulatory capital treatment.\nOur 10-K reference the two-year reasonable and supportable period used in CECL estimate, but it was a more appropriate to reduce that for one-year horizon during this period of heightened economic uncertainty, a one-year reversion to the mean follows the reasonable and formal period.\nThe deterioration in the economic environment since January 1 due to the current healthcare crisis resulted in a higher allowance for credit losses ratio as of March 31st, then was modeled in the day one seasonal implementation and is currently at 1.39%.\nOur modeling process incorporates quantitative and qualitative considerations that are used to inform CECL estimates.\nThe internally developed economic forecasts used to determine the allowance for credit losses as of March 31 was approved on March 20.\nAt the time, the approved forecast line with rating agency and Wall Street economic forecast between that approval date and quarter-end, we saw further deterioration in the economic outlook, which resulted in the need for a qualitative overlay to our allowance for credit losses.\nThe qualitative overlay of $37 million at 10 basis points to the allowance for credit losses and better aligns the total allowance with the economic indicators and forecast at the end of the first quarter.\nSignificant economic uncertainty remains as a result of the continuing healthcare crisis and the ultimate impact of government stimulus efforts.\nIf our economic outlook on June 30 resembles these more recent forecast, we would expect to see further increase in the allowance for credit losses.\nCapital ratios on slide 12 include the impact of CECL and incorporate applicable regulatory transition period.\nAs we've shared in the past, our target capital ratios were determined through our routine internal capital adequacy assessment process and include the capital optimization efforts completed in 2019.\nThese capital ratios give us comfort that even in a severely adverse scenario we have a sufficient buffer to withstand the losses and our main well capital.\nIn the first quarter, our CET1 ratio declined 8.72% largely due to the increase in risk-weighted assets, which accounted for a reduction of 25 basis points.\nOur continued strength and PPNR generated 39 basis points of capital, which more than offset the 21 basis point impact of CECL related allowance build.\nAs a result of CECL, we anticipate capital ratio degradation earlier in a recessionary environment than under prior accounting guidance.\nHowever, it is that allowance, which will provide a significant buffer to absorb any realized losses later in the cycle and affords us the ability to return to our capital targets over-time.\nCurrently, the allowance bill was reflected in the total risk-based capital ratio, which increased 6 basis points from the prior quarter to 12.31%.\nBased on the same framework that was established and utilized for stress testing under the Dodd-Frank Act, we continue to leverage our internal capital management processes.\nThese processes coupled with our risk appetite framework provide a road map and outlines capital preservation strategies in the event we see a more protracted period of economic weakness.\nAs we navigate through this recession, we will be very diligent in how we deploy our balance sheet with a clear prioritization toward core customer relationships.\nThese processes also govern how we consider share repurchases in our common equity dividend.\nThrough this process, we determined to suspend our previously approved share repurchase program.\nWe continually evaluate our approach to common equity dividends in our capital planning process, which is guided by our assessment of capital adequacy as well as our projection of sustainable long-term earnings.\nWe believe a change in the common dividend is not warranted at this time.\nAs discussed, we remain confident in our capital adequacy and we continuously assess our long-term earnings outlook.\nLiquidity management has always been a priority at Synovus and we continue to improve our liquidity profile.\nIn the first quarter, we issued $400 million of bank debt at very attractive levels and we increased our collateral of the Federal Home Loan Bank by approximately $2 billion.\nAs shown on slide 13, you can see that we have approximately $14 billion in readily available balance sheet liquidity.\nWhile we expect loan balances excluding P3 loans to remain fairly flat over the near term, we do anticipate considerable second quarter growth associated with our P3 lending effort.\nTo best manage our risk and to maintain our existing funding sources for other customer need.\nwe anticipate using the Federal Reserve's P3 lending facility to support funding for at least a portion of these loans.\nWe believe that this is the most effective way to manage our overall liquidity position and to mitigate the associated impact on our capital ratios.\nKevin will now share a deeper dive on credit portfolios most impacted by COVID, some details about our responses to this crisis and provide an update on Synovus forward.\nBefore I go into deeper detail on several industries where the COVID-19 crisis is currently having a greater impact on business operations, this seems like an appropriate time to take a deeper dive into the composition and the quality of our loan portfolio by category as well as the significance of the diversification and derisking benefits that have been realized since the last financial crisis.\nThe chart on the slide shows the key components of each of our three portfolio categories with the table on the bottom right showing the shift in the composition from 2009.\nOur C&I book totaled $17.7 billion and is primarily comprised of general middle market and commercial banking clients across a diverse set of industries.\nWithin C&I, the specialty divisions such as senior housing and premium finance comprised about 14% of total loans and have been a significant contributor to our growth story while also possessing some of the best credit metrics over the last several years.\nThe overall portfolio is well diversified by industry and geography and is extremely granular with almost 35,000 loans with an average original loan balance of approximately $770,000.\nThe CRE portfolio is $10.7 billion and 86% of the book is comprised of income producing properties with multifamily office, shopping center and hotel being the largest property types within the portfolio.\nWe do adhere to a disciplined concentration management philosophy thus our largest CRE loan is less than $50 million with an average loan size of approximately $13 million.\nThis portfolio is diverse both from a geographic and property type standpoint with strong loan to value and debt service coverage levels.\nAs a result, this portfolio has continued to perform well and as it relates to net charge-offs, the CRE book is in a net recovery position over the last five quarters.\nThe consumer book is $10 billion, almost three quarters of the consumer portfolio is in mortgage and HELOC categories with the remainder in lending partnerships, credit cards and other consumer.\nYou can see by the credit score and loan to value statistics that this portfolio is super-prime and remains very healthy.\nUnder the existing economic conditions, we expect our consumer portfolio to decline in the near term as we decreased our appetite for unsecured lending and third party partnership purchases.\nThe last point I want to cover on this slide is the substantial improvement that we've made to the diversification and derisking of the entire loan portfolio.\nFrom 2009 until first quarter of 2020 we have significantly reduced our exposure to one-to-four family residential land and investment properties as well as CRE in aggregate.\nBy simply utilizing historical loss rates, the remix of our portfolio alone would result in a 50% reduction in losses.\nCombined with the improvements in underwriting and portfolio management, we would expect losses to decline even further when evaluating the impact of the severely adverse scenario.\nMoving to slide 15.\nWhile our entire loan portfolio is continuously assessed, we have introduced enhanced monitoring for the segments noted on slide 15.\nThese segments totaling $4.6 billion had been identified as having a more direct and immediate impact from the COVID-19 crisis.\nWe are continuously working with our customers to evaluate how the current economic conditions are impacting their business operations and ultimately their cash burn rate.\nWe are leveraging payment deferments as well as the CARES Act stimulus programs to help weather short-term financial effects.\nSolid underwriting and strong credit performance coupled with stronger balance sheets that have been built during our extended expansionary period give us confidence that these portfolios enter this downturn in the best possible position.\nIn the appendix on slides 27 through 29 you will find more detail around each of these portfolios, but I will touch on a few of them now.\nOur hotel book is over 85% franchised and primarily contains non-resort properties, more than 90% of our hotels are rated upper mid scale or above.\nThis portfolio has strong credit metrics with an average loan to value of 54% and debt service coverage ratios of 1.9 times.\nWe have about $1 billion of shopping center exposure to centers that aren't grocery pharmacy or discount store-anchored.\nBased on our southeastern footprint, these locations are situated markets that have continue to see good population and household income growth, which has created growth and stability for these businesses.\nAs such, these portfolios continue to perform well from a credit quality standpoint.\nThe restaurant book is $800 million with 56% of the book in limited service restaurants and 40% in full service.\nOver 60% of our restaurants are franchises and have an average loan size at origination of roughly $1.5 million.\nThe next 2 industries are non-essential retail trade and arts entertainment and recreation, combining for $1.2 billion in outstandings.\nBoth of these portfolios have performed well pre-crisis and are also very granular with average loan sizes at origination of $1.8 million and $1.2 million respectively.\nLastly, I will mention are relatively small exposure to oil-related industries at less than 1% of total loans.\nGiven our five state footprint, oil is not a prevalent industry, particularly as it relates to exploration and production.\nMost of our exposures and transportation operations and support related to the industry.\nThis portfolio has exhibited strong credit performance, but given the current state of the oil industry, we are more closely monitoring our exposure.\nOur bankers and credit team members continue to work with and provide financial advice and consultation to our customers and ensure we are providing the necessary support to mitigate the short-term disruption and cash flows.\nAs with our entire credit portfolio, each of these portfolios has exhibited strong performance over the trailing quarters and years and was as well positioned as could be expected coming into the current environment.\nThe duration of the downturn will obviously determine the impact on these businesses and how quickly these industries will return to more normalized cash flow levels.\nDespite rolling out our Synovus forward playbook in March, we quickly reconfigured our efforts to focus on our COVID response starting with the safety and well-being of our team members who are vitally important to support our customers as well as the communities we serve.\nWe effectively exercised our business continuity plan, which enables our employees to work remotely while continuing to provide customer facing roles in our branches and call centers to meet the needs of our customers.\nAnd quite frankly, that was our other primary focus, the safety and continued service of our customers.\nAlthough we continue to practice social distancing, we are here to serve our customers and continue to provide advice and new solutions to help them navigate the changing business climate and support their business operations.\nIn fact, during the first quarter, we implemented over 6,000 new services in our Treasury & Payment Solutions area, which represented a 320% increase over the first quarter of 2019.\nThis is another proof point of our continued commitment to serve our customers and our ability to do so in a difficult climate.\nAnd despite the crisis, our bankers continue to call on and on-board new prospects as our relationship-based approach is serving as a key differentiator in this trying environment.\nWe are going to deploy our capital in areas where we receive optimal returns and while this business approach may produce lower loan growth in aggregate, we will continue to focus on acquiring new full service relationships and deepening our current relationships with new opportunities.\nAs we have mentioned, we've also taken a proactive approach to providing relief to our customers when needed from waving fees to increasing ATM and mobile deposit limits to granting deferments on loan payments.\nOur loan deferment program is constructed to allow smaller loans upon request to receive a short-term 90-day deferral of interest and principal to the maturity date of the loan.\nFor larger loans, we have initiated a credit driven approach to review the specific circumstances of each request, annualized cash burn and obtain updated financial information while determining the need for the deferment.\nTo-date, our percentage of total deferrals is around 13% of the overall portfolio with those industries more directly impacted by COVID-19 carrying higher percentages.\nWe also have closely monitored all of the stimulus actions and programs made available by the CARES Act.\nObviously the paycheck protection program has had the greatest impact on our customers to this point.\nWe began the P3 process on March 28 with an online expression of interest portal.\nWe began taking applications on April 3rd, the day the program went live.\nAs Kessel mentioned earlier, as of today, we have secured funding for over 8,000 customers for approximately $2 billion.\nAs I close, let me transition to the future at Synovus Forward.\nAs we shared during an investor conference in March, Synovus Forward is our newly formed program that was built to generate an incremental $100 million of pre-tax income in the coming years and to lead to top quartile performance among mid cap banks in terms of profitability and efficiency.\nDuring the development of this program, we evaluated over 20 unique and distinct initiatives that included a combination of expense and revenue opportunities.\nWe are confirming today that the incremental opportunity is still very achievable.\nHowever, many of the benefits have been delayed due to the focus on the current crisis.\nMany of the expense and revenue initiatives that were planned for the first half of 2020 will be recast into the second half of the year or in early 2021.\nWhile we have had to delay some initiatives, we are also accelerating actions in others.\nThis includes increasing the efficiencies gained from the third-party spend initiatives, accelerating the development of digital and analytical capabilities to drive growth and manage risk and leveraging our remote environment to aggressively think about our physical distribution and locations.\nWe have also continue to invest in technology and more specifically, My Synovus, our consumer digital portal.\nIn March, we deployed major updates to enhance the bill-pay and transfer experiences of our customers.\nAnd as we made improvements, we've seen higher levels of enrollment and utilization while seeing our overall operating increase and it's important to note that the current crisis is creating opportunities to add new initiatives to the portfolio and resize current initiatives that we had planned.\nThe Synovus Forward portfolio is not rigid it and will continue to evolve we are committed to delivering and growing the value as we address new economic and customer behavior realities.\nThere is much work ahead of us and we understand the need to balance both short term and long-term priorities.\nThe end state benefits, their timing and sizing may continue to evolve in this fluid environment.\nAnd for a brief update on the weeks activities just wanted to share that on Wednesday, we hosted our first online only virtual shareholder meeting.\nAmong other actions our shareholders overwhelmingly approved the elimination of our 10 -1 voting structure and super majority voting requirements.\nThese changes reflect our Board's continuing commitment to best-in-class corporate governance.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:In the first quarter, Cullen/Frost earned $113.9 million or $1.77 a share compared with earnings of $47.2 million or $0.75 a share reported in the same quarter last year and $88.3 million or $1.38 a share in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nIn a very challenging economic environment, our team not only continued to execute on our strategies, but also achieved some extraordinary accomplishments that I'll discuss in detail as we go through the call.\nEconomic impacts of the pandemic continue to affect loan demand.\nOverall, average loans in the first quarter were $17.7 billion, an increase of 18% compared with $15 billion in the first quarter of last year.\nBut excluding PPP loans first quarter average loans of $14.9 billion represented a decline of just over 1% compared to the first quarter of 2020.\nAverage deposits in the first quarter were $35.4 billion and they were an increase of 30% compared to $27.4 billion in the first quarter of last year.\nObviously, macroeconomic factors over the past year have impacted our deposit growth but it's also been our experience over our history that our frost that we're safe haven for customers and times of uncertainty.\nOur return on average assets and average common equity in the first quarter were 1.09% and 11.13%, respectively.\nWe did not record a credit loss expense related to loans in the first quarter after recording a credit loss expense of $13.3 million in the fourth quarter.\nOur asset quality outlook is stable and experienced a meaningful improvement during the first quarter.\nIn general, problem assets are declining in number and new problems have dropped significantly and are at pre-pandemic levels.\nNet charge-offs for the first quarter dropped sharply to $1.9 million from $13.6 million in the fourth quarter.\nAnnualized net charge-offs, for the first quarter, were just 4 basis points of average loans.\nNonperforming assets were $51.7 million at the end of the first quarter, down 17% from the $62.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter.\nAnd a year ago, nonperformers stood at $67.5 million.\nOverall, delinquencies for accruing loans at the end of the first quarter were $106 million or 59 basis points of period-end loans at stable when compared to the end of 2020 and comparable to what we have experienced in the past several years.\nOf the $2.2 billion in 90-day deferrals granted to borrowers that we've discussed on previous calls, only about $11 million remain in deferment at the end of the first quarter.\nTotal problem loans, which we define as risk grade 10 and higher were $774 million at the end of the first quarter compared with $812 million at the end of the fourth quarter.\nEnergy-related problem loans continued to decline and were $108.6 million at the end of the first quarter compared to $133.5 million for the previous quarter.\nTo put that in perspective, total problem energy loans peaked at nearly $600 million early in 2016.\nIn general, energy loans continued to decline as a percentage of our portfolio falling to 7.5% of our non-PPP portfolio at the end of the first quarter.\nAs a reminder, that figure was 8.2% at the end of the fourth quarter and the peak was 16% back in 2015.\nWe continue to work hard to rationalize our company's exposure to the energy segment to appropriate levels.\nOverall, we find that credit quality is improving.\nWhen the pandemic started last year, we assembled teams to analyze the non-energy portfolio segments that we considered the most at risk which included restaurants, hotels, entertainment, sports and retail.\nThe total of these portfolio segments, excluding PPP loans, represented just $1.6 billion at the end of the first quarter.\nAnd our loan loss reserve for these segments was 4.9%.\nThe credit quality of individual credits in these segments is mostly stable or better compared to the end of the fourth quarter, and the outlook is improving although macroeconomic trends impacting some segments will take time to fully digest.\nThe Hotel segment, where we have $286 million outstanding remains our most at risk category.\nHowever, we believe our exposure to any significant loss is minimal.\nI'm very proud of our team's ability to build relationships with new customers in challenging times.\nParticularly when so much effort was put into helping existing small business customers get PPP loans.\nDuring the first quarter, we added 55% more new commercial relationships than we did in the first quarter of last year.\nA good portion of those mentioned PPP is the reason they came to frost, but even more of them we're just from the continued hard work by our bankers and the level of service that we provide.\nNew loan commitments booked during the first quarter, excluding PPP loans, were down by 16% compared to the first quarter of 2020, which was before the economic impact of the pandemic had been felt.\nSo this comparison clearly shows the impact of the pandemic on loan demand.\nRegarding new loan commitments booked, the balance between these relationships was nearly even with 49% larger and 51% core at the end of the first quarter.\nWe will continue to keep this balance in mind.\nIn total, the percentage of deals lost to structure was 70%, and it was fairly consistent with the 73% we saw this time last year.\nHowever, keep in mind, we believe that's a high number, and it illustrates the competition out there through underwriting.\nOur weighted current active loan pipeline in the first quarter was up about 1% compared with the end of the fourth quarter.\nSo though modest, it was good to see some improvement.\nConsumer banking also continues to see outstanding growth.\nOverall, our net new consumer customer growth rate for the first quarter was up 255% compared to the first quarter of 2020, 255%.\nSame-store sales, as measured by account openings were up by 18% and through the end of the first quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2020, and up a non-annualized 11% on a linked-quarter basis.\nIn the first quarter, 36% of our account openings came from our online channels, including our Frost mobile app.\nWe believe this compares very well to the industry.\nOnline account openings were 35% higher when compared to the first quarter of 2020.\nConsumer loan portfolio was $1.8 billion at the end of the first quarter, up by 1.4% compared to the first quarter of last year.\nWe're nearing the completion of our previously announced Houston expansion.\nWe opened the 23rd of the planned 25 new financial centers in April, and the remaining two will be opened in the coming weeks.\nOverall, the new financial centers are exceeding our expectations.\nThis is one of the extraordinary accomplishments that I mentioned earlier.\nOur team's performance of keeping the momentum going in Houston despite the pandemic and all the work we put into PPP is a true credit to our outstanding staff.\nNow let me share with you where we stand with the expansion as of March for the 22 locations we had opened at that time and it excludes PPP loans.\nOur numbers of new households were 144% of target and represent over 8,700 new individuals and businesses.\nOur loan volumes were 212% of target and represented $263 million in outstandings.\nLet's look at the mix of this portfolio.\nAbout 85% represent commercial credits with about 15% consumer.\nThey represent just under half C&I loans, about 1/4 investor real estate, 15% consumer and around 10% nonprofit in public finance.\nFinally, with only three loans over $10 million, over 80% are core loans.\nNow let's look at deposits.\nAt $343 million, they represent 114% of target.\nThey represent about two-third commercial and one-third consumer.\nWe've seen increasing momentum over the last year when we were about 68% of our target.\nWhat I hope this demonstrates and what's important to understand is that the character of the business we are generating through the expansion is very consistent with the overall company.\nIt's just what we do.\nAnd you can see that its profitability will be driven by small and midsized businesses.\nI'm extremely proud of what our organization has been able to do in Houston, and I believe you should be, too.\nWe've built a platform that will add to shareholder value for years to come.\nAnd that's why I'm happy to share that we will be taking the lessons and skills we've learned in the Houston market to a very similar opportunity we have before us in Dallas early next year with 25 new locations over a 30-month period.\nThis will put us on a path to triple our number of locations in that dynamic market over that time.\nTurning now to PPP.\nOur team was ready to respond when SBA reopened the application process in January.\nTo date, we've taken in about 12,400 new loan applications in the second round of PPP with over $1.3 billion funded.\nCombined with our total from the first round last year, we funded more than 31,000 loans or $4.6 billion, just amazing.\nWe've also been working hard to help those borrowers get loans forgiven.\nWe've invited all of the round one borrowers to apply for forgiveness, and we've submitted 70% of those loan balances to the SBA, and we've received forgiveness on about 50% already.\nBecause this process is vital to our borrowers, we're doing all the work in-house with frost bankers.\nWe haven't outsourced any of these efforts.\nWe're excited to announce that on April 15, we've launched a new feature for our consumer customers called $100 overdraft grace.\nThis feature is an investment in our organic growth strategy.\nAnd at the same time, we believe it will make a difference in our customers' lives.\nIt clearly sets us apart from both traditional bank competitors and neo banks.\nAs a result, we expect it to further increase the rate of new customer growth and our already growing consumer bank.\nAlso this month, we received some good news from third-party organizations that assess our customer service.\nThe Greenwich Excellence awards or frost has had the highest scores for superior service, advice and performance to small business and middle market banking clients for four consecutive years.\nLet us know that our already high overall satisfaction and Net Promoter scores went up even higher over 2020, while many of our competitors saw declines.\nAnd I'm very pleased to let you know that J.D. Power and Associates, just this week announced at Frost once again received the highest ranking in customer satisfaction in Texas in the retail banking satisfaction study.\nThat's the 12th consecutive year we've had the highest scores in Texas.\nWhen you put it all together, the solid financial results, the healthy numbers in deposits and loans, all the new relationships, the goodwill from our PPP efforts, the Houston expansion and the customer service accolades it shows that when we care about customers and work to be a force for good and their everyday lives will be rewarded.\nAnd I don't just mean rewarded in a financial sense.\nI mean the sense that people recognize that we're doing something important and we're doing it better than just about anyone else.\n2020 was a tough year in 2021, hasn't been easy so far, but things are looking up.\nAnd that's due to everything that our employees have been doing for our company and our customers in these difficult times, and I'm very optimistic about our outlook.\nI appreciate all their hard work.\nAnd I'm proud of them, and I'm proud to be at frost.\nLooking first at our net interest margin.\nOur net interest margin percentage for the first quarter was 2.72%, down 10 basis points from the 2.82% reported last quarter.\nThe decrease was impacted by a higher proportion of earning assets being invested in lower-yielding balances at the Fed in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter, partially offset by the positive impact of the PPP loan portfolio.\nInterest-bearing deposits at the Fed earning 10 basis points averaged $9.9 billion or 25% of our earning assets in the first quarter, up from $7.7 billion or 20% of earning assets in the prior quarter.\nExcluding the impact of PPP loans, our net interest margin percentage would have been 2.59% in the first quarter, down from an adjusted 2.75% for the fourth quarter.\nThe taxable equivalent loan yield for the first quarter was 3.87%, up 13 basis points from the previous quarter.\nExcluding the impact of PPP loans, the taxable equivalent loan yield would have been 3.77%, basically flat with the prior quarter.\nAverage loan volumes in the first quarter of 17.7 billion were down 260 million from the fourth quarter average of 17.9 billion.\nExcluding PPP loans, average loans in the first quarter were down about 184 million, or 1.2% from the fourth quarter, with about three quarters of that decrease related to energy loans.\nTo add some additional color on our PPP loans, as Phil mentioned, we funded over 1.3 billion of round two PPP loans during the first quarter.\nThis was offset by approximately 580 million and forgiveness payments during the quarter on round one loan, bringing our total round one forgiveness payments to approximately 1.4 billion.\nAt the end of the first quarter we had approximately 73 million in net deferred fees remaining to be recognized with about one third of this related to round one loans.\nWith respect to round two loans given the smaller dollar size of the loans and changes in the forgiveness process, we expect this portfolio to have a shorter average life and the round one portfolio.\nAs a result, we currently expect about 90% of the remaining net defer fees to be recognized this year.\nLooking at our investment portfolio, the total investment portfolio averaged 12.2 billion during the first quarter, down about 335 million from the fourth quarter average of 12.6 billion.\nThe taxable equivalent yield on the investment portfolio was 3.41% in the first quarter, flat with the fourth quarter.\nThe yield on the taxable portfolio, which averaged 4 billion was 2.06% down 6 basis points from the fourth quarter as a result of higher premium amortization associated with our agency mortgage backed security given faster prepayment speed, and to a lesser extent, lower yields associated with recent purchases.\nOur municipal portfolio averaged about 8.2 billion during the first quarter, down 154 million from the fourth quarter with a taxable equivalent yield of 4.09% flat with the prior quarter.\nAt the end of the first quarter 78% of the municipal portfolio was pre-refunded, or PSF insured.\nInvestment purchases during the first quarter were approximately 500 million and consistent about 200 million each in treasuries and mortgage backed securities respectively with the remainder being municipal.\nOur current projections only assumed that we make investment purchases of about 1.4 billion for the year, which will help us to offset a portion of our maturities and expected prepayments and calls.\nRegarding non-interest expense looking at the full year 2021, we currently expect an annual expense growth of something around the 3.5% to 4% range from our 2020 total reported non-interest expenses.\nAnd regarding the estimates for full year 2021 earnings, given our first quarter results, in our assumption of similar to improving credit metrics to those we saw in the first quarter.\nWe currently believe that the current mean of analysts' estimates of $5.42 is too low.\nSummary: ",

company's public filings and reports, which are available on the SEC or the company's corporate website.\nNow I would like to turn the conference over to Karen Colonias, Simpson's President and Chief Executive Officer.\nI'm pleased to discuss our results with you today.\nI'd like to first begin with a high level summary of our first quarter financial performance and we'll then turn to a more detailed discussion on the coronavirus pandemic, the impact it has had on our business and the actions we are taking to address this unprecedented situation.\nWe delivered a solid first quarter, operationally and financially.\nSales of $283.7 million increased 9.4% over the first quarter of 2019 and were driven by higher sales volume in North America.\nSales volumes increased primarily due to milder weather conditions in our key markets compared to a year ago which was an unusually cold and wet winter.\nSales were partially offset by weaker conditions in Europe, which was impacted by the COVID-19 beginning in mid-March.\nOur gross profit margin was strong at 45.7%, an improvement of 320 basis points year-over-year.\nThis was largely due to sales mix and decreased material costs.\nOur gross margin coupled with the relatively flat operating expenses, help generate operating income of $49.4 million, up 64.4% year-over-year and strong earnings of $0.83 per diluted share, up 66% year-over-year.\nBrian will provide additional details on our Q1 performance shortly, but now let me turn to discussion of the COVID-19.\nOur hearts go out to all of those who have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe health and safety and well-being of our employees, their families, our customers and our communities is our top priority, and is at the forefront of every decision we make.\nWe took immediate action at the onset of this crisis to enact rigorous safety protocols in all of our facilities, by improving sanitation measures, implementing mandatory social distancing, reducing on-site staff to staggered shifts and scheduled and remote working where possible and restricting visitor access to our location.\nAs of today, all of our US manufacturing facilities remain operational in accordance with the applicable shelter-in-place orders as suppliers of businesses deemed essential, including hardware stores and other building material companies.\nHowever, two of our larger European operation in the United Kingdom and France were ordered to cease nearly all operations in late March, forcing us to temporarily furlough many of those affected employees.\nWe have every intention of being able to bring those employees back to work, when the timing is right.\nOver the years, we've built a strong brand reputation with a loyal customer base and talented group of employees, and we have every intention of protecting that to ensure we can continue to service our customers, while operating in accordance with the local government regulations.\nImportantly, we have not experienced any supply chain disruptions related to the COVID-19 and have been able to meet our customer needs.\nIn the month of April, sales declined compared to March levels due to lower demand from the anticipated slowdown in housing starts and general construction activities.\nWhile this situation is highly unique and unlike any other downturn we've experienced in the past, we believe we are well positioned to emerge on the other side from a position of strength.\nIf you look back to 2008 and 2009 during the financial crisis, which was accompanied by a drastic decline in US housing starts and a simultaneous 28% drop in sales.\nYou'll see that our strong balance sheet played a major role in supporting our business through this recovery period.\nToday, our balance sheet provides us with ample liquidity to support our day-to-day operation.\nWe ended the quarter with $305.8 million in cash on hand, after drawing down $150 million on our revolving credit facility as a precautionary measure to preserve financial flexibility and ensure our working capital needs will be met in light of the current uncertainty, stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nImportantly, following the 2009 crisis, we made significant strategic changes to our business, to ensure our foundation will be even stronger in the event of a future recession.\nThese actions included diversifying our business to be less reliant on US housing starts, by making key investments in adjacent products and markets.\nMore recently, we've taken significant steps to rationalize our cost structure over the past three years in connection with our 2020 plan goals.\nWe've been able to operate more efficiently, as evidenced by our 250 basis point improvement in our total operating expenses as a percent of sales for the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019.\nGiven the level of uncertainty regarding the long-term impact of COVID-19, including market conditions and demand trends, we have proactively taken additional measures to ensure we maintain our strong financial position.\nBeginning in the second quarter, we've implemented a hiring freeze and will focus on employees retention and adjust and employee hours based on lower production levels in the near term.\nIn addition, our discretionary expenses including employee travel and spend on certain consultant-related projects have been significantly reduced, as we abide by the shelter-in-place orders throughout our operations.\nTurning to capital allocation.\nOur strategy has shifted in the recent months, focus more on cash preservation until this crisis passes.\nAs a result, we are reducing our planned capital expenditures to be used only for projects that are required for repair or maintenance or to address potential safety issues in our factories.\nIn addition, we are being highly selective in regard to inventory purchases in the current environment in line with our goal to improve our inventory balance through careful management and purchasing practices.\nThat said, you will notice inventory dollars on our balance sheet at March 31 increased compared to the level at December 31.\nThis is primarily to support the rollout of significant new customer in the second quarter of 2020.\nAbsent the impact of this new customer, our total inventory dollars and pounds on-hand, including finished goods, would have been down compared to the levels as of December 31.\nWe look forward to providing more details on this rolled out on our upcoming second quarter conference call.\nIn regard to stockholder return activities, year-to-date as of April 25, we paid over $20 million in dividends to our shareholders and repurchased more than 900,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $69.46 per share for a total of $62.7 million.\nHowever, given cash conservation is our priority in this current environment, we are suspending our share repurchase program until further notice.\nFinally, before I conclude, I'd like to highlight that we completed the final phase of the SAP implementation in our major US sales organization during the first quarter of 2020 with the successful on boarding of our Stockton manufacturing facility.\nWe now have all of our US based sales organizations transitioned over to SAP.\nAs of today, we still anticipate a companywide completion goal at the end of 2021, however, we will continue to monitor and update our timeline should stay at home orders remain in place for a prolonged period of time.\nIn summary, we are pleased that we have delivered strong first quarter results.\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic began toward the end of the first quarter, we've begun to operate in a highly difficult and unpredictable environment that has shaken our global economy.\nIn terms of our 2020 plan, while the operating environment has made it difficult to predict, with these financial targets remain achievable by the end of the fiscal 2020, we continue to execute based on the same underlying principle of focusing on operating efficiencies and cost savings to guide us through this pandemic as we move forward.\nIn a world filled with so much uncertainty, I can say that we believe our business is very well positioned to weather the current storm as a result of our focus on elements that we can control, including upholding a best-in-class customer experience and manufacturing high-quality trusted products, maintaining overall financial flexibility by ensuring we have ample liquidity and remaining conservative in our capital allocation approach with focus on cash preservation in the near-term.\nI'm pleased to discuss our first quarter financial results with you today.\nNow turning to our results.\nAs Karen highlighted, our consolidated sales were strong, increasing 9.4% to $283.7 million.\nWithin the North American segment, sales increased 12.5% to $249.1 million due to higher sales volume supported by stronger housing starts compared to the wet winter, weather conditions we experienced a year ago.\nUS housing starts grew 22% in the first quarter versus the comparable period last year, notably in the west and south where we provide a meaningful amount of content in the home starts grew 27% and 19%, respectively year-over-year.\nIn Europe, sales decreased 8.5% to $32.7 million, mainly due to lower sales volume in our concrete business.\nIn addition, first quarter sales were slightly impacted by our facilities in France and the United Kingdom which experienced government mandated restriction orders on operations in March for safety precautions in response to COVID-19.\nAs a result, these locations were operating with minimal activity to comply with the orders.\nEurope sales were further negatively impacted by $1.0 million from foreign currency translations, resulting from Europe currencies weakening against the United States dollar.\nIn local currency, Europe sales were down approximately 5.5% for the quarter.\nWood Construction products represented 86% of total sales compared to 84% and Concrete Construction products represented 14% of total sales compared to 16%.\nGross profit increased by 18% to $129.7 million, resulting in a gross margin of 45.7%.\nGross margin increased by 320 basis points, primarily due to lower material and factory and overhead costs as a percent of sales on increased production, offset partially by higher labor, warehouse and shipping costs.\nOn a segment basis, our gross margin in North America improved to 47.7% compared to 44.4%, while in Europe, our gross margin improved slightly to 32.7% compared to 32.3%.\nFrom a product perspective, our first quarter gross margin on wood products was 45.4%, compared to 42.3% in the prior year quarter, and was 42.5% for concrete products compared to 39% in the prior year quarter.\nNow let's turn to our first quarter costs and operating expenses.\nResearch and development and engineering expenses increased 9% to $13.4 million, primarily due to increased personnel costs and cash profit sharing expense.\nSelling expenses increased nearly 2% to $28.5 million, primarily due to increased personnel costs and commissions in cash profit sharing, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation and advertising and promotion expenses.\nOn a segment basis, selling expenses in North America were up 2% and in Europe they increased nearly 2%.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased 3% to $38.5 million, primarily due to decreases in professional and legal fees and stock-based compensation.\nPartially offsetting these decreases were increases in personnel costs, cash profit sharing, bad debt reserve adjustment and intangible amortization expense.\nOn a segment level, general and administrative expenses in North America decreased 5%.\nIn Europe, G&A increased by nearly 6%.\nTotal operating expenses were $80.4 million, a slight increase of $0.5 million or approximately 1%.\nAs a percentage of sales, total operating expenses were 28.3%, an improvement of 250 basis points compared to 30.8%.\nIncluded in our first quarter operating expenses were SAP implementation and support costs of $3.4 million compared to $2.4 million in the prior year quarter.\nSince the project inception, we've capitalized $19.7 million and expense $29.3 million in total, as of March 31, 2020.\nOur strong gross margins helped drive a 64% increase in consolidated income from operations to $49.4 million compared to $30 million.\nIn North America, income from operations increased 63% to $53.6 million due to higher sales and lower operating expenses.\nIn Europe, loss from operations was $1.7 million compared to a loss of $0.4 million due to lower sales and higher severance and amortization expense.\nOn a consolidated basis, our operating income margin of 17.4% increased by approximately 580 basis points.\nThe effective tax rate decreased to 21.3% from 22.5%.\nAccordingly, net income totaled $36.8 million or $0.83 per fully diluted share compared to $22.7 million or $0.50 per fully diluted share.\nNow turning to our balance sheet and cash flow.\nAt March 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents were $305.8 million, an increase of $192.4 million compared to our levels at March 31, 2019 largely due to the aforementioned decision to draw down $150 million on our revolving credit facility.\nThis action was taken as a prudent measure in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of current uncertainty, resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak.\nThe proceeds from the borrowings will be available to be used for working capital, general corporate or other purposes as permitted by the Credit Facility.\nWe have approximately $150 million of remaining borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility.\nWe generated cash flow from operations of $16.8 million for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of $7.1 million or 74%.\nWe used approximately $6.8 million for capital expenditures, which included a minimal amount for our ongoing SAP implementation project.\nWe also spent $10.2 million in dividend payments to our stockholders.\nAnd on March -- excuse me, on April 23, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share which will be payable on July 23 to stockholders of record as of July 2.\nTo date, there remains a significant amount of macroeconomic uncertainty regarding the coronavirus pandemic, including an overall lack of visibility into future market conditions, including the US housing starts, a leading indicator for a significant for a significant amount of our business.\nBased on these factors, we have chosen to withdraw our previously provided full year 2020 outlook as well as the financial targets associated with our 2020 plan.\nIn closing, we're very pleased with our first quarter results.\nWe believe our significant market share, geographic reach and diverse product offering combined with our ongoing cost saving initiatives from our 2020 plan strong balance sheet and near-term focus on cash preservation will play Simpson in a position of strength when shelter in place orders begin to be lifted.\nWe are confident in our ability to maintain our operations during this difficult time as long as we are able to continue operating as a supplier of central businesses and believe we are well positioned to support future demand trends once the COVID-19 pandemic passes.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:As a reminder, before we begin, the Company has a slide deck to accompany the earnings call this quarter.\nBecause these statements deal with future events, they are subject to various risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from the Company's current expectations.\nI'm going to pass it over to Tom to begin.\nSo, a pretty exciting quarter here for us at California Water Service Group.\nWe get to talk quite a bit about our California General Rate Case and some of the other things that are going on in the quarter.\nAnd I'm going to begin on Slide 6, which is a slide about the recognition of the 2018 California General Rate Case.\nSo, as most everyone knows at this point, on October 14, the California Public Utilities Commission published a proposed decision in our California GRC, that's a delayed GRC that should have been effective on January 1, 2020 and the proposed decision approved the settlement that we had announced back in October of 2019.\nAnd it also proposed to adopt Cal Water's positions on the disputed financial matters in the case.\nAnd for the first two quarters of the year, we had been reluctant to record regulatory assets for some of our continuing balancing account mechanisms, such as the WRAM and the MCBA decoupling mechanism, as well as our pension and medical cost balancing accounts, because those accounts we did not know whether they were probable for recovery.\nWe have concluded, based upon the proposed decision and a couple of things subsequent to that, that the GRC decision is very probable to award us those accounts on a continuing basis.\nAnd so, we are recognizing the regulatory assets associated with the water revenue adjustment mechanism, modified cost balancing account and the pension medical cost balancing account regulatory assets, and those will -- those add significantly to our revenue for the quarter and for the year-to-date.\nIn addition, the Commission will grant us interim rate recovery.\nAnd since we now know the proposed decisions take on the revenue requirement, we're able to calculate what is in the interim rate memorandum account.\nAnd so, we've also booked a regulatory asset for the interim rate memorandum account.\nI did want to talk briefly about the subsequent event that is giving us further confidence in the General Rate Case.\nAnd that is, that on Tuesday, among other things that happened on Tuesday in the United States, the the Cal PA, the Public Advocates Office issued their comments on the proposed decision.\nAnd while they gave extensive comments on a variety of areas, they did not comment on the three major areas that we're recovering here.\nIn other words, their comments do not take issue with the proposed decisions granting of a continued water revenue adjustment mechanism, modified cost balancing account or pension and medical cost balancing account.\nAnd so, we feel very strongly that the final decision, which can be rendered by the Commission no earlier than November 19, is going to allow those those balancing accounts for us.\nAnd so, that's very good news for the Company.\nIn addition to those three items, I would mention that as part of this rate case, we are refunding to customers the excess deferred tax associated with the Tax Cut Jobs Act reduction in the federal income tax rate and that refund is being applied.\nIt's applied to the customer rates and it's shown up in our income statement as a reduction to our effective tax rate.\nAnd so, you'll see a lower effective tax rate for the Company on a go-forward basis as we refund those excess deferred taxes.\nI do want to emphasize that these assessments of probability do have some risk associated with them.\nWe are dependent upon the CPUC adopting the proposed decision with no material changes.\nBut as I say, given the evidence that we have right now, we think that is likely and that's why we've gone ahead and included these in our third quarter estimates -- or rather third quarter earnings results, not estimates.\nAnd so, turning to Slide 7.\nThe result of that determination means that we have a very significant increase in our net income for the third quarter.\nThat is going from $42.4 million to $96.4 million as compared to 2019.\nEarnings per share $1.94 for the third quarter as compared to $0.88 in the third quarter of 2019.\nOn a year-to-date basis, on Slide 8, the net income is up, it's up about $30 million to -- so it's $81.3 million, up from $51.8 million in the year-to-date period of 2019.\nAnd that means, our earnings per share is $1.66 on a year-to-date basis as compared to $1.08 on a year-to-date basis in 2019.\nAnd then going through Slide 9 and Slide 10, I'll go through very quickly.\nJust the other changes that we have to earnings, revenues and expenses are pretty standard for us.\nThe things that we've talked about in prior quarters.\nSo, we have increased operating expenses for wages and other things, such as generally increased depreciation, amortization.\nWe do have variations from time to time in our unbilled revenue accruals and you'll see that on a couple of these slides as well as the mark-to-market adjustment that we have on some of our retirement plan assets.\nSo, there is nothing major either in the quarter or in the year-to-date period in those areas, but those do end up affecting earnings.\nI do want to focus very briefly on Slide 11, the earnings bridge, to emphasize the point about the third quarter earnings.\nAnd if you're there on Slide 11, you will notice the first bar change is $0.80, which is titled delayed recording of Q1 and Q2 regulatory assets.\nAnd because we're recording the effect of the General Rate Case through the third quarter, in the third quarter, that $0.80, that's in the first part, represents the earnings that would have been achieved in the first two quarters of the year had the rate case been adopted on time.\nAnd so, we're putting this -- just highlighting this for you, so that when we get to the third quarter of 2021, there is a recognition that we're probably not going to earn $1.94 again per share in the third quarter of 2021, although obviously that would be nice if we could.\nAnd then I do want to focus on Slide 13.\nI think just to run through this again as a basis of calculation for analysts and others thinking about the Company stock.\nThe earnings power of the Company, and again we're a predominantly regulated utility in all four states.\nAnd that is -- drives most of our revenues and net income.\nThe California Rate Case, if it is a docket, the proposed decision is adopted, actually allows for a specific net income about $76 million in test year 2020 and that reflects the authorized equity return on the equity portion of $1.5 billion in rate base.\nIn addition to California, we have about $110 million of rate base in other states that should earn a similar equity return, again, on a normalized test year kind of basis.\nBut do remember that our equity returns on the regulated businesses are dependent on our cost being in line with adopted costs.\nAnd also, in particular, in the other three states, in New Mexico, Washington and Hawaii, our returns are also affected by our water sales.\nAnd as Paul will talk about in a minute, beginning in 2023, we expect the earnings in California will also be affected by water sales.\nAnd another point for the quarter and the year to date is to make sure that everyone understands that on an annual basis, we do not anticipate a net income effect from changes in our unbilled revenue accruals or unrealized changes in the value of retirement assets, the mark-to-market that we talk about from time to time.\nThose factors through the third quarter, are adding about $9.6 million to our year-to-date net income.\nAnd so, just be cognizant of that as we go toward the end of the year, that we expect particularly the unbilled to drop back down to where it was at the end of 2019.\nAnd then finally, there are a couple of other factors that cause our earnings to be a bit higher than the otherwise core regulated earnings, and those are unregulated activities, operation maintenance contracts, the antenna leases for various things -- various cellular antennas on our facilities, the regulatory asset that we book associated with the equity portion of construction funding, the AFUDC if you will, and then state tax timing differences can play a factor there.\nAnd so, just wanted everybody to be aware of that, happy to take questions on that as well.\nI want to give everyone a quick operational update with the backdrop of COVID-19.\nBut even with COVID-19, it was the worst fire season in California history.\nSo, in addition to COVID, we had to deal with a number of fires and then folding in the public safety power shut downs that we had throughout the state at various times during the state, as well as a couple of earthquakes, it's been a very, very busy year for operations.\nWe've opened our emergency operations center and totaled 18 times year-to-date.\nI think that's a new record for us.\nThe EOC, or emergency operation centers, we basically follow a FEMA type protocol in terms of how we deal with emergency situations.\nAnd very happy to say that, despite dealing with a number of potential emergencies throughout the year, the Company's operations have gone very, very well and we avoided having any major disruptions of water service or lack of water service, especially during fire season.\nHaving said that, we still continue to operate with enhanced safety protocols to protect customers and employees from infections.\nProtecting employees and customers and public health remains our number one priority.\nVery happy to share with everyone, and you may have seen this, we received the Stevie Award, the Silver Stevie Award as Most Valuable Employer for COVID Response.\nThat was out of 700-plus companies competing for a Stevie Award.\nSo we're very happy to win that award for our work on the COVID response and keeping our employees safe.\nWhile dealing with the pandemic, we've seen an increase in customer accounts aging from the suspension of collection activities.\nIf you recall, early on in the process, Cal Water suspended our collections and shut-offs, and it was further ordered by the governor [Phonetic] to do so, but we had done it prior to any orders of the government, because we recognize the need for water for our customers to help fight the virus.\nSo, our over 90 balances has increased to about $5.4 million.\nOnly a portion of such amounts are typically uncollectible.\nWe continue to monitor that very, very closely.\nWe think it's indicative of the hard financial times as the pandemic has hit people, and people have been ordered to shelter in place, and maybe have been on some type of assistance program and not able to meet their ability to pay their bills.\nWe've increased our reserve for doubtful accounts by about $1.6 million to $2.7 million, roughly 50% of that balance is reserved for, and we'll continue to monitor that as we move into the four quarter.\nOur incremental expenses dealing with the COVID were less than $100,000 in the third quarter, which we think is good.\nWe do have a memo account in California and also a memo type account in Hawaii.\nAnd as most of you know, a memo account, you expense the cost in the right -- in the period it's incurred, but you track it kind of off the books.\nAnd when it gets to be a certain amount, you potentially have the ability to go back to the Commission and seek recovery for those costs as they are incremental to what was planned in the business model.\nSo, we continue to track costs on our memo accounts associated with COVID in our operations.\nWater sales, in aggregate, have been closer to the adopted levels, or about 95% of adopted sales in California, with the increases in customer usage, obviously, with people being home, using more water and that was offset by lower business in industrial uses during the quarter.\nIn terms of liquidity.\nOur liquidity remains strong.\nAs of September 30, we had $113 million in cash and additional current capacity of $170 million through a line of credit.\nSo, liquidity has remained strong with the Company throughout the pandemic, and we're positioned very well going into the fourth quarter.\nSo turning to Slide 15, is the California regulatory update.\nIt has been a very busy year for Cal Water on the regulatory front.\nAs Tom mentioned, the Company received a proposed decision in October and then the PD, or the proposed decision, the Commission established a new revenue requirement for Cal Water of $698.7 million for test year 2020.\nIn the proposed decision, it also authorized $828 million of new capital expenditures or new capital investments across the three years of the rate case cycle.\nNow, we filed a settlement agreement as a part of this rate case and the settlement agreement that we filed resolved the majority of the issues in the General Rate Case.\nHowever, there were 11 items, 11 litigated items, litigated financial items, which were not part of the settlement agreement that we filed with the Commission.\nIn the proposed decision, the judge agreed with Cal Water's position on all 11 of the litigated financial items.\nThey were ruled in our favor by the administrative law judge and these included: The continuation of the water revenue adjustment mechanism, WRAM/MCBA; a continuation of the sales reconciliation mechanism, or SRM; the continuation of the pension and healthcare balancing accounts, inclusion of an equity component in our AFUDC calculation; an approval of capital projects for AMI, or advanced meter infrastructure; and for some water quality or water treatment projects down in the Los Angeles area.\nThe Commission is set to rule on the proposed decision, at earliest on its November 19 open meeting.\nI will also note on Slide 15 that Cal Water along with the other parties have filed a request for rehearing on the August 27 decision by the Commission, which bars Cal Water and others from continuing to use the WRAM/MCBA, beginning, in our case, in our 2021 Rate Case filing, which will be effective in 2023.\n2021 as I said -- our 2020 has been a busy year.\n2021 will also be a busy year, because, as I just mentioned, we will be filing our 2021 Rate Case next spring and we will also be filing our cost of capital case next spring.\nSo we -- our regulatory team will be very busy next year, putting all of those together.\nAnd I'm going to give a quick update on the capital investment program for 2020.\nCapital investments for the third quarter were $84.7 million, up 16% over the same period last year.\nYear-to-date, our capital investments are $221.3 million, up $13.5 million year-to-date over 2019.\nThe Company has previously estimated, we'd spend between $260 million and $290 million.\nWe think we're in good shape going into the fourth quarter to achieve our capital investment program goals for this year, despite what has been really a challenging operating environment.\nIn addition, we announced on October 13, that we had completed and put into service our Palos Verdes Water Reliability Project, which is the largest project in the Company's history, just shy of $100 million project, to bring redundancy to the PV Peninsula down in Southern California, so it's nice to have that wrapped up.\nThe team did a fantastic job, again, working in difficult operating environments to get that project wrapped up this year.\nHot off the press yesterday.\nThe CPUC adopted a decision granting Cal Water's request for an additional $700 million of additional financing authority, which is expected to be used to help finance the Company's capital program through 2025 or later.\nSo, this will allow us to go out and raise an additional $700 million of debt or equity to finance our capital growth program in the next five years.\nSo, that was good news as well.\nOne of the areas that we've been super busy and frankly, or probably, the busiest in business development that we've been probably in the last 20 years as BD, and so Paul is going to give us an update on what's been happening on the business development side.\nOn Slide 17, I have an update for our business development efforts.\nCal Water is continuing a very strong new business development process and has had a lot of success this year.\nYear-to-date, our new development efforts have put over 25,000 new customer connections under contract.\nRepresenting over a 5% growth in new customer connections across the Company's subsidiaries.\nSo far, in 2020, the Company has closed on two acquisitions, the Rainier View Water system in Washington and the Kalaeloa Water and Sewer system in Hawaii.\nAnd, we have entered into contracts for acquisitions of the Animas Valley Water Company in New Mexico and the Gunner Ranch Sewer system in California, which are both subject to regulatory approval.\nOn the regulatory approval side, we are still undergoing regulatory review on two other acquisitions, that being the Kapalua Water and Sewer Company in Hawaii and the The Preserve at Millerton Water and Sewer in California.\nIn summary, our business development efforts are strong, as you can see from this matrix, and our pipeline of potential deals is robust.\nAnd I will turn that back over to Tom.\nSo, I'll just spend a couple of seconds going over our next two slides, which are the traditional bar charts showing our capex and rate base.\nA little bit more certainty on these two charts than in the past.\nObviously, as Marty and Paul mentioned, the capex authorized by the Commission is getting closer to realization.\nWe do have the midpoint of our target of $275 million for capex, that's very achievable here in 2020 and how much we've done so far.\nIf you flip to the estimated regulated rate base, we have updated this chart to reflect the proposed decision rate base in California.\nAnd then add the rate base that I mentioned earlier in the call from the other states.\nSo we estimate that our rate base in 2020 after the CPUC adopts -- assuming they adopt the proposed decision and the settlement, the California and other state regulated rate base is going to be about $1.6 billion.\nThat does not include the Palos Verdes pipeline project.\nAs Marty mentioned, that was close to $100 million.\nThat is one of these advice letter projects.\nWe expect that to be included in rates pretty close to the start of the year in 2021 or maybe even a little bit before that, depending upon the timing as it flows through the rate case process here in California.\nSo, that will be almost two-thirds of the advice letter rate base that we show on this chart.\nSo, I do want to emphasize though that 2021 and 2022, our rate bases in California are subject to the earnings test.\nWe haven't been talking -- we didn't have an earnings test this year because of the rate case test year.\nBut two out of every three years, we do have an earnings test that looks at the progress we've made on our capital investments and the effective rate of return before it grants us additional rates in the districts in California.\nSo, I think we'll have an update on that, by the time we get to the year-end call and what that increment will add to 2021.\nSo, what's shown in 2021 here is the authorized rate base if we were to pass all of those earnings tests.\nAnd so, that is what it is there.\nIt's been a real busy couple of weeks since we got the PD to figure all this out and get everything booked and work with our independent registered Certified Public Accountants, Deloitte & Touche.\nI know you worked a lot of hours to get this stuff booked.\nIt's great to have the 2018 General Rate Case close to being ramped up and getting that done.\nIt was disappointing for us that it was so late, but it's nice to have it done and allowing us to kind of move forward.\nAnd we've already been working on our 2021 General Rate Case, as Paul mentioned.\nAs we move into the last six weeks of what has truly been a disruptive year, maybe the biggest disruptive year anyone in our generation has ever experienced.\nCal Water has continued to be well positioned with the execution of our business plan, including our business development growth plans, and our dividend growth plans and our capital investment programs.\nMost importantly, is our safety program that has allowed us to continue our operations.\n91% of our employees have been at work every single day.\nMost of our employees are our assets are in the field and they've been on the job every single day with COVID, which required us to adopt a lot of very tight COVID protocols to protect them.\nSo, we figure we're executing well, we're positioned really well.\nAnd I thought, in a year that's just hasn't had a lot of really good news, I want to close with something that I think is fairly significant.\nIn late September, the legislature in the state of California passed a bill that we've been working on to help us address some of our concerns regarding wildfire liability.\nSenate Bill 1386, which is the bill, which is now law after being signed by Governor Newsom, specifies that fire hydrants connected to public water systems are generally not designed or installed to provide water service to aid in the extinguishing of fires that threaten property not served by a water service provider or wildfires.\nThe government affairs team worked very hard with California lawmakers to get this law put into place.\nAnd we believe this is another significant milestone to further differentiate our risk profile from the profiles of the electric and gas utilities in the state of California.\nSo, it's a big step in the right direction, kudos for the team for getting that done.\nAnd Brigette, with that, we're going to open it up for Q&A, please.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Earlier today, we published our second quarter 2021 results.\nA copy of the release is available on our website at oshkoshcorp.com.\nOur presenters today include John Pfeifer, President and Chief Executive Officer and Mike Pat, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nWe're happy to announce outstanding second quarter results, highlighted by sales of $1.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.48, both of which exceeded the prior year and our expectations.\nDemand across the company and particularly in our Access Equipment segment has come back stronger and faster than we expected as a result of positive vaccination progress and the confidence that, that brings to the marketplace.\nOur production rates are back to pre-pandemic levels across the company and our 14,000 dedicated team members continue to do an exceptional job of rapidly adapting to changing situations as we recover from the pandemic.\nCompanies across the globe are facing significant supply chain challenges as the economy rebounds, including a global semiconductor shortage, record high steel prices and resin shortages from the deep freeze in Texas back in February.\nOur supply chain team members and third-party suppliers have worked hard to maintain production, but supply chain disruptions will likely remain a risk, we will continue to manage for the duration of 2021.\nIn addition to our strong second quarter performance, we received some great news on February 23, when we were notified that we won the Next Generation Delivery Vehicle program with the United States Postal Service.\nI am very proud of the efforts of our team over the past several years that culminated in this historic win, which supports President Biden's goal to electrify the federal fleet with zero-emission vehicles and create new sustainable manufacturing jobs in America.\nOur Defense segment will supply the Postal Service with as many zero-emission battery electric vehicles or BEV units that they desire as they upgrade their fleet to be increasingly sustainable.\nThis award is the latest accomplishment in our 25 years of continuous innovation in electric drive and BEV engineering.\nI will discuss this exciting contract win in more detail a little later.\nWe are also proud to be included in the S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook once again in 2021.\nThe inclusion in the yearbook highlights top 15 performance for Oshkosh in our industry category and underscores our commitment to creating a more sustainable future and culture that is centered on a safe and inclusive workplace.\nAdditionally, we have pledged to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption as we continue to make investments in technology, including the development of battery electric products in all of our businesses.\nI am also pleased to announce our expectations for 2021, adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.35 to $6.85 as we return to our practice of providing quantitative guidance.\nMike will share more details in his section.\nThe improvements we started to see in our markets back in December and January, following positive vaccine news, rapidly accelerated over the past few months and helped drive the strong performance we are reporting today.\nRevenue increased by 6.5% over the prior year, leading to a solid adjusted operating margin of over 11%.\nWe previously expected a return to growth in the second half of the year, so we are pleased to be ahead of schedule.\nThese strong results would not be possible without the access team's disciplined execution through the pandemic, which has enabled the business to quickly respond to changing customer demand, particularly in North America.\nOrders were also strong, leading to a solid backlog of $1.5 billion for this segment, up 80% versus last year.\nSince most forecasts project nonresidential construction to be down in 2021, we have -- we believe replacement demand is driving access equipment sales growth.\nAs we've discussed for the past several quarters, fleet ages are elevated throughout the North American market, and we believe the need to replace these aged fleets will be a significant driver for new equipment sales in the coming quarters.\nWe are further encouraged that demand has returned for a broad cross-section of customers, not just the largest and most visible rental companies.\nThis is important as we believe it signals a healthy and robust market.\nAs we noted on the last earnings call, JLG's U.S. production facilities returned to full production levels in March.\nWhile the threat of absenteeism in our operations has significantly decreased due to lower COVID infectivity rates and robust contact tracing, we are closely managing supply chain challenges that could impact production in the second half of the year.\nAs part of the coalition of American Manufacturers of Mobile Access Equipment, we also took action during the quarter against some unfair competition practices by foreign companies in the United States.\nWe believe this is good for the long-term health of the industry.\nSteel prices remain at record highs, and we took further actions during the quarter to mitigate the risk, including additional cost locks on portions of our planned steel purchases as well as price increases for new units ordered beginning in early March.\nMuch like we experienced in 2018 when steel costs increased significantly, there will be a lag in the benefit until we work through orders that were in our backlog prior to the price increase.\nI'd also like to share some good news on our Tianjin China facility.\nConstruction is largely complete for our expanded operations, and we expect to begin shipping product out of the new capacity later this year.\nThis is an important step in our long-term strategy to drive profitable growth in China and other Asian markets.\nWe're proud to be the supplier of the next-generation delivery vehicles for the United States Postal Service.\nRecall that this competition has been a rigorous five-year process and our world-class engineers really stepped up to the challenge to provide the postal service with a vehicle that meets or exceeds all of their current and future needs.\nThe program covers the purchase of 50,000 to 165,000 units over 10 years as part of the postal services plan to significantly modernize their delivery fleet with improved safety, reliability, sustainability, cost efficiency and a much better working experience for our nation's postal carriers.\nOur offering provides the postal service with both zero-emission BEV units and fuel-efficient, low-emission ICE units with the option of delivering any combination up to 100% of either model.\nThe vehicle design also provides the postal service with the flexibility of converting ICE units to BEV units in the future.\nWe expect to begin delivering production vehicles in the second half of calendar 2023.\nWe are also pleased with the progress of integrating Pratt Miller into the company, following the close of the acquisition in January.\nWe look forward to leveraging their speed, agility and expertise as we intensify our innovation focus across the company.\nOur operations team at Defense continues to work hard to deliver the JLTVs, FMTVs and FHTVs that support our U.S. armed forces.\nDuring the quarter, we established a new production line for a portion of our volume.\nThe new production line incorporates industry-leading technology to further optimize the manufacturing process.\nWe did experience higher onetime costs and onetime inefficiencies during the quarter as part of the move, which supports the long-term success of the segment.\nBefore we leave the Defense segment, I'm pleased to announce that the National Advanced Mobility Consortium has selected Oshkosh Defense and our partner, ST Engineering, to participate in the prototype phase for the U.S. Army's cold weather all-terrain vehicle, or CATV.\nThe CATV is a new program for tracked vehicles that operate in arctic conditions and are designed to replace the small unit support vehicles that have been in service since the early 1980s.\nWe believe the program represents another solid opportunity in an adjacent product space for our defense business.\nThe Fire & Emergency segment delivered another quarter of outstanding performance with both strong sales growth and an operating income margin over 15%.\nLast year, we faced a significant supplier challenge, combined with customer final inspection limitations as the pandemic struck, but the team recovered quickly and continues to deliver industry-leading performance.\nWe've also moved past concerns we had discussed surrounding absenteeism, and our operations have returned to pre-COVID levels.\nWe often talk about the strength and capabilities of our strong Pierce dealer network.\nDespite the pandemic, our dealers have continued to increase investments in their sales and service networks, demonstrating their commitment to customers.\nWe believe this is the type of commitment that ensures sustainable success going forward.\nThe segment finished the quarter with another solid backlog of $1.3 billion, basically on par with last year's all-time record.\nOrders in the quarter were lower year-over-year as we expected, largely due to the pandemic-related impacts.\nAs we've said previously, we will monitor municipal budgets, and we believe that the North American fire truck market will decline modestly over the next few quarters as a result of the pandemic.\nHowever, we don't believe this will be much of an impact on the long-term success story that we are building with our Fire & Emergency business.\nAnd as Mike will discuss, our outlook for this business in 2021 is strong.\nOur Commercial segment delivered a solid quarter with higher operating income on lower sales.\nOur simplification and innovation strategy in this segment is working, which gives us confidence that margins can continue to improve over the long term.\nDuring the quarter, we continue to make excellent progress on our focused factory approach of transitioning mixer production to London, Ontario.\nI want to commend the team on their efforts as it hasn't been easy due to cross-border travel restrictions with Canada as a result of COVID.\nWe are also making great progress in building a high flow refuse collection vehicle line in Dodge Center, Minnesota, leveraging the space freed up from the move of mixers.\nThis modernization and automation investment brings added capacity and efficiencies as part of our strategy.\nMoving to our markets, we are seeing solid recovery in order activity for mixers and refuse collection vehicles as business improves as we move beyond the pandemic.\nWe believe the reopening of the U.S. is driving increased refuse collection, and construction is picking back up again, as evidenced by our higher year-over-year backlog.\nWe believe these trends will continue as we work through 2021.\nAs you might expect, supply chains also pose risks in the Commercial segment.\nFor instance, the availability of third-party chassis from truck manufacturers as a result of semiconductor and other component shortages is an issue that we are managing closely, and it could have some impact on our deliveries in the back half of 2021.\nOur supply chain teams are doing a great job of responding to these challenges and keeping our production lines running, and we are staying vigilant.\nWe remain on track to deliver the electric refuse collection vehicles we talked about last quarter to our customer in Boise.\nThese units will provide valuable insights on opportunities and challenges when BEVs are used on a daily basis for refuse collection.\nThe development of these products is part of our long-term electrification journey across the company that we believe will generate significant benefits for our customers and the environment.\nThis wraps it up for our business segments.\nWe delivered a strong quarter that well exceeded our expectations.\nAs the quarter unfolded, demand increased sharply in the Access Equipment segment, leading to consolidated sales of $1.9 billion, $92 million higher than the prior year and approximately $140 million above our expectations.\nThe growth over the prior year was driven by a 29% increase in Fire & Emergency sales and a 6.5% increase in Access Equipment sales, offset in part by a modest sales decrease in the Defense segment.\nAccess Equipment sales increased due to improved market demand in Asia and North America.\nLast year, demand was negatively impacted late in the second quarter as the COVID-19 pandemic drove shelter-in-place restrictions around much of the globe.\nDefense sales decreased in the quarter due to lower FMTV sales and lower cumulative catch-up adjustments as we received FHTV and JLTV contract awards in the second quarter last year, offset in part by higher FHTV sales and Pratt Miller sales for a portion of the quarter following its acquisition in January.\nFire & Emergency sales increased as a result of both higher fire truck and ARFF vehicle sales.\nIn the prior year, fire truck sales were negatively impacted by the combined effects of COVID-19-related customer travel restrictions and a supplier quality issue that impacted our truck delivery schedules.\nOur sales benefited from the delivery of vehicles under two multiunit contracts in the current year quarter.\nAnd Commercial segment sales were down primarily due to lower refuse collection vehicle demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of divesting our concrete batch plant business in the fourth quarter of 2020, offset in part by an increase in concrete mixer volume.\nFront discharge concrete mixer sales were muted in the prior year as the new S-Series 2.0 was still ramping up.\nConsolidated adjusted operating income for the second quarter was $143.3 million or 7.6% of sales compared to $133.6 million or 7.4% of sales in the prior year quarter.\nAccess Equipment adjusted operating income increased as a result of higher sales volume, lower spending as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and improved product mix, offset in part by higher incentive compensation expense.\nDefense adjusted operating income decreased as a result of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments as well as costs and labor inefficiencies associated with the start-up of the new manufacturing line during the quarter.\nFire & Emergency operating income increased in the current year quarter, primarily as a result of the increased sales volume, favorable price cost dynamics, improved product mix and improved manufacturing performance.\nAnd Commercial segment operating income increased due to lower product liability costs, lower spending as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and lower warranty costs.\nAdjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.48 compared to adjusted earnings per share of $1.25 in the prior year.\nWe are pleased with our solid performance in the first half of 2021 as well as the improved visibility we have for the second half of the year, which has positioned us to once again provide quantitative expectations.\nWe have solid backlogs in all four segments and have seen a significant reduction in COVID-19-related absenteeism.\nAs John said, we faced supply chain risk for the remainder of the year, just like most companies around the globe.\nOur supply chain teams have done an outstanding job of keeping our manufacturing lines running.\nHowever, it is possible that supplier shortages could interrupt production in the back half of the year.\nOur expectations that follow assume no major production interruptions as a result of supply chain shortages.\nOn a consolidated basis, we are estimating sales of $7.75 billion to $7.95 billion compared to $6.9 billion in 2020.\nWe are also estimating adjusted operating income of $610 million to $655 million compared to $496 million in the prior year and adjusted earnings per share of $6.35 to $6.85 compared to adjusted earnings per share of $4.94 in 2020.\nAt the segment level, we are estimating access equipment sales of $3.15 billion to $3.35 billion, a 25% to 33% increase compared to 2020.\nWe expect growth to be led by North America, although we expect sales growth in most regions as the world comes out of the pandemic.\nWe are estimating that access equipment adjusted operating margin will be 10.5% to 11.25%, included in our expectations is an approximately $30 million net headwind from elevated steel prices that we expect will primarily impact the fourth quarter.\nWe believe the headwind will decrease in 2022, as we begin to more fully realize the benefit of pricing actions implemented in the second quarter.\nThe full year impact of last year's temporary cost reductions returning to our expected run rate this year has declined versus prior expectations due to lower spending in the first half of the year as travel, trade shows and other discretionary spending have returned slower than anticipated.\nTurning to Defense, we're estimating 2021 sales of approximately $2.5 billion, an 8% increase compared to 2020.\nThis estimate includes increased JLTV production and the benefit of Pratt Miller sales.\nBacklog remains robust at $3.5 billion, providing solid visibility into 2022.\nWe are estimating our defense operating margins will be approximately 8%, consistent with our comments over the past several years of high single-digit operating margin percentages.\nThis estimate reflects higher new product development spending, manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the start of the new production line and lower cumulative catch-up adjustments compared to 2020.\nWe expect Fire & Emergency segment sales will be approximately $1.2 billion, roughly $90 million higher than 2020.\nThe increase in revenue is primarily due to a return to more normal production and customer deliveries as interruptions due to COVID-19 decline.\nWe expect operating margin in the Fire & Emergency segment to increase to approximately 14% as a result of increased sales volume.\nWe are estimating sales of approximately $925 million in the Commercial segment, down slightly from 2020 as a result of the prior year scale of the concrete batch plant business.\nAnd we are expecting operating margins for this segment of approximately 7%.\nMargins will be impacted the second half of the year in this segment as a result of the rapid increase in steel costs as well as disruption in the supply of third-party chassis.\nSimilar to access equipment, we expect this unfavorable impact to wane as we begin to realize the benefits of price increases in early 2020 June.\nWe estimate corporate expenses will be $150 million to $155 million, an increase of $25 million to $30 million as a result of the return of higher incentive compensation levels.\nWe estimate the tax rate for 2021 will be approximately 22%, and we are estimating an average share count of 69.3 million shares.\nFor the full year, we are estimating free cash flow of approximately $650 million, reflecting an expected strong year of cash generation.\nWe also estimate capital expenditures will be approximately $120 million.\nLooking at the third quarter, we expect consolidated sales to be up approximately 40% over the prior year, with access equipment and defense up most significantly.\nWe expect commercial sales to be up high single digits as our markets rebound, and Fire & Emergency sales are expected to be essentially flat.\nLast year, we benefited from approximately $60 million of temporary cost benefits in the third quarter.\nThis will be a headwind to incremental margins during the quarter as our spending begins to return to more typical levels in the third quarter this year with increased business activity.\nWe just announced a great quarter, and we have a strong outlook for the remainder of the year with expected growth in revenue, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share compared to 2020.\nWe expect to exit the year in a strong position as we look forward to the next several years.\nSupply challenges remain, but we believe we are in a great position to take advantage of the many opportunities open to us through the recovery as we continue to innovate, serve our customers and advance our company going forward.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:With me on the call today is Intrepid's co-founder, executive chairman, president and CEO, Bob Jornayvaz.\nThese statements are based on the information available to us today, and we assume no obligation to update them.\nThese risks and uncertainties are described in our periodic reports filed with the SEC, which are incorporated here by reference.\nDuring today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial and operational measures.\nSolid cash flow and EBITDA highlighted our fourth quarter and put a positive end on a unique year.\nThe encouraging trends we saw emerging in the fourth quarter are continuing into spring as commodity markets show strength across both our fertilizer and oilfield segments.\nThe last couple of months, we have seen gradual yet sustained improvements in our ability to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, we are optimistic that the good news will continue as cities begin to relax restrictions now that significant portions of our most vulnerable populations are protected.\nWe wish the world well.\nOur nutrient business ended the year with significant momentum and hasn't slowed down in the first quarter.\nWe called the bottom in the potash market on our November earnings call and recent pricing and demand has exceeded our expectations.\nWe announced another potash price increase in February, up $50 per ton, increasing our posted potash prices $140 per ton above summer fill levels.\nTrio has also seen strong demand and has currently posted $60 per ton higher than the summer fill values.\nCustomers have been eager to secure product as prices continue to move up and have locked in some volumes through second quarter with additional spot buying occurring throughout the spring and farmers who are eager to replenish nutrients at today's crop prices.\nStrong commodity pricing in soybeans, corn, wheat, palm oil, sugar, cotton and bottoms in the cocoa market in the coffee market, all in strength to a continuing global demand.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we continue to position ourselves to capitalize on the return of the oilfield demand in the Delaware Basin, leading ESG initiatives with a clear emphasis on full cycle water management.\nFull cycle water management means minimizing traditional source water use and produced water disposal with environmentally friendly treated produced water recycling.\nWith environmental and sustainability goals, front and center for so many oil and gas management teams, regulatory bodies and governments, the need for responsible and innovative use and reuse of water is the key to capturing the full potential of the Delaware Basin.\nIntrepid is uniquely positioned with its variety of assets and water rights in Southeast New Mexico, to become a leader in the space, touching every aspect of the market from fresh and brine water delivery to recycled and produced water handling and disposal.\nWe are in the early stages of construction of a produced water disposal system adjacent to our South Ranch and should have our first produced water well drilled in the first half of this year.\nAs we finalize our capital plans, we are also working on minimum volume commitments with operators that will provide a solid base of demand to support our investments.\nWe expect to produce water well will cost approximately $2 million and will complete incremental capital for the surface facility at the appropriate time.\nTotal capital for our first well and surface facilities is estimated at $7 million.\nWe expect additional wells can be added as demand and volume commitments require at a cost of approximately $2 million each.\nIn addition to produced water, we're investing in recycling infrastructure and expanding our capabilities to deliver the services and products necessary to operate in an increasingly ES&G focused environment.\nWe are currently in talks with multiple companies about partnering in new and exciting areas of oilfield and full cycle water management business that will leverage our unique position and inherent optionality of our Intrepid freshwater and brine water assets across the Northern Delaware Basin.\nThe Northern Delaware is full of long-term-focused, well capitalized operators, and we are seeing many of these operators revisit their expectations for 2021 as oil prices have improved significantly in recent months.\nFrac demand is increasing and source water demands per completion are higher than ever.\nDuring the first quarter, we sourced water from third parties had positive margins to supplement our own water rights and existing infrastructure to meet the increasing volume requirements of operators.\nOur strong relationships with those operators and our ability to meet significant refresh rights sets us apart from many other source water providers in the Delaware Basin.\nThe next few quarters are pivotal for Intrepid, as we will execute on our strategy to expand our oil and gas midstream business in the Delaware Basin and tap into the significant opportunity that full cycle water management offers.\nProper water management and the ability to provide operators with a single source capable of meeting both their operating and ESG goals will be essential in unlocking the potential value of this business over the coming months.\nOur fourth quarter was highlighted by strong improvements in earnings and EBITDA compared to the third quarter as good fertilizer fundamentals and an improving oilfield outlook drove increased gross margin across all our business segments.\nWe recorded fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $9.7 million, an increase of over $8 million compared to the third quarter of 2020.\nAs Bob noted, the potash market really took off in the fourth quarter with three announced price increases, good weather across the country and rising commodity prices.\nCustomers look to replenish potash inventories after a strong fall application season that was evidenced by the 78,000 tons of potash sold in the quarter up significantly from the prior year.\nLooking toward 2021, we still expect first half potash volumes to exceed prior year by about 5% to 10% despite the large volumes in the fourth quarter.\nAverage net realized sales price will continue to increase into the second quarter as we've layered in ag sales at varying price levels throughout the spring.\nWe have fully realized the fourth quarter price increases in our second quarter volumes and expect some additional spot tons at our current pricing.\nAll said, we expect our net realized pricing to increase from $248 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2020 to 300 to $310 per ton for the second quarter of 2021, with the first-quarter net realized sales price about halfway between the two.\nGoing forward, we continue to focus significant effort on expanding our specialty potash sales, specifically into the premium armory and feed markets, areas where we saw significant growth in 2020.\nFor the trio segment, our domestic market saw great early season demand in the fourth quarter as we continue to grow sales in key markets throughout the U.S., total fourth quarter sales volumes were down slightly compared to last year.\nDue to large international sales in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nOur posted price is now up $60 per ton compared to the summer fill levels, and we are seeing good subscription at current pricing into the spring.\nWe expect our net realized sales price will increase to approximately 220 to $230 per ton in the first quarter and 230 to $240 per ton in the second quarter of 2021.\nThe oilfield segment improved significantly over Q3 as water sales increased from our higher-margin sources and contracts, benefiting the bottom line.\nTotal water sales, including byproducts, were $5.8 million in Q4 an increase of $2.2 million compared to the third quarter of 2020.\nOperators are adding more crews than they expected just a few months ago and commodity pricing is clearly supportive of the world-class reserves in the Northern Delaware Basin.\nOur debt position is unchanged since the third quarter with $55 million outstanding, of which $10 million relates to the PPP loan.\nOur forgiveness application is being reviewed by the SBA with our 90-day review period ending in April.\nAvailability under our credit facility was $20 million at year-end.\nCash flow from operations was $12.7 million in the fourth quarter and $31 million for the full year.\n2020 capital investment ended the year at $16.4 million.\nWe estimate 2021 capital investment of 25 to 35 million, of which 12 to 15 million will be sustaining capital with the remainder as potential opportunity capital projects.\nWe have significant discretion over our opportunity capital investments in 2021, and we may adjust our investment plans as our expectations for 2021 change.\nWith a strong early start to the spring season, our cash position today is $28 million with no change in our outstanding debt from year-end.\nOperator, we're ready to take questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Joining me on the call today are Arsen Kitch, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Murphy, Chief Financial Officer.\nFinancial results for the third quarter 2020 were released shortly after today's market close.\nOn a consolidated basis, the company reported net sales for the third quarter of $457 million and adjusted EBITDA of $77 million, which represents growth of approximately 3% and 145% respectively over the third quarter of last year.\nA few business highlights to mention.\nOur tissue business drove results with both higher sales and production volumes, to meet elevated demand.\nLower input costs, particularly in pulp were also a tailwind on a year-over-year basis.\nOur service levels in tissue started to recover to pre-COVID levels, as we continued to work with customers to fulfill orders and replenish inventory levels.\nOur paperboard business continue to deliver stable performance, managing through uneven end-market segments with solid execution.\nOur current backlogs are in line with previous years and we successfully launched ReMagine folding carton brand, offering recycled content in SBS Board.\nIn the third quarter, we used the free cash flows generated to reduce our net debt by an additional $40 million and we refinanced our 2023 notes with a new 2028 notes.\nOn slide four as I noted, these last two quarters, we remain focused on our top priorities during COVID, the health and safety of our employees and safely operating our assets to service our customers.\nWe continue to operate with appropriate safeguards against COVID, including temperature checks, quarantine protocols, sanitation practices, social distancing guidelines, face covering requirements, remote work, travel restrictions and enhanced benefits.\nOur human resources and manufacturing leadership teams are doing an exceptional job of proactively monitoring the health of our workforce and ensuring that we have the proper staffing levels in place.\nOur efforts and risk mitigation strategies are making a difference in helping to reduce the risk of COVID at our sites.\nI would like to express my deepest gratitude to all of our people for their extraordinary efforts and perseverance through these challenging times.\nI will now share what we saw from both the tissue and paperboard businesses in the third quarter.\nLet's start with our Consumer Products division on slide five.\nAs we have previously noted, at-home tissue demand remained elevated during the quarter.\nWe continue to believe that this is being driven by the shift from away from home to at-home consumption, as many people continue to work and learn from home.\nWe noted on our previous earning call that because of these consumption changes, we were seeing retail sales per IRI panel data stabilize at above pre-COVID levels.\nIn the third quarter that resulted in low double-digit retail sales growth relative to the 2019 quarter.\nWe expect that year-over-year increase had continued to moderate as retailers replenished their inventories, consumers de-stocked their pantries and people adjust to living with the pandemic.\nOur industry view remains largely the same, so I will summarize in a few key points to provide some context.\nFirst, recall that the market for tissue in the US is traditionally two-third at-home and one-third away-from-home.\nMany states economies began to reopen, which we believe drove some of the normalization and demand in the third quarter.\nWe expect continued uncertainty associated with these reopening and travel patterns, making it challenging to predict demand drivers for these end markets during the next few quarters.\nIt is also difficult to predict what a new normal might look like as the pandemic eventually subsides.\nSecond, while it is too early to discern trends on branded share relative to private branded share.\nWe are noticing the paper towel demand is tracking ahead of the overall tissue category while facial demand is lagging.\nWe will continue to monitor these trends in the coming months and quarters due to the continued uncertainty in consumer demand associated with COVID.\nThird, as we noted last quarter, SKU rationalization has occurred, creating additional production.\nWe believe that lower SKU counts benefit both retailers and manufacturers like us.\nWhile we have seen some customers desiring a recovery of SKUs, we do not anticipate SKU counts to go back to pre-COVID levels in the near to medium term.\nOur tissue results in the third quarter were robust.\nWe shipped 14.5 million cases, which was up around 10% compared to the third quarter of 2019, but down 9% over the second quarter of 2020, as expected.\nWe continue to execute for our customers and are pleased with production efficiency and fixed cost leverage achieved.\nWe have largely replenished inventories throughout the supply chain and are seeing in-stock conditions improve.\nIn addition, to meet peak demand during the pandemic, we believe that some of our customers need short-term commitments to alternative suppliers and tertiary brands to meet demand, including imported products.\nAs a result, we believe that these customers have greater than normal inventory levels in several product categories that they are now working to reduce.\nWe have also adjusted our sales and customer mix over the last six months to better position our business for growth in a long-run.\nThat has led us to exit several customers to reduce complexity and improve our network.\nWhile we have a robust pipeline of new business for next year, these strategic moves are expected to have a volume drag in the next couple of quarters.\nMike will further address the impact of these trends on our businesses and financial outlook section of our discussion.\nAs you recall, we estimate that approximately two-thirds of paperboard demand is derived from products that are more recession-resilient and one-third is driven by more economically sensitive or discretionary products.\nOur business including customer demand has been stable despite economic uncertainties.\nOur folding carton customers, especially those with exposure to food and healthcare packaging continue to see strong demand and our foodservice customers, especially those with exposure to quick service restaurants and away-from-home dining, as well as commercial printers continue to see weaker demand.\nOur exposure to diverse end-market segments helped provide stability for our order book in the quarter.\nWe did not have a planned major maintenance outage in the third quarter of 2020 like we did in 2019, which drove improved operations.\nOur current sales backlogs are consistent with previous years, indicating stable demand.\nWhile we're encouraged by our solid performance in the quarter, we're navigating through some uncertain market conditions.\nOn our last earnings call, we introduced the ReMagine brand of SBS folding carton paperboard with up to 30% post-consumer recycled fiber that is FDA-compliant for food contact.\nTogether with our NuVo SBS brand of cup stock with up to 35% post-consumer recycled fiber, we're meeting our customers and consumer preferences for more recycled content in an already highly sustainable form of paper-based packaging without compromising on consumer safety and product quality.\nThe consolidated company summary income statement is depicted under the third quarter as well as the first three quarters of 2020 and 2019.\nIn the third quarter, diluted net income per share was $1.28 per share and adjusted EBITDA was $77 million.\nThe corresponding segment results are on slide eight.\nOur Paperboard business continued its strong adjusted EBITDA performance while consumer products benefited from significant sales growth and fixed cost leverage associated with production growth and favorable input costs.\nIn the second quarter of 2019, we started our Shelby, North Carolina, paper machine and incurred as anticipated, start-up costs related to lower production throughput, higher waste and other costs which persisted during the remainder of 2019.\nAs a reminder, we achieved the targeted production rate of our new paper machine in the second quarter of 2020 and we are continuing to capture the benefits associated with the project, including ramping our converting lines, realizing supply chain benefits and achieving sales wins and mix improvements.\nWhile we're not providing a specific dollar amount for these costs and benefits, the continued realization of the Shelby investment is an important factor in our performance improvement.\nOur mix continues to improve as Shelby has come online, more than offsetting some year-over-year price impacts.\nWe are benefiting from the volume increases related to the production ramp which helped to meet elevated demand.\nOverall fixed cost leverage from increased production, lower input costs and improved mix positively impacted our tissue business in the third quarter of 2020, relative to the third quarter of 2019.\nYou can review a comparison of our third quarter 2020 performance relative to the second quarter of 2020 on slide 16 in the appendix.\nSlide 10 contains some additional context to the outstanding performance in our tissue business and we are building off the data we shared last quarter.\nThe slide contains IRI panel data, which is a snapshot of retail sales of tissue measured in dollars.\nThe line shows monthly change on a year-over-year basis while the data on the box shows a quarterly view versus last year.\nIt is estimated that $1 retail sales grew 34% in the first quarter, 23% in the second quarter and 12% in the third quarter.\nYou can see in the data that pantry loading phenomenon at the end of the first and beginning of second quarters, that has given away to a more stable demand picture for our retail customers.\nDuring our last quarter's call, we anticipated the IRI panel data to be up in the 10% to 15% range in the third quarter and it was close to 12%.\nIn the fourth quarter, we would expect year-over-year sales growth to continue to moderate.\nThis expectation is highly uncertain and dependent on consumer behavior, retail buying patterns and COVID-related restrictions.\nOur sales in the third quarter were 14.5 million cases, representing a unit decline of 9% versus the second quarter and unit growth of 10% versus prior year as expected.\nOur production in the quarter was 15.3 million cases, were down 4% versus the second quarter and up 19% versus prior year.\nOur production levels had benefited from the Shelby ramp and SKU rationalization.\nThe cost leverage from the significant increase in production along with improved costs in freight and logistics led to continued strong results.\nSlide 11 is a year-over-year adjusted EBITDA comparison for our paperboard business.\nLower pricing reflected in Macy's reported price decrease in February was partially offset by favorable mix.\nThe absence of a planned major maintenance outage at our Idaho mill was also a major driver of year-over-year improvement.\nOverall, our team brand our operations well in the quarter and continue to deliver stable results.\nYou can review a comparison of our third quarter 2020 performance relative to the second quarter of 2020 performance on slide 17 in the appendix.\nOur performance in the third quarter exceeded our expectations with stronger sales and production volumes in tissue and continued stability in paperboard, despite weak economic conditions.\nThese factors combined with outstanding operational execution delivered robust results.\nSlide 12 provides a perspective on our fourth quarter outlook.\nAs previously discussed, tissue outlook is largely a function of sales demand.\nAs Arsen mentioned, we recently exited some customers and specific products to better position us for the future.\nAdditionally, several of our large customers placed heavy orders with us and other suppliers in the third quarter, leaving them with high inventories in several product categories.\nAs a result, we're seeing order pace slow in October as customers are adjusting their supply chains.\nOur October shipments were around 4 million cases, which is down from an average of 4.8 million cases per month in the third quarter of 2020 and 4.4 million cases per month in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nWe are anticipating our tissue sales to be at or below fourth quarter 2019 levels.\nOur production will also decline to meet this level of demand, so that our inventories do not exceed targeted levels, which will impact our fixed cost absorption that had benefited Clearwater throughout much of 2020.\nInput costs are expected to continue to be largely benign except for some increasing freight expenses.\nAnd as we mentioned previously, our paperboard business remained stable in total and while we continue to prepare for potential COVID recession-related weakness, our portfolio of customers and end-market segment exposure continues to position us well through the end of October.\nIf assumptions around demand as well as largely stable prices and raw material inputs hold, we would anticipate fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $52 million to $62 million.\nThis range also assumes that we continue to operate our assets without significant COVID-related disruptions.\nFor the full year 2020, we anticipate the following.\nInterest expense between $46 million and $48 million, which is a slight decrease to the past expectations due to debt repayments.\nDepreciation is expected to be between $109 million and $112 million.\nCapital expenditures are trending toward $45 million and we still do not expect to be a net cash taxpayer in 2020.\nWhile we're not prepared to provide specific guidance for 2021, there are several variables to keep in mind.\nPlanned major outage expenses are expected to reduce our earnings in 2021 compared to 2020 by $25 million to $30 million.\nWe've updated this guidance on slide 22, which represents a slight increase relative to prior guidance of $23 million to $27 million.\nThis is due partly to a new project to replace the head box on one of our Lewiston paper machines, which will require some additional downtime.\nBased on third-party pulp forecast, we are anticipating around a $50 per ton increase in pulp.\nAs a reminder, we purchased approximately 300,000 tons of pulp each year.\nCapex is expected to trend closer to our historical averages of approximately $50 million.\nSlide 13 outlines our capital structure.\nWe utilized approximately $40 million of free cash flow to reduce our net debt, which included a $40 million voluntary prepayment of our term loans and our liquidity was $277 million.\nIn the quarter, we refinanced our 2023 notes with a new 2028 note maturity, providing approximately 5.5 additional years of tenure at a rate we deemed to be attractive at 4.75%.\nWe also achieved the mass [Phonetic] amendment through our ABL facility, providing some reporting and other flexibilities.\nS&P recognized our improving credit trend and removed us from negative outlook.\nWe continue to make strides, reducing our net debt and increasing our financial flexibility.\nI would like to reiterate our value proposition, which we discussed on our previous earnings call and mentioned to investors throughout the quarter.\nWe believe Clearwater Paper is very well positioned across two attractive and complementary businesses.\nOur Consumer Products division is a leader within the growing private branded tissue market.\nFrom our vantage point, we believe the key strengths of this business are the following.\nFirst, we have a national footprint with an ability to supply a wide range of product categories and quality tiers, which is an attractive sales proposition to our customers.\nOur expertise in manufacturing, supply chain and transportation is a key differentiator, especially during challenging times like today.\nSecond, there are long-term trends away from branded products to private brands.\nThese have typically been amplified during recessions.\nPrivate brand tissue share in the US rose to over 30% in 2019, up from 18% in 2011.\nWhile these trends are impressive, we're still a long way from where many European countries are, where private brands represent over half of total tissue share.\nLastly, tissue is an economically resilient and need-based product.\nHistorically, demand has not been negatively impacted by economic uncertainty.\nTurning to our Paperboard division.\nWe believe that the key strengths of this business are the following.\nFirst, we operate well-invested assets with a geographic footprint enabling us to efficiently service customers on both posts.\nWe have a diverse customer base that serve end markets that have largely stable demand.\nSecond, not being vertically integrated enables us to focus on independent customers with unparalleled service and quality commitment.\nThird, we believe the business is well positioned to take advantage of trends toward more sustainable packaging and food service products.\nLastly, our paperboard business has demonstrated an ability to generate good margins and solid cash flows.\nOverall, our large capital investments are behind us and we're prioritizing cash flows to reduce debt, as we demonstrated in the third quarter with a net debt reduction of approximately $40 million, bringing our net reduction thus far in 2020 to over $140 million.\nWe intend to continue to deleverage by delivering benefits from our Shelby investment, continuing with operational improvements, aggressively managing working capital and prudently allocating capital.\nWhile we expect to have lower tissue shipments in the coming quarters, we're making sound strategic moves to support our customers and their success and continue to position our business for success in the long-run.\nWe believe that this strategy is the best way to create value for equity and debt holders.\nSummary: ",
    "output": "q3 earnings per share $1.28.\nq3 sales $457 million versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $461.6 million.\nin q4, demand for tissue products is expected to soften relative to q3 of 2020.\n"

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Joining us today are: Brian Chambers, Owens Corning's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Parks, our Chief Financial Officer.\nRefer to the Investors link under the Corporate section of our homepage.\nPlease reference slide 2 before we begin, where we offer a couple of reminders.\nWe undertake no obligation to update these statements beyond what is required under applicable securities laws.\nI hope all of you on the call are staying healthy and safe.\nOver the past year, I'm pleased to say that our team has consistently risen to the challenges that fundamentally impacted not only our businesses and markets, but the ways we work and live.\nWhile many of those challenges continue to affect our daily lives, they are no longer unprecedented.\nWe've learned to be more agile to adapt and respond to changing market condition, demonstrating that strong execution and an uncompromising commitment to our people and our customers can drive exceptional performance even against this backdrop.\nWe certainly demonstrated this in the first quarter, delivering great operational and financial results by leveraging our market leading positions, unique product and process technologies and enterprise operating model to capitalize on strong or improving market conditions.\n, before turning it over to Ken, who will provide additional details on our financial performance.\nI will then come back to talk about our business outlook for the second quarter and share our perspective on key markets.\nAs always, I will begin my review at safety, where our collective focus remains working together to keep each other, our customers and our suppliers, healthy and safe.\nDuring the first quarter, we maintained a very safe environment with an RIR of 0.64, which is in line with our full year 2020 performance.\nMore than half of our facilities across the globe have remained injury-free for more than a year.\nFinancially, we delivered record first quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, an increase of 20% compared with the first quarter of 2020, up 18% on a constant currency basis; and adjusted EBIT of $282 million, which is more than double what we reported for the same period last year and a record for any first quarter historically.\nOur global teams continue to execute well, delivering outstanding financial results in a dynamic market environment, demonstrating the earnings power of our company.\nOur performance during the quarter was driven by good volumes, broad price realization and strong manufacturing efficiencies across all our businesses, resulting in an adjusted EBIT margin for the company of 15%, with all three of our businesses posting double-digit EBIT margins for the third consecutive quarter.\nDuring the quarter, we saw broad strength across many of our end markets.\nSpecifically, the US residential housing market continues to run at a robust pace, with both repair and remodeling activity and new construction growth driving strong demand for our products.\nIn addition, we continue to see many of our global markets as well as our commercial and industrial end markets improved throughout the quarter.\nWhile market conditions have certainly turned more favorable, our operating priorities, investments and execution have positioned us to deliver these strong financial results.\nAcross the enterprise, we continue to invest in select growth and productivity initiatives to service our customers and improve our operating performance.\nWithin Insulation, we are investing in automation and process technologies to create a lower cost, more flexible manufacturing network in our residential insulation business as we commercially position ourselves to benefit from a strong housing market.\nIn addition, we continue to invest in new Insulation materials and systems in nonresidential applications to expand our global product offering.\nIn our Composites business, we are investing to grow in higher-value downstream applications, such as building and construction, wind energy and infrastructure.\nAnd we remain focused on optimizing our low-cost manufacturing network to service key markets such as North America, Europe and India.\nAnd in roofing, we continue to leverage our vertical integration model to develop innovative products and systems, while expanding our roofing components offering and strengthening our partnerships with contractors and distributors, to help grow their businesses with our products and brands.\nAll of this work is enabled by our enterprise operating model, which leverages our commercial strength, material science capabilities and global operating scale, to expand our growth opportunities, improve our operating efficiencies and generate strong free cash flow.\nOn the talent front, we recently announced the appointment of two great executives.\nFirst, I'd like to congratulate Dr. Jose Mendez Andino on his recent promotion to Chief Research and Development Officer.\nMaterial science research and product and process innovation are fundamental to what we do and how we deliver value as a company.\nJose will play a key role in leading our efforts to increase our innovation pipeline and ensure we are helping our customers win and grow in the market.\nShe joins us from Nordson Corporation where she served for 8 years, most recently as their General Counsel.\nGina brings more than two decades of experience working across multiple industries and will be a valuable partner to both me and our entire executive team.\nAnother highlight I would like to share is the recent publication of our 15th annual sustainability report titled, Beyond Today Shaping Tomorrow.\nWe began our sustainability journey nearly 2 decades ago.\nAnd over the years, our goals have evolved and expanded well beyond environmental sustainability.\nToday, they are built on three key pillars: expanding the positive impact of our products, reducing our environmental footprint and increasing our social impact.\nWe are proud of our progress and our accomplishments over the past decade across all of our 2020 sustainability goals, particularly our progress on climate action, where we have reduced absolute greenhouse gas emissions from our operations by 60% since our peak year despite adding several material acquisitions along the way.\nIn our recently published 2030 goals, we are committed to further reduce these emissions by another 50%.\nThis will result in 2030 absolute greenhouse gas emissions being 75% below our peak.\nAt the same time, we are also committed to a 30% reduction in our scope 3 emissions as we focus on making a positive impact throughout our supply chain.\nSustainability is core to our purpose and will continue to be an important driver and differentiator for our company moving forward.\nAs Brian commented, Owens Corning delivered outstanding financial results in the first quarter.\nStrong top line growth, 400 basis points of gross margin expansion and continued operating expense discipline drove record first quarter adjusted EBIT, along with an adjusted EBIT margin of 15%.\nThe stronger earnings, combined with a continued focus on working capital management and capital investments, resulted in healthy free cash flow generation in the quarter.\nWhile benefiting from market conditions that are broadly stronger than they were a year ago, continued solid execution across the business was fundamental to driving this performance.\nAs anticipated, we're managing a more inflationary environment, primarily related to materials and transportation.\nPositive price realization and manufacturing productivity more than offset the inflation headwind in the quarter.\nMaintaining this positive balance remains a focus as we move through this inflationary environment.\nNow turning to slide 5.\nWe can take a closer look at our results.\nFor the first quarter, we reported consolidated net sales of $1.9 billion, up 20% over 2020 with double-digit revenue growth in all 3 segments, reflecting the robust US residential housing market and the continued strengthening of commercial and industrial markets.\nAdjusted EBIT for the first quarter of 2021 reached $282 million, up $166 million compared to the prior year and was highlighted by all 3 segments continuing to deliver double-digit EBIT margins.\nAdjusted earnings for the first quarter were $183 million or $1.73 per diluted share compared to $67 million or $0.62 per diluted share in Q1 2020.\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the quarter was $119 million, up slightly compared to the prior year.\nOur capital additions for the first quarter were $60 million, up $6 million as compared to Q1 2020.\nWe'll continue to be disciplined in our capital spending as we focus on delivering strong free cash flow and prioritizing investments that drive growth and productivity.\nSlide 6 reconciles our first quarter adjusted EBIT of $282 million to our reported EBIT of $301 million.\nDuring the quarter, we recognized $20 million of gains on the sale of certain precious metals.\nOngoing progress on our productivity initiatives and manufacturing process technology has enabled us to further modify the designs of our production tooling and reduce certain precious metal holdings.\nIn addition, we recorded $1 million of restructuring costs associated with the Insulation network optimization actions that we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nThese items are excluded from our adjusted first quarter EBIT.\nSlide 7 provides a high-level overview of our first quarter adjusted EBIT comparing 2021 to 2020.\nAdjusted EBIT of $282 million was a new first quarter record for the company and increased $166 million over the prior year.\nRoofing and Insulation more than doubled their EBIT and Composites grew by 80%.\nBefore turning to the review of each of our businesses, I want to speak to the onetime financial impacts we had from the winter storms in February.\nEach of our businesses faced operational disruptions related to the storms.\nHowever, these were offset in each of the businesses by gains on renewable energy settlements.\nAs we discussed at the time of our year-end call, these impacts were contemplated in our first quarter guidance.\nNow, turning to Slide 8.\nI'll provide more details on the performance of each of the businesses.\nThe Insulation business executed well to deliver strong growth on both the top and bottom lines.\nSales for the quarter were $700 million, a 16% increase over first quarter 2020.\nWe saw volume strength across the business as US new construction continued to be robust, and many of the commercial end markets we serve globally continue to strengthen.\nIn North American residential Fiberglas Insulation, we continue to ship all we can produce as the US new residential market remains very healthy.\nWe saw volumes up in line with the expectations we had at the time of our last call and continue to see positive pricing as a result of the actions that we've taken over the past three quarters.\nI'm happy to share that we started up our batts and rolls lines in Kansas City in February and continued to ramp up production as we move through the quarter.\nIn technical and other insulation, we saw volume up across the business with our highly specified products, continuing to see growth in demand in North America and Europe.\nPricing continues to be stable, and we saw a benefit from currency translation in the quarter.\nFor the Insulation business overall, good execution in our manufacturing operations partially offset continued transportation headwinds and accelerating material inflation.\nWe delivered margins of 12% and EBIT of $82 million more than double the $39 million of EBIT in the first quarter of last year.\nThe Composites business had a strong start to the year.\nSales for the first quarter were $559 million, up 13% compared to the prior year.\nStronger-than-expected volume growth in the quarter resulted from demand for downstream applications serving the building and construction and wind markets as well as demand in key geographies where our local supply for local demand model is being valued by customers and drove higher volumes compared to the prior year.\nWe also saw positive price realization in Composites, resulting from our most recent contract negotiations and the strength of the markets.\nOperationally, solid manufacturing performance offset headwinds from material and transportation inflation.\nFor the quarter, Composites delivered $79 million of EBIT and EBIT margin of 14%.\nSlide 10 provides an overview of our Roofing business.\nThe Roofing business produced its strongest first quarter top and bottom line performance as we continue to operate in a sold-out environment.\nSales in the first quarter were $711 million, up 28% compared to the prior year.\nThe US asphalt shingle market grew 26% for the quarter as compared to the prior year with our US shingle volumes, slightly outperforming the market.\nWe're seeing strong realization on our announced price increases and price costs remained positive as asphalt deflation continued to narrow through the quarter, and we started to face into transportation inflation.\nSimilar to the other 2 businesses, strong manufacturing performance was a fundamental element of the Roofing business results.\nFor the quarter, EBIT was $156 million, up $92 million from the prior year, achieving 22% EBIT margins.\nTurning to Slide 11.\nI'll discuss significant financial highlights for the first quarter and full year 2021, continued discipline around management of working capital, operating expenses and capital investments resulted in strong cash flow.\nIn addition, we didn't experience the seasonal working capital build that we typically see in the first quarter of the year due to robust demand across our businesses.\nFree cash flow for the first quarter of 2021 at $120 million, up $264 million compared to the first quarter of 2020.\nIt was a record for a first quarter.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock and returned $197 million of cash to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends.\nWith the strong cash performance and last year's deleveraging activities, we maintain a solid investment-grade balance sheet and are operating within our target debt to adjusted EBITDA range with ample liquidity.\nAt quarter end, the company had liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion, consisting of $605 million of cash and nearly $1.1 billion of combined availability on our bank debt facilities.\nWe remain focused on consistently generating strong free cash flow, returning at least 50% to investors over time and maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet.\nNow, turning to 2021 outlook for key financial items.\nI'll point out that there are no changes from our initial outlook provided in February.\nGeneral corporate expenses are expected to range between $135 million and $145 million.\nCapital additions are expected to be approximately $460 million, which is below expected depreciation and amortization of approximately $480 million.\nWe continue to focus on opportunities to support our businesses at a sustained lower level of capital intensity over time.\nInterest expense is estimated to be between $120 million and $130 million.\nAnd we expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be 26% to 28% of adjusted pre-tax earnings and our cash tax rate to be 18% to 20% of adjusted pre-tax earnings.\nWe're closely monitoring potential changes to the US tax landscape and will be proactive to mitigate the long-term effect on our cash tax rate.\nOur first quarter performance provided a strong start to the year.\nAs we look forward, we expect the US residential repair and remodeling and new construction end markets to remain robust with our commercial and industrial markets continuing to strengthen.\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic continues to create market uncertainty, our teams are performing at a high level, producing results that demonstrate the earnings power of our company and position us well to continue building on this outstanding performance.\nGiven the strength of our key markets and our continued operational performance, we expect the company to generate another quarter of significant revenue and earnings growth in the second quarter versus prior year.\nConsistent with prior practice, I'll focus my business outlook comments on our expectations for Q2.\nIn each business, we expect prior year comparisons to be impacted by pandemic-related market responses, which affected our production and volume shipments last year.\nStarting with Insulation, we continue to see strength in new U.S. residential construction.\nGiven the decline in North American residential Fiberglas Insulation shipments last year during the second quarter, we expect those sea shipments to grow about 25%, with pricing continuing to improve from realization of our April increase.\nGiven our outlook for inflation, we have also recently announced an 8% price increase effective June 28.\nIn our technical and other building insulation businesses, we are seeing volumes recover to pre-COVID levels.\nIn the second quarter, we expect our volumes to be up mid-teens as we see increasing demand for our products in global building and construction applications.\nPricing in these businesses is expected to remain relatively stable to slightly up.\nIn terms of inflation, we expect material and transportation cost increases we faced in Q1 to continue in a more meaningful way in the current quarter, partially offset by ongoing strong manufacturing productivity.\nAdditionally, we anticipate benefits of approximately $30 million from better fixed cost absorption on higher production volumes.\nGiven all this, we expect EBIT margins to improve sequentially, approaching mid-teens for the quarter.\nMoving on to Composites; we expect our volume growth to continue at a strong pace, up approximately 30% versus the prior year.\nPricing is also expected to improve low to mid-single digits year-over-year.\nMargins should benefit from the reversal of roughly $30 million of curtailment cost we saw in the second quarter of 2020.\nConsistent with the broader industry trend, inflation will represent a more meaningful headwind for the business, which we would expect to partially offset through productivity gains.\nOn a sequential basis, EBIT margins in Q2 are expected to be similar to the first quarter.\nAnd in Roofing, we expect the market to be up between 15% and 20%, with our volumes up mid to high single digits.\nWe anticipate our volume growth will trail the market growth due to the strength of our shipments in Q2 of last year.\nRoofing pricing is expected to improve with the announced increase of 5% to 7% that was effective at the beginning of this month.\nFrom an inflation standpoint, we expect to face more significant headwinds in asphalt cost and other material inputs, particularly resin used in our components business.\nGiven this, we have recently announced an additional price increase of 4% to 6% effective in mid-June.\nOverall, we expect EBIT margins to increase sequentially from Q1, approaching mid-20%.\nWith that view of our businesses, I'll turn to a few key enterprise areas.\nOur team remains committed to generating strong operating and free cash flow.\nIn terms of capital allocation, our priorities remain focused on reinvesting in our business, especially productivity and organic growth initiatives.\nReturning at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases and maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet.\nIn addition, we are also evaluating investments in bolt-on acquisitions that leverage our commercial, operational and geographic strengths and expand our building and construction product offering.\nOverall, we are well positioned to capitalize on near-term market opportunities as well as several longer-term secular trends that provide multiyear growth opportunities, including the demand for new housing in the US which has been underbuilt for several years and continued remodeling investments as homeowners renovate their living spaces and upgrade their homes.\nWe are also seeing growing opportunities to benefit from the drive for increased energy efficiency in homes and buildings, a greater importance being placed on sustainability and material durability and additional investments being made in renewable energy and infrastructure.\nEach of tease trends creates opportunities for Owens Corning to leverage our material science, building science and unique product and process technologies to partner with our customers and help them grow with additional products, systems and services.\nAs I noted at the beginning of today's call, our team is proud of the outstanding operational and financial performance we delivered in the first quarter and are excited by the opportunities we have to grow our company, help our customers win in the market and deliver value to our shareholders.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:Please note for those of you listening by phone, you may experience a time delay in slide movement.\nWhen referring to operating margins, that is based on operating income and sales, excluding surcharge.\nLet's begin on Slide four and a review of our safety performance.\nOur fiscal year-to-date total case incident rate, or TCIR, is 0.6.\nWe have now demonstrated three consecutive quarters of sub-1.0 TCIR performance as an organization, which is exceptional safety performance.\nHowever, we do not take these accomplishments for granted and continue to enhance the fundamentals of our program in areas such as hand safety, human performance, leadership development, ergonomics, employee engagement activities and at-home safety programs.\nI look forward to achieving our next safety performance milestone as we pursue safety excellence on our path to 0.\nOur third quarter results were largely in line with our expectations as near-term volume headwinds related to COVID-19 continue to pressure our financial performance.\nBoth our SAO and PEP segments delivered results that were consistent with the guidance we provided on our second quarter earnings call.\nWe have maintained a focus on our key strategic priorities during this challenging period.\nFirst, ensure the safety of our employees.\nSecond, drive cash flow generation and strengthen our liquidity profile.\nOver the last four quarters, we have generated $189 million in free cash flow and ended the third quarter with total liquidity of $539 million, including $244 million of cash and no near-term financial obligations.\nAnd third, focus on the long-term relationships with our customers.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to expand our relationships across our customer base and then cover additional areas of value creation.\nAs evidenced, we completed several contract extensions, primarily in our medical, transportation and aerospace and defense end-use markets.\nIn the aerospace market, customers fully understand that capacity was limited prior to the pandemic and supply of aerospace materials will be constrained again when build rates return to normalized levels.\nAs you know, Carpenter Technology is the only company in our space that has invested in capacity, namely the Athens facility.\nQualification efforts have continued through the pandemic as we received a meaningful provisional approval during the quarter.\nLastly, the investment made in our hot strip mill on our Reading campus is currently in its final commissioning stages.\nThis advanced mill is a significant addition to our soft magnetics solutions and capabilities portfolio and positions us to benefit from the growing trend of electrification.\nNow let's move to Slide six and the end-use market update.\nOur customers and markets have been heavily impacted by COVID-19, particularly aerospace and defense, our largest market.\nWe have been successful in mitigating a portion of the near-term impact of the aerospace downturn by capitalizing on growing demand for our solutions in transportation and industrial and consumer end-use markets, namely our semicon business.\nRecently, all of our end-use markets have experienced positive inflections and have moved past their pandemic decline trajectories.\nAll of our end-use markets are in demand recovery, albeit at different rates.\nWe believe the worst is behind us, and we expect to see improving conditions over the coming quarters.\nLet's get into some more detail starting with the aerospace and defense end-use market where sales were down both year over year and sequentially.\nIn the third quarter, customer inventories continued to decrease, and we saw some initial replenishment activity.\nAs a reminder, in our recent second quarter, we talked about a variety of onetime customer contract-related items, which represented a positive.\nWhen you remove the impact of those items, aerospace results would be relatively flat sequentially.\nWhile visibility remains limited, overall sentiment points to incremental improvement through the balance of calendar year 2021 and then accelerate activity in calendar year 2022 and beyond.\nIn addition, future industry capacity and lead time continues to be a focus during conversations with customers as most recall the situation the supply chain was in prior to COVID-19 where lead times were significantly extended.\nActivity in the defense submarket remains solid, and we continue to see increased demand on select programs.\nIn our medical end-use market, sales were up 7% sequentially.\nElective procedure volumes increased compared to the second quarter as patient sentiment and hospital capacity improved.\nThe recovery of elective surgery volume is expected to continue into the second half of calendar year 2021 as vaccination levels rise to support increased confidence.\nBased on current conditions, we expect activity levels in the medical end-use market to show further improvement in the fourth quarter as our customers look to support an increase in elective surgeries.\nAs many of you recall, the medical end-use market was one of our fastest growing markets prior to the pandemic.\nToday, we remain well positioned to continue supporting the medical end-use market given our expanded OEM relationships, leading advanced materials portfolio and ability to develop new materials solutions that address complex and unmet market needs.\nIn the transportation end-use market, sales were up both sequentially and year-over-year.\nOn a sequential basis, sales increased across all of our submarkets.\nDemand in the light vehicle market remains solid driven by North America and China.\nWhile the heavy-duty truck market has largely recovered and is expected to grow through calendar year 2022.\nOverall, we are winning share in both the light vehicle and heavy-duty truck submarkets due to the value of our high-temp, high-resistance turbocharger and valve exhaust solutions.\nNow moving to the energy end-use market.\nConditions in the oil and gas submarket remained challenged and activity levels remain low in the U.S., while international markets have shown some improvement.\nKeep in mind, that prior year third quarter results included our Amega West business that was divested during the first quarter of this fiscal year.\nIn our power generation submarket, we continue to work with customers as the current maintenance upgrade cycle continues.\nLastly, for the industrial and consumer end-use market, sales were down year-over-year and sequentially.\nThe slight sequential decline was a function of order flow between the last two quarters as we continue to experience demand pickup, consistent with the general manufacturing recovery.\nI'll start on Slide 8, the income statement summary.\nNet sales in the third quarter were $351.9 million and sales, excluding surcharge, totaled $298.1 million.\nSales, excluding surcharge, were effectively flat sequentially on 5% lower volume.\nCompared to the third quarter a year ago, sales decreased 40% on 39% lower volume.\nAs Tony covered in his review of the end-use markets, the year-over-year decline is attributable to the ongoing demand headwinds in our key end-use markets of aerospace and defense and medical as a result of the global pandemic.\nAs expected, the demand was similar to our recent Q2 levels.\nGiven the current demand environment, we continue to actively manage our production schedules and focus on executing against our targeted inventory reduction program.\nAs we have said on prior calls, while the reduction in inventory drives near-term cash flow generation, as evidenced by our liquidity position, it negatively impacts our operating income performance.\nSG&A expenses were $47.8 million in the third quarter, down $3 million from the same period a year ago, reflecting the actions we took to reduce costs, including the elimination of about 20% of our global salaried positions late last fiscal year, managing discretionary spend closely as well as the impacts of remote working conditions that reduced certain administrative costs such as travel and entertainment.\nSequentially, SG&A costs were higher by $5.6 million, reflecting incremental costs in the quarter associated with going live with our new ERP implementation as well as the incremental depreciation costs associated with the ERP system.\nThe current quarter's operating results include $7.6 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges, including inventory writedowns, associated with our ongoing actions to reduce cost and narrow focus in our additive business unit within our PEP segment.\nIn addition, our results for the third quarter include $2.7 million in COVID-19-related costs, which are down slightly from the $3.9 million of COVID-19 costs incurred in our recent second quarter.\nAs a reminder, these costs include direct incremental operating costs, including outside services to execute enhanced cleaning protocols, isolation pay for employees potentially exposed to COVID-19 and additional personal protective equipment and other operating supplies necessary to maintain the operations while keeping employees safe against possible exposure.\nThe operating loss was $40 million in the current quarter when excluding the impact of the special items, namely the restructuring and asset impairment charges and the COVID-19 costs.\nAdjusted operating loss was $29.7 million compared to operating income of $58.7 million in the prior year period and adjusted operating loss of $32.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nAgain, the current quarter's results were largely in line with the expectations we set at the beginning of the quarter and reflect the impact of significantly lower volume compared to the prior year combined with a targeted inventory reduction, partially offset by the cost reduction efforts.\nAlthough not shown on the slide, in the current quarter, other expense net includes an $8.9 million noncash pension settlement charge related to our largest qualified pension plan.\nIn addition to recording the charge in the current quarter, we were also required to remeasure the plan's net pension liabilities.\nAs a result of the remeasurement, we expect pension expense to be lower by about $3 million for the full fiscal year versus what we had anticipated.\nFor clarity, this reduction in net pension expense does not impact operating income.\nOur effective tax rate for the third quarter was 29.2%.\nFor the balance of the year, we currently expect the tax rate to be in the range of 28% to 30%.\nEarnings per share for the quarter was a loss of $0.84 per share.\nWhen excluding the impacts of the special items, adjusted earnings per share was a loss of $0.54 per share.\nNow turning to Slide nine and our SAO segment results.\nNet sales for the quarter were $299.6 million or $246.5 million, excluding surcharge.\nCompared to the third quarter last year, sales, excluding surcharge, decreased 38% on 37% lower volume.\nSequentially, sales, excluding surcharge, were essentially flat on 3% lower volume.\nThese sequential results reflect similar weakened demand conditions in our largest end-use market of aerospace and defense as the supply chain continues to deal with near-term reductions in OEM build rates.\nThis was partially offset by stronger shipments in transportation as North American light vehicle production continues to drive strong demand conditions for our materials.\nSAO reported an operating loss of $9.9 million for the current quarter.\nThe same quarter a year ago, SAO's operating income was $76.4 million.\nAnd in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, SAO reported an operating loss of $11.6 million.\nThe year-over-year reduction in operating income primarily reflects the impacts of lower volume as well as the negative income statement impacts of reducing inventory, partially offset by the actions taken to reduce operating costs.\nDuring the current quarter, SAO reduced inventory by approximately $15 million and, year-to-date, has reduced inventory by $146 million.\nSequentially, the lower operating loss is principally the result of lower volume, offset by a favorable product mix and a less pronounced impact of the inventory reduction relative to the second quarter due in part to rising raw material prices.\nIn addition, the current quarter's results reflect approximately $2.1 million of direct incremental costs associated with our efforts to protect our facilities and employees in light of COVID-19.\nThis compares with $3.2 million in COVID-19 costs in our recent second quarter.\nLooking ahead, we expect demand conditions across most end-use markets will stabilize and begin to gradually recover beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nBased on current expectations, we anticipate SAO will generate an operating loss of approximately $5 million to $7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nFor clarity, I want to highlight a couple of key points in this guidance.\nFirst, this estimate includes similar sequential COVID-19-related costs in the upcoming fourth quarter.\nAnd second, as we continue to reduce inventory, we expect that we will be required to record a noncash LIFO decrement charge in our upcoming fourth quarter.\nGiven the significant inventory reductions we expect to generate for the full fiscal year, we are liquidating LIFO layers that include inventory costs that are higher than the fiscal year 2021 cost and, as such, a noncash charge will be recorded to the income statement.\nThe guidance we provided excludes the impact of any noncash LIFO decrement charges.\nNow turning to Slide 10 and our PEP segment results.\nNet sales, excluding surcharge, were $64.9 million, which were down 39% from the same quarter a year ago and up 20% sequentially.\nThe year-over-year decline in sales was driven by market headwinds, largely due to the global pandemic.\nAdditionally, sales in the energy end-use market declined as a result of our exit of the Amega West oil and gas business in the first quarter of this fiscal year.\nThe sequential increase in sales reflects increasing demand for titanium materials used in the aerospace and defense and medical end-use markets.\nIn addition, our distribution business drove higher sales due to growing demand related to the strong activity in the automotive supply chain.\nLastly, our additive business saw a modest increase in sales as demand improved.\nIn the current quarter, PEP reported an operating loss of $3.3 million.\nThis compares to an operating loss of $7.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 and an operating loss of $0.3 million in the same quarter last year.\nThe sequential operating results reflect the favorable impacts of higher volumes across all the PEP business units.\nAs we look ahead, we believe that demand conditions will gradually begin to improve in the coming quarters, and we currently anticipate PEP will generate an operating loss of $0 million to $1 million in our upcoming fourth quarter.\nAlso, as I mentioned for SAO, the PEP guidance includes COVID-19 costs in line with the recent quarter but excludes any noncash LIFO decrement charges.\nNow turning to Slide 11 and a review of free cash flow.\nIn the current quarter, we generated $4 million of cash from operating activities.\nAs you can see within the cash flow generated from operations, we continue to reduce inventory, although less pronounced than we have executed in the last several quarters.\nOver the last four quarters, beginning with our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, we have reduced inventory by just under $300 million, including $182 million of reductions to date in fiscal year 2021.\nIn terms of other working capital, with the implementation of our new ERP system, we experienced some challenges with customer collections that reduced cash from accounts receivable collections.\nThose challenges are largely behind us, and we expect to realize the benefits of that catch-up in our upcoming fourth quarter.\nIn the third quarter, we spent $19 million on capital expenditures.\nWe expect to spend about $110 million to $120 million on capital expenditures for fiscal year 2021 depending on the timing of certain projects expected to be completed in the balance of this fiscal year.\nThe actions we have taken to generate cash in the current environment have been essential.\nIt should not be lost that we believe in the value of returning capital to our shareholders.\nAnd despite the challenging economic conditions, we have continued to pay a quarterly dividend to our shareholders.\nThe quarterly dividend demonstrates the confidence we have in our ability to deal with the near-term impacts of market conditions and the long-term prospects for our business.\nWith those details in mind, we reported negative $25 million of free cash flow in the quarter.\nAs I mentioned, we dealt with some challenges in the quarter related to cash collections of accounts receivable.\nAs we look at the fourth quarter, we believe we have addressed those challenges, and we'll continue to execute on opportunities for further inventory reductions.\nWith that in mind, we are targeting at least $50 million of positive free cash flow in our upcoming fourth quarter.\nFrom a liquidity perspective, we ended the current quarter with total liquidity of $539 million, including $244 million of cash and $295 million of available borrowings under our credit facility.\nKeep in mind, in the current quarter, we amended and extended our credit facility and reduced the size of our facility from $400 million to $300 million, which is reflected in the sequential change in liquidity.\nWith that, I'll move on to the next slide, Slide 12, to talk about our capital structure.\nOver the years, we maintained a balanced view of capital allocation.\nAnd as the global pandemic emerged a little over a year ago, we quickly shifted our focus toward building liquidity, which was enabled by our strong capital allocation philosophy.\nIn addition to the actions we took to reduce costs and focus on cash generation earlier this year, we took action to extend our maturity profile and add incremental cash to our balance sheet with our July 2020 notes offering.\nThis extended our notes due in July 2021 to July 2028.\nLast month, in March 2021, we executed another important step in our strategy by completing an amended and extended credit facility.\nThe previous credit facility was set to expire in March 2022.\nThe new facility matures in March 2024.\nWith those actions behind us, we have no near-term maturities and have significant liquidity with opportunities to generate even more.\nAs we all know, different demand recovery time lines and customer ordering patterns will continue to influence our shorter-term quarter-to-quarter mix.\nI want to share a bit more on our enthusiasm related to midterm and longer-term outlooks in the end-use markets we serve.\nLet's start with aerospace.\nDuring the downturn, we continue to improve our already strong position.\nMost market participants and experts believe that demand will rebound to and through pre-COVID-19 levels which, if you recall, was already exhibiting constrained dynamics.\nLonger term, the industry will continue to need improved fuel efficiency and emissions, driving the need for better engine materials where we are strongly positioned.\nDefense will continue to experience market resiliency on key platforms that require increases in strength, customers and fatigue performance.\nLonger term, we are monitoring funding patterns as governments reassess their budgets after significant COVID-19-related spending.\nIn medical, as orthopedics and dental follow the cardiology recovery, we continue to secure additional share and identify more upside, largely due to the breadth of the high-value material solutions we offer in support of the industry innovation in this space.\nLonger term, we see this continuing as quicker patient recoveries and improved patient outcomes will be the key drivers.\nIn transportation, with the recovery well under way in North America and China, regulations drive the near-term movement to higher efficiency powertrains, which is a positive for our portfolio of high-temperature materials.\nLonger term, as electric vehicle adoption grows, it is natural they will take more and more share away from the large internal combustion engine base.\nWe have a good view of the life cycle decline of those products and are balancing our focus accordingly.\nAs I mentioned earlier, our new hot strip mill brings capability and capacity to support significant future electric vehicle volume growth.\nMoving to energy, which experienced a significant decline in demand this past year.\nOil prices have increased by 50% in calendar year 2021, and we have seen limited capital expenditures released for some major projects that offer up specific opportunities.\nWith that said, there will likely continue to be a supply and demand imbalance over the next couple of years.\nLonger term, we expect to see continued emphasis to move away from oil to natural gas and other alternative fuel sources.\nIn industrial submarkets, specifically with semiconductor and fluid control products, the relatively steady demand we experienced through the pandemic is expected to increase driven by manufacturing for 5G, Internet of Things connectivity and more efficient power plants that require better-performing materials.\nThe consumer submarket is expected to continue its seasonal cyclicality.\nHowever, we're seeing more and more applications that have tighter design envelopes that require the removal of wave interference and that make use of our materials to offer automated sensory feedback responses.\nLonger term, with the proliferation of digital and data management, we expect to see more devices with more sensors requiring exponentially more connectivity.\nI've spoken in prior quarters about our soft magnetics products and their relevance within increasing electrification trends.\nWe believe this capability will well position us in the long term to capitalize on the growth in these areas.\nIn the electrification space, we are participating in an increasing amount of prototype and initial low rate production initiatives that utilize our products to provide power dense propulsion in a manner that relies upon reduced mass or where there is limited space for the motor.\nAnd we see current drone, air taxi and other related applications becoming more and more relevant, especially where our options to extend range or boost performance are being exhausted.\nAnd lastly, in additive manufacturing, while we've seen some projects cancel or delay indifferently, along with some industry consolidation, we believe the competitive space has been narrowed, thus providing a focus on the value of our quality and life cycle management platform where data and knowledge management will be vital to the success of any additive program.\nDespite the challenges the pandemic has created, we have continued to strengthen our foundation for long-term profitable growth.\nI'm proud that we continue to drive toward a goal of a zero-injury workplace and that all of our facilities have remained open during the pandemic.\nThe efforts have demonstrated a resiliency and commitment to our fellow employees, our customers and our communities.\nWe have adopted to new working conditions, aligned our cost structure and our manufacturing footprint to rapidly changing market conditions.\nWe have taken a series of steps to enhance our capital structure, drive strong liquidity and extend our debt maturities.\nWe ended the third quarter with $244 million in cash and over $539 million in total liquidity.\nOur capital structure activities combined with our targeted cost reduction initiatives place us on solid ground to not just manage through the downturn but emerge on the other side a leaner, more flexible and more productive company.\nWe have also deepened our relationships with our customers.\nRecovery across our end-use markets remains in varying stages.\nBut we expect overall market conditions to continue to improve as we move through the rest of calendar year 2021 and into 2022.\nSome markets will recover faster than others.\nAnd we are laser-focused on capitalizing on the recovery as opportunities arise.\nThis includes our largest end-use market, aerospace and defense, where the recovery is beginning to show signs of life.\nWe are working daily with our customers to align our production schedules with their material needs as overall sentiment begins to trend upwards.\nOur core business is established and built upon 130 years of metallurgical expertise, manufacturing and processing experience and a commitment to delivering mission-critical solutions to customers in some of the largest industries in the world.\nThis strong core business will be supported over the long term by the targeted investments we have made in critical, emerging technologies, including electrification and additive manufacturing.\nTaken together, we believe our core business and next-generation capabilities position us to deliver sustainable, long-term growth and value creation to our shareholders for years to come.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:On Slide 2 is the safe harbor statement.\nThese statements are based on our beliefs and assumptions, current expectations, estimates, and forecasts.\nThe company's future results are influenced by many factors beyond the control of the company.\nDuring today's call, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures, including organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, and adjusted diluted EPS.\nBefore we dive into our Q3 results and raised 2020 guidance, I like to make clear the importance of our mission at West and the values that formed the pillars in which we operate.\nIn today's uncertain environment and what seems like a new set of challenges each day, we remain focused on two key priorities: keeping our team members safe and ensuring uninterrupted supply of high quality containment and delivery devices required by our customers and the patients we currently serve.\nMoving to Slide 5, West is uniquely positioned to satisfy increasing market demand by leveraging our global operation of scale and our resources.\nOur team recognized at the outset of the pandemic that need to increase production capacity.\nWe were already supporting the growth trajectory of our base business and the future demand for our products required for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics meant that we needed to act quickly and very decisively.\nTo address the increase in demand, we brought forward planned capital investments and production capacity.\nSo, earlier this month we installed new manufacturing equipment at one of our HVP sites to prepare for the future demand of FluroTec and NovaPure.\nAs of this week, that capacity is operational and we have additional equipment being installed at a second HVP site with more installations planned in the coming months at other global sites.\nThe strength of our performance this past quarter demonstrates the forward momentum we have built over time with our market led strategy and also One West team approach to satisfy market demand.\nAnd now turning to Slide 6, the disruption caused by the pandemic has impacted the way all of us conduct business in our daily lives.\nWest is no exception.\nCustomers can come to West for a scientific and technical expertise, and this differentiates us in the market.\nWe have been investing in digital technology and automation with two objectives in mind, bringing new connected products to market, as well as enhancing the productivity of our operations at every level of the organization.\nWhile we're early in our digital journey, I would like to share a few examples of the recent success, starting with our manufacturing automation strategy.\nWe made great strides over the past year and helping us to achieve continuous improvements and quality, safety, service and cost.\nPetersburg, Florida site has developed an automation process for robotically loading and unloading molding presses.\nThis has considerably reduced idle production time associated with product changeovers and improved operating efficiency.\nOur Kinston site has automated molding, trimming, rinsing processes, which will drive higher quality and final product and greater efficiency gains.\nAnd I'm especially pleased with the team's agility in bringing forward the production capacity expansion, I mentioned earlier.\nA great deal of planning and engineering went into this initiative to help us meet our customers' requirements.\nOn the digital front, we have just introduced the West virtual, the future of customer interactions with a truly immersive, fully interactive online experience.\nWe expect this tool to be a primary customer interface, even beyond the current pandemic.\nSo, turning now to Slide 7 and our performance in the third quarter, our financial results remain strong.\nI'm pleased to say that the growth trends we have experienced over the past several quarters continued in the third quarter and the outlook for the fourth quarter remains positive.\nAnd we've had over 18% organic sales growth in the third quarter, driven again by robust high value product sales, as well as sales in contract manufacturing.\nAnd we experienced solid growth in operating profit margin expansion.\nThis resulted in a strong adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for the third quarter.\nSimilar to the second quarter, our base business had solid organic sales growth in the third quarter.\nWe also had incremental sales associated with many COVID-19 development projects we are supporting for both therapeutics and vaccines.\nSpecifically for vaccines, toward really the back end of the quarter, we were asked by our customers to accelerate initial deliveries of components is more than offset continued sales decline of products associated with injectable drugs and treatments such as dental and elective surgeries that have been impacted negatively by the pandemic.\nAs for guidance for the remainder of the year, we are confident that we're well positioned with the strength and resiliency of our core underlying business and the incremental opportunities being presented to support our customers with pandemic solutions.\nTherefore, we're raising our sales and earnings per share guidance for the remainder of this year.\nLet's review the numbers in more detail.\nWe'll first look at Q3 2020 revenues and profits, where we saw strong sales and earnings per share growth, led by strong revenue performance primarily in our biologics and generics market units and Contract Manufacturing.\nI will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways.\nFinally, we'll review our updated 2020 guidance.\nOur financial results are summarized on Slide 8, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 16 to 20.\nWe recorded net sales of $548 million, representing organic sales growth of 18.2%.\nCOVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $32 million in the quarter.\nThese net revenues include the assessment of our components associated with treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic.\nExcluding net COVID impact, organic sales grew by approximately 11%.\nLooking at Slide 9.\nProprietary product sales grew organically by 20.3% in the quarter.\nHigh-Value Products, which made up more than 65% of proprietary product sales in the quarter, grew double-digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q3.\nLooking at the performance of the market units, Biologics market units that were -- have delivered strong double-digit growth.\nWe continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings.\nThe generics market unit experienced high single-digit growth led by sales of Teflon stoppers and FluroTec components.\nOur Pharma market unit saw mid single-digit growth with sales led by high-value products and services, including Westar and FluroTec components.\nAnd Contract Manufacturing had double-digit organic sales growth for the third quarter, led once again by sales of diagnostic and healthcare-related injection devices.\nWe continue to see improvement in gross profit.\nWe recorded $194.6 million gross profit, $46.8 million or 31.7% above Q3 of last year.\nAnd our gross profit margin of 35.5% was a 310 basis point expansion from the same period last year.\nWe saw improvement in adjusted operating profit, with $103.9 million recorded this quarter, compared to $70.1 million in the same period last year for a 48.2% increase.\nOur adjusted operating profit margin of 19% was a 360 basis point increase from the same period last year.\nFinally, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 46% for Q3.\nExcluding stock tax benefit of $0.02 in Q3, earnings per share grew by some 53%.\nLet's review the gross drivers in both revenue and profits.\nOn Slide 10, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter.\nVolume and mix contributed $77.1 million or 16.9 percentage points of growth, including approximately $32 million of volume driven by COVID-19-related net demand.\nSales price increases contributed $6.1 million or 1.3 percentage points of growth, and changes in the foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by $8.7 million or a reduction of 1.9 percentage points.\nLooking at margin performance.\nSlide 11 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 35.5% for Q3 2020, up from 32.4% in Q3 2019.\nProprietary products third-quarter gross profit margin of 40.8% was 260 basis points above the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2019.\nOur key drivers of the continued improvement in proprietary products gross profit margin were: favorable mix of products sold, driven by high-value products; production efficiencies; and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs.\nContract Manufacturing third-quarter gross profit margin of 17.9% was 350 basis points above the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2019.\nThis is a result of improved efficiencies and the plan utilization.\nNow let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash.\nOn Slide 12, we have listed some key cash flow metrics.\nOperating cash flow was $323.8 million for the year-to-date 2020, an increase of $63 million, compared to the same period last year, a 24.2% increase.\nOur year-to-date capital spending was also $116.7 million, $27.9 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance.\nWorking capital of $790.6 million at September 30, 2020 was $73.5 million higher than at December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in Accounts Receivable due to increased sales activity and inventory, mainly as a result of increasing safety stock.\nOur cash balance at September 30 of the $519.4 million was $80.3 million more than our December 2019 balance, primarily due to our positive operating results.\nOur capital and financial resources, including overall liquidity, remain strong.\nTurning to guidance, slide 13 provides a high-level summary.\nFull year 2020 net sales guidance will be in a range of between $2.1 billion and $2.11 billion.\nThis includes estimated net COVID incremental revenues of also approximately $85 million.\nThere is an estimated headwind of $4 million based on current foreign exchange rates.\nWe expect organic sales growth to be approximately 14% to 15%.\nThis compares to prior guidance of $2.035 billion to $2.055 billion and growth of approximately 12%.\nWe expect our full year 2020 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to be in a range of $4.50 to $4.55, compared to prior guidance of $4.15 to $4.25.\nAs Eric discussed, we are expanding our HVP manufacturing capacity at the existing sites to meet anticipated 2021 COVID-19 vaccine demand.\nCapex guidance remains at $170 million to $180 million.\nThere are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review this revised guidance.\nEstimated FX headwinds on earnings per share has had an impact of approximately $0.02 based on current foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe revised guidance also includes $0.18 earnings per share impact from tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\nSo just to summarize the key takeaways for the third quarter, strong top-line growth in both Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share and growth in operating and free cash flow.\nOur sales and earnings per share projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct or approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and earnings per share expansion.\nBefore I close, I'm pleased to share that last evening we received FDA clearance for West to market our 20 millimeter Vial2Bag advanced product.\nThe team is excited to bring this innovative product to the healthcare professionals.\nTo conclude, there are many challenges ahead of this, but we're resolute in our mission focus systems and most importantly, the team to address these challenges.\nWe see strengths in our core business and we're confident in our long-term growth strategy.\nOur market led strategies delivering unique value propositions to our customers.\nOur global operations network is able to flex and respond to the demand, while driving our market leading service and quality.\nAnd our investments in digital technology and automation will continue to keep us on the forefront of the industry.\nWe remain focused on delivering value to all our stakeholders on a very sustainable basis and doing our part to support the healthcare industry as it works to resolve this global pandemic.\nOn behalf of the team members at West, we continue to wish you well in the days ahead.\nGila, we're now ready to take questions.\nSummary: ",

    "input": "Please summarize the content of the context into bullet points and provide only the bullet point summary.\nContext:I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and our Vice Chairman, Chris O'Herlihy.\nSenior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen, is recovering from a sports-related injury and is not available to participate in today's call.\nDuring today's call, we will discuss ITW's second quarter financial results and update our guidance for the full year 2021.\nIn the second quarter, we saw continued recovery momentum across our portfolio, and we delivered strong operational execution and financial results.\nRevenue was up 43% with organic growth up 37%, and we saw double-digit growth in every segment and geography.\nEarnings per share of $2.45 was up 143%, 108% if you exclude the onetime tax benefit of $0.35 that we recorded in the quarter.\nIn this strong demand environment and in the face of very challenging supply conditions, our teams around the world leveraged our long-held close to the customer manufacturing and supply chain approach, and the benefits of staying fully staffed and invested through our winter recovery positioning, to continue providing world-class service levels to our customers while also continuing to execute on our long-term strategy to achieve and sustain ITW's full potential performance.\nWe're certainly encouraged by our organic growth momentum as order intake rates remained pretty much strong across the board.\nAnd during the second quarter, we saw multiple examples of how our ability to sustain our differentiated delivery capabilities by remaining fully invested through the pandemic resulted in incremental share gain opportunities for our businesses.\nWhile there's no doubt that the raw material supply environment is as challenging as we have experienced in a long time, maybe ever in my 38 years at ITW, we are as well positioned as we can be to continue to set ourselves apart through our ability to respond for our customers.\nWe've worked hard over the last nine years to position ITW to deliver differentiated performance in any environment, and I have no doubt that the ITW team will continue to execute at a high level as we move through the balance of the year and beyond.\nNow for some more detail on our performance in the second quarter.\nAs I mentioned, organic growth was 37% with strong performance across our seven segments.\nThe two segments that were hardest hit by the pandemic a year ago led the way this quarter, with Automotive OEM up 84% and Food Equipment up 46%.\nBy geography, North America was up 36% and international was up 38%, with Europe up 50% and Asia Pacific up 20%.\nGAAP earnings per share of $2.45 was up 143% and included a onetime tax benefit of $0.35 related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets in the U.K. due to a change in the statutory corporate tax rate there.\nExcluding this item, earnings per share of $2.10 grew 108%.\nIt was a Q2 record and was 10% higher than in Q2 of 2019.\nOperating income increased 99% and incremental margin was 40% at the enterprise level.\nOperating margin of 24.3% improved 680 basis points on strong volume leverage, along with 150 basis points of benefits from our enterprise initiatives.\nYear-to-date, our teams have delivered robust margin expansion, with incremental margins for our seven segments ranging from 37% to 48%, inclusive of price/cost impact.\nSpeaking of price/cost, price/cost headwind to margin percentage in the quarter was 120 basis points.\nWhile the pace of raw material cost increases accelerated in the second quarter, our businesses have been active in implementing pricing actions in response to rising raw material costs since early in the year, consistent with our strategy to cover raw material cost inflation with price adjustments on a dollar-for-dollar basis.\nIn Q2, we ended up just short of that goal due to some timing lags, and as a result, net price/cost impact reduced earnings per share by $0.01 in the quarter.\nWe continue to expect price/cost impact to be EPS-neutral or better for the year, and I'll come back and provide more color on the price/cost environment a little later in my remarks.\nIn the quarter, after-tax return on invested capital was a record at 30.8%.\nFree cash flow was $477 million, with a conversion of 72% of net income when adjusted for the onetime tax benefit I mentioned earlier.\nAnd that was due to the additional working capital investments necessary to support our strong organic growth.\nWe continue to expect approximately 100% conversion for the full year.\nWe repurchased $250 million of our shares this quarter as planned.\nAnd finally, our tax rate in the quarter was 10.1% due to the onetime tax benefit.\nExcluding this item, our Q2 tax rate was 23%.\nNow moving to Slide four for an update on price/cost.\nWe continue to experience raw material cost increases, particularly in categories such as steel, resins and chemicals and now project raw material cost inflation at around 7% for the full year, which is almost five percentage points higher than what we anticipated as the year began.\nAnd just for some perspective, this is roughly 2 times what we experienced in the 2018 inflation tariff cycle.\nWe learned a lot from that experience.\nAnd as a result, the timeliness and pace of our price recovery actions are well ahead of where we were in 2018.\nAs I mentioned, we expect price/cost impact to be EPS-neutral or better for the full year, with pricing actions more than offsetting cost increases on a dollar-for-dollar basis.\nPrice/cost will continue to have a negative impact on our operating margin percentage, however, in the near term, as we saw in Q2, and that impact will likely be modestly higher in Q3 versus Q2 before it starts to go the other way.\nFor the full year, we expect price/cost impact to be dilutive to margin by about 100 basis points, which is 50 basis points higher than where we were as of the end of Q1.\nThat being said, margin benefits from enterprise initiatives and volume leverage will provide us with ample ability to offset the negative effect of price/cost on margin percentage and deliver strong overall margin performance for the year.\nAnd beyond the near-term price/cost impact, we remain confident that we have meaningful additional structural margin improvement potential from the ongoing execution of our enterprise initiatives.\nStarting on Slide five, the table on the left provides some perspectives on the growth momentum in our businesses with a look at sequential revenue from Q1 to Q2.\nAs you would expect, the pace of recovery in our Auto OEM segment has been dampened by the well-publicized shortage of semiconductor chips despite very strong underlying demand.\nAnd for that reason, we added a row to the table to show portfolio demand trends ex Auto.\nOur Q2 revenue ex Auto increased 8% versus Q1.\nThis year, Q2 had one more shipping day than Q1, so on an equal days basis, our Q2 versus Q1 revenue growth ex Auto is 6%, which is 2 times of our normal Q2 versus Q1 seasonality of plus 3%.\nIn addition, we added more than $200 million of backlog in Q2.\nBoth of these factors show that demand accelerated meaningfully in Q2 across our portfolio.\nSo let's go to a little more detail for each segment, starting with Automotive OEM.\nDemand recovery versus prior year was most evident in this segment with 84% organic growth.\nThis, of course, was against easy comps versus a year ago when most of our customers in North America and Western Europe were shut down from mid-March to mid-May.\nNorth America was up 102%, Europe was up 106% and China up 20%.\nWe estimate that the shortage of semiconductor chips negatively impacted our sales by about $60 million in the quarter.\nOperating margin of 18.8% was up 26.6 percentage points on volume leverage and enterprise initiatives.\nPrice/cost with a significant headwind of more than 200 basis points due to the longer cycle time required to implement price recovery actions in this segment.\nGiven the ongoing semiconductor chip supply uncertainty, we now expect full year organic growth in Automotive to be approximately 10% versus our original range of 14% to 18% at the beginning of the year.\nTo be clear, this is not lost revenue but simply delayed into next year.\nFurthermore, the slower-than-expected growth in Auto is offset by strength elsewhere in the enterprise.\nIn Food Equipment, organic revenue rebounded 46%, with recovery taking hold across the board and the backlog that is up significantly versus prior year.\nNorth America was up 39% with equipment up 42% and service up 33%.\nInstitutional revenue was up more than 30%, with healthcare and education growth in the low to mid-30s and lodging up in the mid-20s.\nRestaurants were up about 60% with the largest year-over-year increases in full service and QSR.\nRetail grew in the mid-teens on continued solid demand and new product rollouts.\nInternational recovery was also robust at 58%, with Europe up 66% and Asia Pacific up 29%.\nEquipment sales were strong, up 66% with service growth of 39%, which continued to be impacted by extended lockdowns in Europe.\nOperating margin was 22% with an incremental of 46%.\nTest & Measurement and Electronics revenue of $606 million was a Q2 record with organic growth of 29%.\nTest & Measurement was up 20%, driven by solid recovery in customer capex spend and continued strength in semicon.\nElectronics grew 38%, continued strength in consumer electronics and automotive applications and the added benefit in timing of some large equipment orders in electronic assembly.\nOperating margin of 28.1% was 240 basis points -- was up 240 basis points and a Q2 record.\nMoving to Slide seven.\nWelding growth was also strong in Q2 at 33%.\nEquipment revenue was up 38% and consumables growth of 25% was the first time in positive territory since 2019.\nOur industrial business grew 52% on increased capex spending by our customers, and the commercial business remains solid, up 26%, following 17% growth in the first quarter.\nNorth America was up 38% and international growth was 13%, primarily driven by recovery in oil and gas.\nPolymers & Fluids organic growth was 28%, led by our automotive aftermarket business up 33% on robust retail sales.\nPolymers was up 34% with continued momentum in MRO applications and heavy industries.\nFluids was up 8% with North America growth in the mid-teens and European sales up low single digits.\nOperating margin was an all-time record 27.3% with strong volume leverage and enterprise initiatives partly offset by price/cost.\nMoving to Slide eight.\nConstruction organic growth of 28% reflected double-digit growth and recovery in all three regions.\nNorth America was up 20%, with 16% growth in residential renovation and with 26% growth in commercial construction.\nEurope grew 61% with strong recovery versus easy comps in the U.K. and Continental Europe.\nAustralia and New Zealand organic growth was 13%, with continued strength in residential and commercial.\nOperating margin in the segment of 27.6% was up 390 basis points and was a Q2 record.\nSpecialty organic revenue was up 17% with North America up 15%, Europe up 24% and Asia Pacific up 14%.\nOur flexible packaging business was up mid-single digits against a tougher comp than the rest of this segment.\nThe majority of our businesses were up double digits, led by appliance up more than 50%.\nConsumable sales were up 19% and equipment sales up 12%.\nLet's move on to Slide nine for an update on our full year 2021 guidance.\nWe now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $14.3 billion to $14.6 billion, up 15% at the midpoint versus last year, with organic growth in the range of 11% to 13% and foreign currency translation impact of plus 3%.\nThis is an increase in organic growth of one percentage point at the midpoint versus the updated guidance that we provided at the end of Q1, driven largely by the incremental revenue impact of pricing actions implemented in Q2 in response to accelerating raw material cost increases.\nWe are raising our GAAP earnings per share guidance by $0.35 to a range of $8.55 to $8.95 to incorporate the onetime tax benefit realized in the second quarter.\nThe midpoint of $8.75 represents earnings growth of 32% versus last year and 13% over 2019.\nFactoring out the onetime Q2 tax item, the midpoint of our 2021 guidance is 10% higher than 2019.\nWith regard to margin percentage, as discussed earlier, the incremental cost increases that we saw in Q2 will result in full year margin dilution of 100 basis points versus the 50 basis points that we projected as of the end of Q1.\nAnd we are adjusting our margin percentage guidance accordingly to a range of 24.5% to 25.5%, which would still be an improvement of more than 200 basis points year-over-year and an all-time record for the company.\nAnd again, we expect zero earnings per share impact from price/cost for the full year.\nWe expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 100% of net income, factoring out the impact of the onetime noncash tax benefit we recorded in Q2.\nThrough the first half, we have repurchased $500 million of our shares and expect to repurchase an additional $500 million in the second half.\nFinally, we expect our tax rate in the second half to be in our usual range of 23% to 24% and for a full year tax rate of around 20%.\nLastly, today's guidance excludes any impact from the previously announced acquisition of the MTS Test & Simulation business, which we expect to close later this year.\nAnd once that acquisition closes, we'll provide you with an update.\nSummary: ",
